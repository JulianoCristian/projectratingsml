1.1   BACKGROUND
      The    rural           water supply and sanitation are                          important     factors     that
      could improve the quality of life of the people living in                                          vi! !ages.
      Though it cannot be said that this subject is neglected in India,                                            it
      is   a. fa.ct tha.t evan a.fter 43 years of independence, people                                     in   man·r
      villages do not have access to drinking water, more so in the summer.
       In Maharashtta, even in high rainfall areas, many vii lagas experience
      acute        water       scarcity.          The decade of 1981-90 was                     declared    as   the
       International            Drinking          Water         Supply and Sanitaion              Decade     by   the
      United Nations General Assembly. The National Drinking Water                                          Mission
      was launched in India in 1966 to give a sense of urgency to the                                           task
      of covering all the problem villages by 1990. As per the reports                                           the
      mission has made impressive progress in its work with the help of its
      five     sub-missions              appointed, respectively for                        li)   Controlling      of

      In   addition,    55   Mini Missions were set up     to   provide    sufficient
      attention    to   the most difficult parts of the country; two         of    them
      were   in   Latur and Satara districts of Maharashtra. This          shows    the
      recent    interest in the subject of rural water supply at the           Central
      Government    level.    These   efforts will have to     be   strengthened     by
      making    additional    resources   available and    by   eliciting     people's
      participation.       While,    for  drinking   water    supply,    there      are
      considerable      efforts    being  made,   rural   sanitation      is     mostly
      neglected. The disposal of domestic wasta, cattle waste, waste              water
      and   also   of   human    excreta is allowed to    take    place   in   a   most
      undesirable     manner   in   most  of  the   villages    in   India.      Though
      personalities like Mahatma Gandhi have devoted considerable             time and
      energy    in teaching and demonstrating hygienic ways of doing           things,
      we   have not made much progress in five decades. There is a need             for
      massive    intervention in improving the rural sanitation and          drinking
      wa.ter supply.

      The interest shown by the World Bank in the project in Maharashtra is
      therefore    a     welcome  step. The World Bank has   placed   emphasis    on
      financial    performance and steady institutional evolution and on         the
      need .for universal access to minimal services in lending* activities
      in support of water supply and waste disposal development . The           four
      important aspects of attention listed by the Bank are li) Institution

      phasing   of     improvements,    the charging of  consumers   of  different
      income  groups, etc.       and livl Selection of programmers    with   proper

      balance among the three essential complementary services,         viz.,watar
      supply, waste disposal and hygiene education.

      Since water and excreta are prominent factors in the transmission of
      the  more  serious diseases of the develop{~g world, a   programme of
      safe drinking water,    construction of latrines and rural   sanitation
      has  been   taken up by the Government of Mahara~htra with  the World
      Bank assistance.

      The  project envisages       the  improvement in  the water     supply and
      sanitation   facilities of the beneficiaries and thereby reduction         in
      the  incidence     of    diseases due to impure water    supply   and   poor
      sanitation.    It  is    also desired   that  the   general   awareness   of
      sanitation    and    the   people's   participation   in  expanding     such
      awareness   wil I increase in future, both because of these facilities
      as  well as the communication efforts that are being        planned,  Since
      implementation    of   all these schemes involves sizeable capital       and
      maintenance costs, it is expected that this cost should be equitably
      borne by the beneficiaries to the maximum possible extent.

      The Government of Maharashtra, therefore, desired to undertake socio-
      economic studies of the beneficiaries in order to collect           benchmark
      information,    which could      be used in comparing with      the   results
      obtained   in   subsequent years;       to collect  benchmark     information
      concerning the willingness and capacity to pay for the improved water
      supply   and sanitation facilities and to provide guidelines         for  the
      implementation    of  the    programme.   The socio-economic study        was
      conducted   on behalf     of    the Government of     Maharashtra    by   the
      Progressive Research      Aids    Pvt. Ltd. Puna, for   the   ten districts
      selected   for   the  programme.     Before we   go  into   the  objectives,
      methodology    ate. of the study, we will present salient       fe~tures   of
      the St~ta of Maharashtra.

1.2   THE STATE OF MAHARAHSTRA

      The   state of Mah~rashtra was founded in the year 1960 by    separ~ting
      the   bilingual S~ate of Bombay into Gujarat and Maharashtra. The     two
      regions    of  Vidharbha and Marathwada which are   presently   part   of
      Maharashtra belonged respectively to M~dhya Pr~dash and the Hyderabad
      State,   prior to 1956. One, therefore,finds a  distinct   heterogenity
      among   Vidarbha,  Marathawada and the rest of    the  regions   of  the
      Maharashtra state.

      The area of the state is 308 thousand sq.km. and is the third largest
      in  the country. It has a population of 62.8 mil I ion parsons     as   per
      the 1981 census and is the third l~rgest state in      the country on the
      basis   of population. Its per c~pita income was     the highest   in   the
      country   earlier, but its current rank is   third in the country with
      Punjab and    Haryana states baing above it.     The   literacy   rate of
      Maharashtra   is 47.2 per cent and is higher than that of the      ~ountry
      as  a whole which is   36.2 par cant. The state ranks high on many       of
      the   indicators    of  socio-economic  develcipmant    mainly    due    to
      substantial   growth of industry and trade in and around the City        of
      Bombay.   The  state has a tradition of stable government.      The state
      government is generally known as comparatively more efficient.


                                        2
Owing to historical reasons, much of the industrial development ha.s
occured in the Bombay-Poona region although in recent years its
influence has extended to certain isolated areas like         Nasik,
Aurangabad, Kolhapur, Solapur and Nagpur. Bombay, Pune and Nagpur
cities are the three large cities with populations of over 10 lakh
persons. There are 11 Municipal Corporations in the state.
The rural population of the state is 65 per cent of the total
population. This percentage turns out to be 75 per cent when Bombay
is excluded. Rural Maharashtra is still predominantly agriculture
based.   There are considerable differences in the cropping pattern
between the regions, reflecting differences in the soil, climate,
rainfall, etc. The Konkan with its heavy rainfall and hilly terrain,
is a producer of rice, ragi (a small millet) and fodder crop~, which
account for more than 80 per cent of the total cropped area of the
region. The humid climate and the well drained soils have also made
the region a natural home for such horticultural crops as mango,
cashewnut and coconut. The       'Alphonso' mango of this region is
popular,   the world over. Large parts of Western Mahar.ashtra fall in
the rain-shadow region with jowar, bajra, pulses and groundnut as
major crops. The development of irrigation has contributed to
widespread large scale cultivation of sugarcane in this region.     The
establishment of co-operative sugar factories and their spectacular
success in this region has led to increase in           acreage under
sugarcane cultivation. The sugar factories have now expanded their
activities beyond the production of sugar and byproducts; and have
taken to education, health and other social development activities in
their vicinity. The socio-economic scene in the sugar belt has
changed considerably. Seeing this, the demand for establishing sugar
factories is coming up from the other regions in a big way though the
factories already started in these regions are yet to run on sound
footing. The Marathawada region mainly bears features of agriculture
as practised in a dry climate with jowar, bajra, pulses, cotton and
oilseeds as major crops. By contrast, the pattern obtaining in
Vidarbha is highly diversified, since the region has relatively high
rainfall in its eastern districts and dry climate with moderate
rainfall in the western area. As a result, the region grows in
abundance, the wet crops such as rice in the east and rainfed crops
like    jowar, cotton and pulses in the west. Though the western part.
of Vidharbha produces cotton on a large scale, the textile mills are
not located in the region in a large number. The Vidharbha region is
also endowed with good forest resources.Chandrapur and Gadchiroli
districts and parts of Bhandara have major forest areas. Western
ghats, where rainfall is heavy and some parts of Nasik, Sindhudurg
and Thane also have forests.

The road passenger transport system is nationalised and the State
Road Transport Corporation has done commendable work in the State.
Almost all the villages are accessible by bus although difficulties
are faced in reaching some villages in the rainy season. All the
villages in the state are electrified.

Primary Credit Societies are in existence in every village     in the
state. Co-operative movement is much better developed in the   Western
Maharashtra, including; milk co-operatives.




                               3
Similarly, multipurpose co-operative societies are existance in all
the regions.  The Panchayati Raj system is also adopted     in  the
state.   As a result, in every village, either a milk co-operative
society or a multipurpose co-operative society exists.

Although Maharashtra state is better placed compared to many other
states, rural poverty is to the extent of 40 per cent. There is
substantial    unemployment   in  certain   pockets    and    hidden
underemployment exists everywhere.   Village life,    socio-economic
conditions, housing patterns and rural culture are different in
different parts of the state.

Scheduled tribes constitute 9.19 per cent of the population of the
state. This is mainly concentrated in the district of Dhule, Naaik,
Thane, Chandrapur, Amaravati, Gadchiroli and Nanded. If one goes by
talukas, there are in all 14 talukas where the tribal population is
more than 50 per cent of the taluka's total population.   Of these,
four are in Dhule, three in Nasik, five in Thane and one each in
Amaravati and Chandrapur districts.
Let us look at the village settlements in these regions.      In the
Western Ghat districts,the villages are generally situated on high
elevated ground alongside a stream, river or some other water source.
Within the village site there is usually a temple and/or a 'chavadi'
which   serves as a centre for village meetings, where all social
business is transacted. Surrounding the 'chavadi' stand the village
houses, the scheduled castes usually having their houses on the
outskirts of the village. Where the village site is not sufficiently
large   to   hold the growing population, there       arise   hamlets
(wadis/wastis) to which a section of the population shifts. The
hamlets however, continue to be administered as part of the main
village and are attached to the main village for social, religious
and other matters. A hamlet is generally a cluster of hutments/houses
belonging to one or more families whose fields lie in the immediate
neighbourhood.
In the Konkan, the village type differs from the earlier type. Here,
there are no well defined village sites or 'chavadis' and the
villagers stay in clusters near their fields,     generally on high
elevated lands. In the case of garden lands, they have their houses
on the land itself. Near the sea-coast, the villages are generally
settled on both sides of the road and the houses stand in their own
compound with their fruit and coconut gardens, fenced on all sides.

In the Vidarbha region, the population of the village is concentrated
in one common residential site known as 'Gaothan'.    In Marathawada
districts the villages are often situated on unculturable stony land
near a nalla and they are walled. Walled villages are also found in
parts of Kolhapur and Jalgaon and some other districts of Western
Maharashtra.  In the coastal districts, none of the villages are
walled.

1.3   THE WATER AND SANITATION PROGRAMME

      The Goverement   of Maharashtra has formulated a  scheme  to  improve
      water supply and sanitation facilities including construction of two-
      pit latrines and implement  the same with the World Bank assistance.
      The scheme covers the following ten districts.

      1. Thana           2. Ahmedna.gar          3.   Puna               4. Satara 5. Sangli
      6. Bu I dha.na     7. Cha.ndrapur          8,   Aurangaba.d        9. Baed   10. Latur

      These districts are henceforth referred to as project districts.

      There are three schemes of water supply, namely, piped water     supply,
      borewell  and hydrofracturing     of old borewells.   For  piped water
      supply,  the vi lla.ge ~dong with its hamlets if any, is  covered.   The
      borewe\1  programme covers 148 villages along with their hamlets,     if
      any  and in addition, covers 621 hamlets. The number of    vii !ages or
      hamlets covered and beneficiaries of the schemes are shown in      Table
      1.1.

      Coverage of the Study

      The Socio-Economic Study conducted covers the villages                          and  hamlets
      under       the    piped water supply scheme and borewell scheme                  only.     The
      villages        under   hydrofracturing were kept out of the scope                   of     the

1.5   METHODOLOGY

      In conducting the study,         following considerations were kept in view

      a)        The socio-economic part of the study would high! ight the    aspects
                associated    with   water-supply, sanitation and  health.   It  was
                decided   to avoid the general purpose questions, <like    names  of
                family members and their details, agricultural practices followed
                by  the  households, etc. I as also those which had no direct     or
                indirect   relationship with the aspects under study, It kept    the
                questionnaire    tidy and  also enabled the investigator to   probe,
                in more details, into the aspects under study without causing the
                interviewer and respondent fatigue.

      bl        The  provision of protected water supply does not stop with     the
                supply    of pure water at common taps or at wei Is. Many  research
                findings   indicate that water can and does get    contaminated  in
                the   processs of transport, storage and handling. These   aspects,
                therefore, were also listed to be probed into, for    understanding
                the   importance of this problem and for   suggesting appropriate
                policy measures.

      cl        At   present,   the   problem of water    supply   is  viewed  by  the
                villagers    only   from the point of view of its adequacy    and   the
                distance   of the house from the source. Its      health  implications
                are not always clear to them. It is possible that the willingness
                to   pay  for   protected water    supply   might   improve,  if   the
                respondents    are   made   aware of  these   implications.   It was,
                therefore,    decided to ask questions concerning willingness     both
                before and after informing them of the health implications.

      dl        The above aspect is also important in probing into the demand for
                latrines and the willingness of the respondents to pay for     them.
                It is, however, slightly more difficult tha.n in the ca.se of water
                supply.  While  the •drinking  wa.ter suppty• is a felt   need   and


                                             6
     therefore,    its demand could be regarded as       equivalent   to   its
     requirement,     the   need   for latrines is yet to be   felt   by   all
     classes   of   people. At one     end of the spectrum   therefore,    one
     might   gat households which may      flatly deny any need of latrines
     while,   at the oth~r     and, there would be households who may       be
     willing    to pay    for a privata latrine which has    all the    modern
     facilities     like    flushing.   ln  this  respect    the    following
     hypotheses,    which    are frequently put forward, were    set    to  be
     tested

         il     Women perceive the 'need'      of the latrines more than man.

       iil      Women   might   be able  to   influence         the   decision        of
                conitructing/using the latrine.

      i i i )   Private latrines are preferable to pub! ic latrines.

       i v )    Maintena..nca    of   public   latrines   is   mora   or     lass    not
                possible.

         v)     Evan  if  latrines are constructed,        children    may     not    be
                encouraged to use them.

       vi)      Latrines,   baing  traditionally looked 1..1pon        a.s  uncI ea.n,
                necessarily     have  to   be away  from   the           residential
                premises.

      viii      Persons who have shifted themselves from cities/towns   to
                villages   <like those employed in banks, offices etc.) or
                those who are more educated feel the need of the latrines
                more than others.

     viii)      Households       having  bio-gas plants are likely to be   more
                receptive       to the construction  of latrines than others.

       ixl      If the respondent is made aware of implied health benefits
                of   two-pit    la.trines,   their  easy   construction    and
                maintenance, the absence     of any obnoxious smells, the low
                costs of construction and maintenance and the      requirement
                of  vary  small   space, many of    the  presently   unwilling
                respondents  might    change   their opinion  in    favour   of
                private/shared latrines and might even be willing to share
                their costs.

         x)     Village level characteristics such as population, nearness
                to urban centre,naarness to highway,atc.might have bearing
                on  the  level  of awareness and tha demand   as  well  as
                willingness to pay for various facilities.

e)   The above   considerations suggested that the demand     for  water
     supply and latrines was influenced by the attitudes of people and
     in turn it could be  altered, through knowledge.Moreover, i t wa.s
     evolutionary;   changing   with    learning,   demonstration    and
     experience. In understanding the present demand, it we~.s therefore
     felt necessary to eKamine the following factors :


                                        7
               How much was it influenced       by lack of knowledge 7
               How much could it increase by improving knowledge ?
               How much       could it be influenced by  various factors  l ike
               education, urba.n influence, environment (ra.infa.ll ),
               a.vai la.bi 1 ity of water, bio-gas plants, etc. ?
               How much was it influenced by past experiences 7
               What roles have the Government Agencies/Voluntary Agencies
               played in setting the present attitudes/demand patterns 7
               To    what extent would the supply of latrines improve    public
               hea.l th 7

fl      The   willingness and ability to pay is, therefore not     considered
        as the function of only economic factors. These were also seen to
        be   influenced   by social and psychological    considerations,   as
        also   by   the  level  of  knowledge.  The   construction   of   the
        questionnaire,    its  administration   and   later  its    analysis,
        therefore    required a lot of planning as also careful    field-work
        and its supervision.

The examination of all these aspects needed a methodology which would
use   various   sources and ways of  collecting    information. Thus,   for
example,   the   information  concerning  practices    followed   by   the
respondents in the case of hygiene can best be collected by observing
the respondents' actual behaviour than, by putting to them       questions
like • Do you wash your hands before taking meals ?w. Similarly,        the
differences in attitudes of men and women cannot always be       explained
by   the  respondents   themselves. They would   be   best   explained   by
persons I ike' social workers, teachers, etc. !Je, therefore, collected
information from various sources and then tried to correlate it.        The
various sources that we attempted were

       il    Secondary Sources   (I ike available records,   publications,    etc.)

     i i )   Primary   sources    (viz.   households),   with    a.   pre-tested
             qtJestionnaire.

 i i i )     Village-level  observations  by the  investigators, who          were
             required to submit their reports in a prescribed format.

     ivl     Village-level observations by a special team of   investigators
             called  •  Participant   -Observers    tPOl", who  provided  an
             intensive  and often   graphic picture of the  present  status,
             factors influencing the behaviour and attitudes and scope   for
             improvements in future.

      v)     Information  provided  by voluntary agencies  working       in     the
             project districts and in the other districts.
     vi I    Information provided by the Gram Pa.nchayat.

          Tapping   all   these   sources was a unique   exercise.   Some   of   these
          sources   (like laboratory analysis of drinking water) were       not   even
          included in the original terms of reference. However, when a! I        these
          sources   were tapped, a fund of information,both of     qualitative     ~nd
          quantita.tive   na.ture, sta.rted flowing in. The response   from    village
          panchayats    and voluntary agencies was particularly very      encouraging
          and provided much needed"optimism while drafting the recommendations.

          These sources are described           in detail   below   :

1. 5. 1    Information Collected from Secondary Sources

          Statistical  information  concerning  water  supply  and   sanitation
          facilities, population, households,occuptaion,cropping pattern number
          of wells,etc, was collected from the recrods of

                It was decided to cover   about 90 projl3ct villages in thl3 sampl13.
                Thl3  number 90 was set both on consideration of general    adequacy
                and  costs. As stated earlier there are certain hamlets     selected
                for the programme, specialy for providing borewells. Taking      into
                consideration   the average number of estimated beneficiaries     per
                hamlet, it was decided to take three hamlets as equivalent to one
                village for sampling coverage purpose.

                Since piped water supply and borewel l schemes of water supply are
                planned   for different villages     exclusively, the villages    under
                these two schemes were treated separately. For each district          the
                project   villages     were grouped into these two   categories.    From
                each   of these lists, a random sample of about 9 per cent of         the
                vil !ages  was taken subject to the minimum of 6 villages in        each
                district. While drawing the sample of villages, 2 extra        villages
                were sampled,      to   be used as substitutes  in   case  of   extreme
                difficulties.    The    entire  work of  sampling   of  villages     was
                carried   out   at    Pune and lists of the  selected   villages   were
                handed over    to field staff in each district. Table 1.2 gives the
                number of villages and      hamlets covered in the sample.

   b)   Sa.mpl ing g_f_ Households

        In each sample village,complete listing of households was carried
        out  and   the households  were  classified  into  the  following
        categories.

             i I   Farmers with irrigated cultivation
           i i )   Farmers with only dry cultivation
        i i i )    La.nd less La.bour
          i v)     Business, salaried class, artisans and others.

        A sample of                             in a vii !age was drawn by
                            10 per cent households                             the
        systematic random sampling method with a provision that the total
        number of sample households in any vii !age will not be less          then
        20 and    not   more   than 70.    Since   number   of   families    under
        category <ivl above is likely to be smal 1, minimum one family          in
        this   category    was  stipulated   to be   covered    in   each  sample
        vii lage,  disregarding     the 10 per cent criterion. Thus,      it   was
        ensured   that   a   cross section of    the  village    population    was
        covered in the sample. With random selection of vii !ages and with
        this   procedure    of sampling of   households,    the    representative
        character was achieved      to the maximum possible extent.

        Since it was planned to obtain certain estimates, mostly in terms
        of   percen~ages     <like the          proportion of          population desirous           of
        having    latrines,       percentage of these people                    willing      to    pay,
        etc. I   it was necessary to have an adequate number of                            households
        in   the sam p l e at t h F.l d i s t r i c t 1 e v e l. F or t h i s , a. s i z e  of  a. bout
        180 households was considered adequate, to ensure a maximum of 10
        per    cent    error    with 99 per cent confidence                     at     the district
        I eve!.

        The  sampling     plan   adopted    gave   us   the adequate number  of
        households.      Table 1.3 gives the district and schemewise     number
        of villages/hamlets and households covered in the sample.

d)     Interviewing

       Generally,     a. tea.m of two investiga.tors, one ma.le and one   f;:nna.le
       investigator visited the sample villages. In some cases this            was
       not   possible     and   both  the members of   the   team  were   males.
       Generally the male investigator interviewed the male         respondents
       and the female interviewed the female respondents. The respondent
       was   not necessarily head of the household. He/she was        an    adult
       member between the a.ge group 20 and 60. Interviews were conducted
       at   the    house of the sample household. The      interviewers   mostly
       sta.yed   in the sample vi lla.ge, for the purpose of the s•.u".,r8y,    in
       some    ra.re cases, they stayed in the nea.rby village,     that    being
       more convenient.

       There ware unaided and aided questions in the questionnaire.     The
       unaided  questions   were   first  asked  to  them  and  then    the
       respondents  were informed of the importance of latrines,     health
       hazards  of defecation in open, consequences of    poor  sanitation
       and  unsafe  water, personal hygiene etc. For t.his   purpose,   the
       material   published by t.he UNlCEF was used. The  aided  questions
       were asked after this.

f)   Participant Observation

     It   is   the    general  exp8rience, that mere    filling     in    of  the
     household     questionnaires    is not sufficient,    and    the   research
     worker   should visit th8 villages and ggt a first hand           feel    of
     the   situa.tion. This is helpful in developing a.      proper      insight.
     However    this cannot be done in the case of large scale          surveys.
     To   overcome     this,  we adopted the   methodology     of   participant
     observation. The participant observer stayed in gach village             for
     4-7   days.    He made detailed observations regarding        the    present
     practices     in   the village and had   discu~sions    with     villagers,
     vii !age leaders     and   prominent persons. He prepared vii lage maps
     and   also filled in 4-5 household questionnaires. At the end,            he
     prepared a. vi II age report.

     The participant observer covered               the following aspects

            i )       Drinking water resources
         i i )        Water for other purpose
       i i i )        Latrines
        vi)           Hygiene at public places
         v )          Maintenance of public places
        vi)           Public institutions
      vi i )          Development works

        X i     )     Personal hygiene
      Xi i     )      Cleanliness

     We   planned to prepare such reports for 50 sample  vi! !ages,                but
     actually    obtained  participa.nt observers';  reports    for                 90
     villages.

gl   Case Studies 9.f.Two Villages

     Two   villages    where the water supply and    sanitation   facilities
     were   provided     adequately,   and   where  they  were   functioning
     satisfactorily     and the people were paying the fees more or      less
     regularly    were    identified. These two villages were    studied   in
     detail   and   the two case studies are presented     separately.    The
     focus   of   the   case studies is on identifying    the   factors   and
     forces leading to successful      functioning.

hl   Role           £f.   Voluntary Agencies

     In  order to obtain information on the present activities of   the
     voluntary agencies, a I ist of voluntary agencies was prepared and
     letters were sent to about 200 agen~ies,   both operating in   the
     project  area and outside, giving them the   informtion  regarding


                                               12
      the   rural water supply and sanitation project and seeking       their
      opinion   regarding  the  role they can play     in  this   effort.   A
      proforma was also enclosed in order to get information       regarding
      the agency, such as area of their operations, number of voluntary
      workers, the infra.structura.l faci I ities, method of their   wok ing,
      etc.   About 50 agencies   responded. These responses were     studied
      and discussions were h~ld with some agencies before       forrmulating
      the ideas regarding role of voluntary agencies in this programme.

il    Correspondance with Gra.mpa.nchayats

      Letters were sent to about 1400 grampanchayats covered under        the
      programme, giving them information regarding      the programme,    and
      seeking    their opinion in this regard. The proforma was      enclosed
      with   the   letter, covering points such as     general   information
      regarding    the  village, present condition of    water   supply   and
      sanitation,    earlier  efforts  in   the  village,   experiences    of
      people's    participation, possibilities of people's     participation
      in   this   programme,  names of individuals    interested    in  these
      activities, etc. About 250 grampanchayats replied to the letters.
      They also helped us in formulating our recommendations.

j I   Testing Q.f. Wa.ter Sa.mple

      We    decided to collect samples of water and get them tested       for
      impurities. We      col !acted about 400 samples and got them analysed
      in  the district public health laboratories. These are        presented
      in   the    report. For this purpose, the field    investigators   were
      given    training and they were required to use sterilised      bottles
      to  collect     the   water samples, which were to be   taken   to   the
      laboratories within a stipulated time period of time.

      During   the course of visits to the voluntary agencies, and     some
      of   the  villages,   we came to know about the  writings   of   many
      saints   on the subject of village sanitation,   personal   hygiene,
      defecation     practices  and  suggestions  for   improvement.     We
      therfore   undertook the work of collection of this    material   and
      visited   various   libraries in Puna and the   Asiatic  library    in
      Bombay.   The   material collected included Gram Gaeta   of  Tukdoji
      Maharaj, writings of Gadge Maharaj and Eknath Maharaj, Gaon Geeta

1.7   OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS

      al        Household groups

                The households were grouped          into four   groups as follows       ;

                    il    Advanced           communities (including   minorities     like    Jains,
                          Christians, Muslims etc. I
                   iii    Other Backward castes <OBCI
                i i i )   Scheduled castes and Nava Buddhas
                  vi )    S c he d 1.1 l e d t r i be s

            We followed the official             procedure while making these groups.

      bl        Educational      status

            We  took into account the highest level of education attained    by
            the   member:; of the ho1n;ehold and divided the households on that
            basis. Thus the groups were


                                                    15
     Households having at                        least one member who    is

              i )        a graduate
          ii)            having some college education
     i i i )             educated upto lOth standard
          i   II )       educated upto 4th standard
              II )       able to read and write

     The sixth group                        consisted of     those households with all      illitrate
     members.

     The    grouping shows                     the educational level of the households in  a
     better fashion and,                       therefore, is, it is hoped, more amenable for
     ana.! ys is,

c)   House types

     The condition of residential houses could b8 understood from  the
     material used for roofs and walls.  We collected  information  on
     these.

     l)              The materials           needed for walls were of     three major    types

                         i )    Wooden    sticks    with    mud    plastering       <Kudl,
                                mud/earth/clay, tins and similar other material ( Kutcha.

                     i i i )    Bricks and cement, stones and cement {pucca wal l l

     I I )            The materials used for             roofs were of five types

                         i )    GI:ass, 1ea.ves and similar products.
                      ii)       Tins, cement sheets
                     i i i )    T i I es
                       i II )   Earthen slab with wooden support from below             ( Dha.ba. J
                         II )   RCC Sla.b

     On  the  basis of these two types of data,                           we                to    group
     houses in to four types as follows

     Type A                     ~Better•      houses,   having   the use of cement   in roofs or
                                wa I 1 s,

     Type B                     •Good"      houses,   with   semi-permenant walls and roofs

     Type C                     •fair•      houses,   with pucca wal Is and    tin/cement        sheet
                                roofs




                                                        16

     The  aggregate of these incomes of all members of                                    the       household,
     gives the cash income of the household.

     This is, of course, not a.n adequa.te mea.sure of 'income' le·.,r8l          of
     the household. It excludes the value of goods consumed within the
     househo 1 d     a.nd   thereby,  unde rest ima. tes   the   i naoma   of    the
     agriculturist        families.     The  cash      income   data   may   not   be
     comparable      with other data on total household          income.   Howe~er,
     the  use     of    cash income has been made in a         limited   manner    to
     support     households     capacity to pay for various         services   (like
     water and latrines) and purchase of assets, soaps etc.

e)   Water consumption

     As      far as water comsumption is concerned, it is quite                                     difficult
      to      estimate the actual water consumption in rural                                  areas,        since
     water           is consumed a.t various places {hou.se, wells, ta.ps,                               rivers
     etc.)           for different purposes. Generally, the clothes are                                  washed
     a.t riversides or we1ls, utensils a.re clea.ned both a.t the well                                          a.s
     wei l       as        in the house, and bathing is done                       depending         upon     the
     availability of water apd shelter, anywhere i.e. home/river/well.
     The estimates of water consumption, therefore, are the                                         estimates
     of      the          respondents. These are naturally affected by                            the     usual
     bias,              lack      of     proper          understanding,        and      difficulties            in
     estimating.                It is however hoped that, used aggregatively,                              these
     biases             would       be cancelled out and the general                      trend     would       be
     visible.              It should at the same time, be noted that                           the     figures
     thus emerging would only represent the monsoon period and (a very

     wells dry out and water becomes scarce.

i.S   PRESENTATION OF FINDINGS

      The findings of    the study are presenl8d in two parts as follows

      Part              M01.in Report

      Part     I\       lmporta.nt  Annexure    such as      Villa.ge   ma.ps, house
                        sketches   and  typica I vi l! age   studies    in different
                        districts.

             The main report is divided into 8ight chapters. After the present
             chapter of Introduction, the socio-economic profile of the sample
             vi lla.ges   and  households  is gh,en in chapter  I I. Cha.pter  Ill
             presents findings regarding personal and community hygiene in the
             sample     villages.  Present conditions, practices and demand    for
             drinking     water and latrines are dealt with in Chapters IV and V
             respectively. Chapter VI presents the role of Voluntary Agencies,
             Chapter VII consolidates the findings, and Chapter VIII      presents
             the Strategy for Implementation. These Chapters are followed       by
             the anneXltres.

2.1   SAMPLE VILLAGES

      As stated in Chapter I, water will be supplied through pipes              in 607
      '>~il!ages.         These village will be called    Piped Wa.ter villages     PW
      villages).           New borewells will be constructed and water will be made
      ~v a. i I a. b l e from these wei Is through hand pumps in 148 villages and 621
      hamlets.

       the borewel 1 scheme <Table 2. 1). The BW vi! !ages are smaller than the
      PW    vii !ages. The villages and hamlets under the borewell scheme are
       together        called borewell villages <BW villages), for convenience                                  in
      this     chapter.          The   two schemes are likely                  to be        implemented by
      different agencies, therefore, we have presented separate anafysis
      for the PW villages and BW villages. The profile of the households in
      P!J a.nd BW vi 1 I a.ges is presented in Annexure 2. 1.

       In   the total of 117 sample villages, 2711 households were contacted
       by   the personal interview method. On an average, 31   households per
      'Jillagl3 werl3 contacted in PW villages, 27 in    villa.ges  under the
       borewel l scheme and 11 in hamlets under the borewel l scheme.

2.2   VILLAGE POPULATION SIZE

      The  population size is an important characteristic of           a   village.
      Socio-economic    profiles    of   smal I and big   villages  are generally
      different. Bigger villages are likely to have better         infrastructural
      facilities such as roads, schools, bus services, health centres, etc.
      The  non-farm occupations may exist in larger proportion           in bigger
      villages,   income level may be better a.nd so on. The small         villa.ges
      and  hamlets   may  have lowers level       of  socio-economic conditions.
      Therefore, we present below the distribution of our samples according
      to population size class of the villages in Table 2.2. It can be seen
      in Table 2.2 that 70 per cent of the BW villages have a population of
      upto 500     persons while only 12 per cent of PW villages         belong   to
      this  population group. The average population of PW sample          vii !ages
      was 2041, tha.t of BW vi ll;;~.ges was 489.

2.3   LOCATION OF SAMPLE VILLAGES

      The   sample villages were generally well   distributed   geographically
      over    the district. There was considerable variation in the   distance
      of   villages from the nearest highway or town. Average distance     from
      the nearest town for a vii \age was 17 Kms in PW village group and      27
      Kms in BW villages. However, the BW villages were found to be     nearer
      the   National/State   highways. The distribution  of   sample  vii lages
      according to distance from the nearest town and from the national       or
      state highway, are presented in Tables 2.3 and 2.4 respectively.

2.4   EXISTING SOURCES OF WATER IH SAMPLE VlLLAGES

      The main existing sources of water can be classified into four groups
      t i i na.tura.l sources which include ri'..rer, strea.m etr::. {iii well   {iii!
      bore     wei I supply and <ivl piped water supply.The sample vii !ages are
      classified according to the existing in source of water. [Table 2.51.
      Of the 57 vii !ages which are under the scheme of piped water            supply,
      32 solely depend upon natural sources; 14 villages seem to have             been
      taken     up for augmentation, since these villages already         have   piped
      water supply, but are probably included in the project for augmenting
      this    source.    The  remaining  11 villages in      the    P.W.  group,   are
      dependent on borewells as a main source of supply.

      As far as BW vi! !ages are concerned, 45 vii !ages i.e. 75 per cent are
      dependent  on natural sources. Only 4 have piped water supply and    11
      are presently dependent on borewel Is.

2.5   DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF HOUSEHOLDS

      Of   the 2711 respondents, 67.5 per cent were males and 32.5 per    cent
      were   females,   all  within the age group of 20 years   to 60 years.
      lnspite   of  our   desire to include an equal  proportion   of  female
      respondents, this   could not be achieved because of  unwillingness   of
      the female respondents.

      Coverage of       the sample by household groups                         is presented in Table 2.6.

2.6   MAIN OCCUPATION OF THE HOUSEHOLD

      The   households were grouped into six major categories      according   to
      their     main   occupation.   The  distribution  of  sample    households
      according    to these categories, is presented in Ta.ble 2.6. i t G~n    b8
      seen   from    this  table   that as the size of  village   (in  terms   of
      population)     increases, the proportion of fa.rmers declines. The    non-
      fa.rm occupations a.re thus relatively higher in larger villages.

2.7     OWNERSHIP OF LAND AND IRRIGATION

        Distribution     of   households  with farming as  main occupation   is
        presented   in  Table   2.9.  Among the farmers,  25.5 per cent were
        marginal farmers <i.e. owning less than 1 hectare) and 28.8 per    cent
        were sma! l farmers. (i.e. owning between 1 and 2 hectares). Only 15.6
        per  cent households owned land more than 5 hectares. There were    4.1
        per  cent households whose main occupation was farming but   they   did
        not  own land. Most of them had leased in land for cultivation, on    a
        share basis. Average land holding was 2.4 hectares.

       The  distribution of farmers according to the irrigated       holding     is
       given   in   Table 2. 10.  Of the 1526 farmers, 59.4 did   not    have   any
       irrigation     facilities;  22.2  per cent had irrigation    of   upto   one
       hectare    only.   14.9 per cent had more than one hectare    and   upto   4
       hectares    of irrigation, whereas only 3.5 per cent have more      than   4
       hectares    of   irrigated  land.  Average  irrigated   land    per  farmer
       household was 0.59 hectares.

       As      explained         in      the methodology, lhe  households   were  classified
       according            to   the      highest  level  of  education attained     in   the
       household.            The     distribution of ths sample households     is  given   in
       Table 2. 12.             Seven      per cent of the households  have   at  least   one
       graduate member and further 15 per cent have at least one member                   who
       has studied in col lege. Nearly half of the households have at                   least
       one member who has studied upto the 10th standard. In other words, 71
       per       cent       households have at least one member who has        studied   upto
       lOth       standard or above. Only 9.6 per cent households consist of              all

2.10    HOUSING

       We present below, the information on housing in terms of material   of
       wal Is, material of roofs, house type and open space available around
       the   house. The materials of walls are classified into  three  groups
       and   materials of wall are classified into five groups. As  explained
       in Chapter I, these groups are then used to classify houses into four
       classes A,B,C and D.

       The information is tabulated in  Tables   2. 13, 2. 14, 2.15 a.nd  2.16,
        In 37.2 per cent cases the houses had poor wal I material,    47.6   per
       cent houses had walls made of bricks or stones but without the u.se of
       cement and   only   15 per cent houses  had   pucca walls    where    the
       bricks/stones and cement was used.

       As far as the roofs are concerned 17.4 per cent had thatched roof, 36
       per  cent used tins or cement sheets, 30.8 per cent used tiles,  12.6
       per cent had cement concrete slabs.

       The houses, as mentioned in Chapter I are classified into 4 types      on
       the   basis  of  material used for walls and roofs.   Type A •better"
       houses,   which used cement for walls or roofs, account for   17.4    per
       cent.   Type  B •good" houses, with semi-permenant  walls   and    roofs,
       account   for the bulk, i.e. 53.2 per cent. Type C "fa.ir" hou.ses   with
       pucca wal Is and tin/cement sheet roofs account for 17.7 per cent     and


                                                     26
Type  D type   houses which are huts with             kut.cha..   walls     a.nd    roofs,
account for 11.6 per cent.

There   were 22.8 per cent houses without any open space   around,   9.7
per   cent had open space of upto 50 sq ft., 5 per cent had 50-100    sq
ft. 17.4 per c:ent 100-200 sq ft., 9. 3 per cent 200-300 sq ft. a.nd  as
many as 35.8 per cent had more than 300 sq ft of open space.

2.11   GASH INCOME AND MONTHLY SAVING

       Distribution        of  sample  households according to  their    annual  per
       capita, cash income is presented in table 2. 17. More than 90 per cent
       households        had  per  capita cash income of lass than   Rs.   2000  per
       annum.       There were only 4.2 per cant with per capita cash     income  of
       more       than   Rs. 5000 per annum. The average annual  per   capita cash
       i n<::orne   wa.s Rs. 1325.

       More than 90 per cent of the households did not save any amount,    3.5
       per cent saved less tha.n Rs. 50 per month, 1.5 per cent sa.ved between
       Rs. 50 and 100 per month, 1. 7 per cent saved between Rs. 100 a.nd 150.
       Only 1.2 per cent saved more than Rs.300 per month { Table 2.16 )

There is quite a close association between cash income and assets              as
seen from Table 2. 19. The percentage of respondents owning all assets
except     tractors, is significantly larger in the high-income          bracket
than in the low-income brackets. This indicates both the            reliability
of   the    two indicators in assessing the standard of li11ing          of   the
respondents      and   also the scale of preference of      the   consumers    as
 income    rises. There is, thus, a. la.rga increase in the       ownership of
radios,     TVs,   b1;llock  ca.rts, sto11as, gober gas   pla.nts   a.nd  better
housing.      It is also interesting, though not unexpected,        to   observe
that    the    amount of cash income is higher     in   the   non-agricultural
profession      than in agriculture. Coupled with other        indicators,   one
sees   a    clear    hierarchy in living standards    as    income    increases,
village-size      increases and the general occupational        nature   changes
from agriculture, to some other occupa.t.ion.

PROFILE OF HOUSEHOLDS IN PIPED WATER
AND BORE WELL WATER SUPPLY VILLAGES

Tables 2A. 1 to 2A. 10 of this Annexure present the differences in                                                 the
profiles of PW and BW villages. As has been seen in                                       chapter ll,             the
BW     villages         consist        of     both villages           and      hamlets          smaller         than
villages.          Moreover,         the     BW      villages       are     also         smaller        than        PW

borewells,            in       preference          to     piped     water       supply,            are        taken
 independently of the socio-economic conditions of villages, there are
likely      to      be differences in these conditions due to the                                     size        and
na.ture      of      the     s8ttl8ments. Th8 Tables 2A. 1 to                        2A.10        provide         the
information           as to the extent to which the socio-economic                                  conditions

these      differences need not be stretched too far. There is no                                           reason
to bel iev8 that these differences would have remained present had                                                  we
taken      into       account the entire villages rather than                               their       selected
hamlets in making such comparisons.

Generally, the BW villa.ges (including hamlets/ indica.te lower

<:~)   Educa.tional         level     is   lower      <Table 2A.4J

d)     Housing conditions are poorer                      !Tables 2A.5,           2A.6,      2A.71

f)     Monthly saving           is   less     !Table 2A. 101

The  only positive factor for BW vii !ages is that the houses                                              have      a
lot more open space surrounding them, than in PW villages.

                     HYGIENE         PERSONAL. AT HOME AND AT PUBLIC PLACES


3.1    INTRODUCTION

      Health      of individuals and of the community depends                            considerably             on
       Cal    personal health habits and                  lbl collective efforts                  to    maintain
      surroundings and public places clean and free from contamination.                                            It
       is    common      knowledge     that many of             the debilitating                ailments        and
      diseases      can     be   avoided through               inculcating         healthy         habits       and
      sanitation         practices.      At     personal         level,        pra.ctices         rela.ting        to
      brushing       of    teeth,    use of soap, washing                 of      clothes,         storage        of
      drinking water, cooking, serving and taking food, etc., reveal a                                           lot
      regarding        the    extent    to which individuals are                    aware        of    hygienic
      practices and take care to ward off diseases. Observation of                                        healthy
      habits       a.t    the   persona.!      level         is   not     eno1.;~gh.       The        immedia.te
      surroundings         also need to be properly looked after. This depends                                     on
      the system developed collectively by the group. In the village,                                         this
      responsibility rests with the grampanchayat as we! l as on                                     individual
      households who as a part of the village community, have to share                                          it.
      Maintaining         hygienic    conditions            on roads, with            gutters,          if    any,
      places       where      water   sources are             located,        public       buildings          like
      cha.va.d is,     g rampancha.ya t     off ices,         schoo Is and         open      spaces,         river
      banks,      etc. become sources of diseases if no regular arrangement                                       is
      made to keep them clean and in a good condition. In rural parts,                                           the
      mo s t   common d i seas e s a. r e    d i a. r r hoe a , d y sen t e r y ,   j au n d i c e ,   t y ph o i d ,
      paratyphoid,         hookworms      and       cholera, etc. To              these      may      be added
      diseases      arising out of malnutrition and wrong food habits. Most                                       of
      these      diseases can be prevented through creation of awareness and                                        a
      mechanism to keep the environment healthy.

       In this chapter, we present information on this subject in regard        to
      the   project  villages.     In   the  household  questionnaire,   specific
      questions   were    included    in order to understand  health   habits  of
      household members. The participant observer <P.O.) was instructed        to
      note observations in general about individual habits as wei l as group
      behaviour   in   regard   to health and    sanitation  practices.   Several
      reports of the POs present vivid account of the hygiene and        sanitary
      practices in the villages. The present chapter is based on all        these
      sources of information.

3.2   APPROACH ROAD TO THE VILLAGES

      One gets a general idea about the prevailing sanitation conditions in
      the   vii !age as soon as one enters the vii !age. Out of   92   vi! !ages
      studied by POs, the approach roads of BO villages can be      classified
      as   quite   dirty. Often, the sides of the approach road are    used   by
      children    and  others  for easing themselves. ln a    few  cases,    the
      approach    roads passed through the streams, the banks of   which    were
      the   places where cleaning and washing took place. Occasionally,      the
      same   river/stream water is used for drinking purposes also. At      some
      villages,    the  public transport as well as bullock carts   and   other
      vehicles    have to wade their way to the village., through the   stream.


                                                       36
      This   is obviously  hazardous to health. During   the monsoons,                  the
      situation  becomes worse, cutting off the villages from the  rest                  of
      the country for days together.

3.3   CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF DRAINAGE

      Conditions  in the villages regarding hygiene, were deplorable.     Only
      in   10 out of 117 villages covered in the present study,     were  some
      efforts to keep the environment clean. These included 2 vii !ages each
      in Pune and Aurangabad districts, 1 each in Baed, Sangli and Buldhana
      a.nd  2 in Ahmedni:J.gar district. In these villages, there  appeared    a
      system  to  clean    drainages, collect garbage from   the  street,   and
      maintain cleanliness at the sources of water.

      Some    rudimentary       outlet   is prepared to let out      the    waste    water.
       drains are not constructed in all villages, and therefore, only about
      25 per cent houses had channe 1 s connected to common drains. In                a.bout
       5.0 per cent cases, the '"aste water is cha.nnelised into soak pits. In
       the   case of a majority, consisting of 70 per cent households,                waste
       water   was    drained out on to the vii !age streets. Good            drains    were
      reported     by POs only in two villages lKund Khurd in District               Sangli
      and Kund Budruk in Buldhana district). At Ohar <Aurangabad                 district!
      the   work    of    covering     open drains was going      on  at    the   time    of
       investigation.       At   Shiregaon {Aurangabad district),         Pokha~i    Haveli
      (Ahmednagar       district),      the   use    collective  effort     to    maint~in
      clean! iness     was     seen. The vii !age Vidyanagar      <Puna    district!     was
      reported     to   be    a clean village. At Ambegaon        !Puna district)       and
      Chambharwadi       (Bead    district), villagers had a       desire     to  maintain
      cleanliness      as evinced by cleaniness maintained at           the    source     of
      water. At Kendale Budruk          IAhmednagar District) practice of disposing
      waste-water into soak-pits was common. These are, however, exceptions
      rather than the rule. Generally drains are not constructed and                  where
      drains are contructed, house channels to carry water to the drains do
      not    exist. There are instances where open drain have              been   rendered
      useless      through       putting    obstructions    in  them.      At    Samangaon
       (Ahmednagar     district) the Vii lage Panchayat constructed drains             from
      the Jawahar Rozgar Yojana Fund after a debate about whether the                  fund
      should be used for construction of latrines or drains. A fraction                   in
      the     village     did    not  approve     of   this  decision.      Subsequently,
      miscreants belonging to this faction, triad to destroy the drains and
      obstructed the flow, by dumping garbage and stones into it.

      50   per cent of the villages ware having open drainage facility        with
      the   average   length  of 290 meters of drains   per   village.     On   an
      average,    these drains were in existance for last 3 years.        lt   was
      also noted that only in 20 per cent of the villages, the condition of
      drains was good and was used by the villagers.       In the remaining     30
      per   cent villa.ges, condition of drains wa.s poor, mainly   becua.sl3   of
      lack of maintenance and due to faulty and incomplete construction         of
      dra.ins.

      Even   through ~early   73 per cent of the  households     ha.d  ba. th room
      facility    available, only 24 per cent were able to   use    open    drain
      facility constructed in th>o~ •Jilla.ge.



                                            37
In   genera.l   Grampanchayats    are                not     willing      to   take    the
responsibility   of  maintaining  and                G I ea.n i ng the    drains    unless
sufficient grants are made available.

A large majority ( 80 per cent! hous~Jitulds wanted to ha.ve open dra.ins
constructed in their respective vii !ages.

The  present  status of drains in few sample vii !ages from                        Pune    and
Sangli districts was as follows

           more than 100 soak pits and the most these soak pits were in good
           condition and were used by the villagers.

           soak pits were regularly used for  disposing waste water.

      Cl   Clea.nl iness ar!_Q_ Hygiene

           Efforts            made    by     various       NGOs  with     participation            from     the
            vii lagers            have shown significant improvement in cleanliness                         and
           maintaining              the     drains.        These aspects have             been   highlighted
            through case studies regarding efforts made to motivate vii lagers
           a. n d c::: h a. n g e   the i r   out 1 o o 1<  towards   c 1 e <:~. n l i ness ,  hyg i e ne  etc.
           However,              in some of the villages \1/here better                   clea.nl iness,    was
           observed             were mentioned in the report.                   The background          of  one
           such villa.ge is eK'plained below.

           ln   the village Shiregaon IAurangabad distric:::t) under JRY     drains
            (open drains) were c:::onstructed and were cleaned regularly.       This
           has helped to maintain the village clean.        In addition to     this,
           villagers    regularly collect household garbage and dump it        in   a
           compost    pit  specially   constructed.    This   has  been   acheived
           without employing     paid labour.   Strong leadership at the village
           level   to   create   awareness and   involving   villagers   in    every
           programme    are  l<ey factors responsible for    development    of    the
           vill<:~.ge.


           In   the    villages surveyed, every    household   has   a   place    set
           a.side   to   be used a.s a ba.throom. It is a. sheltered   pla.ce  in   a.
           majority     of ca.ses <.62.2 per centl. ln the remainig cases, it      is
           not even she\ tared, being open on at l     sides, the la.rge stone and
           some outlet indicating that the place is to be used as a bathroom
           for washing clothes and for bathing. Only one family reported           to
           have a closed bathroom.

3.4   GARBAGE DISPOSAL

      Arrangement  for garbage disposal is an equally important         aspect    of
      the management of environmental sanitation. ln the vii !ages surveyed,
      it   was found that while individual houses are         kept  clean   through
      every day sweeping and dungwash, litter is dumped outside the           houses
      on   the street. This practice was reported by 67.2 per cent          of   the
      respondents.    About    12.4 per  cent     of  the   respondents   had   some
      arrangement  ma.de for disposing of the litter. Of these        respondents,
      14 (0.5 per c:::entl reported the pr<:~.ctice of burning the 1 itter, 7 were
      using it in gas-plants and lB (0.6 per cent) were putting it in           pits
      on farms. Arrangements to col teet alL the garbage in the vii !age         and
      dispose  it  of     systematically was more     or  less   non-existent.    At
      Budhnerwadi. (Beed districtl, wa.ste water from the houses was drained
      directly  to the places where garbage was dumped. Villagers          defended


                                                    39
      this     practice  by arguing that this way garbage    is  converted  into
      man1.J.re.  While this ma.y or may not b>3 true, it was certainly  causing
      nuisance to the environment.

      Compost    pits

      Nearly    12   per    cent of villages   reported that    they  have    adopted
      garbage    col !action on a regular basis.     Some vii !ages   were    burning
      this    garbage, whereas others have construdted compost pits and           were
      dumping    all    the   ga.rbage.  For this purpose,    these  vi lla.ges    ha.ve
      deployed     workers    on   regular  basis.  Nearly 14    per  cent    of    the
      households      reported proper disposal of household garbage.         Majority
      of   them    use compost pits near the house or      the farm.     Few    either
      burn it or mix it in biogas plant.

      In  general  awareness  about waste water   and  garbage   disposal  is
      limited  among  few villagers.  Vii !age panchayats do   not  discharge
      their duties in terms improving village cleanliness.

3.5   MAINTENANCE OF CATTLE

      l<eeping   cattle,   sheep  a.nd goa.ts, etc.,  within  the  residentia.l
       premises    or  very close to it is yet another aspect of  hygiene.   As
      many   as 61 per cent of the households had cattle. Of these 53. 1    per
      cent   kept cattle within the premises of residence, but    outside   the
      living    rooms; 0.8 per cent kept cattle within living rooms;   another
       16.3  per    cent kept cattle near the premises in the  open;  and   the
      remaining     kept cattle on the farm, presumably in a shed  constructed
      for the purpose.

      About   27 per cant had sheep and goats. Of these, about 14  per             cent
      ware   keeping them within the living rooms; while 71.3 per cent             were
      keeping   outside  the rooms mostly in the open.  The  remaining             were
      keeping sheep and goats either on the farm or elsewhere.

      The   floor, where animals are tethered was baing kept   clean  through
      sweeping everyday. Dung was col leoted and used for making dung cakes.
      Urine   of animals was drained out of the house. While care was    taken
      to   keep the place clean, it appeared that it was not enough to    ward
      off   diseases  arising   out of the  unkempt immediate   surroundings.
      Vii lagers  appear   to be indifferent to the conditions   outside    the
      threshhold of the residence or the place where the animals are kept.

3.6   SOURCES OF DRINKING WATER

      Unhygienic   conditions  at the source of drinking water  are   perhaps
      most   harmful   as  water  gets   immediately contaminated   and   such
      contaminated   water  is distributed to every house. In  the   villages
      surveyed, it was observed that little care was taken in this    regard.

      Well  sites were usually the most neglected places. The       surroundings
      were   muddy  due to spil I ing of water, which   was   inevitable   while
      drawing   water    from   the  well  and  filling  the  pots.   The   a. rea.
      surrounding    the    wells was rarely paved with tiles  or   with  marked
      outlets.   A typical situation is a well illustrated in the report        of


                                          40
      Budhnerwadi   lBeed district) In this village, two   borewells,   fitted
      with   handpumps, provide adequate water to the entire population     for
      drinking as well as for other purposes. The wells are so located that
      waste-water from a! l the houses flows in the direction of the    wells.
      The well sites ara used for washing animals, clothes     and   utensils.
      All   this results in the formation of pools of water and    mud around
      the walls. Villagers fill in their pots with water for     drinking    in
      this   environment. The objective of providing potable and safe water
      through   the  construction  of  borewells  is  thus   defeated   to    a
      considerable eKtent. Whereever tap water is provided near the     public
      standposts, a similar situation has bean noticed.

       Absence of care to maintain surroundings of the water source is        also
      surprisingly     found in the newly established villages.    The    vii \age
       Talegaon    Budruk Tanda No. 2 (Baed District) illustrates    the    point.
      This    village has been established about 50 years ago by a     group    of
       150   families, belonging to a nomadic tribe called    "Laman".    Nomadic
      tribes     are in the process of settling down at various places in      the
      state.     The Government is offering facilities and assitanca     to   them
      through     provision  of employment, lands,   housing,  construction     of
      we! ls etc. For this group, a borewell was constructed which       provides
      a    limited quantity of water. This facility together with     some    land
      and the availability of wage work in the vicinity, has contributed to
      the    settlement of    this group. It was   however  observed   that    the
      surroundings     of the well were not well kept; water   is  consequently
      likely to be contaminated.

3.7   PERSONAL HYGIENE

      Personal   habits are important in determining the level    of    hygiene.
      Villagers    apppaarad  to   be mora aware of these  than  of    community
      hygiene.   This is reflected in their responses to    various   questions
      concerning personal cleanliness. About 46 per cent of the respondents
      reported that drinking water brought home is first treated before       it
      is   used.   Of these, about 87 par cent filter i t through a    piece of
      cloth;   about 4 par cent treat it with chemicals; 1.8 per cant clean
      it   through   the application of alum, and a small minority     lO.B  par
      cant)   boil it. About 23 par cent reported that water in     the   public
      source itself is already treated and therefore needs no further care.

      Except 24 respondents, all reported that members take daily baths and
      that  for most of them (95 per cent! it was possible to take a   bath
      everyday, throughout the year.

      About 75 per cent of the respondents replied that they use soap while
      bathing;  65   par cant of these required upto 3 pieces of soap   in a
      month. [ lThe most popular brand was Lifebuoy (56 per cent!   followed
      by  Lux  (31.4   per cent)], Most of the  respondents  196  per   centl
      reported  the washing of their hands before taking food, mostly with
      plain water (93. 1 per cant). Soap is used by a small minority while
      washing hands before and after taking food.

      The above responses. however, cannot be accepted at their face value.
      The  participant  observers  and the interviewers  have  an  entirely
      opposite observation   to report. They mention that the  anwsers,  as


                                       41
      given   by  the respondents, at bast show th~t they are aware     of the
      importance   of    personal  hygiene and of what needs  to  be  dona  in
      maintaining    it.   The reported actions are rarely practised.   If one
      ware  to summarise the observations of the POs and the     interviewers,
      the following picture emerges

      '3 )        Whenever   water    is   in shortage,   no wa.ter   is    used   for     clea.ning
                  a.fter toilet.

      b)          Drinking    water   is       neither    filtered    nor   treated   with
                  chemica.ls.  Even if it     is filterc~d, i t is not always done with  a
                  clean cloth.

      cl          Villagers   do not always take a daily bath. Bringing   water   home
                  and taking a bath is generally avoided; bathing at public places,
                  howsoever   dirty they ma.y be, is preferred. At home,  water   used
                  for   bathing   is  inadequate. Washing and cleaning   of  hair    is
                  mostly neglected.

      dl          Washing  of hands after meals is practised.              The same      cannot    be
                  said about washing of hands before meals.

      el          The  use   of  soap, both for bathing     and  washing clothes,      is
                  exa.ggerated.  The   villagers ca.nnot a.fford it. At best,    most  of
                  them  use washing soap for bathing or washing hair. The        utensils
                  a.re clea.ned  mostly   with a.sh or mud.   Similarly,  a.fter   easing
                  themselves,   villagers   wash their hands by rubbing them      on  the
                  grouhd and applying a little water.

      f )         Clothes      a.re  not    regularly   wa.sh8d. They   a.l ways       sme 1 1  of

                  are  used     to f i l tar water, wipe ha.nds, a.nd even, as        towels,   to
                  wipe chi ldr8n ~.f ter their ba.th.

3.8   CONCLUSIONS

      The general          conclu~ion~     that emerge out of   this analysis are          :

             al     Shortage of water is responsible,        among oth8r faders,          for     lack
                    of ad8quate personal hygiene.

             bl     People are only broadly aware of th8 importance of clean! iness.
                    They  are   not aware of th8 germs and the media  through   which
                    they  carry   diseases.   Thus, a lot  of  extension   effort   is
                    necessary   to educate them about hygiene and th8 ways in   which
                    it can be maintained.

            c )     Thera  are  some  age-old  habits  like  lazin8ss     in   bathing,
                    spitting,  easing  oneself in the open, washing    in    the  op8n,
                    etc., which need to b8 corr8cted. Here aga.in, th8 importa.nce of
                    education cannot be over looked.

       DRINKING YATER SUPPLY : PRESENT CONDITIONS PRACTICES AND DEMAND


4. 1   BACKGROUND

       Under   the Rural Drinking Water Supply Programme, it is  proposed   to
       provide water with the help of the Piped ~ater Supply Scheme and
       Borewell Schemes. As we have seen in chapter 11, the villages covered
       under these schemes are different in character. We intend to present
       village and household data separately in        two sections  of   this
       chapter.   The first   section will cover   the analysis  of  vil \ages
       proposed   under  the Piped Water Supply and the second will      cover
       vii lages under the Borewell Schemes.

       Originally    it was   proposed  to include  in the project 75    large
       regional    piped ~.S. schemes and 174 small individual     piped W.S.
       schemes    covering   500   villages, 12 wadis   and 2   towns   to be
       implemented in two phases.   So  far  56  large  regional piped    W.S.
       Schemes covering 462      villages, 19 wadis, 2  towns  and   91  small
       individual piped W.S. schemes coverning 91 vii !ages and 32 wadis have
       been  identified for   being taken up under the project as under

       The above figures may undergo further changes.

       Under the proposed schema it is planned to provide
            40 I itres per capita per day C lpcd) for public stand-post
            70 lpcd for House Connections with a single tap

       This  covers villages where no such scheme, is available at   present,
       and where Piped Water has been made available,     but  needs   to  be
       augmented.

4.2    EXTENT OF DEPENDENCE ON SOURCES OF WATER

       Under   the Piped Water Supply Schema, we covered               a  sample of    57
       villages    from a.ll the ten project districts. An effort is            made   to

Dug wells are, by far, the most important source of water,    followed
by borewells and piped water supply. There are 16 villages which also
depend on rivers/streams and 13 whicl1 require water supplied through
tankers in the summer months.

There were 33 villages out of 57 villages, in which more than 80 per
cent of the sample households depended only on a single source. Their
distribution is given in table 4.2.

The following 17 villages have been identified which                   depend   on   a
single natural source like a river or well.

Of these 17 villages, 8 villages were receiving per capita water
supply in the range of 25-30 litres. whAreas 3 villa«es were getting
between 31-40 litres, and the rest 6 were getting more than 40 litres


                                  44
per capita per day. The water availability as noticed in rainy season
may be on the higher side compared with availability of water in
other seasons. Since the field work was carried during the months of
July-August, the water consumption data relates to rainy seasons.

The eight villages which were depending exclusively on        piped   water
supply were from the following 5 districts :

             District                  Villages

     1.      Aurangabad                Karmad and Shiregaon

     5.      Latur                     Karla, Sayyadpur {Bk), Takli (Bk)

All these villages (except Warje Malwadi) were receiving a per capita
water supply of between 20-30 litres. In the case of Warje Malwadi,
which is located on the outskirts of Pune, supply was 60 litres per
capita. All these villages reported inadequate supply of water mostly
during the summer months.In Dhulgaon, water was supplied by tanker
during the summer months of shortage.

Villages which were depending on borewells         were   receiving   water
supply in the range of 20-35 litres per day.

In the group of 24 villages which had more than one source of water
[see table 4.3{A)], 21 villages were depending on open dug wells.
There were 3 villages which were depending with one organised source;
Inspite of this water availability in these 3 villages was reported
to be inadequate.

After studying village level availability of water it would be
necessary to know the present conditions and practices at the
household level for the three categories of households.

Out of 1777 households covered, only 5 per cent were dependent on
natural sources like rivers, streams etc., 51 per cent depended on
wells, whereas about 64 per cent of the households covered had access
to organised sources of water. Of these, a majority {36 per cent),
were getting Piped Water Supply from stand-posts and              private
connections.  Slightly less than one per cent of the households
covered, reported that they depended on supply through tankers during
the days of shortage. The details a:t.·e presented in Table 4. 3(B).

Since practices concerning water consumption habits relate to source
of supply,   we plan to describe present condition practices and
estimate demand for these three sub-categories separately.

The extent of dependence on wells is observed to be about 55 per
cent for all the three groups. It was nearly 78 per cent for
households depending on natural sources, 32 per cent for the piped
water group and 23 per cent for the Bore-well group. Nearly 73 per
cent of the wells were owned by the community. More than 99 per cent
of the wells both privately owned and community owned are of the open
type. Table 4.5 shows group wise ownership of wells.

    Eighty per cent of the households from the "Natural source group are
    at present dependent on public wells to meet their water needs.  This
    proportion was 56 per cent for the group belonging to    'Bore-Well'.
    In the third group of "Piped-Water", this proportion was only 43 per
    cent,  indicating the presence of a larger number of privately owned
    open wells.

4.3 DISTANCE FROM SOURCE OF WATER
    The households were asked to indicate one way distance they are
    required to walk to fetch water every day. The average distance is
    worked out by adding distance for each type of source as large
    number of hoursehoulds depended on too or more sources.       It was
    observed (see table 4.6) that, for well, river sources, by and large
    are in the range of 300 to 550 metres away from their homes while,
    Bore Wells are within the range of 140-235 metres. Relativaly Public
    Stand -Posts are closer, within 140 metres from the residence of the
    households.

    In other words, where households depended on natural sources, persons
    had to walk a distance (one-way) of about half a kilometer;  it   was
    around ·150 meters (or one-third) where borewells or stand-posts were
    provided.

4.4   MONTHS OF USE
      Dependence (in months) on various sources of water during the course
      of the year was also noted. Dependence on natural sources like wells
      is slightly lower when compared to the organised sources.         The
      differences between these three groups are presented in table 4.7 :

                TABLE 4.7           MONTHS OF USE OF DIFFERENT SOURCES

4.5   WAITING AT SOURCE OF WATER
      It is imperative that most of the households who were dependent on
      common sources of water had to wait for some time at the source. This
      is seen from the table 4.8.

                       TABLE 4.8            PER OENT HOUSEHOLDS WHO
                                            HAD TO WAIT AT THE SOURCE
                                                                            ( Per cent )

                                                       Water                       Sources

      In the case of households depending on natural sources; mostly wells,
      relatively a smaller proportion of households were required to wait
      (44 per cent). In the piped water supply scheme, among those who were
      dependent on public stand-posts, 46 per cent of households had to
      wait. Nearly 76 per cent of the households depending on borewells had
      to wait at bore wells (hand pumps).

4.6   TIME REQUIRED FOR FETCHING WATER
      Even though distance from the water source is almost three times in
      the case of households depending on natural sources of water, it is
      not adequetely reflected in the time required for fetching water from
      this source. The average duration required varied between 65 to 80
      minutes.




                                              48

                Borewell                                65

      The time so calculated includes waiting time as well as travel time.
      In other words, the waiting time at the organised sources,     almost
      compensate for the travel time in case of the natural sources.

      N.Q..,_ Qf Trips

      The average number of trips made by each household to fetch water was
      around 3.   This number was the same for households depending on
      natural as well as organised sources. The total time required for
      fetching water in a day,      thus comes to around 3 to 4 hours,
      irrespective of the source.

4.7   WHO FETCHES WATER
      Water is brought from the source to the residence mainly by women.
      Other members of the family also help in this activity. Fetching of
      water only by men is reported by about 12 per cent of the households.

      It is interesting that in the piped water source households, men            had
      a little more involvement.

4.8   TYPES OF CONTAINERS USED FOR BRINGING STORAGE OF WATER
      The traditional containers { known in local parlance as Kalashi.
      ghagar,  handa etc.) which have narrow mouth and are round in shape
      are still used by the majority of households. They are mostly made of
      copper/brass (76 per cent). The use of buckets, which is relatively a
      modern containar,   is reported by only about 16 per cent          of
      households.

      Similarly, the traditional containers known as Ranjans (earthen pots)
      Handas (metalic pots) etc. are still in wide use for storing water.
      The modern 1 drums' have, however, made an entry in the rural areas
      for storage of water.


                                       49
      Nearly 88 per cent of the households have at least one container made
      out of clay.    Brass is the next major material used for storage
      containers  {57 per cent) followed by steel {19 per cent) and copper
      (16 per cent). This is presented in the following table.

4.9   USE OF WATER AT THE RESIDENCE
      More than 94 per cent of the households, used                     water     fetched          from
      these sources for drinking and cooking.

      This implies that other domestic activities li~e washing and laundry
      are conducted at sources, instead of at homes.

      Method    of taking water from storage vessels can be noted from                            Table
      4. 11.

       In all the three groups of households there is not much differennce
       in the habits. Only about 15-18 per cent households have developed
       hygienic habits of drawing water.

4.10   TREATMENT AT SOURCE
       Table 4.12 presents information on the respondents' knowledge          about
       the treatment of water undertaken at source.

4.11   TREATMENT OF WATER
       Households were asked about potability of water they were drinking.
       Nearly 90 per cent households felt that the water they were drinking
       was potable. Of those who mentioned that water was not potable,   50
       per cent found water 'murky' and 20 per cent found it either salty
       or without taste. The households, by and large, judged the purity of
       water by its taste and look.

       Inspite of the fact that the water was reported as potable,   on an
       average,  46 per cent of the total households were reported to be
       using some method for purifying water at home. A bulk of those
       reporting purification, used filtering through a piece of cloth (54
       per cent}. Only about 16 per cent reported the use of chemicals.
       There was not much difference in this reporting, which any case
       appeared exaggerated in the households using different sources of
       water.

4.12   BATHING HABITS
       Water required for bathing was estimated to be in the range of 60-65
       litres per day, per household. Taking into consideration the average
       household size which varied from 6.3 to 6.8 members per household,
       the per capita water requirement works out to around 9.5 litres per
       day. This is comparable with the per capita water requirements in the
       states of Gujarat and Tamilnadu.

       The number of persons bathing at the source of water, varied between
       2 to 3 per household. It was also reported that due to limited
       availability of water, it was not possible to bathe everyday.    The
       incidence of skipping the daily bath was found to be more in the
       households provided with piped water supply than those with natural
       or borewell supplies. This was because a large number of household2
       depended on public stand-posts, for water, so it was not alway~
       possible to get enough water for bathing.


                                       51
4.13   WASHING AND CLEANING HABITS
       Due to limited availability of water and lack of proper facilities
       available in the house, many households undertake washing of clothes
       and other activities outside the house, generally at the source of
       supply. This is seen from the table 4.13

       In the case of households depending on Natural sources, more than 64
       per cent households wash clothes at the source of water. This
       proportion is 38 per cent in the Piped Water group and 46 per cent
       for Borewell group. Wells and Rivers are generally most common
       sources where washing of clothes is carried out.
       Quantity of water required for washing of clothes was estimated in
       the range of 40-45 litres per day, per household. It was observed
       that water used for washing clothes at the source was slightly more
       than that for clothes washed at home.

       Cleaning Q£ Uteneils

       As many as 92 per cent of the households clean utensils at home.  The
       remaining 8 per cent do so either at open wells, borewells or rivers.
       There is no difference between the three groups as far as this
       activity is concerned. On an average, 25 litres of water are needed
       per household per day.

4.14   WATER REQUIREMENTS FOR CATTLE
       More than 90 per cent of the households take their cattle to water
       sources for drinking water, bathing,cleaning etc. This practice is
       almost uniform in all the three groups of households.         Sources
       commonly used for this purpose are wells (30 per cent),   rivers (28
       per cent) and streams (18 per cent). Only 4 per cent          of the
       households use water tanks, specially built for animals. The quantity
       of water required for cattle was reported to vary between 52-65
       litres per day, per household.

    4.15     WATER REQUIRE"ENT FOR OTHER PURPOSES
             In every household, plastering the floor with dung and preparation o
             dung cakes is a regular activity, but use of water for this      acti~it
             was   reported by only about 12 per cent of the households. Wat~r       fc
             personal   hy~iene   was  separately  reported by 4   per   cent   of   th
             households.   About   8  per  cent of  the  households    reported    wate
             consumption   for   various  other activities like   gobar   gas   plants
             washing   of animals etc. Only 3 per cent of the    households   reporte
             requirements   of   water for kitchen gardens. Water   is   consumed    fo
             household industry, profession etc. was reported by about 3 per        cen
             households. 40-45 litres of water is required per households per day

    4.16     WILLINGNESS TO PAY FOR PIPED WATER

             Households   were   initially asked about their       preferences    regardin
             house-connections    and   public stand-posts. They were also        asked  t
             indicate   the   amount that they ware willing to pay        towards   capita

       After getting these responses they were informed about Piped Water
       Supply scheme,   advantages of potable water and estimated capital
       expenditure   towards house-connections,   and monthly    maintenance
       charges   for   both.  The questions concerning     preferences   and
       willingness, then, were again asked to them (Aided response).

       It was observed that in all the three groups aided          response   was
       siginificantly different from the unaided response.

       In the section 4.17 demand for private water supply connection 13
       explained in detail.   Our basic premise is that this demand is not
       related to income alone.  The factor of capacity to pay is important
       and was measured in terms of ownership of either a radio or a bicycle
       Hence   those households who are willing to pay and having either of
       these two assets were considered for estimating demand for private
       connections.

       The reasons for not considering cash income was also discussed in the
       section 4.17 hence it was not necessary to present the table on
       income and willingness to pay for private connection.


4.17   DEMAND FOR PRIVATE WATER SUPPLY CONNECTIONS
       For estimating demand, the following methodology was used :

       The households from only those villages which are included in the
       piped water supply projects are considered for estimating demand.

       The response is obtained after giving the     respondents    information
       concerning the cost of connections.

       In estimating    demand, two factors are considered; willingness I to
       have the connection and willingness to pay for it;     as also the
       capacity of the households to pay the amount.

       The factor of willingness was assessed from the respondents' answers
       to the question concerning this aspect.    All the 1728 respondents
       answering the questions affirmatively and willing to pay at least Rs.
       1 were considered to be demanding the private piped water connection.

       The factor of capacity to pay was assessed using two approaches.    One
       was the possession of either a radio or a bicycle. Since both cost
       more than Rs. 500;-, ~t was assumed that the respondent possessing
       any of these assets is in a position to spend for          the capital
       expenditure required for a private pipe connection.         Only those
       household_::; who were willing to pay and had either of these two
       assets,      were considered for estimating      demand   for   private
       connections. In the other approach, the cash income of the households
       was considered. Since these figures are rather under-reported and not
       all the households have sources of cash income, this approach was not
       put•sued further. There was e.lso the problem of deciding what level of
       income should be considered to determine adequate capacity to pay.
       The total demand is presented in table 4.15. The demand is given for
       various levels of the respondents' willingness to pay separately for


                                        54
advanced   and backward castes.    The figures are     expressed  as
percentages of households to be provided with piped water supply in
their villages.   The results suggest that, for all districts taken
together,  9% households are willing to pay above Rs. 401/- per year
for a private water supply connection.

The demand schedules vary between advanced and backward castes. The
latter are, generally, lower than the former. It is also seen that
the demand varies from village to village.

The conclusions emerging from this analysis can be stated thus :

  i)   There is a decrease in the number of households preferring
       house connections, after the information on capital costs, etc.
       was given to them. Still, between 30 to 35 per cent households
       would       like to have house-connections.       While   explaining
       advantages         (Aided   response) about piped   water    supply,
       households         were also informed about the capital cost and
       monthly maintenance charges. Many households who opted for
       house connection in an unaided response declined to pay the
       specified amount towards capital cost.          Hence there is a
       cle<:::rease in .. Aided Response".

 ii)   Those who prefer to have house connections are ready to spend
       between Rs.   250 to Rs. 400 towards capital cost. There is a
       difference in this willingness in villages having different
       sources of supply.    The villages with borewell sources are
       likely to pay more than those which already have pipe water
       supply.  The aided response in terms of willingness to pay has
       also shown an increase as compared to unaided response.

iii)   The monthly maintenance charges for stand-posts at Rs. 7 to Rs.
       10 seem to be acceptable to most. This amount,    under   aided
       response, ii an improvement over the unaided response.

4 . 18   BACKGROUND
         In the Borewell Scheme there are two components viz

          i)     Revitalizing (hydrofracturing) of existing bore wells
         ii)     Digging of new wells

         Under the revitalisation programme there are 305 villages from 10
         districts,   whereas,  the new well programme is planned in         10
         districts,   covering 148 villages and 621 hamlets. It is proposed to
         provide    one hand pump per 250 persons in these villages, in such a
         manner that the beneficiaries are not required to walk more than 250
         metres tn fetch water and obtain 40 litres of water per day,       per
         person,

         As indicated in the first chapter, we have              not   included        villages
         under hydrofracturing scheme.

         We covered 934 households from 17 villages and 43 hamlets in 8
         districts.  The districts of Latur and Buldhana were not included in
         the samplej   as there were only 2 villages and 2 hamlets proposed
         under the project in these districts.

4.19     DEPENDENCE OF VILLAGES ON VARIOUS SOURCES OF WATER
         Out of 60 villages and hamlets, 85 per cent are get their supply from
         wells,  33 per cent from rivers, streams, canals etc., 48 per cent
         from existing borewells and 23 per cent from piped water supply.
         Twenty per cent villages are supplied water through·'tankers'  during
         the months of March, April and May. (see table 4.16)

The dependence        on    only one source was more for                       hamlets        than   for
villages.

Exclusive dependence on natural and organised sources was studied
further. It was found that dependence is more on natural sources than
on the organised sources. (see table 4.18)

        Only 22 per cent of the households are at present depending on
        rivers, nalla,  stream etc~ as compared to 64 per cent on wells,
        whereas 35 per cent of the households depend on organised sources
        like borewell, stand-post and private connection. 9 per cent of the
        households mentioned that during the day~ of shortage of water, they
        are required to get water from water tan~ers.

        On the basis of the major source of supply of water in a village we
        grouped villages into three categories viz ; Natural sources,   Bore
        well and Piped water

        The distrubution      of    households by these                   three    categories           is    as

        The households ( 175) mainl)' depending on bore wells had to augment
        their water supply by taking water from open wells. From the group
        which mainly depends on natural sources, only 17 per cent had access
        either to bore wells or piped water as a secondary source. Nearly 32
        per cent have to depend on seasonal natural sources like rivers, I
        streams, nallas etc. This group deserves bore well scheme most.

       Households depending on Natural sources had to walk more than 250
       meters to reach wells. and nearly 400 meters to reach rivers.     The
       second group which is dependent on bore wells requires to walk abOllt
       215 meters to fetch water from bore wells.  Those depending on stand-
       posts require to walk 140 meters to reach the source.

       The average distance between the source and the residence for all
       households in borewell scheme villages and hamlets is estimated to be
       280 meters.

4.23   MONTHS OF DEPENDENCE ON VARIOUS SOURCES

        The households depending on natural sources from all the three groups
        on an average, depend on wells and rivers for 8 months during the
        year. Compared to this, the average period of dependence on organised
        sources is 11 months indicating clearly that organised sources of
        water, wherever available, are more dependable than natural sources.
        Wells form the major source of water for about 70 per cent of the
        households in all the three groups. This proportion is the highest
        i.e. 75 per cent in the natural sources group. About 35 per cent of
        all the wells are privately owned. The following table shows
        distribution of wells by ownership

        More than 98 per cent of the wells are open type.
4. 24   WHO   FETCHES WATER

        The female members of the household is the single major group
        involved in fetching water, although this activity is also shared by
        male members in about 45 per cent of the households. In only about 14
        per cent of the households male members fetch water, without any
        assistance from female members.
4.25    TIME REQUIRED FOR     ~~TCHING    WATER
        Every day about 90 minutes are spent by a household in fetching
        water. The average time required for these groups is presented in the
        following table :
                                    TABLE 4.25         TIME   REQUIRED

        In the group of households depending on natural sources, nearly 16
        per cent did not spend any time in fetching water mainly due to the
        fact that they had wells in their backyards. This proportion was
        about 7 per cent in the borewell group and 32 per cent in the piped
        water supply group.

        Every day, water is fetched 2-3 times a day. About 46 per cent of the
        households do it once/twice a day and the remaining do it 3 times a

                                                  62
        day.
 4.26    WAITING TIME AT THE SOURCE OF WATER
        Nearly 36 per cent of the households reported that they are required
        to wait at the source 6 for fetching water. This proportion was lowest
        in the case of households depending on Natural Sources (31 per cent)
        increasing to 50 per cent for households depending on Borewells and
        56 per cent for households depending on Piped Water Supply Scheme.

4.28    TREATMENT OF WATER
        Nearly 79 per cent of the household reported that water ovailable to
        them is potable. Those who mentioned that it was not potable have
        given the following reasons.

        Reasons

        Water is salty                32        ~lostly   from nat, ural & bore well
            group

        Water is murky                35        Natural source

        River water with moss          8        Natu.ral source

        Other reasons like bad
        smell, water without taste    15        Natural sourced

        In order to test the knowledge of respondents,      they were asked
        whether well water was chemically treated.       Only 22 per     cent
        households from all the three groups positively mentioned chemical
        treatment. Nearly 21 per cent were sure about non existence of such a
        facility in their village. The rest (about 57 per cent) were not
        aware of such a service undertaken by the Gram Panchayat.

        When enquired about methods of purifying water at home, nearly 39 per
        cent mentioned that they treated water before use. 46 per cent of the
        households from the borewell group reported that they treat water,
        whereas 39 per cent households from the natural sources group
        reported treatment. Filtering of water using a piece of cloth is the
        major method followed.

4.29    BATHING HABITS
        Less than 1.5 per cent of the households reported that it was not
        possible for the members to bathe at home. This proportion wa::> one
        per cent in the case of households from the natural sources group,
        where as it was less than 3 per cent for households from th~ borewell
        group.  This was,   as in the case of PW villages,  contrary to the
        observation made by participant observer.

t. 30   WASHING OF CLOTHES
        Slightly more than one third households were able to wa:::.h clothes at
        home,  this proportion was maximum ( 45 per cent.) in the households
        from the bore well group and minimum (26 per cent) in the Piped Water
        Supply group. The major places where clothes are washed are presented
        in the following table.

        As regards cleaning of utensils, nearly 90 per cent of the households
        perform this activity at home. Of the remaining 10 per cent, about 9
        per cent clean their utensils at wells, canals, nallas, rivers,  etc.
        Only one per cent of the households do so at public stand-posts or
        borewells.

4.32   ANALYSIS OF WATER SAMPLES
       There are 57 villages covered in the sample which are to be provided
       with piped water supply schemes.     Out of these villages,   samples
       from 50 villages were collected for chemical analysis, with a minimum
       of 3 samples per village, In all, thus 178 samples were collected for
       analysis. All these samples were collected from the households. These
       samples were collected in the bottles provided by the Public Health
       Laboratories.  These laboratories the water collected analysed.    The
       following observations can be made from the results obtained in these
       analysis.

       From table 4.30 it can be seen that the water collected from nearly
       all villages is contaminated and not fit for drinking purposes.   From
       only two villages (out of 50 ) all the samples were free of
       contamination.  As against this in 23 villages all the samples were
       found    to  be contaminated.   Moreover in 15     villages,    faecal
       contamination was observed in the water samples.

       Table 4.31 provides the information about the results of samples
       together with the sources of supply from which the respondent
       households brought the water.     Nearly 80 per cent of all water
       samples   were contaminated.   This percentage remained the      same
       irrespective of the fact that the source of water was an open well,
       river/nalla/tank or piped water. It is only in the case of the
       borewell, that the extent of contamintion was lower at 67 per cent.

       This analysis stresses two facts, which require urgent attention.

        i)   It is likely that from most of the sources, including                  pipes,
             contaminated water is stJ.pplied. This must be stopped                 and a
             constant monitoring must be done.

       ii)   It is also likely that water gets contaminated during storage,
             transport and handling. In other words, a mere supply of piped
             treated water does not ensure consumption of safe water.               The
             people have to be ediJ.Cated in thi~· :eegard and it ::Lhc:.1Lld .iQr.m ~

5.1   INTRODUCTION
      As explained in chapter I the discussion in this chapter is based                    on
      the information obtained from

      a)     Questionnaires canvassed for 2711 households                in    the    sample
             project villages, spread over in 10 districts.

      b)     Reports of the investigators on the village situation.

      c)     Reports of the participant observers (POs) who submitted detailed
             village reports.

      d)     Records of the village Panchayat,          Zilla Parishad,       RUWAT     data,
             Census and other publictions.

      This chapter provides the aggregate information for all the districts
      together. The district-wise tabulation is given in Volume II.

5.~   PRE~ENT    aiTUATlON OONOERNING LATRINES
      Out of   2711 households, only 161 households {forming around 6 per
      cent) reported the use of latrines. This percentage varied between 0
      (for Latur district) and 19 (for Thane district}. The major factors
      affecting a large incidence of latrines in Thane district were good
      availability of water and nearness to the suburbs of Bombay.

      The distribution of latrines among settlements also shows a wide
      variation. Out of 122 settlements covered, as many as 87 settlements
      (71 per cent) did not report any sample household,   using latrines.
      The principal settlements reporting large usage of latrines are
      presented in Table 5.1.

      Thus,  these 12 settlements account for 75 per cent of the observed
      use of latrines, and in these settlements the percentage of sample
      households using latrines varies between 11 per cent to 53 per cent.
      The profile of these villages is discussed in section 5.5.

5.3   TYPE OF LATRINES USED
      The distribution of households according to the type of latrines used
      by them is as given in table 5.2.

                            TABLE 5.2           TYPES OF LATRINES

                   Septic                                        58.9
                   With Gobargas & Others                        11.4

      The incidence of septic latrines is t.he highest, nearing 60 per cent,
      followed by the traditional ones at 20 per cent. The latrines with
      gobar-gas utility are around 11 per cent. The incidence of one      or
      two pit latrines is quite low, indicating partially a lack of
      awareness of such latrines and partially, the preference for the
      flush type of latrines.

5.4   OWNERSHIP OF LATRINES
      The distribution of households using latrines according to            ownership
      is given in Table 5.3.

      The rnajori ty of the latrine-users own the latrines.     The   household~.
      using public latrines are only around 9 per cent.

      92 per cent of the respondents reported that the latrines are used by
      all the family members with almost all of them using them throughout
      the year.

      Over 61 p~r cen£households reported constructing the latrines during
      the last 5 years, and further 13 per cent constructed latrinee
      between 6-10 years ago, the remaining 1.5 per cent constructed them
      11 or more years ago~

      incurred by them is given as follows

5.5   THE PROFILE OF THE VILLAGES HAVING
      A LARGE POPULATION OF LATRINES
      Thane district

      The three villages, Satpale, Bhuigaon Bk. and Nale have two common
      features. Firstly, all of them are at a very short distance from the
      suburbs of Bombay (Nale and Bhuigaon Bk. are 6 kms and 15 kms
      respectively from Vasai and Satpale is 8 kms from Virar). This,  with
      nearness to the rail/road and a large number of buses and train~.
      serving them has increased the residential population of salaried
      classes in these villages, who come to Bombay and to other nearby
      suburbs of Bombay (like Vasai, Virar, Andheri and Borivali).     They
      are more educated and also belong to advanced castes.   (In Satpale,
      for example, there is a large population of Christians). The increase
      in population has also reduced the open space. The second factor is
      abundance of water. Nearly,every household has a well, with a water
      level at between 10 to 30 ft. and supply water throughout the year.
      Though,  all this water is not fit for drinking and though there is
      some shortage of potable drinking water in summer; there is adequate
      water for irrigation, bathing and sanitation throughout the year.
      These villages are included in the area known as the "green" belt
      which is favourable for growing vegetables, fruits and flowers.   The
      latrines are mostly of the septic type.



      In this district, Newasa has a sizeable number of private latrines.
      Newasa is 60 kms from Ahmadnagar, the district headquarter.      Ite
      population is around 6000 and the large number of latrines seems tr
      be due, according to the reports of the POs, to the abundant supply
      of water,   both from borewells and piped water supply,      and the
      relatively high income of the owners of the latrines, who have spent
      around Rs.   6 to 7 thousand each for the construction of latrinee
      which are mostly septic.


                                     71
      In this district also, the owners of latrines seem to come from    the
      well to do class and have had urban contacts.

      Sane;J.i
      Kumthe village, with a population of 5000, is situated near Sangli
      city (11 kms) and Tasgaon (9 kms). A piped water supply scheme was
      implemented in 1981, but it is not functioning. So is the case with 8
      community latrines constructed 6 years ago, All of them are not in
      use,  for want of maintenance. All the private latrines that are
      constructed are by those who constructed bio-gas plants.     Some of
      these latrines are also not in use because of the non-functioning of
      bio-gas plants.

      More or less the same situation prevails in Dhulgaon (population
      2500) which is 15 kms from Sangli city. Here also the latrines are
      constructed by the bio-gas plant users. Here again, 11 out   of 26
      bio-gas plants are not functioning.

      Buldbana
      Amdapur is a large, semi-urban area, having a population of around
      10000. Although there is a piped water supply scheme operating in the
      village,  it is thouroghly inadequate and there is a severe shortage
      of water in summer. Only those households which are from the salaried
      classes and which have had some contacts with the cities have
      constructed latrines, which are of the flush type.



      In Beed, both Borgaon and Ghatnandur are large villages. The people
      who have constructed latrines here are relatively well to do,
      educated and have urban contacts.

      The discussion thus indicates that demand for latrines is restricted
      to those villages which are urban oriented and within the villages,
      to the relatively better off classes. Naturally, the latrines thus
      found are of costly nature, mainly septic.

5.6   THE PROFILE OF HOUSEHOLDS USING LATRINES
      The above analysis indicates that :

      a)   The latrine users are concentrated in few villages.
      b)   Most of the latrine users own the latrines they use.
      c)   Most of the latrine owners have spent on the latrines between Rs.
           1000 to Rs. 1500.
      d)   Most of the latrines are of the septic tank/flush types,     with
           quite a few attached to the gobar-gas plants.

      In other words, the present latrine users should be coming from the
      relatively better sections of the society. This is borne out from the;
      following table (Table 5.4) which compares latrine users and non-:


                                      72
   following   table  (Table 5.4) which compares latrine users and   non-
   latrine users in Thane district with different indicators of level of
   living.   There are distinct differences between these  two sections.
   A significantly lower number of households which use latrines,     own
   cycles,   radios,  TYs and stoves as compared to non-latrines   users.
   They also have better houses and larger cash incomes.

   Question 6 in section 1 of the household questionnaire         referred   to
   whether      the household had any facility of a latrine. {n the entire
   sample,      161 households (from a total of     2711 households)   replied
   a.ffirm.:il.tively <5.!3 per cent}. In Thane district alone, 71 hoi.Jseholds
   (19.1     per    cent of 371 households in    the district)   reported   the
   facility. To what extent is the profile of these households different
   from that of those who do not have latrines 7

   The following summary of selected characteristics of                     households         in
   Thane district is interesting.

          None of the households surveyed in Thane district had any private tap
          water connection.

          Apparently,  ownership of TVs, houses with stronger walls              and cash
          incomes more than 15000 seem to be the most discriminating             variables
          from among those considered.

  5. rr   PRATIG'ES OF NON-USERS OF LATRINES

          Questions were asked to the household respondents concerning the
          places of defecation. The percentage response concerning the places
          frequented_ by children, men and women are tabulated below   (Table
          5' 5).

                    River/stream             12.5          27.2           17.9
                    In open spaces            9.6          16.9           18.7
                    Others                    6.2           8.3           13.6


          The   table reveals the general unhygenic surroundings of         the
          households. As many as 40 per cent households reported that the
          children defecate near the house which indicates bad hygiene. If we
          take into aecount that it is likely to be an underestimat.e and that
          even the children in those households which have latrine facilities
          also defecate in the open, one is not surprised with the POs findings
          that most roads in the villages are seen to be defecated on,       by
          children if not cleaned by natural scavengers i.e. pigs.

          Defecating in the distant places is naturally more common among
          adults than children, and the farms seem to be the most convenient
          places for this purposes. The banks of rivers/streams come next,
          polluting the wate:t· in the process. The "open spaces", with wh~t t.ever
          shelter that is available,       are also used for the purpose of
          defecation by adults.

5.7.1     The latrine practices are more vividly        described by the POs.        Their
          observations can be summarised as below

              (i)   The practice of covering of excreta by mud is rarely 'ollowed.
                    The importance of this is not known to the villagers.


          *   In fact, even after explaining the importance of this practice,
              the persons were reluctant to accept it, saying that it would make
              them difficult to identify the dirty spots and there would be a
              risk of trampling over them.


                                               74
         (ii)     Although the men/women prefer to go to distant places in     the
                  day-time,  this practice is not strictly observered in       the
                  night or by the sick people.

        {iii)     Generally, for cleaning purposes, water in a small pot
                  (approximately of 1 litre capacity) is carried to the place of
                  defecation. If it is not available, any material (like leaves,
                  stone, etc.) is used.

         (iv)     Although most households reported washing hands/feet after
                  defecation, it is not adequate. The use of soap/ash is rarely
                  made. At best,    some mud is applied to the hands bef <::.'l'e
                  washing,  if water is adequately available. If water is not.
                  available, the leaves are used for wiping the hands.

  5.8   REQUIREMENT OF LATRINE
                                 .\
        The requirement of latrines was assessed t-hrough questions ( 1 ike "do
        you need lat1·ines") and also by enquiring into their willingness t.o
        pay for the construction and maintenance of latrines.       Since the
        knowledge of one or two-pit latrines was found to be lacking in the
        pilot survey, the interviewers were asked to provide this knowledge
        at a specific stage of interview with the help of pictures and
        posters and then repeat some questions. The latter response was
        called "aided" while the initial response, before t.he knowledge was
        imparted,  called "u.naided". These questions were asked to 2f.>50 non-
        users of latrines.
5.8.1   The conclusion of this analysis can be presented as follows :

        A)   To the direct question : "Do you need latrines ?", 77 per cent of
             the respondents answered affirmatively. Gender-wise, 80 per cent
             of the malr~ respondents and 72 per cent of the female respondents
             answered     affirmately.   The   difference   is    statistically
             significant. The lower response on the part of women is somewhat
             puzzling and tends to refute the hypothesis that "women feel the
             need of latrines more than men."
             According to the interviewers (especially the lady interviewers)
             and the POs, these responses are influenced by the follov1ing
             ~~onsiderations.

                 i)   Women feel that with the construction of latrines, they
                      will have to shoulder additional responsibilities         of
                      maintenance and cleaning. In fact, many women, while t.:.hey
                      can clean the houses, clothes and utensils,        are not
                      prepared to undertake this "dirty" responsibility.

                ii)   The expof:H.l.re to the plJ.blic latrines at places like ST
                      stands has created a resentment more among women than men
                      because at such places, women are forced t,o use t.hese
                      lat1·ines while men can avoid them if they want t-o do so.
             iii)     Women are so accustomed to the use of open spaces that
                      they do not want to change their practices. Men,     on the
                      other hand, are likely to be more inclined to change


                                            75
      iv)   Women are more cost-conscious than men and have their
            priorities on other aspects like water,    food,  clothing,
            houses and education than latrines. Probably there is a
            difference in these preferences between women and men. This
            has   also been reflected in their responses on         the
            willingness to pay.

B)   38.6 per cent of the respondents are not willing to pay anything
     towards the capital cost of the construction of latrines. Gender-
     wise, these percentages are 33.3 per cent for male and 49.6 per
     cent   for female respondents.     Again these differences    are
     statistically significant indicating that relatively more men are
     prepared   to   pay towards latrine construction than women.
     Although,  ultimately, the finances might be controlled by men,
     there is some evidence that women might put up some resistance.
     The same level of differences are seen in the gender-wise
     responses on the willingness to pay for construction cost,  which
     are   statistically    significant and   which   indicate   lower
     willingness on tho part of women.

C)   On the ownership of desired latrines, 72.4 per cent (of those
     respondents who wanted lat1·1nes) preferred private, while 20.7
     per cent opted for the public/cNnmunity latrines Gender-wise,
     76.8 per cent of male respondents opted for private while 62 per
     cent female respondents opted for private. Here again the gender-
     wise difference are statistically significant and indicate a
     possibility of the women respondents not willing to opt for
     cleaning and maintenance of their latrines. This, it should be
     noted,  is an 'aided'    response,  indicating that the     women
     respondents have not sufficiently been convinced about the
     advantages of the latrines.

D)   As far as the types of latrines were concered, 39 per cent of the
     respondents (who desired to have latrines) preferred one/two pit
     latrines and an almost equal number (viz.        41.5 per cent)
     preferred to have septic or flush types of latrines.

     Here again, there are marked difference in the response between
     male and female respondents. 41 per cent of male respondents
     opted for one/two pit latrines while 34.7 per cent of female
     respondents opted for such latrines. Conversely, 39 per cent of
     male respondents opted for septic/flush latrines while the
     percentage of female respondents preferring these latrines was
     47.2.  The gender-wise differences are statistically significant
     and indicate that women have yet to be convinced about the
     advantages of one or two pit latrines, especially concerning the
     troubles involved in maintenance and cleaning them. Again,  this
     was an "aided" ref:!ponse.

E)   Concerning the location of latrinef:!, only 3 per cent preferred
     within the houf:!e, 58 per cent very near the house, and 26 per
     cent preferred the latrine to be located ~ithin 100 ft.  (around
     30 meters) of the house. There were no gender-wise differences,
     in this regard. This again was the "aided" response.



                                  76
         F)   On the direct question of willingness to maintain and clean
              latrines themselves 86 per cent respondents (of those desiring to
              have   latrines}   replied affirmatively.    Gender-wise,   these
              percentages were 87.9 for male respondents and 83.3 for female
              respondents. Again the gender differences were statistically
              significant, confirming that a relatively smaller number of women
              respondents are willing to take up the responsibility of cleaning
              latrines. This was again, an "aided" recall.

         G)   When asked whether the use of public/community latrines would be
              made by the respondents, 34.7 per cent respondents replied
              affirmatively.  There was no difference in the        gender-wise
              responses.
         H)   57.5    per cent respondents replied affirmatively that       t.he
              public/community latrines will be used by all. Again, here, there
              was no difference, in the gender wise response . . pa

         I)   In the pilot study to assess demand for latrines, it was observed
              that two villages from sangli district reported their willingness
              to share latrines among limited number of households.       Taking
              clue from this,      we asked 3 specific questions      to    2711
              households during the main study.

              The following points emerged

              Nearly one third of the households covered have shown their
              willingness    to    share latrines    among   their   neighbouring
              households.    When asked about t-he amont they were willing to
              spend monthly for sharing latrines, they indicated that Rs.6 per
              month was the average amN:tnt they were willing      to spend for
              this.    The most common range of payment was between Rs.3 and 20
              per month per h!)Usehol(l.   About 7 3 per cent of the households
              reported that all the members of theit• households would u_se suc.h
              shared latrines.      This clearly indicates that there is good
              scope for w6rking out strategy for those households who are
              unable to construct their own latrines but are willing to pay
              on regu.lar basis. b

fi1. 9   WILLINGNESS TO PAY FOR LATRINE

         We have already commented on the number of l"espondents who were not
         willing to pay for the capital cost of construction of latrines. This
         section probes a little deeper into this question because, it could
         reflect the true 'demand' picture for latrines. The tabulations are
         given in Tables 5.6 and 5.7.

         The question was asked to understand willingness to pay both for the
         capital cost and maintenance cost. (Unaided and Aided)

         After the information was given, there was a slight,   statistically
         not significant, decrease in the number of respondents who were
         unwilling to contribute any amount and there was a corresponding
         increase in the number of respondents willing to pay more than Rs.
         1500/. However, by and large, there is no significant change in the
         response. The bulk of respondents are either not willing to pay
         anything (37 per cent) or are willing to pay below Rs. 500  (40 per
         eent).

         Here also, there is a slight rise in willingness to pay with aided
         recall; but the overall trend remains the same. Most respondents are
         unwilling to contribute (35 per c~nt) or contribute upto Rs. 20 (53
         per cent} per month, towards maintenance expenditure.

>. 1"0   DEMAND   FOR LATRINES
         The   above analysis indicates that while,      theoretically,   each
         household would require a latrine, there is very little felt need
         for latrines. The demand is therefore more clearly brought out in the
         willingness to pay for the capital cost of latrines.

         In estimating demand therefore, two factors are considered
         willingness to pay for the latrine;:;, as also the capacity of the
         hou;:;eholds to pay the amount.



                                            78
The factor of   willingness was assessed from the respondents reply to
the question    concerning this aspect. All the respondents answering
the question    affirmatively and willing to pay at least Rs. 1 were
considered to   be demanding the private latrine.
The factor of capacity to pay was assessed on the basis of the
respondents possession of either a radio or a bicycle. Since both
cost more than Rs.      500/-, it was assumed that the respondent
possessing any of these assets is in a position to spend for the
capital expenditure required for a private latrine. It was also seen
that the possession of these assets was closely related both to the
existing latrine users,     as well as to the cash income of the
respondents. Only· those households therefore, who were willing to pay
and had either of these two assets, were considered for estimating
demand for private connections.
The demand includes all types of latrines, viz. One and two pit,
flush and septic. If only two-pit latrines are to be provided, those
asking for flush and septic latrines will have to be persuaded to opt
for the two-pit latrines. A separate analysis only for two-pit
latrines is also enclosed. These figures are quite low as compared to
the demand for all types of latrines, and indicate the amount of
extension required t1:> do this persuasion.

The total demand is presented in Table 5.8 and 5.9. The demand is
given for various levels of the respondents willingness to pay,
separately for advanced and backward       castes. The figures are
expressed as percentages of households in the project villages. The
results suggest that 16.9 per cent of households in all districts
taken together are willing to pay at least Rs. 500 for latrines (all
types). The corresponding percentage for those demanding only one or
two-pit latrines is 6.9 per cent.

The demand schedules vary between advanced and backward castes.    The
latter are generally lower than the former.
It is also seen that the demand varies from village to village. The
type of latrines demanded by the households also varies, depending on
the location of the villages. This aspect is discussed in the final
chapter.

         ROLE OF VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS AND COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION

6. 1   BACKGROUND
       The role of voluntary organisations in the process of development has
       now been well recognised.     There are a few thousand voluntary
       organisations in the country, working in important fields            of
       development and with the poor and socially deprived sections of
       society. Research studies available on this subject indicate that
       voluntary organisations have made significant contributions          in
       improving our understanding of the development process as well as in
       enhancing it. The strength of voluntary organisations lies in their
       dedication, flexible and innovative approaches, capacity to reach the
       otherwise inaccessible sections of society, and in organising and
       conscientising them. Efforts of voluntary organisations have br('.Jiught
       the hitherto neglected and depressed classes in the main-stream of
       the development process and have helped them considerably in taking
       the benifits of development programmes. Limitations of voluntary
       organisations have also been laid bare. By and large, activities of
       voluntary organisations have remained severely localised.       Their
       financial conditions are very precarious.      Efforts to build up
       networks have achieved only very limited success. Relations with the
       bureaucracy, political parties and leaders at all levels, have llOt
       always been cordial. In spite of this, the voluntary sector has g~)Wn
       and expanded; their number is increasing and so also more var.lous
       kinds of organisations are coming into existence. Realising the
       important role they can play, the government has in the recent past,
       taken   certain decisions for securing their collaboration          and
       participation in implementing development programmes in important
       fields like health, education, social forestry, development of land
       and irrigation and especially in the upliftment of the rural poor.

       The proposed 'water supply and latrine ' programme is one of the
       important development programmes, in the implementation of which
       involvement of voluntary organisations would be very crucial. The
       preceding chapters make it clear that successful implementation of
       the programme depends basically on the preparedness of the villagers
       to operate the schemes efficiently, on a long term basis. Organising
       and educating villagers is very essential, as a first ~tep in this
       regard. This is a difficult task and has to be handled with the help
       of   concentrated   action   by   Government   agencies,    voluntary
       organisations of all kinds, and financial institutions. It seems that
       voluntary   organisations   will have to play a       leading   role,
       appropriately supported by other agencies.

6.2    TYPES   OF ORGANISATION
       Voluntary organisations are of varied kinds,        differing from each
       other in terms of ideology, objectives, methods, and procedures of
       work and fields of activity. We need not go into the details of thi~.
       For the purpose of the 'water supply and sanitation'         project,    it
       would be convenient to make two categories of voluntary organisations
           Regional     and village organisations.      The    former   includes
       organisations which serve an area larger than a single village,        and
       which have specific goals and objectives.           The latter includes
       organisations which emerge at the initiative of local villagers BJld
       whose aci vi ties are confined to the village of origin and are mon-t~ly
       informal.      The   youth organisations,   ( tarun    mandals)   women.'~)



                                        82
      organisations (mahila manclals), groups of devotional song singeJ
      (bhajani mandals), etc., are illustrations of the latter type.

      In the present study, we made an effort to understand the role
      voluntary organisations in the village development process and car
      to the conclusion that both these kinds of organisations aJ
      potentially capable of playing an effective role in implementir
      water, sanitation and latrine programmes. Apart from studying a fE
      examples in some detail, we tried to gather basic information fr<
      about 450 regional organisations, out of which 39 responded.    AftE
      sc:rutinising this information, we listed 31 organisations which >
      thought can be approached for participating in the programme.     Tl
      list is enclosed. Needless to state that the list is not exhaustivE
      it only indicates that a sufficient number of voluntary organisatior
      can be indentified and their collabaration elicited, if we agree 1
      use their services in the task. The village organisations are qui1
      numerous. Each and every village has its own Tarun and MahiJ
      mandals, and similar organisations. By and large, they are passi\
      and make their presence felt on certain occasions like election~
      religious ceremonies, and some crisis - social or economic.

6.3   MAITREYI -A CASE STUDY
      The manner in which both kinds of organisations can work hand in har
      in   regard to WSL programme can be made clear with           a    f~
      illustrations. The activists of Maitreyi, a voluntary organisatic
      with headquarters at Bombay are devoted to work for improvir
      conditions and status of women in Indian society.   They decided
      work with rural women in a few villages ( Kurali,       Bahul, Solt
      Kharabwadi, Dhanor in Khed taluka, of Pune district). The activisi
      being interested in sanitation wanted to explore whether the wom(
      would welcome    latrine construction programme in their respecti~
      villages.  The response was encouraging. Women as well as men showf
      keen interest, but voiced their prejudices, doubts and difficultie~
      A series of discussions-meetings were organised,        in order 1
      understand these doubts and difficulties, it was found that villageJ
      felt
        i)   that a latrine would cost not   less than Rs. 10,000/-;
       ii)   that latrines   required lots of space, which   they     could      n(
             spare.

      iii)   that day to day maintenance would involve cost,        time   and
             large quantity of water.

       iv)   and that for construction of latrines, technical and      financi1
             support is not available.

      All these and other points were taken up for detailed disscussion:
      The activists provided information about technical,    financi.Bl a1
      maintenance aspects. They also agreed to make secured financi1
      support, which eventually they received from CAPART. In the toti
      cost of Rs. 2000, CAPART provided a grant of Rs. 1200; and Maitre~
      provided an additional grant of Rs. 300/-. The beneficiaries weJ
      called on to bear expenditure of Rs. 500/- only. As a part of tl
      educational programme,   a visit was arranged to Gandhi Bhavan
      Pune, where a permenant exhibition of different types of latrines h~
      been established, and to Dehu ( Taluka : Haveli, Dist. : Pune ) wheJ
      a medical practitioner turned-social worker constructed more than 4t
      latrines. ( a reference is made to this work in this chapter )
      Maitreyi activists were operating through the local Mahila Mandai.
      Once convinced, members of the Mahila Mandal became active. A few
      members voluntarily completed the spade work such as collection of
      initial contribution, filling in necessary forms etc.   Interaotlon
      among villagers themselves proved to be of crucial importance and
      this became possible primarily through activisation of the Mahila
      l'1andal.
      In a period of 15 months, 55 latrines were constructed, about 40
      percent of which are close to the living rooms. The families are
      maintaining    these   satisfactorily. The   following  important
      observations are made by the activists
      A)   Voluntary   organisations have a crucial role to       play   in
           implementing the scheme. Village level organisations are best
           suited to create a proper atmosphere in the village,     through
           initiating interaction amongst themselves. The role of regional
           organisations is to activise village organisations, provide
           information, and ensure the necessary support         technical,
           financial and moral.

      B)   The demonstration effect is of crucial importance. Visits to Dehu
           and Pune influenced the decisions of villagers to construct
           latrines.  This implies that the educational programme should
           consist of three components :

           a)   Providing information and creating awareness;

           b)   Organising visits   to    sites   where   the    scheme     has   been
                implemented; and

           c)   Assurance of technical and financial back up.
      C)   Although Subsidies facilitate latrine construction, it is not
           true to say that villagers accept latrines only because subsldh:ts
           are available. A majority of the villagers can bear            the
           expenditure; but they cannot pay it in one single installment.
      D)   Acceptance by a few families in the village, influences ~)ther
           families, and the influence spreads to the neighbouring villaQt:H'I
           also. The time and effort required for mobilising and trainipg is
           reduced in the course of time.
      E)   One trained village mason can construct one latrine in five
           days.  In a month he can thus construct six latrines and earn an
           income of Rs. 1800 p.m. A team of four persons, local as far as
           possible, is required for supervision and monitoring the plan for
           five to ten villages.

6.4   JYOTSNA AROGYA PROBODHAN -A CASE STUDY
      At   village   Dehu near Pune, which is one of the        important    cultural
      centr~s.of the.State,two-pit latrines were introduced by one            me~~o~l
      practl tloner ln 1956. He took lead in establishing a village--ba81i!d
      organisation called "Jyostna Arogya Probodhan" and      launched     a
      campaign to persuade people to construct latrines. Being a medical
      practitioner,  it was relatively easy for· him to convince the
      villagers of the need to accept latrines in order to improve health
      environment. He prepared slides to show how most of their ailments
      are due to bad hygiene and that the corrective step is to put a stop
      to the practice of defecating in the open. In carrying out this


                                         84
      campaign, he received active support from Gandhi Smarak Nidhi,  Pune,
      which has done pioneering work in preparing designs of latrine5,
      appropriate to rural conditions. The two organisations together could
      construct about 450 ~atrines in the villages. In the process,     new
      designs were developed,    which were less expensive and could b·::
      adjusted in small spaces. A new design of a bio-gas plant was also
      prepared, which does not have a floating dome.

      The Nidhi was established in 1950 as a fund in memory of Mahatma
      Gandhi,   in order to propagate Gandhian philosophy,       in   which
      sanitation and emancipation of scavengers occupied a central place.
      Mahatma Gandhi was an innovator himself and conducted experiments for
      developing suitable designs. His work was carried on further by his
      followers, notable among whom is Appasaheb Patwardhan. The Nidhi has
      been instrument~l in constructing several lakhs of latrines in thf
      state so far. This is one more example which shows how two types ot
      voluntary organisations
                           ,, can effectively work jointly in this field.

6.5   NAV NIRMAN TRUST : A CASE STUDY

      Experience of the Nav Nirman Trust (Pargaon, Taluka : Daund,     Dist.;
      Pune) is of a different kind. NNT was established formally 1981,    but
      had been working in the region for a longer time,     informally.   The
      village Pargaon was one of the villages included in the list of
      difficult villages ", i.e., villages which suffer from acute shortagE
      of drinking water. The Government had prepared     the Water Supply
      scheme, costing about Rs. 4 lakhs,but its implementation was delayed,
      for   some   reason NNT decided to activise       the    local    youtt
      organisations,   collected   contributions of    Rs.    40,000/-    anc
      pressurised the concerned offices to undertake implementation Qn ar
      urgent basis. In Feb. 1982, the work was completed and the scheme waf
      inaugurated ceremoniously. However, within a couple of hours,       tht
      taps went dry. On investigating, it was found that the scheme wa[
      techinically defective. Villagers were greatly disappointed. In the
      following two years they could do nothing.


      In June 1985, NNT approached the Youth organisations and urged then
      to take some action. The youth organisations approached the Panchaya1
      members to pressurise the concerned Government officials.   To thei1
      surprise, they were told that a new scheme worth Rs. 8.5 lakhs was ir
      the offing. The youth leaders tried to get the details,   which werE
      supplied to them with a good deal of hesitation. The members of thE
      youth organisation, under the guidance of NNT experts, examined thE
      scheme,  and suggested important modifications,      which,   withoui
      altering the overall budget, brought about an integration of foddeJ
      and social forestry schemes with the water supply scheme.         ThE
      modified scheme,   thus,  could meet the fodder,     fuel and wateJ
      requirements of the village. The response from officials was poor
      Since more than one department was involved, the scheme as suggeste1
      by the villagers, could not get approval till June 1989.

6.6   CONCLUSIONS

      The above experience shows that :

      A)   A voluntary organisation can create awareness among villagers
           train and motivate them to pressurise the Panchayat members anr
           Government officials to expedite the process of implementatiol
           of the scheme.
               ,,,_    ·' ··•" ,,,.:.,,.,;in t~ec:hnical matters and encouraged   to
       participate even in the formulation of scheme. It is clear from
       the above account of a few experiences that voluntary action,              if
       initiated and supported properly, facilitates and enhances the
       proces::o.     of      implementation       of     development    programmes
       condsiderably, At present, such efforts are sporadic. What seems
       essential is to devise a strategy which will promote such efforts
       on a large scale and co-ordinate them in an effective manner.              As
       stated       earlier,several kinds of voluntary organisations exist.
       Most of them can be induced to participate in the WSL programme.
       ~or    example,      the     Rotary and Lions clubs would be able to
       provide funds and technical guidance.                Schools,  colleges and
       u11iversities may be able to organise students' camps in villages
       and undertake specific construction work; there are examples of
       students undertaking technical surveys and planning also.               There
       are voluntary organisations set up to provide technical guidance
       in many development programmes. Resources of such organisations
       may also be tapped.             Several industrial houses have          rural
       development programmes. Expertise and resources available with
       them may also be profitably exploited.                  Sugar   co-operative
       industries and other kinds of co-operative organisations may also
       come       forward to extend some support and participate in the
       p:c(,gramme.

       We feel that the Government should explore this field thoroughly,
       identify organisations which would like to participate in the
       programme and prepare a policy-frame to support the programme in
       all possible ways.

                               SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

      This chapter presents the findings, as revealed in the earlier
      chapters,   in a summarised form. The purpose of this chapter is to
      provide a direction towards planning and implementation of the
      proposed water supply and sanitation programme.       The subseque11t
      chapter (chapter VIII) which outlines the strategy, is based mainly
      on these findings.

      It should be noted, at the outset, that these conclusions are not
      merely based on the responses to the household questionnaires. A lot
      of qualitative information in the form of POs'      reports,  village
      schedules,  personal visits and discussions with Government and Non-
      Government   organisations,   have supplemented    the   quantitative
      information collected from the primary and secondary sources. Judging
      the importance of this information, it is our firm conviction    that
      in all the socio-economic surveys of this nature, an equal stress
      needs to be given to the collection and analysis of both qualitative
      and quantitative information. In fact, such information should also
      form an important part of the monitoring system,     proposed to be
      installed for the water supply and sanitation project of the
      Government of Maharashtra.

7.1   SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROFILE
      The sample survey covered 75 villages and 42 hamlets.      All these
      settlements are proposed to be provided with water supply,     either
      through pipes or through borewells from these villages and hamlets
      (called hencefoith as villages), a sample of 2711 households was
      contacted by personal interview method. All the hamlets covered were
      in the bore-water sup~ly projects. The major socio-economic findings
      are given below

      a)   The average population of a village where piped water supply is
           to be provided was more (i.e. 2041) than that of the village
           where borewell water supply will be provided (viz : 741).    The
           average population of a hamlet was 381.

      b)   The major source of supply in all these villages was the dug
           well.  The dependence on natural sources like rivers,    streams,
           etc.,  was very small. Out of the 57 villages where piped water
           supply is to be provided, 14 villages already receive water
           supplied   through the pipes. In these villages,    the proposeJ
           schemes are presently in the nature of augmentat.ion. In further
           11 villages, the borewell was the main source of supply. Out of
           the 60 villages, where the bore -well supply schemes are prop,)sed
           in 4 villages,    there is already a piped water supply in
           existence.




      c)   Around 58 per cent of the total households belonged to t,fle
           advanced communities   (from all regions)    13 per cent    from
           scheduled castes,   2 per cent from scheduled tribes and 27   pt:OH'
           cent from other backward communities. The average size of t.h.::
           household was found to be 6.5.



                                       91
d)    Farming as the principal occupation was reported by 56 per cent
      of the households, followed by agricultural labour (23 per cent.)
      The share of salaried business and professions    increased with
      the size of the village.

e)    Among the farmers,    26 per cent were marginal farmers and a
      further 29 per cent were small farmers.     Thus the number of
      farmers owning less than 2 hectares, formed 55 per cent of the
      total farmers.   The average land holding was 2.4 hectares.
      Irrigation was available for around 40 per cent of the farmers.

f)    The bicycle was found to be the most popular asset owned by the
      households. Around 48 per cent of the households ·contacted, owned
      a bicycle. This was followed by the stove (44 per cent ),    radio
      (42 per cent), TV (11 per cent) and sewing machine (9 per cent).
      Gobar-gas plants were owned by 6 per cent,         while improved
      chullahs were owned     by 4 per cent. Around 60 per cent       of
      households, owned animals (cattle, sheep, goats,etc.)

g)    As far as education was concerned, ten per cent of the households
      had all the members who could neither write nor read.     At the
      other extreme, there were 22 per cent households who had at least
      one member who was educated in a college.

h)    Twelve per cent of the respondents dwelt in huts, while 17 per
      cent in houses built with cement and other permenant materials.

i)    The average annual per capita cash income was Rs. 1325. However,
      more than 67 per cent of the households had per capita income of
      less than Rs. 1000.

j)    More than 90 per cent households reported no cash savings.   Only
      3.5 per cent reported monthly savings of upto Rs.    50,   and a
      further 1.5 per cent between Rs. 50 toRs. 100.

k)    There were significant      correlations   between   several   socio-
      economic variables.

      These were :

        i)   Positive association between population of the village     and
             per capita cash income .

       ii)   Positive association between cash income and house types.

      iii)   Positive   association between cash income and ownership    of
             assets.

       iv)   Positive association between cash income and education.

I )   As compared to the villages included in the piped water supply
      schemes,  those included in the bore~ell scheme showed a lower
      level of socio-economic profile. Thus, in the borewell scheme
      villages,

        i)   The share of farmers was higher.
       ii)   Educational level was lower.
      iii)   Housing conditions were poorer.
       iv)   Annual cash income was lower and
        v)   Monthly savings were lower.
      These villages had, however larger open spaces surrounding the
      households than the piped water supply project villages.    These
      differences were partly due to the lower population size of   the
      borewell project villages.

7.2   PERSONAL AND COMMUNITY HYGIENE
      It would not be entirely incorrect to say that this area is grossly
      neglected so far. Neither the State Government nor the Zilla Parishad
      have paid necessary attention to this aspect so that as years passed
      by and as the population increased, the rural areas have become more
      and more dirty, obnoxious and unhealthy. All the roads leading to the
      village are covered with dirt and excreta; in mansoons, these are
      washed out or even, in some cases, are submerged in the river or
      stream. Flies and mosquitoes are seen everywhere; the waste water
      comes on the roads; gutters, if in existence,       are choked with
      garbage. The garbage pits, in turn, are never cleared in time and
      breed all types of insects. The cattle freely roam the streets.
      Almost without exception, this is the case in all the villages
      surveyed by us. Such a situation is the outcome of sheer neglect
      towards community hygiene. Saints like Gadge Maharaj and leaders like
      Senapati Bapat have graphically described the situation concerning
      village hygiene and called for community action; unfortunately,  very
      little has been done so far in this respect. The situation has
      worsened over the years and if not attended to immediately,     rural
      India will become"a threat to the health of the country.

      It should be noted that merely providing education, health facilities
      and even job opporturlities in rural areas will not be sufficient to
      retain population in the villages. Equally important is the existance
      of a healthy and hygienic environment, in fact, the ultimate aim of
      improving village life should not be just to arrest migration towards
      cities. The objective should be to initiate a process by which the
      urban population is increasingly attracted towards villages.     This
      process must start with improvement in the village hygiene to the
      extent that it be better than urban hygiene.
      Equally important are the aspects of personal hygiene.     Here also,
      precious little has been done or achieved. It has been observed that
      even simple things like washing hands, bathing, washing clothes,
      cleaning utensils etc. are not done regularly or properly.    Hair is
      not cleaned regularly, so that infection of lice spreads in schools.
      All these practices ar.e the result of age-old habits, and steps must
      be taken to educate the people. The most encouraging finding of the
      survey in this regard is the wide coverage obtained by radio/TV and
      the extent of recall of popular advertisements. The use of these
      media could be investigated to promote healthy habits among the rural
      people.

7.3   WATER SUPPLY
      a)   Out of 57 sample villages , which are proposed to be provided
           water through pipes, 33 villages already have a partial supply
           through pipes.   In fact, 8 of these 33 villages reported piped
           water supply as their main source of supply. Similarly, out of
           60 sample villages and hamlets where proposed water supply would
           be through borewells, 14 villages already received piped watex'
           supply.   Only one hamlet of these 14, reported         exclusive
           dependence on piped water supply.

      b)   All villages, other than those which had as piped water supply as


                                       93
     the mainsource, depend on open wells or borewells. The dependence
     on natural sources like rivers or streams for drinking water,
     throughout the year was absent in all the sample households.
c)   The    average distance travelled by a household to a public stand
     post   was around 135 meters. It increased to about 200 meters when
     the    source was a borewell, to around 300 meters, when it was an
     open   well and to 500 meters when it was a river/stream.

d)   The total time spent in fetching water to the household was
     between 60 to 80 minutes a day. This included travel time and
     waiting time. There was no variation in this total time, due to
     the source of water. This was because, shorter distance for the
     piped water (viz. stand post) or at the borewell was compensated
     by the longer waiting time at these sources.
                                            y


e)   Women were mainly involved in fetching water. In the case        of
     stand posts, however, this responsibility was shared by men      in
     a large number of households.

f)   Water was stored in clay containers in all households.       Brass,
     stainless steel and copper came next in terms of usage.
g)   Water brought home was used mainly for drinking, cooking, and
     sundry washing.   Bathing, washing of clothes and washing of
     utensils were done mostly at the source.
h)   Most households used unhygienic methods of storing water and
     taking water from the containers. In the latter case, the methods
     followed involved dipping of hands.

i)   There was a general lack of awareness concerning the purity of
     water.  The water was regarded as pure if its taste         and
     appearance were satisfactory.
j)   Although 46 per cent households reported using some method of
     purifying water (filtering, using chemicals etc.), this figure
     was found to be highly exaggerated from the reports of the
     participant observers.   At the most, the women used their own
     sarees to filter water.
k)   The average per      capita total consumption of water, for all
     purposes, and all   available sources, was estimated at around 35
     litres a day. Out   of this, 10 litres were required for bathing,
     6 for washing of    clothes, 9 for animals (drinking and washing),
     and the remainig    10 litres for drinking, cooking and washing of
     utensils.

1)   This consumption figure pertained to the survey months of July
     and August, when the water was available in plenty. Almost all
     households felt shortages in the summer months when adequate
     water was not available for washing and bathing. Even for
     drinking water, 25 villages and hamlets have reported chronic
     dependence on the arrival of tankers.

m)   There were 63 per cent households (from these sample villages
     which were to be provided with piped water supply) demanding
     house connections. On an average, they were willing to pay Rs.
     268/- for capital expenditure and Rs.       11/-(per month) for
     maintenance. However, when the water supply scheme was explained
     to them, with an expected capital expenditure of Rs. 300 to Rs.
           1000 and monthly maintenance expenses of Rs. 15 to 35 for    private
           connections,  there was a decrease in the number of          persons
           desiring house connections.     The percentage of these      persons
           decreased substantially from 63 per cent to 33 per cent,       while
           the average amount increased from Rs. 268/- to Rs. 312/-     towards
           capital   investments,   and the monthly      maintenance     amount
           marginally from Rs. 10.90 toRs. 10.98.

      n)   Almost all the households were willing to take water from
           stand-posts. However, only 32 per cent households were willing to
           pay for it, with an average amount at Rs. 7.17 per month per
           household. When the scheme of piped water supply was explained to
           them, with an expected amount of Rs. 5 to 15 per month, then the
           proportion dropped to 25 percent, who were willing to pay an
           average amount of Rs. 8.04 per month.

      o)   As far as monthly expenses for the borewell were concerned, there
           were 65 per cent respondents willing to pay for it,      with an
           average amount of Rs. 8.40 per household. When the information
           concerning borewell water supply was provided to the respondents,
           with an expectation of Rs. 3 to Rs. 6 per month per household,
           naturally,  there was a marginal decrease in the per cent
           households willing to pay (which declined from 65 to 61) and in
           the average amount (which declined from Rs. 8.40 toRs. 7.80) per
           household.

      p)   When we consider both the ability and willingnes to pay for a
           private household connection, we find that there are about 17 per
           oent households which are willing to pay Rs. 500 or more towards
           capital expenditure and Rs. 10 per month towards maintenance
           expenditure.   Since the activity is dependent upon ownership of
           assets   and cash income, which is found to be more in larger
           villages (on the basis of population), the initial effort for
           this purpose could be made in such villages. In all other cases,
           the stand-posts could be provided with a monthly charge of Rs.  8
           per household.

      q)   The hypothesis that after giving the information about assured
           water supply and its quality, there would more response for the
           individual connections has not been indicated by the study. This
           is because,   in addition to this information,   the information
           about the capital cost of these connections was also provided,
           and this cost was found to be on the           highside by   the
           respondents.

      r)   There are only two villlages, out of 50, where water was not
           contaminated, whereas in 23 villages all water samples showec
           contamination and in 25 villages at least one sample showec
           contamination.

      s)   Nearly 80 per cent of all water samples were contaminated.     Thiz
           was observed for all types sources of water.

7.4   LATRINES

      a)   Out of 2711 sample households, only 161 households (forming 6 pe1


                                      95
      cent) reported the use of latrines. All the remaining   households
      did n6t use latrines.

b)    The latrines were concentrated only in few villages and within
      these villages,   among few households. The villages where most
      latrines were found had sufficient 8Vailability of water,     and
      were nearer to the large cities like Bombay. The households using
      latrines were distinctly better off in terms of socio-economic
      conditions, as compared to the non-users.

c)    Most of these latrines (around 60 per cent) were of the septic
      type,   followed by the bucket type (20 per cent) and one/two pit
      ( 10 per cent).

d)    A bulk of these latrines      (86 per cent) were    owned     by   the
      households. Only 9 per cent were public latrines.

e)    The non users of latrines frequent places near the farms,    open
      spaces etc. Children defecate near the houses. It was reported by
      the POs' that even the children from latrine using households do
      not necessarily use latrines, although the respondents have not
      reported this to be the case.

f)    Most of the respondents were not aware of the two-pit       latrines,
      their advantages and costs.

g)    Both men and women perceived the need of latrines equally;
      however their scales of preferences varied. The women had a
      rather cautious response since they believed that using latrines
      would add to their responsibilities in the form of fetching of
      more water and cleaning the latrines.
h)    For these reasons, there were limitations in women influencing
      the decisions    concerning the latrines.   However,  women were
      found   to be more influential where there was         sufficient
      availability of water, spread of education, and extension by the
      non governmental organisations.

i)    A majority of respondents (72 per cent) preferred individual
      latrines. The non preference for public/community latrines arose
      from their past experience of community latrines and the lack of
      proper maintenance of the public latrines at places like bus
      stands, railway stations, etc.

j )   The latrines are not preferred inside the house. Only 3 per cent
      of households desired such a location. A majority (i.e.  84 per
      cent) preferred to have latrines near the house,     within the
      distance of 100 ft.

k)    There were 39 per cent households which were not willing to pay
      any amount for latrines. When the information about two-pit
      latrines and their capital cost of Rs. 2000/- was provided to
      them,  this percentage decreased sl ight.ly ·to 37 per cent. A bulk
      of the respondents (41 per cent} were prepared to pay upto Rs.
      500/- and there was no change in this percentage even after
      providing the information. This absence of change was due to


                                 96
           rigid   beliefs   of the respondents and their       scales  of
           preferences.  It was found from the experience of several NGO~.
           that it takes a great deal of time and effort to break these
           attitudanal barriers in the promotion and use of latrine.
      l)   In the existing situation, 17 per cent of households are willing
           to pay at least Rs. 500/- per latrine towards capital cost. These
           are mostly located in large size villages and near the large
           cities.

7.5   ROLE OF NON-GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES
      Maharashtra has earned fame for it's several           non-Governmental
      agencies.   Their involvement is observed to a great extent in water
      supply programmes. Some agencies and individuals have also done
      commendable work in the construction        of latrines. They have,
      however, not done much in the field of hygiene. The non-Governmental
      agencies are, however, working at the grass root level and they can
      be extremely useful in changing attitudes and initiating behavioral
      changes. There are also other voluntary agencies wich can render
      financial    assistance.   The   resources   of   the    GOM    can   be
      augumented if these agencies are also involved in the programmes. The
      general   impre~sion   of these NGOs about the working          of   the
      Governmental Departments is not favourable. Several instances of
      complicated    and   tedious procedures, delays,      red-tapism    and,
      corruption have been cited by the NGOs. However if proper moti vat. ion
      is provided to them, the NGOs can become the strength of Maharashtra
      and aid in rapid infrastructral development of the state in the
      fields of water supply, hygiene and latrine construction.

C. Latrines
                                      Increasing awareness concerning
                                      health aspects of latrines.

                                      Increasing awareness concerning
                                      two-pit latrines.

                                      Constructing private two-pit
                                      latrines

All these areas require urgent and integrated attention. At present,
the Zilla Parishads and the Village Panchayats are entrusted with the
responsibilities in the fields of water supply and hygiene at the
community levels. However, their performance in these respects has
been rather unsatisfactory. If we have to improve living conditions
in villages, it is not sufficient to provide electricity, roads and
job opportunities there. It is equally necessary to provide cleaner
habitat and hygienic conditions both within and outside one's place
of residence. The entire village level activity, therefore, needs tc
be toned up, and the Government has to provide training and extension
input in this regard, in a sustained fashion.

There are instances of wrong planning in the water supply· programme,
duplication, favouritism, political interference, lack of maintenance
and construction of facilities like latrines without considering the
needs and attitudes of the beneficiaries.

There are several instances, where the facilities that have been
created remain unused or misused. The Government administration will
have to renew its efforts and take action in a much more professional
manner in all these areas. Some of the most urgent tasks that it can
undertake in this regard are :

  i)   Regenerati6n of all the existing wells which are      not     useable
       for a variety of reasons.

 ii)   Collection of water charges from all the beneficiaries.

iii)   Ensuring purity of water at all sources of drinking         water   in
       villages.

 iv)   Evolving technologies for the low-cost disposal methods and for
       recycling of household wastes/waste water/solid wastes.

 v)    Immediate repair of all pipes, wherever necessary.



                                99
      These actions should be undertaken concurrently with the proposed
      water supply and sanitation programmes in the project villages.

      As far as extension of knowledge and change in attitudes is
      concerned, the efforts of the Government will not be adequate. This
      is more so in the fields of hygiene and latrines. It will have to
      take the support of the Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). The
      scope of this support is discussed in the next section.

8.2   ROLE    OF     NON- GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS
      As we have seen in the      earlier chapters, Maharashtra is fortunate in
      having a large number       of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and
      progressive   minded        individuals engaged in     rural   development
      activities. These NGOs      can be classified into three main types as :
      a)     Village-level    individuals with progressive attitudes,     like
             doctors,   teachers, sarpanchs, traders etc. who either through
             individual    efforts   or with the backing of      the  village
             organisations, initiate the development processes.
      b)     Village-level organisations like Women's organisations, Youth
             organisations, 'Bhajani Mandals'  etc., which pool    individual
             resources,   create    awakening and   initiate programmes    of
             developmental activities.

      c)     The agencies outside the village which include

               i )    Individual social workers
              ii)     Registered voluntary agencies
             iii)     Co-operative sugar factories
              iv)    'co-operative dairy societies
               v)     Industrialists/industries
              vi)     Charitable organisations like the Rotary club, Lions   Club,
                      other trusts etc.
             vii)     International organisations like ,UNICEF, UNDP, etc.

      Some of these outside agencies are merely financing agencies which
      provide the required financial assistance to the agencies/individuals
      which are actively working in the rural areas.
      As a first step, the Government should prepare through field surveys,
      an exhaustive list of all the agencies/institutions        which are
      working in the rural areas. To the extent the scope of the present
      survey permitted, we have prepared a partial list for the sample
      villages,   giving   the   names of    the   village   level   active
      individuals/organisations. Naturally, all the villages do not have
      such agencies or individuals. But those which already have them are
      placed in a more advantageous position and the chances of success in
      implementation of development orientation schemes are better. We,
      therefore, suggest that such a list for all villages (including non-
      project areas) should be prepared by the GOH as early as possible.

      As far as the outside agencies are concerned, a partial list of
      individual social workers and registered voluntary agencies has been


                                          100
        prepared   by us and the description of their activities          anr
        willingness to get into the work involved has been obtained for thost
        agencies which replied to our questionnaires and those which we
        personally visited.

        Since it is necessary to evaluate these agencies both in terms oJ
        their willingness/capacity (as also in terms of their organisatiol
        and mangement),  a comprehensive study of these agencies is calle(
        for.

        In addition to these agencies, there are agencies like co-operativf
        societies, dairy co-operatives, industries, etc., which undertake
        good deal of developmental activities in villages where they arE
        located. The list of these organisations giving details of theiJ
        activities should also be prepared. The procedures of financin~
        adopted by agencies like the Rotary Clubs, Lions Clubs etc.    shoul(
        also be documented and updated, so that their resources can be tappec
        for the proposed project.

        In the following suggestions, it is assumed that all these lists are
        obtained, studied and the various organisations evaluated. However, <
        beginning can be made with whatever information is provided in t.hi ~
        report and available with the GOM.

6.2.1   Involvement~~           in Water Supply
        The requirement of adequate water is a felt need and there is,
        probably, no extension effort required in creating demand for water.
        We, therefore, visualise the involvement of NGOs in the followin~
        areas :

        A)   Village-Level Agencies
               i)   Preferences and conveniences of users.

              ii)   Super''ision of the construction of tube-wells and laying of
                    pipelines and timely reporting in case of delays,    qualit}
                    of construction, etc.

             iii)   Maintenance of wells, pipes, stand-posts and other    source;:
                    of water.

              iv)   Collection of dues.

               v)   Periodic testing of water, both at the source and     at   the
                    consumption level.

        B)   Outside Agencies

               i)   Selection of village-level agencies/individuals for the
                    work relating to superv1s1on, maintenance, cleanliness and
                    purification of water.

              ii)   Extension in the field of health and water-borne     diseases
                    through various media.


                                          101
             iii)   Extension in the field of transport, storage and        handling
                    of water, through demonstration and media.
              iv)   Periodic collection of information concerning incidence         of
                    diseases through household surveys.

               v)   Provision of equipment for testing water,      (including
                    micropscopes) and training the village-level agencies in
                    taking samples.

              vi)   Liaison between GOM/International funding agencies and         the
                    village level agencies, passing the latest know-how            and
                    resource availability.         ·

             vii)   Limited   Research in the field of   . water    borne   diseases,
                    quality   of water,  etc.

        The GOM,   after the selection of outside agencies, should not only
        entrust them with these responsibilities, but should also ask some of
        them to promote vilage level agencies in those villages which do not
        have them.

        As described earlier, the GOM should actively pursue the efforts of
        correlating the efforts of various other financing agencies. For this
        purpose, it should have a close contact with district offices of the
        Rotary Clubs and Lions Clubs, as also with industries and provide
        them guidelines in the selection of villages,       active voluntary
        organisations, with which they can associate themselves and the
        financial and other support required from them. A good deal of public
        relations activity is called for in this regard.

3.2.2   Involvement Qf   ~in      village hygiene
        In the field of hygiene, the entire responsibility can be given             to
        the NGOs.   We visualise that the following responsibilities can            be
        assigned to the NGOs :

        A)   Village-Level NGOs
               i)   Supervision of the maintenance of cleanliness at public
                    places like temples, wells, stand-posts, public latrines,
                    etc.

              ii)   Extension in the field of personal hygiene.

             iii)   Promotion of soak pits, gobar-gas       plant     conversion    of
                    manure from household wastes.

        B)   Outside NGOs

               i)   Training and extension to the village-level NGOs          through
                    different media.

              ii)   Visits to villages, on the spot inspection and guidance         to
                    the Panchayat, village NGOs and people.


                                          102
             iii)   Liaison   with   financial   institutions/Government    for
                    subsidies, material requirements and schemes available.

8.2.3   Involvement Qf   ~in     Latrine   ~rogramme~

        The first task for the GOM is to construct individual household
        latrines whereever they are demanded and wherever the benefiaciaries
        are willing to bear part of the capital expenditure required for this
        purpose. If the percentages obtained in the survey are applied to all
        the project beneficiaries, around 5000 households belonging to the
        backward community are willing to pay a minimum of Rs. 500 and around
        15000 households belonging to advanced communities are willing to pay
        Rs.lOOO for constructing their own latrines. In other words,around
        20000 households can be provided with individual latrines, if the GOM
        provides a total of Rs. 225 lakhs as subsidy towards construction of
        latrines.  This assumes that the average cost of construction of an
        individual latrine is Rs. 2000.

        These households are,    dispersed and spread over many villages.
        Moreover, the construction of these latrines will satisfy the need of
        only 5.8 per cent of the households in the project areas.      If we
        assume that around 5 per cent of the households already have/use
        latrines, it means that it is still necessary to reach 90 per cent of
        the households.    This would require construction of around 3 lakh
        latrines in the project villages alone. This is a big task    because
        there is neither a significant 'felt' need for latrines,       nor a
        willingness to pay for them. A good deal of extension work is
        obiviously required in these households about the construction of
        latrines.

        The   involvement of outside NGOs in this task is          therefore,
        unavoidable. This involvement is necessary also because the extension
        in the field of latrines is more of a personal nature and the target
        group/person would vary from village to village and from household to
        household. The flexibility required for the extension, is not likely
        to be provided by the Government machinery.

        The experience of the NGOs working in this field indicates that
        around 6 to 15"visits to the village are required to identify the
        local village-level target groups, hold discussions with them and
        create awareness.   In other words, creating a felt need among the
        first say, 20 to 30 bouseholds in a village, requires an extension
        time of around 3 months for a team of 2 volunteers. Hopefully, if the
        latrines so constructed are properly used,       they will have     a
        multiplier effect without requiring additional extension effort.

        The involvement of outside voluntary agencies in the field of latrine
        construction will thus be :

        a)   To identify the target group/persons in the village

        b)   Provide extension service and training

        c)   Construct around 100 latrines a year with the help of a team of 2
             volunteers.


                                           103
      d)   Supervise the construction and use of ,,latrines.

      e)   Liaison with Government agencies, material supplying agencies and
           masons during/after the construction of latrines.

      In terms of simple arithmetic, thus, to cover 1000 project villages
      in one year,    we will require 250 teams of volunteers.      If the
      programme is to be spread over 5 years,        f>O teams of trained
      volunteers will be needed. The above figures are quoted only to
      provide the dimension of efforts required. They require to be firmed
      up with a detailed feasibility study.     Further,  they cover only
      project villages and exclude a very large area of non project
      villages where the need for hygiene and latrines is equally urgent.

8.3   ORGANISATIONAL REQUIREMENTS
      The task associated with the three activities of water supply,
      hygiene and latrines is, thus, a multi-agency task and the GOM will
      have to play a very important and crucial role of financing and co-
      ordinating the activities of various agencies.

      At present, the construction of piped-water supply in a village is
      the responsibility of MWSSB for larger schemes and     of the Zilla
      Parishad for the smaller schemes. ZPs are also responsible for the
      maintenance of the schemes and the Grampanchayat is supposed to look
      after the recovery of water charges.      As far as borewells are
      concerned,   GSDA   is responsible for their      construction,  the
      Grampanchayat/Zilla Parishad for maintenance and the Grampanchayat
      for the recovery of water charges. The village drainage construction
      is the responsibility of the Zilla Parishad and its maintenance is
      the responsibility of the Grampanchayat. The Grampanchayat is also
      responsible for the village cleanliness. The soak-pits are to be
      constructed and maintained by the individuals at their own cost.

      In the case of latrines, an individual beneficiary has to take the
      lead in approaching the Zilla Parishad for receiving subsidy.     The
      subsidy of Rs. 200/- (Rs. 450/-for SC/ST) is given to the beneficiary
      by  the Zilla Parishad, along with a pan after the construction upto
      plinth level is completed. The contribution of the Zilla Parishad
      (viz.  Rs. 175/-) towards the subsidy is given by the Zilla Parishad
      after the construction of the latrine is complete.

      The role of voluntary agencies at present is to motivate people and
      enable them to approach the authorities like the Zilla Parishad,   for
      taking the benefit of subsidies. In all the cases reported to us, the
      delay in inspection, reporting and disbursement on the part of the
      Government agencies was found to be the major factor discouraging the
      large-scale   involvement   of NGOs in these      tasks.   In    these
      circumstances, the experiences of Gujarat during the last two years
      in implementing the latrine programme (which was assisted by the
      World Bank) is worth noting. The chief features of this experiences
      are

      a)   The Government of Gujarat     (GOG)  undertook a programme     of
           constructing 20,000 latrines in rural areas in three years (1989-
           1992)


                                       104
b)   This programme was handed over,     for implementation,   by the
     Gujarat   Water Supply and Beverage Board (GWSSB),       to  the
     Enviromental Sanitation Institute, Ahmedabad (ESI), a volunt.ary
     organisation whose Director has been Shri. Ishwarbhai Patel.

c)   The selection of NGOs for the village-wise implementation of the
     programme was done by ESI. Ultimately, 48 NGOs participated in
     implementation.

d)   These NGOs selected villages and the beneficiaries.

e)   ESI provided necessary training to

       i)   NGOs
      ii)   GWSSB
     iii)   Village panchayat staff/village people
      iv)   Masons"

f)   ESI prepared and ]distributed pamphlets, forms and posters to     the
     NGOs.            '

g)   NGOs were completely responsible for the site selection of
     latrines,   construction and  recovery of  dues  from   the
     beneficiaries.

h)   NGOs were supplied material and finance by the ESI        after the
     former submitted the required documents and after the     inspection
     of these documents by the ESI.

i)   The cost of each latrine constructed was Rs. 2357. Out of this,
     Rs.  100 were paid to ESI for supervision and guidance, Rs.   100
     to the NGO for supervision and implementation, Rs. 100 to the
     beneficiary and Rs. 57 to GWSSB for supervision and monitoring.

j)   For meeting the remaining cost of the latrine {viz. Rs.  2000/-),
     a grant in aid was paid to Harijans, Adivasis and economically
     backward castes at Rs. 1500/- and Rs. 1000/- to others,      per
     latrine. Thus, the own contribution of the beneficiaries towards
     the cost of construction was Rs. 500 in the case of backward
     castes and Rs. 1000 in the case of advanced castes.

k)   GWSSB provided ESI with funds in advance to pay the NGOs.     ESI
     paid to NGOs on the basis of actual work done by them,      after
     physical verification.   Household beneficiaries were paid the
     subsidy by the NGO and copies of vouchers were sent by the NGO to
     ESI and Board office.

1)   It was reported that under this programmes,    upto April 1990,
     through 48 NGOs 12, 626 latrines were constructed in 3 7 6 vi llageE.
     from 46 blocks. Of these, 10354 latrines were for Harijans,
     Adivasis and economically backward households.      Further,      820
     latrines were under construction. ESI expected to cover the
     target of 20,000 latrines before March 1991.




                                 105
      Although critical evaluation of these efforts is yet to be made, the
      available reports indicate that the achievement of Gujarat in the
      construction of latrines is indeed impressive. This success is
      attributed to the following factors

      a)     Complete absence of red-tapism;

      b)     Freedom to the ESI in selecting the NGOs and in laying down the
             procedures and to NGos in selecting villages/beneficiaries and in
             implementating the programme.

      c)     Precise demarcation    of functions and responsibilities   of   GOG,
             GWSSB, ESI and NGOs.
      d)     A simple and straightforward information ahd reporting system.

      e)     A large amount of subsidy given to the beneficiaries. It should
             also be noted that ESI and NGOs concentrated only on the
             construction of latrines and did not attend to the hygiene
             aspects. Maharashtra, unfortunately, does not have an agency like
             ESI.   It will also not be practicable to accord any one NGO, the
             status of an ESI and ask other NGOs to report to it.       At the
             same time, in order to minimise the administrative delays, it is
             necessary to implement the programmes through one agency. We,
             therefore,   make the following recommendations for implementing
             the programmes.

8.4   RECOMMENDATIONS
      A.     The GOM should create an independent,    state-level autonomous
             agency ( called hereafter as Nodal Agency ) on the lines of ESI.
             It should have sufficient financial and administratative powers
             to work independent of the Zilla Parishad, MWSSB and other
             existing agencies.

      B.     The staff of this agency should consist of young and dynamic
             persons drawn on deputation from other departments/ offices.
             Experienced persons working in other voluntary agencies could
             also be apporached to work for this agency either as permanent
             members or as Experts/ consultants/ trainers.
      r
      '-'.   Initially the Nodal Agency should work only for the project
             villages;  its scope, however, is expected to cover all villages
             in the state, in due course of time.

      D.     The functional areas of the Nodal Agency should include

             a)   Supervision and monitoring the regeneration of existing water
                  supply sources.

             b)   Supervision and monitoring the construction of the    proposed.
                  water supply schemes.

             c)   Creating   awareness among Village Panchayats/ villagers
                  concerning the importance of purity of water,   personal
                  hygiene and community hygiene.


                                         106
     d)   Construction of household two pit latrines.
     e)   Monitoring of the entire programme of water supply,   hygien-:
          and   latrines,   taking corrective actions    and    send in[
          periodical reports to the GOM.
E.   The Nodal Agency will work entirely through the NGOs.    It wilJ
     identify and select the NGOs in each district and provide then
     necessary ·training. The Nodal Agency will be responsible fo1
     creating, training and extension material as also for givin€
     publicity through state/ district level media.     It will alsc
     evolve the necessary criteria, and procedures for selecting NGO~
     assessing their performance, disbursing funds to them         anc
     preparing the reporting/ monitoring system. A visit of thE
     officers of the Nodal Agency to ESI in Ahmedabad for this purposE
     is strongly recommended.

F.   The NGOs will work as far as possible, through the village-leve1
     agencies.   If the latter agencies are not in existence, the NGOf
     should try to create them by identifying suitable persons, and b~
     doing the necessary extension. It should be emphasised to thE
     NGOs that, if the sustained impact of all these efforts is to bE
     achieved, all the efforts should be made through the villagf'
     level   organisations    only.   The   involvement   and    active
     participation of the Village Panchayat should also be sought by
     the NGOs.
G.   While the ,regeneration and construction of the water supply
     scheme is not the responsibility of the NGOs ( although theil
     supervision and monitoring does form one of their functions), the
     construction of two pit latrines will be the responsibility of
     the NGOs. Similarly, providing assistance in the construction of
     soak pits will be the reponsibility of the NGOs.
H.   The NGOs    will be free to identify their villages. They alsc
     identify masons for constructing latrines and sources of supply
     of materials.
I.   The NGOs should prepare a status report on each of the selected
     villages and prepare, in consultation with the Nodal Agency, a
     time bound action programme. The Nodal Agency should pay the NGC
     for preparing the status report.

J.   All the disbursements to the NGOs should be made by the Nodal
     Agency directly. They should not depend on any clearances, etc.
     from other departments or agencies.

K.   The disbursments to the NGOs should be made on the basis of their
     achievements of the action plan.

L.   It would be better if an officer in the Nodal Agency is assigned
     a specific    di~trict  so that he/she can co-ordinate all the
     activities (both of the Governmental agencies as also of NGOs)
     within the district and be responsible for the achievement in the
     district. He/she will, however, have to spend much of his/heT
     time in travelling within the district.

                                 107
M.   Separate   cells   within    the agency will look        after

     a)   Preparation of training, extension and publicity              material.

     b)   Conducting   training   programmes   for   MWSSB    officers,
          Panchayat officers, NGOs village level workers, and masons.

     c)   Providing publicity through various press and audio-                   visual
          media, arranging visits of villagers to demonstration                  sites,
          holding conferences/ meetings, etc.

     d)   Identifying   the   sources   of supply  for                 items   like
          pans,  pipes,  etc.  and arranging for their                adequate and
          timely supplies to the NGOs.

     e)   Planning,   monitoring,     reporting     and     evaluation      of       the
          programmes.

     f)   Liaison with institutions granting              financial        assistance
          (like UNICEF, Rotary cl.ub, etc.)

N.   The payment to NGOs         by the Nodal     Agency     could    be     for     the
     following activities

     Rate of Payment

     a)   Preparing the Status Report for                        Rs.200/- per

     c)   Arranging awareness camps for                          Rs.300/- per

     These rates are only suggestive. These can be             finalised           after
     consultation with NGOs.


                                    108
      0.   In addition, the Nodal Agency may also consider giving prizes for
           substantial achievements.
           We suggest the follwing indicative prizes:
           i)   Achievement .in community hygiene

                Each village should submit a hygiene report in the prescribed
                form every year. An Assesment Team,      appointed for each
                Tahsil,   should visit the village, assess the progress and
                give scores on each pre-determined item.     10 top ranking
                villages,   on the basis of total village scores,  should be
                visited by the Nodal Agency, which should select three
                villages in each district for the award of village hygiene.
                These awards could be:

                JLirst   £:t:i~e   Rs. 5000/-   to the Village   Panchayat   and
                                   Rs. 3000/-   to its NGO.

                Second £rize       Rs. 3000/- to the Village     Panchayat   and
                                   Rs. 2000/- to its NGO.

                Ihird Prize        Rs. 2000/- to the Village     Panchayat   and.
                                   Rs. 1000/- to its NGO.

      Similarly, all the village scores could be aggregated for a Tahsil.
      The first three top ranking Tahsils in the state could be awarded the
      prizes of Rs.10000/-, Rs.7000/- and Rs.3000/- and they could be given
      to the Taluka Panchayat.

      These prizes would motivate both the Village Panchayats and Taluka
      Panchayats to implement better water supply schemes, to provide safe
      drinking water and to maintain village hygiene.

8.5   MOTIVATING THE VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS
      Involvement of the NGOs in this task will require a considerable
      amount of motivation. Several NGOs are personality oriented, have
      their own styles of working and, also their own ideas of development.
      These ideas are, many a time, a product of their experiences in their
      specific areas of operations. It is better to respect these ideas and
      allow them to follow their own course in the extension and execution
      of the projects. It is therefore, necessary to see that the Nodal
      Agencies or the Government departments initiating these programmes,
      do not dictate their own terms or become 'bosses' of the voluntary
      agencies. Their role should be purely administrative and          co-
      ordinating. Since the importance of all the three activities is
      recognised by most voluntary agencies, it will not be too difficult
      to solicit their co-operation, if freedom of action is assured tc
      them.  If properly documented, their experiences will also provide
      guidelines to each other.

      The voluntary agencies, at presen·t, lack proper communication bott
      among themselves, as also between the Government and themselves. If
      this gap is filled in by publishing a periodical, they can sharE


                                         109
      their experiences. Initially, the periodical can be devoted only       to
      the selected district areas and later on, can cover other areas        as
      well.

      It is also necessary that before implementing, all the details of the
      scheme   are discussed with the NGOs,      including village    level
      organisations. Nothing should come only as a "GR"; everything should
      be the outcome of deliberations with them.

      The GOH, while providing centralised serives of publicity, supply of
      extension material,training etc. should also take cognizance of such
      services already provided by the NGOs. The Seminar/Workshops arranged
      to discuss these services will go a long way in expanding the reach
      of such services and obtaining the required co-operation from the
      NGOs.

8.6   TRAINING NEEDS
      The above discussion points out that various training inputs          are
      required by the agencies implementing the programmes.   They          are
      tabulated below :

8.7     FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS
        While the detailed financial implications of the above suggestions
        are beyond the scope of the present study,       some of the broad
        dimensions are presented in Table 8.1. The figures in this table are
        based on the follwing assumptions:

        i)   Subsidy amount of Rs. 1000 per latrine is given to the               advanced
             communities and Rs. 1500 per latrine is given to the                 backwal'd
             communities.

       ii)   The following targets in terms of construction of latrines are to
             be achieved in the project villages

             There are around 3,44,000 households in the project villages
             (consisting   approximately of 2,87,000 households of advanced
             communities and 57,000 households of backward communities). At
             the end of 4 years, thus, an achievement of 58 per cent coverage
             will be made.

      iii)   Status reports for all the 1650 project villages are prepared               by
             the NGOs.

       iv)   On an     average, three awareness camps in each village        are       held
             (total    : 5000 camps in 1650 villages during 4 years)

        v)   50 soak pits are to be constructed in each village. during                four
             years {Total No.      of soak pits to be constructed in                   1650
             villages : 82500).
      vi)    The following costs are not included in table 7.1

             a)    Organisational    cost    of   the    Nodal   Agency      (salaries,
                   travelling, etc.)

             b)    Cost of Associates, Experts, Consultants appointed             by   the
                   Nodal Agency-.

             c)    Cost of Training conducted by the Nodal Agency

             d)    Cost of Training material, Equipment, Demonstration material,
                   publicity material and publicity.




                                            111
     With  these assumptions, the total cost comes to around Rs. 25 crores
     IRs.  250  million). Outofthisbulki.e. SSpercent           is  spent  on
     subsidies to the benificiaries for latrine construction and 10.7     per
     cent given to the NGOs. If there are SO NGOs working in 10 districts
     (i.e. B per district) on an average, one NGO receives Rs. 67,500     per
     year,  covering 20 villages and constructing 625 latrines     par  year.
     This  amount and work should enable the NGO to maintain a staff of     3
     social workers a.nd meet their tra.vell ing and overhead expenses.

     The  tota.l financial  cost could be met from the  resources                              of   ths:l
     Gov8rnment,  World  Bank and other financial  agencies  I ike                             IJNICEF,

                                                      Soil Poor; 60 irrigation wells;


Kolegaon  is  a.t a. distance  of   14km.                    from Shevgaon,the     ta.l uka.
headquarter.  The   road  is  mot.orable,                   but during  monsoon    it     is
difficult to use it.

!Ja.ter for drinking and other purposes

There         are    two      sources of water    ~    One stream,      three   wells.

For drinking purposes,              water   is drawn from private wei Is on farm         and
from one public well.

The  public wei l was deepened 15 years ago by the     villagers  through
joint efforts to the depth of 45 feet. Prior to that it was       shallow
with a depth of only seven and half feet. Now water is available at 9
feet from the ground level; but in summer the level goes      down to 40
feet. W;;.ter of this well is a little sa.lty a.nd villagers do not  ma.ke
much  1;se   of  it..• l.later for drinking is, therefore,  fetched   from
private we! Is on farms.

Ualls  of the pub! ic wei l are built with stone & mortar and a 5 feet
high  wal I is constructed round the weiJ.Four pulleys are fitted  for
drawing water and spilt water is drained away properly. This water is
used for washing clothes and utensils and for bathing.

During  the           famine of 1962-63, water was brought from outside      in  a
tanker and           pour~d into this wei I. In the process wal I of the wei I w~s
r:;ia.ma.g ed.•


The     second   well wa.s constructed in 1950. It is 45' deep a.nd   ha.s    a..
diameter     of   7 feet. Hormally water is available at 10 feet     but     in
summer it sinks to 40 feet from the ground-level. This well was built
by the villag~rs through voluntary labour contribution         'Shramadanl.
It     is  also   built   with stone and mortar and  is  fitted   with     two
pulleys.      It's w~ter is also salty. Jt is,therefore used for     wa.shing
clothes,     utensils and for bathing. Five feet radius of the      well    is
covered     with floor tiles and properly constructed outlets drain        the
waste water to village gutters. The surroundings of the well are kept
·~! 8a.n.


The  third wei 1 in the village is located in the residential area       of
the scheduled caste fami J ies. It is fitf:.ed with four pt.!lleys.  !Ja.ter
level is 35 feet from the ground level. In summer the well goes       dry,
and  the scheduled casts families h~ve to take water        for   drinking
purpose from the well near the Panchayat Office.




                              26
On south of Kolegaon, there is a stream, which orginates within   the
village boundaries. Water from this ls used for washing and animals
are taken here for drinking water. At present, the water is five feet
deep but in summer the stream becomes totally dry,

Since   there  is no perennial source of water,  a  'temparary water-
supply scheme•    was  implementated in 1962-83; under  the scheme a
pipeline was laid for carrying water from a public well in the nearby
viJ lage,  which is at a distance of 2 kms. This water was  stored  in
the public well of the village which was also constructed in 1982-83.
This pipeline was made of plastic and was laid under the ground* but
it was not very deep under the ground. Therefore during the mon6oon,
the soil above it was eroded and the carts and other vehicles running
over it caused considerable damage to the pipeline.

There is one percolation tank to the north of Kolegaon at a   di~lance
of   2000 ft.  lt was constructed in   1962-63 under   the Employment
Guarantee Scheme.   Water-level in the wells in the vicinity    of the
percolation tank has improved considerably due to    this work.During
the 1982-83 famine 4 bore wells were attempted in order to solve   the
the water shortage problem. All the attempts failed. But two of Lhese
wei Is started giving water after monsoon. Pump will    be  fitted  to
these from the funds available with the MLA of this region.

Latrines

There  is   not a single public or private latrine    in    the village.
Villagers, therefore, use the open sp~ce. Men go eastward & women      go
northward.   During monsoon, children defecate within    the     village
nearby   the garbage dumps and the residential    houses and audults
dafacate    on  the sides of    the approach   road.No    trenches   are
constructed and villagers do not cover excereta with earth.

Most of the people are not prepared to construct latrines. They would
welcome scheme of housing or any other scheme but      they would    not
accept latrines. Because according to them latrine means consid~rable
rtiFt ~n~ fRwl ~m~l l and nobody would take care to maintain them
properly.   When the importance of latrines was explained to   them,   a
few   families  expressed desire   to h~ve   priva~e   la~rines.   Many
preferred community latrines ~s they individually cannot afford       to
construct separate    latrines. They insisted that their should be a
provision to employ person to keep them clean.

Hygiene at Public places

To reach Kolegaon one has to cross       the  stream.   Villagers  use
banks of the str~ams and sides of the approach road     to   defecate.
Foul  smell  and dirt meet the visitor of the village. Water   of  the
stre~m becomes murky due to w~shing of clothes; the   State Transport
bus also goes through the stream.

The residential houses are on a higher plane. They are made of l'ricks
& earth and have thatched roofs. There is an open but covered    space
in front of most of the houses. During monsoon, roofs leak and walls
become damp. As there are no windows or other provisions to   \e\.  in


                  27
the  sun,   walls  remain damp for a    long time.   Inside   the house
therefore   there  is a smel I of dampness. Mosquitos are    in plenty.
Houses are small in size, At one corner there is an earthen chullah.
Outside the house there is provision to wash, and.an outlet takes the
waste water to the village gutters. Some families     have constructed
pits    where  the waste water gets acccumalated.    Once   the  pit is
filled,   it is emptied on the street itself. Litter in the house    is
dumped outside. It gets accumuJatd and the children defecate nearby.

On festival days, the scheduled caste persons sweep the village. They
receive some sweet eatables for this work. A lot of weed has    grown
around the village. Children defecate in this weed.

Daily Life of Women

Women   get up early in the morning and start their daily chores with
heating water for bathing etc. They take bath in the house            itself.
Soap   is    used   very rarely. Instead, a. ha.rd  stone   is  used.   After
bathing they start cooking daily food, which consists of Bhakari made
of bajra or jowar and some vegetable & dal preparation. There after,
they   go    to the well or stream to fetch water which        is used    for
cleaning utensils. Later they then go to the field and work either on
their    farm or others' farm to earn wages while returning home         they
bring fuelwood. At home,       immediatly they ha.ve to cook meals. If they
go out      for wage-work in EGS project they return late.      On days of
festivals,     they   give a. dung wash to the house.     Periodically   they
carry out the work of keeping stored grains clean, making papad etc.

There is no weekly market in the village for making routine purchases
therefore villag~rs have to visit markets at a distance of 4 km.  For
medical  treatment  they have to visit the dispensary which is at   a
distance of 1 km.

Persongl Hygiene

After defecation villagers wash their hands with earth only. Soap    is
never   used.  For brushing teeth, ash or roasted  tobbacco   is  used.
Villagers   take bath at home but soap is not used regularly. Only on
festival occasions like Diwali etc. soap is used. Before taking food,
villagers   wash  their  hands. Clothes in daily use are    taken   for
washing   to the stream. For washing clothes soap    is  rarely   used.
Thrashing on a rock is the usual practice.

Cleanliness in the Kitchen

A simple chul lah is used for cooking. Before starting cooking women
wash it with water and plaster i t with mud; then they worship it. The
hearth   is always kept clean. Tea is served without milk and   rather
excessive sugar    is used. For breakfast the bhakri prepared  in  the
preceding evening is used. Napkin is never used for drying hands. The
corner of sari is used for this purpose. Uater is neither boiled   nor
filtered.   For  washing   utensils only earth is used and    not any
detergent or washing powder. Drinking water is stored in earthen pots
and water required for cooking is stored in copper pots. For    taking
water from the pots, smal I pots without handles are used. Bhakari   is


                    28
kept  in a cane basket which is hung on the wall. Vegetable   or  dal
curry is k~pt in a pot. The kitchen floor is giyen a dung wash before
cooking is commenced.

Institutions

The   village has a grampanchayat for three    villages    viz   KolBg~on,
f1angrool   Khurd  and Mangrool Budruk since 1956. In addit.ion     to  its
routine    functions  the panchayat constructed a   school   buildinl    al
Mangrool    Khurd from the funds available to MLA, office of     panoh~yat
from Jawahar Rojgar Fund in 1990, a Samajmandir      (community    plac~),
drainage    Copen gutter) at Manqrool. A chavadi (meeting      place!   tor
scheduted caste people was under construction.

There   is  a multi-purpose cooperative society with a   ~embership   of
150.   Tarun Mandai was established 2 y~ar$ ago with a   membership of
25.    The same members     are also   members  of  another    political
organisation.   Shiv  sena.   They   organise  festivals  like  Ganpati
Fest.ival etc.

Bhajani  mandal  a  group of 20 persdns,   meet  frequently          to      ~ing
devotional songs. There is no women's organisation.

The PHC is at Chapadgaon, 4kms away. One medical   practioner  Ylsits
the village once in a week. At the time of inve~tigation there WH&  3
widespread   incidence of   influenza  ln  the   village.   VetRrnary
dispensary is at Akhegaon.

There is no post office in the village, but a postman visit          ei!~J f' y'd<~Y
and collects and delivers Jetters.Thure is also no office              of      the
village revenue official tTalathil.

There   is no flour mill in the     village. For this  purpose  villagers
have  to go to Hasanapur, which     is 1 km away from Kolegaon. There  is
one grocery shop in the village     ; it is owned by the sarpanch.  Thera
is no fair-price shop, villagers     have to visit Limgaon, which is at a
distance of 2 km.

There is one Anganwadi .    25 children in the age group 2.5 to 5           vears
at.tend it.

The  school run by Zilla Pa.rished sta.rted working in 1962. It h··!ill'i   '+
standards but one teacher looks after all the classes.         The vil !age
has been demanding one teacher for each class ; but so far the demand
has not been met. Consequently, t.he c1uaJity of t.JE~a.ching is poor.    Th•J
4th standard students cannot even read correctly.

                   Scheme                        Piped Water Supply


Hale   is about 6 km from the Bombay suburban railway station,   Yasai.
It   is enjoying ample water supply and is therefore one of    the   few
prosperous villages. A majority of families have private wells and no
water supply scheme is needed in the village. Those who do not have
private well take water from four public wells. No need     of  storing
water    in the house is felt as one can draw water from one's  private
well   anytime when    there is a need of it. On an average a    family
consumes between 150 & 200 liters of water every day.

Quality of water is on the whole good but during summer water    level
shrinks and being near to the sea, water become a little salty. Water
is not properly drained and is allowed to seep, while using   it   for
washing and bathing. This is likely to contaminate the well    w~ler.
The village and    its region is attracting people and as a    result
construction activity    is rapidly expanding. This in turn requires
large quantity of water. Water level is fast going down.

Latrines

Only  12 years ago there was not a single latrine    in the village.
Growing urbanisation and modern housing made latrines inevitalbe and
now 56 and of     the total 115 families  have   private   latrines   in
addition to one commom latrine used by 5 families. Four latrines are
attached  to bio-gas plants. Those who do not have    latrines    go  to
distant places for defecation. Five families have a common      latrine.
The owners have allocated among themselves     the responsibility of
maintaining the l~trine. This common latrine was constructed 5 years
ago at a total cost of Rs. 25000/- , each family sharing an equal
amount.    This experiment   h~s   proved successful.

Private    latrines are maintained olean through weekly washing with
bleaching powder.      All   the latrines are constructed as      permanent
structures within the residential premises but a little apart (10
15   feet)    from the Jiving rooms in the backyard. There is no water
tank with tap in the latrines, one has to carry water while going        to
the    latrine. One family has one pit latrine and an old woman in the
family alone uses it; the rest of the members prefer the open fields
or space near the tank. The tank water gets contaminated during rains
when excreta is washed into it. The practice of covering excreta with
earth is not only absent but is even rediculed. During mansoon street
sides cue used       for defeca.tion. Growing  pop,Jla.tion a.nd eJ<panding
construction activity are creating hardship for oldmen and children
as   the open space is getting reduced. All are feeling the need of       a
private     latr~ne. The fact that out of 41 BPL families three     have a
private latrine, shows that the need is felt by all and that even the
very    poor are prepared to bear the e~penses. Public      latrines are,
however, not favoured by anyboby,      But small groups consisting of    5-



                    30
10 families seem to be willing to have common latrin~s. The cost of a
latrine with a 1:>ept.ic tank is now about. Rs. 10-12 i:.ilo\;:3a.nd.

Villagers   want latrines because it saves their timu              nd not             because
It    is necessary for proper health environment. When                  ! iterature on
latrine is shown to them, they find hard to believe i t ~nd argue that
the absence of latrines to which they are used, since childhood,                            has
not  caused   ill neas ~.nd diseases so f ~.r. l,lhy then h :, ._. .;::    l a+.. r i n~;ts  on
health grounds 7      Private latrine is prefered as            lhe          problem of
maintaining   it clean becomes easier. Villager prefer latrine with                           a
septic   tank but cannot explain why they prefer it to other kinds                           of
latrines. l t seems that they have no knowledge a.bout. other t:.yp8s.

Hygiene     at    Public     Places

The village, wlth total area of about 47 hectares, is      divid8d    into
four   settlements. Even though the village is relatiue!y     prosp~rous,
it   is not in any way better managed as compared to    other   villages.
The main     road of   the village as well as  the  roads   I inking   the
settlements    have gutters on sides to carry waste w~t r. But all     the
houses   have no connection to these gutters, and consequently       waste
water gets accumulated    in the backyards. More harmful is the ab~ence
of   any system for collection of Jitter which     is   dumped   anywhere
indiscrimenantly.    During the rains these dumps breed   mosquitos    and
flies and emit foul smell. Litter dumped in the gutt~rs obstruct       the
flow and cause futher health hazards. The village h83d told that once
in a year the gutters and roads are cleaned; howev r, there was         no
staff to carry out this work.

Personal Hygiene

Villagers take bath daily and use soap and adequate w~ter. The houses
are also kept clean. They wash their hands and foot after    returning
from work, defecation and before taking food. On th8 whole   villagers
have good health habits,     but they do not    real iss  that   proper
maintainance  of  public places is as important as    personal  health
habits.

Health

The PHC is at a distance of about 2.5 km. It was reported that only a
few years ago water borne diseases like cholera etc. ~ere very common
and recurring. Now such diseases are absent. Since tt18 villagers  are
enjoying good economic conditions, they take the services of   private
medical practitioners. The widespread ailments include cold & fever,
skin cracking of feet due to working inthe rains, liver trouble due
to liquor addiction etc.

Paily Routine of Women

Women  spend whole of the time in the house. Food     is  cooked   three
times  a day - break fast, lunch and dinner. Since every house has      a
backyard    garden which is known as wadi, women are required  to   look
after   i t and for this purpose they spend on an ave.sge 2-3    hrs.   a
day.  Unlike women     in most of the village, women at  Hale  are    not


                        31
required    to spend time and anergy for fuel collection and     storing
water. This village is fortunate as most of the families have private
wells   and   fuel is  available in wadis. Almost  905 of     women are
! iterate, which is also a peculiar feature of this vii lage.

Village Institutions

A mahila mandal, established in 1965, was found working. It has   a
saving scheme and     it conducts an excursion once   in a year. In
addition  it organises ceremonies and festivals. The membership was
reported to be 30 only, alI coming from reach famil las.

There was no other voluntary organisation in the village,

Gramsabha is held twice in a year but attendance is very poor. Nobody
seems to be intrested in problems relating to village management and
development.
