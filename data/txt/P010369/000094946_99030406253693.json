The key lessons learned are: 1)\n            Attention should be given up front to the institutional and\n            financial arrangements for operation & maintenance\n            (O&M) of the new facilities. 2) The entity responsible\n            for overall project coordination involving various agencies\n            should be fully staffed prior to implementation and be\n            empowered to approve key project milestones and impose\n            penalties for non-adherence to these milestones. 3) The\n            community participation arrangements should be clearly\n            defined prior to appraisal. 4) Planning of water supply and\n            sanitation facilities should have a long-term horizon and\n            investments should be planned to allow for infrastructure to\n            be built in a phased manner. 5) The respective roles of\n            government agencies, communities, nongovernmental\n            organizations (NGOs), and local governments in the planning,\n            implementation, and O&M of water and sanitation\n            facilities should be clearly defined during project\n            preparation. 6) Criteria for the selection of NGOs should be\n            clear, well targeted and transparent, and agreed by project\n            appraisal. 7) Adequate orientation and capacity building for\n            the staff of the public sector agencies and NGOs involved\n            should be made available as early as possible during\n            implementation. 8) To ensure affordability of the piped\n            regional water schemes, lower-cost alternatives should be\n            pursued and users' willingness to pay should be\n            assessed at an early stage."}, "docdt": "1998-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
