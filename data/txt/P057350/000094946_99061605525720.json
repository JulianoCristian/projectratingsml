ethnic\n            diversity. The project has three components. The first\n            component designs and implements an interactive learning\n            center (ILC) as a non-formal educational facility focused on\n            the social, scientific, and environmental requirements for\n            sustainable development, to be used by children, teachers,\n            and parents. The project emphasizes the pre-Hispanic\n            contribution, specifically research on the practices and\n            scientific knowledge of pre-Hispanic cultures; trains local\n            residents, including indigenous residents, as guides for the\n            COPAN park (a park of archeological ruins); and develops a\n            conceptual framework for interactive archeological exhibits\n            and workshops for children at the COPAN park. This component\n            also consists of archeological parks subprojects. The second\n            component supports capacity building for the staff and\n            volunteers of the ILC and the development of an ILC\n            communication strategy. The third component designs and\n            implements a management plan for archeological parks."}, "docdt": "1999-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
