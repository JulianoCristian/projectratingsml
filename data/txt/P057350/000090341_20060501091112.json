Introducing learning\n            by demonstrating concepts has tremendous value, both in\n            training and in developing exhibits for facilities. In any\n            type of construction project involving government and an NGO\n            such as the Profuturo Foundation, a high degree of trust\n            among the different agencies is essential. For an\n            institution such as the ILC, the establishment of a\n            nongovernmental organization/foundation to manage the center\n            with a significant endowment is a prerequisite. The original\n            drivers that spurred the development of the GDLN were the\n            ability to utilize Information and Communications\n            Technologies to import training and capacity building to the\n            public sector. Even after a single year of operations,\n            clearly the GDLN's presence in Honduras can achieve its\n            original financial sustainability goals. The network has\n            evolved and now offers Honduras real opportunities to\n            connect to the global knowledge economy."}, "docdt": "2006-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
