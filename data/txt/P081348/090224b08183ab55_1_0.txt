                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project remains in unsatisfactory status due to significant delays in project implementation. With completion of project funded water supply works in project counties, the project
                         has provided an additional 1.087 million people with access to improved water supply, bringing the total to 2.0 million in the 20 counties remaining under the project. To create or
                         expand wastewater management services, the project results to date show that 345,000 additional people have access to wastewater services, or a total of 549,000 in the 20 project
                         counties. To improve the planning, regulatory and operational capacity of the sector institutions, the project finances technical assistance (TA) packages. Among those TA contracts,
