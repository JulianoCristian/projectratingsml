                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Despite the efforts made by the Province over the last two years of implementation, the project will close in unsatisfactory status. To date, with completion of project funded water
                         supply works in the 20 cities and counties that participated in the project, the project has provided an additional 1.048 million people with access to improved water supply, bringing

                         activities resulted in 553,000 additional people having access to wastewater services, or a total of 837,000, exceeding the target of 563,000 in the 20 project counties. Under the

                         technical assistance (TA) component, the project management and financial management consultancies were implemented but the TA to improve the planning, regulatory and
                         operational capacity of the sector institutions was never implemented, so no progress was made toward this aspect of the PDO.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Despite recent physical progress, at least four contracts may not be completed prior to the loan closing date. These works must be completed with counterpart funds. The Provincial
                         project management office should closely monitor these contracts and ensure qualitydelivery. Finally the borrower should begin preparation of its implementation completion report for
                         delivery before the Bank’s completion mission scheduled for September 2013.
