                           The project remains in unsatisfactory status due to significant delay in project implementation and restructuring. To create and expand water supply in project counties, Results
                         monitoring data (from July 2011) indicate that the project has provided an additional 743,000 people with access to improved water supply, bringing the total to 2.3 million or 55% of
                         the goal of 4.2 million. To create or expand wastewater management services, the project results to date show that 126,000 additional people have access to wastewater services, or

                         a total of 490,000, which is 60% of the project goal. To improve the planning, regulatory and operational capacity of the sector institutions, the project finances technical assistance
                         (TA) packages. Among those TA contracts, three have been awarded and the TA for the study on sector reform is expected to be procured by March 2012. In additional to slow
                         implementation, part of the reason results are lower than expected is because 18 of the original 38 participating towns have dropped out of the project. A plan to restructure the
                         project to reduce its scope and relocate savings has been discussed, but the plan is awaiting provincial approval. Eventually, the restructured project should be able to reach its

                         benefits as well.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                           The client should make its final decision on the proposed project restructuring and strengthen its overall project management and oversight capacity. As a few project-supported
                         facilities are being put into operation, the operational training for utility staff should start soon.
