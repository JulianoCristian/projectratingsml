Water Supply and\n            Sanitation Project for China was deemed to have an\n            unsatisfactory outcome, with moderately unsatisfactory\n            performances by the Bank as well as the borrower. The\n            project implementation was unsatisfactory due to\n            difficulties with procurement, weakness in project\n            management, ineffective use of technical assistance and slow\n            response to management issues. Of the three project\n            development outcome indicators, two were partially achieved,\n            while the third was unsatisfactory. Significant lessons\n            learned during the implementation of the project include: 1)\n            hiring of consultants to help the borrower in project\n            preparation must start at project identification stage; 2) a\n            full understanding of the screening and selection criteria\n            by participating counties is important to ensure success; 3)\n            engagement of both a team of experts and a design institute\n            working in tandem to support the Project Management Offices\n            (PMOs) and Water Utility Companies (WUCs) in preparation of\n            a FSR (Financial Stability Report) is not practical; and 4)\n            programmatic loan with a framework for selecting and\n            appraising subprojects could have been more appropriated."}, "docdt": "2013-12-24T00:00:00Z"}
