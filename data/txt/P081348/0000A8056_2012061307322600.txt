                         The objective is to help create or expand water supply and wastewater management services and improve the planning, regulatory, and operational capacity of sector
                         institutions, thereby helping improve living conditions and the economic growth of participating county towns with relatively low incomes.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project remains in unsatisfactory status due to significant delays in project implementation and restructuring. With completion of project funded water supply works in project
                         counties, results monitoring data indicate that the project has provided an additional 1.087 million people with access to improved water supply, bringing the total to 2.0 million in the
                         20 counties remaining under the project. To create or expand wastewater management services, the project results to date show that 345,000 additional people have access to
                         wastewater services, or a total of 549,000 in the 20 project counties. To improve the planning, regulatory and operational capacity of the sector institutions, the project finances

                         August 2012. In additional to slow implementation, part of the reason that the results are lower than expected is because 18 of the original 38 participating towns have dropped out of
                         the project. A plan to restructure the project to reduce its scope and relocate savings has been discussed and the plan is expected to be submitted to the central government for
                         approval during the next two months. Eventually, the restructured project may be able to reach its objectives, but its outcomes in terms of the number of people with access to water
