Municipal Development Program Project for Brazil\n            were as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk\n            to development outcome was significant, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            investment projects with small and medium-sized\n            municipalities require sustained efforts to construct and\n            enhance the institutional capacity of the Borrowers. The\n            design of investment projects with subnational clients\n            (especially those of small and medium scale) should take the\n            Borrower's implementation capacity into account when\n            introducing innovative and or multi-faceted approaches. The\n            success of a project depends not only on the project\n            management units (unidades de gestao do projeto)\n            (UGP's) internal structure and capacity, but also on\n            the level of coordination between the UGP and the\n            Borrower's decision making structure and the commitment\n            of policy makers. In the case of small to medium size\n            municipalities, counterpart funding requirements should be\n            carefully assessed at entry, considering the financial and\n            fiscal situation of the particular Borrower. While grouped\n            projects can present advantages in economies of scale, these\n            gains must be balanced against the operational burden on the\n            Bank to ensure a cost-efficient project. Horizontal\n            adaptable programmatic loans (APLs) can be appropriate\n            instruments for designing successful, relevant, and\n            efficient multi-Borrower programs, provided some technical\n            and institutional conditions are met."}, "docdt": "2014-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
