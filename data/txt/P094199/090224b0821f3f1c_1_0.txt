                         Grande and Uruguaiana projects were closed on December 31, 2012. Santa Maria project was the last one to start implementation, and is scheduled to close on December 31, 2013.
                         Bage, Pelotas and Santa Maria projects have finalized the main project activities and have moderately satisfactorily met the intended Program Development Objectives (PDO). Rio
                         Grande project came across final implementation obstacles, which prevented it from satisfactorily completing the activities and PDO. Uruguaiana project, on the other hand, closed
                         without having achieved the significant positive impacts previously expected, namely addressing environmental issues related to the municipal solid waste agenda. All municipalities
