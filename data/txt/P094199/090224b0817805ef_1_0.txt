                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Restructurings of Bage, Rio Grande, Uruguaiana and Santa Maria Projects are being processed and are expected to be signed in November 2012. Among various minor
                         adjustments, two aspects are worth noticing: (i) the closing date for the Santa Maria project is requested to be extended by12 months, until December 31, 2013; and (ii) the remaining
                         funds under the Uruguaiana loan will be cancelled, as per the municipality request.
