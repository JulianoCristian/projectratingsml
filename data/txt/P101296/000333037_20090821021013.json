Second, and Third\n            Programmatic Development Policy Loans (PDPL) Project for\n            Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was modest, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the experience of parts of the human\n            resources sub-component of the PDPL confirms the importance\n            of 'ownership' and 'criticality' as good\n            practice principles for development policy loan operations.\n            The lack of clear ownership by the authorities and the\n            assessment that the prior action is not critical to\n            achieving results might have contributed to the partial\n            achievement of some of the program objectives and could be\n            interpreted as suggesting that a more narrow focus will have\n            been more appropriate. At the same time, the experience of\n            the decentralization sub-component of the program suggests\n            that a broader focus could be supported provided the good\n            practice principles are met. This subcomponent was not\n            necessarily central to either pillar one or two, but its\n            inclusion in the PDPL helped avert a potential derailing of\n            this area of reform. The PDPL team tried to secure a buy-in\n            for the supported reforms from as many groups, particularly\n            the opposition, as possible. This approach paid off as the\n            change in government between PDPL two and three did not\n            result in backtracking on the reform program. Also, the new\n            law on labor balanced the interests of the parties through\n            stakeholder involvement, which made its passage faster. The\n            participatory process by which the law was prepared also\n            improved negotiating sills of relevant stakeholders, which\n            will be useful for negotiations in the future."}, "docdt": "2009-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
