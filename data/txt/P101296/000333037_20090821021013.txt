H. Restructuring (if any)
1.      Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

The Programmatic Development Policy Loans (PDPLs) were a series of three operations during 2004-08
totaling US$85 million in Bank funding. The PDPL series was designed to support the Government's
economic reform program, and was focused on the areas of promoting economic growth through
improvements in the investment climate and strengthening the governance and efficiency of the public
sector.

1.1     Context at Appraisal

The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR) is a small, landlocked country with a population of
about 2 million. At independence, Macedonia was among the least developed republics of the former
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). A series of negative shocks as well as lackluster
progress in reforms since independence made it one of the slowest growing economies in the South-East
Europe (SEE) region at the time of the appraisal of the PDPL series.

The macroeconomic policies in the decade prior to the PDPL series, however, established a record of
stability. Inflation had been held to single digits for almost a decade. Unlike many countries in the SEE
region, external and public debt ratios remained moderate. Gross external debt and gross public debt fell
to about 40 percent of GDP in 2004.

Real GDP rose to about 3 percent in 2003 and 4 percent in 2004, placing FYR Macedonia among the
slowest growing economies in ECA in this period. Also, the recovery was based on a few key sectors,
and the unemployment rate remained extremely high at over 30 percent. There was a low level of new job
creation in the formal sector, which was attributed to a restrictive labor market and high payroll taxes. An
overly burdensome business regulatory environment also reduced business startups, added time and costs
to business procedures and impeded job creation. These factors also encouraged the informal sector,
which was estimated to account for more than 40 percent of GDP in 2004.

The investment rate of 20 percent of GDP lagged significantly behind faster growing economies in the
Europe and Central Asia region. The flow of FDI into FYR Macedonia averaged only 1.5 percent of GDP
during 1995-2005, one of the lowest rates among transition countries. Business climate surveys indicated
that the most serious obstacles to private sector development were a poorly functioning judicial system,
lack of access to credit, heavy regulation (especially in labor markets), political risks, corruption, and
policy unpredictability.

Macroeconomic Context

The Bank had a positive assessment of the medium-term outlook which supported the view that a PDPL
program would be sustainable. This positive outlook was based on a GDP growth projection of 3.7
percent in 2005, and the re-opening of large steel mills under new ownership. The full implementation of
key reforms would reduce the structural bottlenecks that impede private investment. These reforms would
lead to a gradual increase in the investment to GDP ratio as the investment climate improved by 2008.
GDP growth was projected to continue to slowly increase to 4.5 percent during this period. Inflation,
which had turned marginally positive early in 2005, was projected to increase to over one percent in 2005
and to about 2 percent by 2007 and 2008.

On August 31, 2005 a new, three-year Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) was approved by the IMF Board.
The program envisaged budget deficits of 0.8 percent of GDP in 2005 and 0.6 percent of GDP in 2006-
2008. Such a fiscal stance would continue the gradual reduction in the public debt to GDP ratio of recent
years from about 40 percent of GDP to below 35 percent by the end of the program. Debt sustainability
analysis conducted by the IMF for the SBA suggested that public debt levels would be sustainable except
from an implausibly large GDP shock.

Prospects for export growth with reforms were expected to slowly improve as structural reforms
improved the competitiveness of FYR Macedonian companies. Tight fiscal policy would contain demand
for imports. Under this reform scenario, the current account deficit was projected to gradually decline to
below 5 percent of GDP. The privatization of the electricity company expected in early 2006 and other
planned privatizations would help boost the international reserve cover to about 4 months of imports.

Prior to the PDPL series, the Government had implemented a Public Sector Management Adjustment
Credit and Loan (PSMAC and PSMAL) to support basic public sector reforms. However, there remained
obstacles to development in the public sector, including wasteful practices and weak capacity in the
country's single payer health institution, the Health Insurance Fund (HIF). The PDPL was designed to
improve these areas and help the country stay on course for EU accession. There were also major
weaknesses in the business environment including weak administration of the rule of law, particularly the
resolution of commercial cases by the judiciary, and an excessive number of unjustifiable regulations
imposed on businesses, many of which were holdovers dating back to the Yugoslavia days. The desire to
move toward EU accession (Macedonia was granted candidate status in November 2005) meant that the
Government needed to broaden its reform strategy, which it decided to do with support from a series of
PDPLs.

1.2      Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The main objectives of the reform program were to promote economic growth and job creation in
Macedonia through improving: (i) the investment climate, and (ii) governance and efficiency of the public
sector. The three Programmatic Development Policy Loans (PDPLs) were designed to support the
Government's economic reform program over a period of three-four years. The reform program was also
geared to help the Government to advance toward its aspiration for EU integration and eventual EU
membership. The key indicators of the program are presented in Section 3.2 and Table 5.

1.3      Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

There were no revisions of the PDOs.

1.4      Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):

The strategy to achieve the main objectives of the program had the following components:

Pillar 1: Improving the investment climate

         Judicial reform­upgrading the legal framework and building capacity to reach and enforce
         judicial decisions in a more timely manner
         Labor market reform--updating the legal framework to increase flexibility of the labor market
         including hiring of contract labor and collective bargaining
         Strengthening financial sector regulation and supervision--instituting risk-based supervision and
         accounting reform in banks.
         Improving the business environment--eliminating business-unfriendly regulations, and
         streamlining and lowering the costs of procedures relating to businesses.

                                                    2
Pillar 2: Strengthening public sector governance

         Public administration reform--promote strategic prioritization and the completion of pay reform
         from the previous PSMAL
         Health sector reform--improving the financial management, transparency and governance of the
         HIF and public health institutions, including procurement of medicines
         Decentralization--supporting a stable and sustainable local government by settling arrears
         between municipalities and contractors and entering the second phase of decentralization.

1.5      Revised Policy Areas

N.A.

1.6      Other significant changes

There were no major changes to the design, scope and/or scale of the program. However, some
components' activities were shifted to later PDPLs in a few instances, and some prior actions were
converted to non-core actions, such as in the civil service reform program.

2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1      Program Performance

Table 1 shows the disbursement dates of PDPL 1-3. Total amount of Bank financing was US$85.0
million to which the Dutch Government added Euro14.0 million (Euro7 million each for PDPL 1 and 2).

                       TABLE 1: PDPL 1-3 Amounts (US$ million) and Release Dates
                                Tranche #          Amount        Release Date
                                 PDPL 1             30.0          12-08-2005
                                 PDPL 2             30.0          10-10-2007
                                 PDPL 3             25.0          09-15-2008
                                 ...Total           85.0

Table 2 lists prior actions included in Schedule 3 of the PDPL1-3 Loan Agreements (LA) and their
implementation status. There were no significant delays in disbursing the loans. The planned release dates
were realistic and allowed ample time for implementation of the prior actions.

At least four months of the extended period between PDPL 1 and 2 disbursements was because of the
Government's request to delay the disbursement, because, although it had fulfilled the prior actions for
disbursement, it did not need the funds at the time. The PDPL1 program consisted of six prior actions and
18 benchmarks that were assessed as critical to achieving the set outcome goals. The PDPL 2 program
consisted of nine prior actions and 20 benchmarks. The PDPL3 program consisted of eight prior actions
and 17 benchmarks.

2.2      Major Factors Affecting Implementation

EU accession. A major factor affecting implementation was Macedonia's desire to accede to the EU.
This objective affected not only the design of the operation, but also the speed and focus with which it
was implemented. EU accession has come to be viewed by some as a panacea for Macedonia's economic
issues, and particularly as a source of stability in a turbulent region. The goal of EU accession was
particularly influential in the number of laws that were passed with PDPL support as well as the content
of the laws and by-laws, which conformed to EU requirements. Trade integration with EU is already high
with 60 percent of exports directed to (and 47 percent of imports from) the EU-27.

Change in government. There was a change in government between PDPL 1 and PDPL 2 (August 2006).
This political change did not adversely affect the pace or content of the reform program. In fact, the new
government accelerated measures to improve the business environment, particularly the regulatory
guillotine (see Sections 3.1 and 3.2) and the Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIA).

Former Bank staff as reform champion. It was an advantage to have an ex-Bank staff serve as Deputy
Prime Minister and champion of the program. As this person was part of the new government that came
in midway through the PDPL program, it also facilitated the transition and was a reason for the energized
efforts to improve the business climate.

Strong efforts to meet with wide a range of stakeholders throughout implementation. The Bank
focused on meeting with a wide range of stakeholders, including members of the opposition. Groups
included labor unions, mayors, parliamentary groups, the Chief Justice, but also other justices, even if
they were not in a policy-making position. This approach also helped ensure that the transition to the new
government did not hamper implementation.

Dutch funding. The Dutch Government, which was the Bank's main partner, contributed Euro7 million
for each of the first two PDPLs, which substantially expanded the resources available to the reform
program. In addition, the Dutch Trust Fund (Dutch TF) funded important TA activities related to the
reform program. The existence of the Dutch TF made the provision of a Bank TA loan, which commonly
accompanies Bank policy loans, unnecessary.

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

While there were sufficient M&E data available from a variety of sources with which to assess the PDPL
program, the M&E of the PDPL series was not adequate. Though M&E indicators were identified at the
outset of the program, they were generally not systematically measured nor consolidated into a results
matrix. The exception was the civil service component, which collected detailed M&E data. At the time
of the ICR most of the indicators in the policy matrix have not been updated with actuals with which to
assess the program. There is a body of M&E data, but it is scattered amongst a variety of sources, and
does not fully match the original indicators (Table 5). For example, the labor markets component has kept
data on separate spreadsheets on components of employment and unemployment. For the judiciary

                                                    5
component, outcome data can be found by reviewing the USAID Court Modernization Project (CMP)
report and the EU Progress Report. It would have been easier to track overall program performance had
this data been compiled in a single location, such as a results matrix, and more regularly updated during
the implementation of the program.

The implementation arrangements for the PDPL series were effective. The Ministry of Finance (MOF)
was a committed counterpart and its coordination office performed well in working with line ministries.
The MOF maintained good institutional continuity, as did the Bank with essentially one task manager for
the entire series of loans.

2.4     Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

Several investment operations are continuing in health (the Health Sector Management Project-HSMP),
judiciary (the Legal and Judicial Institutional Improvement Support project-LJIIS), business environment
(the Business Environment Reform and Institutional Strengthening project-BERIS) and the Dutch TF,
which is mainly for capacity building in public administration and business environment improvement.
Originally, the FY07-10 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) opened the possibility for a new series of
policy loans to begin in FY10, but these loans were not requested by the authorities. However, the Bank
may provide budget support in an operation to mitigate the effects of the global economic crisis. The CPS
progress Report (March 4, 2009) established future milestones in a number of reform areas of the PDPL,
including the regulatory environment (establishing a unique electronic registry), the judiciary (a new
Court Information System), the health sector (reference pricing for drugs in place) and labor markets
(decreased labor tax wedge), that also demonstrate continued Bank engagement in the reform program.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The PDPL program design was closely relevant to the development priorities of the country as articulated
in a number of strategic documents, including the previous Government's reform agenda, and the current
Government's 100 steps program, which lay out FYR Macedonia's comprehensive economic policy. The
agreed matrix was modified slightly as the program evolved.

The PDPL series continued and broadened the Bank support of the government reform program that was
provided under the Public Sector Management Adjustment Loan (PSMAL-FY04) and its predecessor, the
Public Sector Management Adjustment Credit (PSMAC-FY03). The PDPL series expanded Bank support
to the area of improving the business climate which included judicial reforms, labor market reforms,
strengthening financial sector regulation and supervision and streamlining the regulatory environment.
The broadness of the PDPL was also driven by the government's objective of covering key areas required
for EU accession. The PDPL series aimed at the factors that have historically discouraged employment
and business creation in Macedonia. These factors have included: (i) an inefficient and opaque judicial
system that obstructs creditor, contract and property rights and has hampered the effectiveness of key
government agencies and supervisory bodies from enforcing administrative sanctions; (ii) inflexible
product and labor markets; (iii) a burdensome regulatory environment; and (iv) poor corporate and
financial sector governance. A poorly functioning bankruptcy regime has hindered firm exit. These
flaws in the investment climate have been compounded by weak public sector governance to further
undermine investor confidence.

Given the multi-year perspective needed to implement some of these reforms, the general strategy of the
PDPL series was to frontload the operation with laws needed to lay the basic legal framework to address


                                                   6
the priority obstacles to business development, and use the remaining loans to support measures to
implement the new laws. The programmatic approach provided the time needed to carry out this plan and,
as such, was an appropriate financing instrument. The timeline in Table 3 illustrates the important
analytical underpinnings and the sequence of investment projects that complemented the policy reforms
supported by the PDPLs.

Relevance to Bank Assistance Strategy

The PDPL series overlaps two CAS periods, the FY04-06 CAS and the FY07-10 CPS. The Bank and the
Government prepared jointly the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY07-10 (midway through the
PDPL program) to ensure that Bank operations continued to support the most important elements of the
Government program. The CPS aims to support the Government in advancing EU integration. The CPS
has two complementary pillars: (i) foster economic growth and job creation, increase living standards for
all, and (ii) public service delivery and supporting good governance, which are closely aligned with the
PDPL design.

The PDPL2 and PDPL3 formed the core of the CPS, accounting for one-fourth of the proposed lending
under the CPS's base case. To maximize the impact of the PDPL series, the Bank complemented it
through investment loans and analytical and advisory services in the previous CAS. The HSMP, the
BERIS project, and the LJIIS project have been designed and implemented in ways that support the
reforms of the PDPLs. All of these investment loans have an implementation period which will carry
them well into the FY07-10 CPS.

Note: the PSMAC/L Dutch Trust Fund for TA was active during 2000 till the end of 2008 and provided
support on some PDPL-related activities. In 2007, the Dutch Government approved a new Trust Fund for
TA, more closely related to the PDPL agenda, which is expected to be active until the end of 2009. The
Dutch Government also provided two co-financing TFs complementing the PDPL 1 and 2 operations.

Analytical Support for PDPLs

The PDPLs were based on a series of economic and sector work. The Country Economic Memorandum
of September 2003 focused on reforms of the labor market and the investment climate to lower
unemployment. The FSAP focused on issues of corporate and financial sector governance, bank and
insurance regulation and supervision, the legal and judicial framework. The CFAA (2003) and CPAR
(2003) built on the analysis of the 2000 PEIR to form the basis for PSMAL-supported reforms in public
expenditure management, including internal and external audit, public procurement, and budget
formulation and execution. The 2007 PEIR focused on issues related to the structure and outcomes of
public spending and helped sharpen the reform efforts in the health sector. The Judicial Reform
Assessment (2005) informed PDPL preparation in judicial reform. A ROSC on corporate governance, a
study on financial sector governance and a diagnostic on financial sector supervision (all in 2005) helped
prepare the PDPL2 and the proposed PDPL3, including the comprehensive supervisory development plan
and improvements to the legal framework for corporate and bank governance.

Coordination with IMF and Other Donors

The IMF 3-year stand-by arrangement, approved in 2005, reinforced several reforms supported under the
PDPLs. The Bank and Fund teams coordinated to ensure consistent policy advice. Coordination has
included participation in each other's preparation missions and extensive intra-mission meetings between
the two teams. Since 2005 the IMF has provided technical assistance on the banking law and banking
reform and supported a resident central bank advisor, which are specific areas also supported by the
PDPL (see Section 3.2). The Fund and Bank carried out jointly the FSAP in 2003 and an FSAP update in
2008.

The PDPL team worked closely with other donors active in FYR Macedonia, and program components
were designed in close consultation with donors active in the particular areas of support. Particularly
useful was a one-day event held at the beginning of PDPL 1in Brussels in which Bank team
members/sector experts met with their counterparts from the European Commission to exchange views on
the reform agenda. Other active donors and the key areas of involvement supported by the PDPL3
include the Dutch Government (private sector development, judicial reforms and decentralization), the
European Agency for Reconstruction (judicial reform and decentralization), and the USAID (reforms of
the judiciary and the business environment, and decentralization). The Dutch Government has also
financed trust funds to fund important technical assistance to several institutions implementing the PDPL
program and provided Euro7 million each in co-financing for PDPLs 1 and 2.

3.2     Achievement of Program Development Objectives

The overall program objectives and targets were largely met, both for the macroeconomic framework and
Pillars 1 and 2 of the reform program. Although a substantial amount of work remains, such as in the
judiciary, a great deal of progress has been made in enhancing the legal framework in key areas and in
building capacity to implement that framework.

Table 4 shows that macroeconomic performance improved until 2008 with a strong downturn projected
for 2009 reflecting the effects of the global economic crisis. During 2006-08 there was improvement in
investment's share of GDP, unemployment and gross reserves, which may be partly attributed to
improvements in the overall business climate. The expected downturn in 2009 is related to the global
economic crisis.

Pillar I--Improving the Investment Climate

Judiciary

The main expected outcome was more efficient and effective enforcement of contract, creditor and
property rights by courts and enforcement institutions. This outcome was mostly achieved, though
there is substantial longer term work to do. The basic objectives were to: (i) Reduce backlog and
delays in court proceedings (partially achieved); (ii) Improve enforcement of court judgments (achieved);
(iii) Improve regulatory and implementation framework for bankruptcy cases (achieved); (iv) Increase
transparency and fairness of administrative agency decisions (mostly achieved); and (v) Increase
institutional capacity to implement and monitor reforms (partially achieved). Table 5 summarizes the
indicators of the achievement of the stated objectives.

In summary, the improvement to the judicial legal framework included:
     Laws on Civil Procedure, Enforcement and General Administrative Procedures (all in mid-2005)
     Amending the Constitution to empower agencies to assess fines (rather than have minor fines
       require court proceedings).
     Licensed enforcement agents (private bailiffs) outside the courts begin operation (mid-2006).
     Law on Courts, Law on Misdemeanors (May 2006), Law on Enforcement, Bankruptcy Law,
       General Administrative Procedure Law, Law on Administrative Court.

The objective to reduce backlog and delays in court processing was partially achieved: A critical
issue for the judiciary was that too many cases were ending up in the courts, even simple matters such as
fines. To improve the capability of the judiciary to reach and enforce court decisions, the reform program
had to be geared to unblocking the system by first eliminating procedural obstacles. The PDPL supported
the adoption of a new Law on Civil Procedure designed to revamp court procedures by streamlining case
processing including delivery of summons, case hearings, etc. This Law achieves the basic requirement
of placing the burden of proof on the parties rather than the judge. The Law also aimed at shortening civil
proceedings by ending unlimited requests for continuances and recusals, which were often automatically
granted. Amendments to this Law adopted in 2008 further streamlined the court procedures.

The new Law on Courts established a more effective organization of the court system including setting up
of an Administrative Court and allowing for specialization within courts. At the same, the Constitutional
Amendments and the new Law on Misdemeanors, the Law on General Administrative Procedure and the
subsequent changes to a number of sector laws have allowed agencies to issue misdemeanor sanctions
without court action, thus freeing the courts from thousands of cases. These cases consisted mainly of
enforcement and misdemeanor cases and administrative cases that are dealt with by the new
Administrative Court. Agencies are just beginning to exercise this new power, and the new

                                                      9
Administrative Court is beginning to hear new cases from agencies and municipalities. The backlog of
these cases fell by 576 cases from June 2005 to June 2007 with 22 of the 27 basic courts recording a
reduction in backlogs. The LJIIS project and the USAID follow-on project continue to work on reducing
backlogs and delays.

The objective to improve enforcement of court judgments was achieved. Even after reaching a court
verdict, enforcement of property, contract and creditor rights in the past was complicated by the practice
where enforcement judges reviewed the original judges' decisions, which further drew out the
proceedings. The new PDPL-supported Law on Enforcement Law took enforcement out of the courts and
placed the function in the hands of private bailiffs. Licensed enforcement agents outside the courts began
operating in mid-2006, and there are now 69 enforcement agents (who are lawyers with 5 years
experience and who must pass an exam that is reportedly more difficult than the bar exam). Managing of
cases has improved and enforcement of court cases increased from 18 percent in 2005 to 39 percent in
2009. 24 percent of cases are now processed within 6 months.

The objective to improve the regulatory and implementation framework for bankruptcy cases was
achieved though more work is needed in the institutional framework. Fast and transparent market
exit procedures are critical to ensuring creditor and contract rights, however, the country's bankruptcy
procedures until recently were open to delay and abuse. The PDPL supported the adoption of a new
Bankruptcy Law which revamped the bankruptcy procedures by changing the role of the trustee, the
bankruptcy process and introducing more transparency and oversight. There have been some delays in the
implementation of the institutional framework for development of the trustee profession required by the
Law. Still, the average duration of bankruptcy procedures has fallen from 3 years and seven months to
two years and two months. Also, the number of new bankruptcy procedures has fallen by half since to
2007.

The objective to increase speed, transparency and fairness of administrative procedures was mostly
achieved. The PDPL supported a new Law on General Administrative Procedures which introduced
international standards of transparency, fairness and due process. The establishment of the Administrative
Court was supported by the PDPL which took over jurisdiction for administrative cases from the Supreme
Court. The new Administrative Court is set up to review agency actions and hold them
accountable to these standards.

The objective to increase institutional capacity to implement and monitor reform strategy was
partially achieved. The PDPL focused on strengthening the General Administrative Office in order to
create capacity within the judiciary for the implementation and monitoring of the comprehensive reforms
agenda. However, disagreements between the Ministry of finance and the Supreme Court delayed the full
staffing of this office, which was recently moved from the Supreme Court to the Judicial Council. A basic
Information System was introduced in all courts. Additional capacity building to support the
implementation of these reforms has been supported by the LJIIS project (2006), which is being
implemented in all 27 courts. Also, with USAID assistance, the Judiciary is scheduled to have an
operating court information system by the end of 2009 (also supported by LJIIS) that will track case
backlogs and allow performance measurement of judges. Judges who have not been keeping up with
their caseloads may be held accountable.

These reforms are beginning to show results. According to the BEEPS 2008, the percentage of firms that
find the courts to be a problem of doing business declined from 55 percent in 2005 to 50 percent in 2008.
However, a number of challenges remain. Judicial reform is disadvantaged by a lack of human and
financial resources. For example, the Advisory Council is supposed to monitor progress, but does not
function properly. While the number of judges increased somewhat, the number of employees in judicial
administration fell by 6 percent during 2007-08. IT offices in the courts are not staffed. It was also

                                                   10
reported that the courts' budget is insufficient to pay utility bills, ostensibly because, as judges salaries
increased substantially, the overall court budget declined. The budget of the judiciary was reduced from
1.98 percent of the total budget to only 1.25 percent, at a time when the judiciary was expected to adjust
to major changes in the legal framework.

Labor Market Reform

The main expected outcome of enhanced labor market flexibility was achieved. The indicators of
increased flexibility are presented in Table 5. Although unemployment is still high in Macedonia, and
one-third of all jobs remain in the informal economy, there was significant legal and institutional progress
in labor markets under the PDPLs. The main component of the labor reforms was the new Labor Law
(enacted July 2005). While Macedonia had already essentially transformed enterprise ownership from
Socially-Owned Enterprises to private ownership, the country had not yet created a new labor law to
match the new economy. The previous Law, passed in 1993, provided only few and relatively rigid forms
of labor relationships which significantly limited the overall flexibility of the formal labor market and
pushed people into the informal sector. In addition, the law did not provide an effective framework to
govern collective bargaining. The new law increases labor market flexibility by expanding possibilities to
use fixed-term employment, including seasonal and part-time employment, removing most restrictions on
work-hours as well as introducing voluntary participation to collective bargaining (a party must be a
signatory to the collective agreement to be bound by it). One problem that has arisen is that, in the process
of determining the participants in collective bargaining, no group has been able to meet the threshold for
representation (currently at 33 percent) in collective bargaining. However the MoLSP is working on
resolving this issue.

There was also the need to develop capacity to implement the new law. The Bank provided a substantial
amount of technical assistance throughout the process of drafting the new labor law and in implementing
it. Rather than a single country model, the Bank helped the Government select a set of good practices
from a number of countries in the region including Bulgaria, Hungary and Serbia. The Dutch TF provided
assistance to improve enforcement of the Labor Law, by strengthening the capacities of the State Labor
Inspectorate to implement the new Law.

During the participatory process in creating the law, there was some challenge to the new labor law from
labor unions, but the whole process took only four months to passage. The labor unions had been
consulted early in the process and their positions were considered in the drafting of the new law. Some of
the generous severance provisions from the old law survived in the final version. The 2008 amendments
to the Labor Law introduced further flexibility in labor relations.

The Law on Peaceful Resolution of labor disputes was prepared in order to facilitate the establishment of
a new approach to labor relations between stakeholders.1 The Law was adopted and budget has been
allocated for its implementation.

Strengthening Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision

The main outcome of strengthened banking sector regulation and supervision, and strengthened
transparency and governance of banks was achieved. The basic objectives were to: i) Strengthen
banking supervision and regulation (achieved) and ii) Strengthen compliance of banks with AML and
CTF requirements (achieved). As a result of the reforms under PDPL, the NBRM has better tools with

 Initially, this issue was supposed to be covered by the Labor Law and Ministerial decrees, but a Constitutional
Court ruling stipulated that such matter has to be regulated by a separate law.

                                                      11
which to assess banks' risk and reduce additional exposure to risk (e.g., in the areas of consumer loans
and credit cards). While not fully attributable to reforms, it is worth noting that financial intermediation
has increased with a credit to GDP ratio increasing to 37 percent from 26 percent during 2007-08.

Banking supervision and regulation was strengthened. The actions in this component are based, in
part on the World Bank's banking sector governance study (May 2005). A new Banking Law and a new
National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM) Law were approved in 2007. The NBRM uses the
SDP to guide its implementation of reforms including bank compliance with anti-money laundering and
counter terrorism financing. An IMF-sponsored resident advisor effectively assisted the NBRM for two
years in implementing the SDP, in particular the new risk-based supervision methodology. The new risk-
based methodology aims also at addressing bank governance weaknesses. The NBRM was also
reorganized according to risk management functions and capacity was built under the Dutch TF in the
area of risk-based supervision.

Compliance of banks with AML and CTF requirements improved. The NBRM issued a Supervisory
Circular in 2006 which established guidelines for the anti-money laundering systems of banks. Also, the
adoption of the new Law on Banks in 2007 facilitated the NBRM's adoption in 2007 of new and
strengthened, fit and proper criteria for Bank ownership.

Improving the Business Environment

The main expected outcome was an improved business environment which was achieved. The
objectives were to: i) Strengthen corporate governance of the enterprise sector (achieved); ii) Adopt a
quality-oriented approach to regulatory reforms to improve the quality of existing and new regulations
affecting business activity (achieved); iii) Implement a business-friendly system for business registration
(achieved); and iv) Enhance the quality of corporate financial reporting (achieved).

Implementing a quality-oriented approach to regulatory reforms was achieved. Through specific
measures under this component and others supported by PDPL, Macedonia was able to improve its
ranking in the Doing Business survey, from 81 out of 155 in 2006 to 71 out of 181 in 2009. At the same
time, the BEEPS 2008 results show improvements in a number of areas related to business environment.
The percentage of firms that reported licensing and permits as problems of doing business fell from 41
percent in 2005 to 34 percent in 2008; 27 percent of firms identified customs and trade legislation as a
problem in 2008 compared to 37 percent in 2005. Table 5 provides additional indicators of results.

In order to clean up the legal framework from legislation that was constraining business activity
(including regulations holding over from the Yugoslavian days), the Government, through the General
Secretariat, established the Committee for Regulatory Reform (CRR), and performed a stocktaking of
more than 2,000 laws and bylaws. The model of the "Regulatory Guillotine" worked effectively in
reducing unnecessary regulations. Following the review of the legislation the CRR, determined whether
it was sensible to retain, modify or eliminate them. The process involved extensive dialog with the
ministries, each of which had working groups, and the private sector. The CRR would then propose a set
of measures to the Government which adopted decisions instructing line-ministries to prepare the
necessary amendments. In the first round of the `guillotine,' the Government identified 64 Laws and 481
by-laws which were to be amended or eliminated, which it than translated into 5 packages of measures.
By September 2009, the Parliamentary procedure for amending 39 of the 64 laws was completed. At the
same time, by Ministerial decrees, 382 of 481 by-laws had been abolished or amended. The second phase
of the "guillotine" is underway which is addressing cross-border issues.

The regulatory guillotine included the reduction in fees charged, required forms and other documentation
in a number of Government agencies critical to doing business, such as the Cadastre and the Central

                                                    12
Registry. One of its biggest accomplishments was the introduction of the "silence is consent" principle in
dealing with the administration, basically stipulating that if the administration does not respond to a
certain request within certain days the client should consider it cleared. Implementing this principle
required amending the Law on Administrative procedures.

The success of the guillotine is linked to the transparency of the process followed in trimming the
regulations. Client comments are favorable in large part because the clients (businesses) had originally
helped identify the regulations that needed to be eliminated in the first place.

The regulatory reform was intended also to prevent the build-up of new legislation that may be hampering
business activity through the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA), which is the third phase of regulatory
reforms. The RIA was officially launched on January 1, 2009 and its implementation was supported by
the Bank's BERIS and the UK's GOFRA projects. Among other things, the RIA requires that all new
laws undergo a regulatory impact assessment to ensure that the benefits of the law outweigh its costs.
This effort is in line with EU accession efforts and represents a deepening of the PDPL supported reforms.

Implementing a business-friendly system for business registration was achieved. The authorities
recognized that fast and affordable market entry is critical to successful market competition, and,
launched a major reform, supported by the PDPL and other donor by adopting the Law on Business
Registration which streamlined registration by taking it out of the courts, combining a number of
government agencies and reducing time, steps and costs required to start a business. The specific
accomplishments of this subcomponent of improving the business environment include:

        Time to register a company was reduced from 3 days to 24 hours. Since early 2008, the law
        requires that registration should not take longer than 4 hours.
        Cost of registering a business has been reduced to less than Euro 50.
        During the first half of 2008, there was an increase of 5,200 in the number of registered
        companies, a 6 percent increase.
        The country ranks 12th in the world on the Doing Business Starting a Business indicator

Strengthening of Corporate Governance of the enterprise sector was achieved. Corporate governance
initiatives conformed with EU transparency directives and with harmonization with IAAS. A critical
piece of AAA supported the design of this subcomponent, the Report on the Observance of Standards and
Codes (ROSC-May 2005) on corporate governance. The ROSC also led to changes in the Securities Law
that was approved in November 2005. The SEC has adopted all of the necessary by-laws for
implementing the new legislative framework. The ROSC also laid the groundwork for a Corporate
Registry with a larger database of companies and appropriate data disclosure. The SEC created a new
corporate governance unit which is tasked with analyzing the data on companies. The Dutch TF provided
funding for a consultant to support the component and introduce risk-based approach to SEC operations.

The key to the success of this component was educating companies that information disclosure was not
merely an obligation, but was in their best interests. To conduct this sensitization process, several
roundtables were held. The angle was to demonstrate that information disclosure was a form of free
marketing to potential customers. There was also the threat of misdemeanor sanctions if the companies
did not comply. Useful outputs of the component included a manual for Joint Stock Companies and
templates for information disclosure. These items were produced with assistance from the IFC and
USAID.

A benefit of information disclosure is that companies are now more cautious about whom they do
business with, because it could reflect badly to investors. Another benefit is the further distinction


                                                   13
between management of the companies and ownership of the companies. That is, owners are now in less
of a position to make managerial decisions. The Stock Exchange has also shown some enforcement power
with several brokers sanctioned for price manipulation. Some of the PDPL activities will be continued
with the REPARIS project.

Pillar II--Strengthen Public Sector Governance

        Public Administration/Civil Service Reform

        Strategic Management

The main expected outcomes were to introduce more effective strategic prioritization; i.e.,
enhanced capacity of the Government to adjust policies and expenditures to better reflect its policy
priorities, while at the same time also improving budget discipline and cost-effective use of budget
resources, which were partially achieved. In 2005, the authorities launched a comprehensive reform of
decision making processes in the government, building on the budget process and public administration
reforms previously undertaken.

Under the PDPL, there was further improvement of the institutional arrangements and capacities
that permit more effective strategic prioritization, but the objectives were only partially achieved.
Under the PSMAC and PSMAL the authorities made good progress towards improving the budget
process and make difficult policy choices with scarce resources. The focal point for strategic prioritization
in the government was the General Secretariat, which received valuable assistance from DFID on
guidelines for strategic planning and training. Still, at the time of PDPL appraisal the strategic planning
effort was not yet fully effective so this activity was continued under the PDPL. Though only two
ministries were targeted under PDPL, all ministries now have a strategic planning unit. The strategic
plans that these units produce must accompany the ministries budget proposal (a three-year plan which is
updated annually). The strategic plans are linked to the Government's top priorities (increasing growth,
lowering poverty, integrate with the EU, building ethnic relations, anti-corruption and focus on education).
Unfortunately, the plans that were produced have had limited operational value as they were not
sufficiently linked to budgets.

        Human resource management

The expected outcome was the development of a professional, politically neutral, civil service 2 ,
managed on the basis of merit, rather than political loyalty was only partially achieved. The
Organic Budget Law (enacted July 2005) and amendments to the Civil Service Law (CSL) shortly
thereafter solidified the CSA role in employment of civil servants by requiring CSA approval of all CS
employments. Additional amendments to the legal framework for civil servants further advanced the role
of the CSA in HR management in the public administration. Also, the number of qualified applicants for
advertised positions increased dramatically. This achievement was the fortuitous coincidence of the
USAID piloting a nation-wide, web-access project which could be used for advertising civil service
vacancies. As a result, the number of applicants for advertised positions increased to 33.1 in 2006
compared with an average of fewer than 5 during 2004-05.




2
 Note that civil service status applies to only about 10 percent of individuals working for the government (teachers,
police, maintenance workers, etc., are outside the civil service).

                                                        14
Performance evaluation has been playing a larger role and has recently been linked to salaries, demotions
and firings. However, data are not systematically kept on these links and it was reported that the
incidence of firings based on poor performance evaluations was extremely rare.

The objective of consistently competitive yet fiscally sustainable remuneration in the public
administration was only partially achieved. The salary decompression effort in the civil service,
initiated under the PSMAL was successfully completed under PDPL. The objectives of pay reform were
to achieve fiscally manageable salary levels, as well as consistency at all levels with private sector
comparators. Also, the Dutch TF financed a public-private salary comparison (completed at the end of
2006), which confirmed the Bank's belief that lower level staff were paid too much relative to higher
level staff, and hence the need to decompress the wage structure. This survey was to be done every 2-3
years and would also provide guidelines for the remaining 90 percent of non-civil service public
employment. Broader public sector pay reform (the Law on Public Sector Wages) was politically more
difficult. This reform began as a prior action for disbursement, but became non-core as the political
difficulties became clearer. There is a plan to update the salary structure with another survey scheduled
for 2010. The Dutch TF was useful also in funding the establishment of a register for civil servants, and
software and training and improved data.

        Health reform

The main expected outcome was improved transparency, management and governance of the
Health Insurance Fund (HIF), which was achieved. The objectives were to: i) Strengthen HIF
Governance and the health policy making environment (achieved); and ii) Improve budget planning and
control, financial management and procurement in HIF, MOH and HCIs (achieved).

The objective to strengthen HIF governance and the health policy making environment was
achieved. The Health Insurance Law was amended to streamline the operations, decision-making and
transparency of the Board of Directors of the HIF. Its independence from the MOH was improved as well
as its implementation capacity. In addition, a comprehensive National Health Strategy was developed to
guide policy-making in the health sector over the long-term. Also, the Health Provider Law was drafted
as indicated in the PDPL policy matrix, but has not advanced and has largely been abandoned. Because
hospitals are operating as commercial entities, the necessity of this law has been questioned.

Budget planning and control, financial management and procurement in HIF, MOH and HCIs was
improved. The PDPL series continued the efforts from PSMAL, which had financed a due diligence of
the HIF and identified severe capacity constraints. As the single payer for all health services and
medicines in Macedonia, it was important to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of this institution.
The improvement of the procurement of pharmaceuticals was one of the most important achievements of
the PDPL series. Savings of US$9 million have been reported from the ICB procurement that took place
in 2007. Most recently, the HIF board has decided to institute reference pricing3, which the HIF finds to
be much easier than ICB. To further strengthen the use of reference pricing, the HIF is currently using
Dutch TF to establish appropriate national pricing.

The financial results of the public health sector improved. The financial obligations of the HFI towards
suppliers were cleared by 2007, while the obligations of the entire public health sector fell from 1.7
percent of GDP (4.7 percent of government revenues) in 2004 to 0.4 percent of GDP (1.0 percent of
government revenues) in 2008. This was achieved by introducing hard budget ceilings for HCIs as well


3
  Rather than procuring drugs, under reference pricing the HIF would reimburse a fixed amount covering the cost of
a generic drug. Doctors and patients could choose which drug to use.

                                                       15
as strengthening ex-ante controls over spending (accountants were installed in hospitals to ensure
compliance). In addition, the financing of HCIs was changed from historic budgets (in which hospital
largely received the funds they received in the past) to output-based budgets. Since 2007 performance
indicators have been incorporated into contracts between the HFI and the HCIs which are supposed to
serve as one of the main inputs in the budget process for HCIs. Most recently, the authorities introduced
Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) in measuring performance and financing health service, (though only
20 percent of the HCI's budget is actually tied to DRG) which is a major change in the way hospitals are
reimbursed.

Going forward with the PDPL agenda, The Dutch TF also supported the development of a central
payment system between the HIF and HCIs and real-time reporting is scheduled to begin in mid-2009.

        Decentralization

The main expected outcome of helping the Government decentralization program achieve stable,
financially viable local governments was achieved. The objectives were to: i) adopt a stable and
transparent mechanism for financing municipal government (achieved); ii) Reduce municipal arrears
(achieved); and iii) Adopt plan for financing teachers salaries (achieved).

The Bank helped the Government achieve important progress and avert backtracking in decentralization.
The objective to create stable and financially viable local governments required that municipalities
receive sufficient and predictable financial resources, and, more importantly, introduce financial
management practices and incentives to avoid build-up of contingent liabilities and resolve institutional
issues to ensure smooth devolution of responsibilities.

A stable and transparent mechanism for financing local government was achieved. Under the PDPL
a fair and stable formula was adopted which transfers a portion of the personal income tax and value
added tax revenues to municipalities. These revenues now constitute a significant part of the revenue
base of local governments. A formula was also worked out where the municipalities received, in addition
to other revenues, 3 percent of the VAT. The formula is based on population (60 percent), land area (27
percent) and remoteness of villages (13 percent).

The objective to reduce municipal arrears was achieved. Prior to the PDPL, the Bank (under the
umbrella of the PSMAL) provided limited technical assistance to the drafting of the Law on Local
Governments which transferred certain responsibilities to the Municipalities. The USAID was also a
major donor in this area. With the main issue being the arrears faced by municipalities, the Government,
with Bank and EU support maintained a no bailout policy. Cumulatively, 60 municipalities were able to
settle arrears by end-2007 and 70 by end-2008. Thus, 16 municipalities have not yet cleared their arrears,
which means that all capital expenditures are blocked by the Treasury and that they cannot enter the
second phase of decentralization. In the second phase of decentralization, Municipalities have increased
financial autonomy and they are responsible for using block grants to pay teachers' salaries. Arrears fell
from around MKD5 billion to around MKD2 billion in 2007 and MKD800 million by the end of 2008.

The no bailout policy had positive effects in that the municipalities were much more cautious than
previously about contracting civil works and ensuring that they have or will have the funds to pay the
contract. While the policy was strict, the no-bailout policy increases long-term financial sustainability of
the Municipalities.

1.1 Judicial Reform
Main outcome:
More efficient and effective enforcement of contract, creditor and property rights by courts and enforcement institutions-mostly achieved.
Reduce backlog and delays in
court proceedings-partially          The overall civil case backlog fell by 9.4% during June 2005-June 2007. Pilot projects supported by
achieved.                            USAID's CMP showed backlog reductions of civil cases more than one year old of 38.3% and for cases

Improve enforcement of court
judgments-achieved.                  The EU progress Report for 2008 states that 22 of the 27 basic courts reduced the large backlog of
                                     cases. These cases consisted mainly of enforcement and misdemeanor cases and administrative cases
                                     that are dealt with by the new Administrative Court.
Improve regulatory and
implementation framework for         The Bankruptcy Law was passed and bankruptcy trustees were re-licensed; however progress in setting
bankruptcy cases-achieved.           up the institutional framework for development of the trustee profession has been slow.
Increase transparency and fairness
of administrative agency             Implementation of the new Administrative Procedure Law is monitored by the Justice Ministry's
decisions-mostly achieved.           Administrative Inspectorate whose capacity has been strengthened through LJIIS support. The new
                                     Administrative Court is operational and hears appeals from agency decisions.
Increase institutional capacity to
implement and monitor reforms-       Substantial training of judges was supported by the Dutch TF, USAID and LJIIS. Also, judges' salaries
partially achieved.                  were increased. Enforcement agents were trained to reduce enforcement backlog. Advisory Council to
                                     monitor progress in reforms, however, is not adequately staffed and is not fully functioning.
1.2 Labor Market Reform
Main outcome: Enhance labor market flexibility-achieved.

Enhance labor market flexibility-    The new Law on Labor has updated the legal framework to conform to a market economy, in particular
achieved.                            focusing on rules for contractual workers, rules for collective bargaining and severance pay. (done)

requirements-achieved.
1.4 Improving the Business Environment
Outcome: Improved business environment-achieved

Strengthen corporate governance
of the enterprise sector-achieved.   The SEC implemented ROSC recommendations including requiring companies to disclose relevant
                                     financial data, instituting financial reporting requirements, and establishing rules and guidelines to
                                     separate ownership from management.

2. Strengthening Public Sector Governance
2.1 Public Administration Reform
2.1.1 Strategic Management
Main outcomes:
More effective strategic prioritization; i.e., enhanced capacity of the Government to adjust policies and broad programmatic expenditure
patterns to better reflect its policy priorities, as reflected in the Government Program-partially achieved.

Improved budget discipline keeps budgeted and actual expenditures in line with Government's strategic priorities and ensures cost-effective
use of budget resources by Budget Users-partially achieved.

3.3      Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The satisfactory rating reflects the high degree of relevance of the development objectives of the PDPL to
the strategic priorities of the country as well as the straightforward link between the objectives and the
PDPL components and resulting prior actions.

Despite some delays in certain areas, all prior actions were fulfilled. The required laws were prepared
and the Government moved forward with enabling legislation and building of the institutions necessary
for successful implementation of the reforms. Legal frameworks and institution building take time to
produce actual outcomes, but the results summarized in the table suggest that almost all components have
moved in the right direction. Furthermore, almost five years after the start of the PDPL program and a
year after the last of the loans was prepared, there have been no reversals in policies.

3.4      Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

There were no measured poverty impacts. With modest growth over the last few years, the poverty rate
declined only marginally. The latest available poverty data suggest that absolute poverty affects around
one fifth of the population. Empirical research has shown that sustainable and strong GDP growth (above
5 percent annually) are required in order to achieve sustained reductions in the poverty rate. Macedonia's
real GDP growth only recently exceeded 5 percent (2007-08). The poverty impacts of improved public
sector and business environment are likely to take several more years to be measurable, and the ongoing
crisis is likely to prolong this period.

At the same time, the unemployment rate fell by only 3.4 percentage points since 2005 and, at 33.8
percent in 2008, remained among the highest in Europe. Employment increased faster, but was also
accompanied by an increase in labor force participation which dampened the fall in the unemployment
rate. The PDPL had no direct impact on gender inequalities and imbalances and social development.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The PDPL introduced considerable changes to the institutional framework in the country. It introduced
international good practice in most of the areas it covered, which presented a large departure from the
systems prior to the PDPL, which were largely unreformed since independence in 1991. It also
established a number of new institutions. Given the long-term nature of institution building, the full
impact of the PDPL reforms is expected to yield much of the expected benefit only in the medium-term.
A number of institutions were improved during the course of the PDPLs, including:

         The Judiciary--progress toward implementing a new legal framework that will improve the
         ability to reach and enforce judicial decisions
         The HIF--its overall capacity, the management of transactions with HCIs, and its ability to
         procure medicines more efficiently.
         Civil Service--its pay reform and decompression of wages.
         NBRM--its upgraded approach to risk-based supervision
         General Secretariat--particularly regulatory analysis and strategic prioritization functions.
         Municipalities--especially contracting practices.

                                                   20
As this programmatic series was heavily focused on establishing a legal framework in a number of areas,
it was a major first step for longer term development in some institutions. The judiciary is actually
becoming more functional and has increased its capacity in the areas documented above, the regulatory
environment has been rationalized and future regulations will be subject to the RIA. Thus, the overall
approach to the business environment has been fundamentally changed.

4.    Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Modest

Probably the most important reassurance of sustainability is the commitment across the political spectrum
to the development objectives of an improved public sector and business environment. In addition, these
objectives are strongly linked to the EU agenda, which is a broadly owned strategic goal of the country.
The donor community continues to support this process.

There are a number of ongoing projects that also contribute to the likelihood of sustainability of the
achievements of the PDPL series. The LJIIS is ongoing and will contribute to further capacity building of
the judiciary. For example, the information management system for the judiciary is expected to improve
case management and provide a vehicle to hold judges accountable for reducing case backlogs. Other
projects that will enhance sustainability are BERIS, the HSMP and the Dutch TF, all of which continue to
operate after the closure of the PDPL series.

The global economic crisis has had a significant impact on the economy, but its impact on the reform
program appears less important. The Government did opt for fiscal expansion but this will be difficult in
an environment of a pegged exchange rate regime and falling FDI and transfers, and has already proposed
a revised 2009 Budget which is slightly reducing the expansion. The IMF mission in early May concluded
that the sharp economic slowdown is worsening the government balances (lower fiscal revenues) and the
balance of payments (exports collapse) and has advised the government to stand ready to consider further
tightening if needed. The Macedonian financial sector appears to be not as hard hit as in other countries
because the sector is not as globally integrated, and does not have toxic assets on its balance sheet.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank followed good practices in using AAA to underpin the program, complementary investment
operations and in coordinating with donors (detailed in section 3.1). The result was a program design that
was consistent with the national development strategy and that was focused not only on EU accession
priorities, but on those key constraints that would thwart business development.

                                                   21
In designing the program there was close collaboration between the sector staff working in different areas
of the PDPL and with the counterparts in the Government and line ministries. One illustration of this
close cooperation was that the Government accepted PDPL 3 resources and cooperated fully with the
supervision and reporting even though it did not need the funds for budget support.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The Bank devised an effective approach to work with counterparts and with other donors in their
respective sections of the reform program. The Bank cooperated closely and effectively with the MOF,
which was the coordinator of activities on the client's side. Supervision was also strengthened by the fact
that the team members who worked on the PDPL also worked on the investment loans which were
mutually reinforcing. Supervision was also enhanced by the continuity of the Bank team, particularly the
task manager who did not change throughout almost the entire PDPL series.

In the case of the USAID, Bank staff had worked with the Chief of Party for the Judiciary project in
another country and had a rapport that was valuable to coordinating strategies in working with the MOJ
and the Judiciary. USAID financed a Court Modernization Program (CMP) for seven pilot courts, which
helped with implementation of the reforms, along with the Bank's LJIIS project, which also focused on
implementation. This focus was appropriate because Macedonia faced severe capacity constraints. The
Bank also worked well with the EC, DFID and the Dutch Government. The Bank effectively used the
Dutch TF. The Dutch TF was a Recipient-Executed Trust Fund (REIT), but the Bank reviewed TF funded
activities to ensure consistency with the PDPL agenda and Bank's procurement procedures.

The Bank worked through a number of challenging reforms with persistence and delivering high level
technical support in all areas including the judiciary, labor markets, civil service, financial supervision,
health and decentralization. The most notable example was the area of health reform where the Bank
worked through difficult communications between the Bank's procurement staff and the staff of the
Health Insurance Fund (HIF) to ensure, ultimately, that ICB could be implemented. When 70 percent of
the bidders in the 2007 ICB procurement did not fill out the bidding documents properly, their bids were
rejected. It was a test of the resolve of the Bank, the HIF management, the special commission for
procurement and the donors that the requirements would be enforced. A new tender had to be carried out
and the compliance with tendering procedures improved dramatically.

The Bank was effective in helping to improve what had been very weak capacity at the HIF. The health
reforms were also challenging from the financial control perspective. Financial discipline was instituted
with the threat that the more inefficient, underutilized hospitals would close. The Bank team stood with
the HIF against determined opposition (from threatened hospitals and their communities and physicians)
to ensure that the reforms were implemented. One area of criticism in this area was that the Bank's
approval system is slow. The HIF reported that it took inordinately long to receive a no-objection (e.g.,
on a procurement plan) for matters that are sometimes urgent.

The Bank also provided valuable support to the Government as it held firm against bailouts for the
Municipalities. The Government was able to quell the political pressure by citing Bank and EU
requirements that Municipalities settle their own arrears and not set a bad precedent by inviting future
moral hazard risks. While decentralization would have occurred anyway, it has been implemented at a
faster pace and more effectively because of the Bank and EU involvement.



                                                    22
The general criticism of the Bank's supervision was that the results measurement could have been carried
out in a more systematic and consolidated way. Mitigating this criticism is the fact that individual
components did collect data with which a final overall assessment of the PDPL program could be made.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

With the rating of the Bank's performance in preparation as satisfactory and highly satisfactory
at supervision, the overall performance is rated satisfactory.

5.2    Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Government put the legal and institutional framework in place to improve public sector governance
and the business environment, and followed through with implementing legislation and capacity building.
All prior actions were completed on time and the Government is continuing to build capacity to
implement reforms with the help of a number of investment projects.

The MOF followed through on all prior actions. There was some dispute between the MOF and the
Judiciary over whether the judiciary's salaries should be raised and a separate budget should be given to
the judiciary. Initially, the MOF resisted the Judiciary's proposal, but agreed in the end with the help of
the Bank. While judges' salaries improved substantially, other court staff's salaries stagnated. On M&E
matters, the MOF did not buy in too heavily to the concept other than to meet Bank requirements. The
Civil Service agency, however, appeared to see more benefits in putting resources into M&E.

One example of strong Government performance was in ensuring that the judiciary component began well.
The Government accomplished this by already having a judicial strategy (Strategy on the Reform of the
Judicial Sector-adopted December 2004) in place, and by being willing to borrow for measures to
improve the judiciary. At the same, the Bank was completing an assessment of the judiciary, which
focused on commercial and enforcement issues, just as the PDPL was starting. The Legal and Judicial
Assessment identified specific judicial, institutional and legislative constraints to the effective
enforcement of property creditor and contract rights and includes an evaluation of the Judicial Reform
Strategy. Other particularly strong examples of Government commitment included the implementation of
the `regulatory guillotine' and the institution of financial and procurement discipline in the health sector.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

In general the implementing agencies performed well and there were no especially weak performances.
Most agencies followed through on the program reforms and handled well the challenge of preparing
substantial amounts of new legislation. The IAs prepared progress reports which were reviewed by the
MOF and the Cabinet of Ministers.

The Ministry of Justice performed well in preparing a substantial amount of new legislation. In its rush to
meet EU requirements for the legal framework, the Ministry could have performed better at anticipating
the impact that all of the new legislation could have had on the judiciary. The MOJ could also give greater
consideration of the number of judges needed (there are a sufficient number now) and the quality of the
judges recruited.

                                                    23
The judiciary, itself, could have performed better, but accomplished a great deal in only a few years. The
judiciary was skeptical of some of the measures, but supported them, perhaps convinced that better pay
and an independent budget was worth compromising on some of the other actions. The CSA could also
have done better given its uneven application of meritocratic principles. In addition, the General
Secretariat, while exceeding the target in the number of ministries with strategic plans, needs to ensure
that these plans are more closely linked to a real budget. As mentioned, it will take several more years for
the benefits of PDPL actions to be fully realized.

The health reforms were the most difficult. The HIF gained a substantial amount of implementation
capacity from a very low level at the beginning of the operation. They acquired the ability to conduct
ICB procurement and also improved the selection and decision making process of the Management Board.

The Ministry of Labor was pro-active and benefited from substantial technical advice from the Bank. The
MOL consulted with relevant stakeholder in drafting the new labor law. The process was participatory,
yet efficient, requiring only four months.

The NBRM was professional and used the Dutch TF effectively. The Supervision Development Plan
benefited from the highly competent staff at the Central Bank and coordinated well with Bank staff.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The performance of the Government and implementing agencies were both satisfactory and thus, so is the
overall rating.

6.      Lessons Learned

A successful approach to achieving judicial reforms:

        Incorporate a judicial assessment into the CAS
        Follow with a DPL
        Follow that with an investment operation

The need for a Judiciary component was nearly overlooked in the CAS preceding the DPL. The critical
need for judicial reform was brought to the attention of Bank staff who agreed that it was an important
component of the reform program and required a detailed assessment to learn how exactly to proceed. As
a result the GOM made substantial progress in judicial reform and implementation capacity, case
backlogs were reduced and deadlines for court proceedings were shortened.

Broader scope for the PDPL should only be considered if there is strong government commitment.

The experience of parts of the human resources sub-component (for example public sector wage reform)
of the PDPL confirms the importance of "ownership" and "criticality" as good practice principles for
DPL operations. The lack of clear ownership by the authorities and the assessment that the prior action is
not critical to achieving results might have contributed to the partial achievement of some of the program
objectives and could be interpreted as suggesting that a more narrow focus would have been more
appropriate. At the same time, the experience of the decentralization sub-component of the program
suggests that a broader focus could be supported provided the good practice principles are met. This



                                                    24
subcomponent was not necessarily central to either Pillar 1 or 2, but its inclusion in the PDPL helped
avert a potential derailing of this area of reform.

Broad stakeholder involvement, reinforced by drawing on cross-country experience may lead to
better and faster legislative solutions and greater ownership of reform.

The PDPL team tried to secure a buy-in for the supported reforms from as many groups, particularly the
opposition, as possible. This approach paid off as the change in government between PDPL 2 and 3 did
not result in backtracking on the reform program. Also, the new Law on Labor balanced the interests of
the parties through stakeholder involvement, which made its passage faster. The participatory process by
which the law was prepared also improved negotiating sills of relevant stakeholders, which would be
useful for negotiations in the future.

Institutional continuity, on both sides (the Bank's and Client's), is important for success

An important factor in the ability of the Government to push through such a broad reform agenda was the
coordinating role of the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry was able to do this, in large part, due to strong
internal capacity in some of its departments and their extensive experience in dealing with the World
Bank. At the same time, the Bank's satisfactory performance in design and preparation of the program
was, to a large degree, due to the continuity of the Bank team throughout the life of the PDPL-series.


7.      Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

(b) Cofinanciers

The ICR is in basic agreement with the comments provided by the Dutch Government concerning the
PDPL operations (Annex 5) and would add that their generous support to the PDPL agenda through co-
financing of the PDPL1 and PDPL2, as well as the related trust funds for technical assistance, were
essential to the success of the PDPL operations.

One specific area to which the ICR needs to respond is the observation by the Dutch Government of the
slowness and bureaucratic procedures that delayed the start and implementation of some activities
financed by the technical assistance trust funds. Some additional explanation is required. While some of
the delays were indeed caused by the need to meet the administrative requirements related to such
agreements, there were also objective reasons for the delay. Resources became somewhat stretched
because the team working on the Dutch TF was focused on finalizing the PDPL2 preparation as well as
accelerating the implementation of the previous Dutch TF for TA. Such capacity constraints continued to
affect the implementation of the TF. The TF was also approved at a time of a change in Government
following the 2006 Parliamentary elections and more time was needed to better align the TF activities to
the needs of the recipient and the PDPL agenda, as well as to meet all Bank procedures related to such
agreements.

      Observations from the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands on the PDPL
                                      programme

The PDPL has been of great significance to the overall reforms undertaken by the Macedonian authorities
in improving the investment climate and strengthening public sector governance. The programme has
contributed towards laying a sound legal basis for implementation of crucial reforms in the field of
judiciary, labour market, business environment, health and public administration.

The Netherlands has been the sole co-financer of the PDPL programme, with  7 million macro-support
co-financing for PDPL 1 and PDPL 2 ( 14 million in total). Moreover, to assist in the implementation of
the PDPL reforms, the Netherlands provided a grant of  2.5 million to the Government. This was a
follow up to the previous Dutch grant support 4 for the Public Sector Management Credit (PSMAC)
reforms in the amount of USD 3.78 million which ended in December 2007. Since the PSMAC TF could
not be amended further to include the new PDPL reform areas (judiciary, labour market and business
environment), the Bank and the Embassy agreed to establish a new PDPL TF which would cover all
PDPL areas and which would run in parallel with the PSMAC TF in the first year of its commencement.
The Administration Arrangement with the Bank for the new grant was signed on 13 December 2006 with
a closing date of 31 December 2008. Nevertheless, due to bureaucratic procedures within the Bank the
Grant Agreement between the Bank and the Macedonian Government was only signed 2.5 months later
on 8 March 2007 which caused delays in launching the foreseen activities under the Trust Fund. This and
partially the slower than expected progress in some reform areas were a basis for a one-year budget
neutral extension of the project until 31 December 2009, in a subsequent amendment to the
Administration Arrangement.

The findings of the evaluation of the PSMAC Trust Fund could unfortunately not be reflected under the
new arrangement for the PDPL Trust Fund due to time limitations. Given that the relevant beneficiaries
indicated that new implementing arrangement5 introduced with the amendments to the PSMAC TF would
contribute to the success of the reforms under the new PDPL Trust Fund, the Bank and the embassy
agreed to reflect new implementing arrangements in an amendment to the Administration Arrangement
for the PDPL TF. The amendments to the Administration Arrangement and the Grant agreement
reflecting these elements, changes in the initial budget allocations and the budget neutral extension were
signed on 21 July 2008.

As of May 20, 2009,  682.583 (27% of the grant amount) have been disbursed while  1.241.971 (50%
of the grant amount) have been contracted. The slow pace in disbursements in part reflects the delays in
launching some of the activities as mentioned above and the slower than expected progress in reforms. At
the moment ToRs have been submitted for all the activities under the Trust Fund. Yet, a final assessment


4
  The Grant agreement for the Dutch support of the Public Sector Management Credit (PSMAC) reforms was signed
on December 19, 2000 to provide both international and local expertise, goods and training to the Ministry of
Finance, Health, the Health Insurance Fund, the State Audit Office and the Pension Fund in important reform areas
falling under the competences of these institutions. The PSMAC TF was closed on 31 December 2007.

  The PSMAC Trust Fund evaluation ,carried out in 2004, identified PIU inadequacies, low absorption capacity
within reform-implementing organisation and passive supervision by the Bank and Embassy as key problems for the
weak functioning of the Trust Fund. Given the multi-disciplinary character of the Trust Fund activities (several
sectors), a new implementing arrangement introducing single-sector PIU or close to the reform-implementing
organization was introduced with the amendments to the PSMAC TF arrangement signed on 31 March 2005.
Furthermore, the monitoring by the Bank and embassy was strengthened further.

about the impact of the interventions cannot be made given that there are still six months to go before the
end of the activity.

As to the operational efficiency, the communication between the Bank and the embassy on both the
macro-support and the Dutch Trust Fund has been sound. Moreover, the transfer of the function of Task
Team Leader for the Dutch Trust Fund from Washington to the local staff member in the WB Office in
Skopje in the course of the project has contributed towards further improvements in the co-operation
among the beneficiary institutions, the embassy and the Bank on all issues related to the Trust Fund.

Institutional development impact
The PDPL's immediate institutional development impact was sound, very strong in reaching the projected
results under banking supervision and regulation and less strong in reaching the results in the field of
public administration. In the field of judicial reforms, the operation provided the legislative basis for more
noticeable reforms to follow. Overall, the PDPL conditions provided the basis for important reforms in
the field of health sector financial management, the labour market and the business environment. As
shown in Table 1, the Dutch Trust Fund-supported technical assistance covered almost all PDPL reform
areas. While there is still some time to go before the closing date of the Trust Fund, the impact of some
activities can already be measured as shown in table 1.
