{"cdata!": "The overall outcome of the Productive\n            Safety Nets Project (PSNP) Project for Ethiopia was rated\n            satisfactory, the risk to the development outcome was\n            substantial, and the performance of the Bank and Borrower\n            was also rated as satisfactory. The PSNP is a flagship for\n            what can be done to smooth consumption and protect the most\n            vulnerable in a very low-income country. However, the\n            Ethiopian experience is highly contextualized upon the\n            country's twenty year experience with significant\n            amounts of humanitarian relief assistance. In such an\n            environment, the main issue is to reduce distortions and\n            dependency while shifting from emergency food aid to a\n            greater developmental impact. Nonetheless, several lessons\n            from Ethiopia may be relevant to other countries, divided\n            into general design, operational and donor coordination\n            aspects: (a) the extensive analytical underpinning and\n            technical inputs, both at the design stage and during\n            implementation, were critical to program success. The bold\n            policy vision of the PSNP had to be built on a sound and\n            shared understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the\n            present system and clarity on the nature of the problem to\n            be addressed. Complex and high risk reforms such as those\n            embodied in this operation are much more likely to succeed\n            if this foundation is present; and (b) the use of existing\n            Government channels and institutional structures builds\n            ownership but presents capacity issues that need to be\n            addressed. Weaknesses, gaps, and capacity constraints in the\n            overall functioning of government structures need to be\n            strategically addressed upfront. Relying on broad civil\n            service reforms, like changes in salaries and hiring and\n            firing rules, will not ease constraints in the short-term.\n            With the caveat that very few countries besides Ethiopia\n            have the type of existing bureaucratic structure around\n            massive delivery of food aid upon which to piggyback a\n            safety net program."}, "docdt": "2007-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
