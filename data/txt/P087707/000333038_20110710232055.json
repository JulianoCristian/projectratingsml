risk to development outcome was significant,\n            Bank performance was satisfactory, and borrower performance\n            was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            donor coordination can be critical for improving fiscal and\n            institutional capacity of governments and efficiency and\n            effectiveness of social safety nets. Commitments of\n            technical and financial support from donors are most\n            effective when donors align around a common framework and\n            principles for engaging with government. The role of social\n            safety nets in a particular country context evolves over\n            time as SSN institutions are created and the capacity to\n            identify different subgroups of poor and vulnerable\n            households expands. Whereas initially the project was\n            designed to address regular shocks in rural areas leading to\n            annual emergency food appeals, the dialogue has evolved\n            towards programming options to address two different types\n            of poor, rural households: those with longer term potential\n            to graduate out of poverty and those who face chronic\n            challenges. Contingency funds serve a critical role enabling\n            government to scale up safety nets both in terms of transfer\n            size and coverage to address transitory shocks, even in low\n            income countries. Both cash and food transfers can be\n            appropriate depending on specific circumstances, such as the\n            level of seasonal variability in food prices, and it is\n            important to be pragmatic about what mix of transfer types\n            is best. Whatever transfer type, predictability is critical.\n            Achieving timely transfers in low income settings is\n            possible but requires investments in capacity building and\n            continuous monitoring."}, "docdt": "2011-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
