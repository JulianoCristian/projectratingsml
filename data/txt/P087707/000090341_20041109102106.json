The project has the following two components:\n            Component 1) Labor-intensive public work will provide grants\n            to households whose adults participate in public works\n            sub-projects. Sub-projects to be undertaken as part of\n            public works will be determined locally by the beneficiary\n            communities through an annual, participatory planning\n            process. Direct support will provide grants to households\n            who are labor-poor and cannot undertake public works.\n            Component 2) This component will focus on strengthening all\n            aspects of program implementation, including (i) capacity\n            building at community level to strengthen beneficiary\n            identification and local level planning, financial\n            management, procurement and technical training at woreda and\n            regional level to ensure that all sub-projects are\n            appropriately designed and rapid response mechanisms are in\n            place to ensure smooth program implementation; (ii) support\n            to the development of a monitoring and evaluation framework\n            and a program MIS. This includes the implementation of a\n            beneficiary survey, and a detailed program process survey\n            after the first 12 months. It will also finance several\n            additional studies as part of the shift to the second phase\n            of the Adaptable Program Loan (APL); and (iii) procurement\n            of essential goods and services."}, "docdt": "2004-11-03T00:00:00Z"}
