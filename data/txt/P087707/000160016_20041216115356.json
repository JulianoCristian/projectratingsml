"Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net\n            Programme (PSNP) includes a community 'public\n            works' component aimed at developing communal\n            infrastructure and assets in areas of chronic food shortage.\n            Annex 2 of this environmental and social management\n            framework sets out typical adverse impacts that need to be\n            avoided, managed and mitigated to ensure optimum results\n            from the types of subproject expected. Annex 4 sets out a\n            range of mitigating measures that have been found to be\n            useful to offset potential adverse impacts. Detailed\n            mitigating measures recommended to offset adverse impacts\n            for specific types of sub-project will be integrated into\n            the technical specifications, work norms and information\n            kits guiding the implementation of the public works under\n            the PSNP. Training materials and technical specifications,\n            work norms, and information kits will be the primary tool to\n            incorporate mitigation measures and to minimize adverse\n            effects. Training may be needed in developing a basic\n            watershed or catchment area plan and design and sequencing\n            of integrated subprojects for soil and water conservation\n            and watershed regeneration, including: Gully treatment\n            prescriptions, water harvesting structures, rooftop\n            catchment systems, appropriate irrigation technologies,\n            terracing and bunding methods, check dams and other control\n            structures, biological measures for soil and water\n            conservation, and plantation methods and management for\n            effective soil conservation. In order to facilitate the\n            environmental management of medical wastes associated with\n            rehabilitation of rural clinics, a Medical Waste Management\n            Guide for Rural Health Centres will be produced by the PSNP,\n            to establish the process for preparation of waste management\n            plans. Similar guidance will be provided for the development\n            of Integrated Pest Management plans, in connection with\n            projects involving small scale irrigation systems. Farmers\n            may need training on managing the increased number of\n            inputs, including fertilizers, pesticides and their\n            alternatives, management of these systems, the development\n            of water user committees and follow-up extension support to\n            assist farmers and DAs in developing irrigated agriculture,\n            and managing the environmental aspects."}, "docdt": "2004-11-27T00:00:00Z"}
