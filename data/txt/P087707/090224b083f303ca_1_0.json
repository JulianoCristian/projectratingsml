For a\n            quarter-century, images of severe drought and widespread\n            starvation have become relentlessly linked with Ethiopia.\n            Each day, they manage hunger, extreme hardship, and multiple\n            sources of uncertainty. Most vulnerable households work as\n            subsistence farmers on small plots of degraded land, and are\n            subject to the vicissitudes of weather. International\n            Development Association (IDA) financed Productive Safety Net\n            Program (PSNP) which launched in 2005 to help the country\n            shift from an emergency relief system to a more effective\n            development-oriented safety net. Up to 192 million paid\n            workdays have been generated through community projects that\n            addressed some of the roots of food insecurity by\n            rehabilitating severely degraded land and creating\n            productive community assets such as terraced fields, feeder\n            roads, and small-scale irrigation systems. Ethiopia faced a\n            potentially devastating crisis from a vicious circle of\n            drought, food shortages and high food prices. An estimated\n            12 million people were affected. The project drew on the\n            Bank's global experience in safety net design and\n            collaborated with the government in adapting insights to the\n            Ethiopian context. The project played a vital role in\n            warding off famine in 2008. As a result food security\n            improved among participating households, as measured by\n            self-reported caloric intake. Agricultural productivity\n            increased, community water supplies were improved and family\n            health benefited. The government of Ethiopia provided\n            in-kind contributions through program supervision and\n            management support."}, "docdt": "2009-08-29T06:54:05Z"}
