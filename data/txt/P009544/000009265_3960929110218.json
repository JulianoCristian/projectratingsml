This will be\n            achieved by: (a) providing wider and more equitable access\n            to minor irrigation through the introduction of more\n            affordable and manageable irrigation technologies; (b)\n            institutionalizing policy changes recently introduced by the\n            Government of Bangladesh (GOB) to liberalize trade and\n            siting of equipment; (c) upgrading the Bangladesh\n            Agricultural Development Corporation's (BADC)\n            capability to support the private sector through advice,\n            market information and quality enhancement; (d) facilitating\n            access to deep tubewell (DTW) ownership by opening ownership\n            to various forms of association besides traditional\n            cooperatives; and (e) assisting GOB in introducing and\n            maintaining a nation-wide consistent approach to minor\n            irrigation development. To that end, the project provides\n            for irrigation development on some 265,000 ha through\n            financing: (i) procurement of new DTWs; (ii) rehabilitation\n            of about 1,800 existing DTWs; (iii) improvement of drainage\n            canals; and (iv) installation of pontoon mounted pump\n            schemes.  The project also finances: (a) demonstration\n            irrigation systems covering about 10,000 ha; (b) capacity\n            building technical assistance in such areas as environment\n            protection, information dissemination, and private sector\n            support; and (c) technical assistance to support project implementation."}, "docdt": "1991-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
