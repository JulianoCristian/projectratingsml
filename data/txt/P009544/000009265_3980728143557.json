        Irrigation Development Project for Bangladesh were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, project suitability was\n            likely, Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: good sector work prior to appraisal and\n            co-ordination between developments partners can be very\n            valuable in assisting governments to embark on correct, but\n            politically difficult, sector policy changes. Policy changes\n            can have unexpected effects on the viability of investments\n            or the implementation mechanisms. At times of rapid policy\n            change, supervision missions should be alert to re-examine\n            project design assumptions. Promotional activities tend to\n            be long term in their effects and benefits are unlikely to\n            prove dramatic over a normal project period. Success of\n            surface water schemes depends on social/land ownership patterns."}, "docdt": "1998-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
