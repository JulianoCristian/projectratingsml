We also refer to (i) the Section 5.02 of the Development Credit Agreement which

necessary to enable farmer groups to acquire legal personality with appropriate powers 
and functions", and (ii) the letter dated December 11, 1991 from the Economic 
Relations Division (Ref. 18/89/291) requesting that the date of this covenant be 
shifted from December 31, 1991 to June 30, 1992.
I am pleased to inform you that the Association has agreed to amend the 
Development Credit Agreement as follows in accordance with your request:
The date December 31, 1991 in Section 5.02 of the Development Credit Agreement 
is deleted 
and replaced by the following date: June 30, 1992.
 
We furthermore refer to (i) the Addendum to the Agreed Minutes of Negotiations 
for the captioned Credit, forwarded to us by a letter dated April 30, 1991, from the

30% by March 31, 1992; to 15% by December 31, 1992; and to zero by December 31, 1993, 
and (ii) the letter dated December 11, 1991 from the  Economic Relations Division 
(Ref. 18/89/292) requesting that the above timetable for phasing out the subsidy on 
BADC's stock of deep tubewell equipment be modified as follows:
Reduction of the existing subsidy of 70% to 45% by June 30, 1992; to 30% by 
March 31, 1993: to 15% by December 31, 1993; and elimination of the said subsidy 
entirely by December 31, 1994.
I am pleased to advise you that the Association has agreed to the above revised 
timetable and to amend the Addendum to the Agreed Minutes of Negotiations for the 
captioned Credit accordingly.
