i.       RThe Bank has made two loans totalling US$37.5 million to Banco
de ia Republica (BR), the central bank of Colombia, for use by five develoso-
ment finance companies (financieras), namely Colombiana, Nacional, Valle,
Caldas and Norte.  The five financieras have developed into a main source
of term financing of industry. As of December 31, 1968, their assets to-
talled Co1. 2,117.4 million (about US$123.3 million).
ii.       Colombia has undertaken a well-conceived effort to maintain a
more rapid economic growth rate. Its resource base is good and the
necessary supporting policies have re!cently undergone impressive changes
for the better.  The growth of GDP has reached about G6- in 1968 and
gross fixed investment is increasing.   IJanufacturing inctustry has been
growing faster than the rest of the Colombian economy and remains one of
its most dynamic sectors. The Government is increasingly concerned with
accelerating the development of industrial export potential more aggres-
sively.  The f-inancierast role in working towrards these objectives has
been and will continue to be of great importance.
iii.      The financieras have established a good record of operating
experience, and close relationships with the Colombian business community,
the Government and foreign institutions.   Cooperation among themselves
is also close., They devote the bulk of their resources to lending opera-
tions denominated in pesos to their clients, providing both wrorking capital
and fixed asse!ts financing.  In addition they have carried out important
investments in eauity. Their short-term foreign exchange operations, al-
though decreasing, continue to be of importance in helping finance exports
and in improving the financierasl profitability.
iv.       The financieras have relied heavily on their ovn equity to finance
operations and have obtained almost the whole amount of their long-term
borrowings frcm the Bank, BR and the Private Investment Fand. They have
also mobilized some savings by issuingl bonds, and are using lines of credit
from foreign commercial banks.
V.        Their nrofitabilitv records and the aualitv of their portfolios
are mixed.  Colombiana and Caldas, which have had the most promotional out-
look. and conseununtlv are most heavilv inve9t9d in enuitv   have at. this
time the lowest profitability, and their portfolios contain the largest

Bank lending to deveLopment finance companies.
co    Free limits for individual projects wouLd be as in the
preceding loan (US$ 250,000 each for Colombiana and Nacional
and US$ 100,000 for each of the other companies) and the
aggregate amount financed under the free limit would be
set at US$ 3 million each for Colombiana and Nacional and
us$ 1.5 million for eBach of the other companies.
d.    BR would charge the financieras the rate applicable to the
Bank loan (currently 6-1/2%) plus a maximum of 1% p.a. to
cover administrative costs (1/2% in practice). The
financieras would add a minimum of 3% p.a., making a total
rate of 10.-  For borrowers Who prefer not to take the
exchange risk, BR wouild do so for an 8% fee.
ix.      The debt/equity ratio of Norte and Valle wouldl be raised from 4:1
to 5:1.

2.       The C;overnment of Colombia and the five financieras have asked
the Bank for Et third loan. This report reviews recent developments in
their structure and performance, and assesses the suitability of the
financieras for a new loan. It is based on information gathered by mis-
sions to Colombia in July/August, OctDber and December 1968, and acquired
through continuing contact with the financieras.
II.   Trf-l ECON-O11C ENVMROMMENT
Recent Developments
3.       Afte2, the severe exchange crisis of 1966 the Government app:Lied
a complex set of policies to control inflation and improve Colombia's
international reserves, together iith a well-conceived effort to sustain
a more rapid income and employment increase than has been possible since
coffee prices coIlapsed in the mrd-155501s. The results of these policies
and efforts have been positive.'/
4.       Several elements indicate the improvement which is taking place.
The rate of growth of GDP, which averaged 4.4% p.a. over 1962-1967, reached
i/  Cf. the reports "ADpraisal of Five Colombian Private Development
Finance Companies"1, No. DB-28a dated April 20, 1966, and "Appraisal
of Five Private Finance Comnanies in Colombia". No. Dn-40a dated
May 1, 1968, which contain basic information on the financieras.

Colomhia" No. WH-188a, dated Decemehr 30- 19Q68

about -- in 1968.   Gross fixed investment as a percentage of GDP increased
from 15;') in 1965-67 to 18S in 1968, reaching Col$ 16.9 billion.  After a
drastic drop in 1966, BR's international reserves increased by US$57.4
million in 1967 and Us$h5 .0 million in 1968. The growth of non-coffee ex-*
ports, which had almost come to a stop in 1966 after an average growth of
195 p.a. over the 1959-1965 period, resumed in 1967 and amounted to 16% in
that year and 25" in 1968.   Nret inflow of private foreign capital in-
creased from less than US$2(: million in 1967 to an estimated US$50 million
in 1968.
5.       However, the stabilization measures have also created difficul-
ties for scme industrial enterprises. The credit squeeze, which made
working capital scarce, reduced the ability of many enterprises to operate
properly. Depreciation of the peso increased the burden of foreign ex-
change indebtedness contracted when the exchange rate was more favorable.
New enterprises, on the whole, have been harder hit than old established
ones; and financieras, especially those engaged in promoting new enter-
prises, have had difficulties in maintaining the soundness of their port-
folios.
Industry
6.       Industry has an important place in the Colombian economy.    In-
dustrial production accounted for 19.2,5 of GDP in 1967, and industrial
investment, in 1965 (the latest year for Twhich detailed data nre available
on this subiect) was 21.Lo of total investment.   The industrial sector
has experienced growth averaging 7.7% between 1957 and 1966, at a faster
rate than the rest of the economy, and the share of industrial production
in GDP has grown from 14h in 1950 to 19.2,9 in 1967.   This growth has been
deceleratin-rlr however: value added increased by only 5.5i p.a. between
1962 and 1-)1966 and by an estimated 4i in 1967, when supplies of imported
innits w'p- drasticallv reduced.   Basically this appears to reflect the
limited import capacity of the country, coupled to the fact that capacity
installed "M the past has become more fully utilized. leaving less room
for grow-Tth without new investment.
7.       Tlhe overall growth of the economy accelerated in 1968, although
little information is as yet availabl e regarding -rmwth by sector during
the year.  Some data seem to indicate that industry has continued to be
more dynamic than the rest of the economy, and more so in 1968 than in
1967.  Industrial imports represented nearly 705 of all imports both in
1966 and 14,7; however, while the absolute amount of imPorts decreased In
1967, imports of industrial capital goods for industry increased from

revaluing assets and widespread price controls, had largely negative
effects on the direction and the voilume of industrial investment. The
prime concem   of the Colombian authorities at this time is to counter-
act the negative effects of those measures and to help improve the en-
vironment for investment decisions and resource mobilization.   The intro-
duction of a flexible exchange rate was a major step in this direction.
Steps to provide funds and further incentives for industrial investment
are being taken, and the investment outlook is good. The financieras
have contributed to financing export-oriented projects and could play an
even more important role in developing Colombia's export potential.
Finance
9.       The principal source of equity capital for induLstry continues
to be retained earnings and capital subscriptions taking place outside
the stock exchanges.  The companies whose shares are actively traded re-
main a few se:Lected and well-known ones.  However, steps to stop the
flight of capital abroad, restrictions on credit transactions outside the
banking system and tax exemptions on dividend income of individuals have
contributed to a renewed interest in the stock exchange, and its per-
formance and outlookl have markedly improved in the recent past. Transac-
tions more than doubled betwteen 1966 and 1968, and the yields of active
shares have been decreasing recently.
10.       The main financial internediaries continue to be (a) commercial
banks; (b) a well-developed net-work of private financieras. of which the
five associated iath the Bank Group are the oldest and niost experienced;
(c) the Priva-e Tnvestment Fhnd (PTF); a fund established in BR in 1963
which channels external finance to industry, agriculture and mining ven-
tures: and (cli a nimber of Governn-nt. institutinns- including the
Instituto de Fomento Industrial (IFI) to which, after some years of
quuierenPneP increasing streams of pnblic and foreion funds ar hbein'
channeled, ma'ing it a major source of term financing for Colombian in-
dulstryr.  IFTT  as set up to promote and finance inadstr es deemed to be
of special izportance for the country, wihich did not attract private
initiative because of the large invest-ment involved, special risks, or
small initial return.  It continues to be a potential ccmpetitor of the
financieras, arnd its impact on them -will depend onn whether the Government
will want to rake or it the main source of finance for private investment,

rather than a competitor of, the f-n-cerao,     -Ad Jn the recen4t p as  TWrto
relations with them have been close.   The Government has asked for a Bank

Role of the Financieras

sizeable working capital financing, both in pesos and in foreign exchange.



- 4 -
As of December 31, 1968, their assets totalled Col$ 2,117.4 million (abcut
US$123.3 million),  a threefold increase during the past five years.  The
financieras have mobilized a large amount of share ca?ital, most of it
from private sources, C01$ 380 million up to December 31, 1968, and a
significant amount of savings through bond issues. In addition, they have
received and used for industrial financing nearly 50% of all PThIF funds
(Col$ 1.1 billion up to December 31, 1968), sizeable credits provided by
BR, and the proceeds of Bank loans. Finally, they have put to use for
agricultural and industrial purposes both short- and medium-term credit
lines from foreign commercial banks and have engaged in useful and
lucrative ancillary operations (e.g., opening letters of credit). These
operations have evolved with, and reflected changes in the terms of,
resources availability, demand and policy considerations (paras. 32-37)
In the recent past, peso loan /commitments have increased from Co!.$ 400
million in 1966 to Col$ 495 in 1967 and Col$ 766 in 1968.  In 1968,
foreign exchange operations totalled about US$18 million, substantially
less than in the years preceding the 1966 foreign exchange crisis.
Finally, equity investments have taken place in the amount of about
Col$ 50 million p.a.
12.       The fact that the financieras are located t;hroughout the country
has had positive effects.  They have succeeded in mobilizing talents and
resources which might not have been mobilized in their absence.  They have
helped provide continuity to the financing of local needs and more timely
assistance to clients than a single, central institution alone might have
provided. They have contributed to improving investrnent standards through
the discipline of loan covenants related to the pronser capitalization of
enterprises, quality of accounts and information, and technical and mana-
gerial standards, and through close contacts with and advice to their
clients.  On the other hand, they are cooperating with one another through
systematic consultation on matters o- general interest. Coordination has
also been brought about by the need to pool resources in order to finance
large projects, by the presence of common shareholders, by the actions of
the Government and the BR and by -the policies of the World Banlk Group,
which has been associated with the financieras since 1961.
III. THE FINANCIERAS
13.       The five recipients of the proposed loan are discussed individu-
ally in Appendices A through E, which focus on recent developments and on
their present condition.
lThe financieras classify as peso loans all loans, whether financed
from domestic or foreien sources, made in pesos and on which they or
their borrowers have not assumed a foreign exchange risk. This
includes loans made from Bank and PIF funds, to finance imports.
The same classification is followred in the present report, unless
specifically indicated othenwlse.



',hare Capital and Ownership
14.       The aggregate share capital of the flve financieras reached
Col$ 379.7 million as of December 31, 1968.   It grew by about Colt 10
million in 19665, Col$ 20 million in 1967 and ColP 30 million in 1968,
through distributions of stock dividends and new issues.   Its evolution
over the past; three years was as follows (in Col$ million):
1965      1966      1967       1968
Colombiana                   118.3     118.3     118.3     127.8
Nacional                      83.2      84.3      91.3      91.3
Valle                         37.7      38.3      45.9      56.0
Caldas                        5.8       64.4      69.4      79.0
Norte                         22.7      23.1      24.2      25.6
Total                   317.7     328.4     349.1     379.7
Colombianals share capital was static between 1965 and 1967, and grew by
8M in 1968 because of a stock dividend distribution.   Nacional's was in-
creased in 1967, with a right issue under which 700.000 shares were taken
up by shareholders. Vallets share capital grew because of dividends which
shareholders elected to take in stock rather than cash, as well as through
new issues of shares.   The same w.as true of Caldast share capital.  Norte's
share canital has hardly changed over the neriod.
15.       The ristribution of t,he financierasl ownershin as of December 31,
1968 can be summarized as follows (in percent of totals):

Colombiana and Nacional have the largest foreign shareholdings, both in ab-
solute and rElative ternris. Although all five companies have fairly diver-
sified oinership, three or perhaps four have among their shareholders a
group of closely associated investors who do or could dominate the Company

if it suited their purpose. Norte is the clear exception; its ownership
is very widespread, interests from the various parts of the North Coast
are represented, and no dominant group seems to exist.    Banco de Bogota
and Colseguros own about 30'o2 of Colombiana and Banco Come:rcial Antioquefio
is the largest shareholder of Nacional with about 17'a of its shares;
these shareholcderst infMluence is far more important than their holdings

staff reflect the national or regional orientation of the companies and
tvhe degree to -wnich their investment policy is oriented towards promot;inlg
new enterprises. Colombiana, whose activities reflect the broadest geo-
graphical diversification and which is heavily engaged in promotion, has
built up a sizeable staff wuith a variety of skills. The other companies
do not have a comparaDoLe staff or diversity of talent.   On the whole, staff
is adequate for the present workload and for the type of projects the finan-
cieras now handle, which involves largely the financing of existing com-
panies.
19.       Appraisals prepared by the f'inancieras are generally satisfactory,
with some weaknesses in the marketing and technical aspects of projects.
Financieras have used consultants with some success in the preparation of
projects.   Fbllow-up procedures are reasonably well defined, but are gener-
ally adhered to only in the cases of Large projects or projects financed
with Bank, FIF and BR funds. Colombicna and Norte have a good follow-up
coverage; the other financieras might usefully broaden its scope. Accoun-
ting has been or is being mechanized :in all the financieras and is generally
satisfactory. However, in order to nEet the requirements of various agen-
cies, and for internal purposes, the financieras prepare financial state-
ments on different bases, which are not always compatible. Also, the accounts



- 7 -
of each firtanciera are not always comparable wiith those of the others.
Uniformity in the presentation of financial statements would be useful
for analytical purposes, and would decrease accounting work. The use of
statistics and projections as management tools ought to receive more
attention than it does at present. Both matters are 'being taken up with.
the financieras.
20.       I'he financieras need additional staff but cannot rely on new
staff alone to carry the growing wJorkload without increasing substantially
administrative costs.  In order to cope with their increasing volume of
business, the financieras should build up their staff moderately, give
priority to their training, pool staff resources when feasible and make
greater use of consultants. The Bankis advice on appraisals in connection
with the prior approval of large projects has been especially valuable,
and continues to be an important means of upgrading the quality of the
financieras! work.
Resources
21.       Total liabilities and equities of the financieras as of
December 31, 1968 amounted to Col$ 2,117.4 million, a.s shown in the

22.       The financieras have relied heavily on the.r own equity to finance
their operations.  They have increased it through both issues of fresh
shares and retained earnings.
23.       ~'pT, ER and the Bank have nrovided the great bulk of the finan-
cierast long-term loan resources. PIF has channeled through the financieras
about 50%/ of its resources, as they became available from foreign bilateral
sources.  PIF lhas limited funds at present, but expects to obtain at least
US$15.5 million equivalent in 1969'.  FR has been mak.Lng resources available
to the financieras since their establishment, originally under redis-
counting facilities and later under credit lines.   In 1966, BR agreed to

in proportion to the size of their equity. The support that the finan-
cieras are receiving irom BR and FIF indicates tvhe importanc]ue that the
Government attributes to their activity.
2h.       In the recent past, the IWorld Bank has been the main source of
fresh long-term funds for the financieras.   As of iarch 1969, the five
financieras had fully committed the first US$25 million Bank loan and had
disbursed US$20.0 million.   They had committed US$4.6 million of the
second US$12.5 million loan and had approved or had under study loans
exceeding its entire amount There is a gap between approvals and sub-
mission for crediting to ITRD the reason of which is unclear, and appears
to rest with Government agencies. This matter should be discussed during
negotiations.
25.       The financieras have mobilized resources throug7h bond issues,
which they initiated by 1962, and of which Col$ 147.4 million was out-
standing as of December 31, 1968. Their bonds carry a 7"- or 8% interest
rate, and are used mainly for working capital loans.    The practice is to
issue the bonds to selected clients for clearly defined projects, and
these clients discount the bonds wiith their insurance companies, wjhich
have decided in advance to participate in the transaction. The market for
bonds could be broadened if the financieras and the Government took action
to make them more attractive. They cannot compete at present with the new,
high-yielding and tax-exempt securities with a guaranteed market issued
by Government agencies.
26.       The use of lines of credit from foreign commercial banks is
decreasing in several of the companies, but increasing in others. His-
torically,they all used such credits to finance specific export-oriented
projects, such as the Uraba banana plantations, and for import and export
financing and ancillary operations.   Valle and Norte are increasinRlv
utilizing such credit lines encouraged by the dearth of foreign exchange
financing to meet the needs of export in their areas.    The other finan-
cieras are following the opposite course, because the commercial banks
which are their princinal shareholders are serving the short-term foreim
exchange requirements of their clients adequately.
27.       IFI has recently bought short-term maturities from. the loan
nortfo1ios of the financier2s, to the +. -fmt.n of' Clorlt 37_0 million  This
is a new type of operation which should facilitate roll-over of the port-
folios of +the -i nncieras   The finnrnci zrn  obtain2 2-', snrpre  on these
operations and improve their liquidity, while IFI utilizes idle funds.
This is also an indication of the cloe relatonship now existing betwTAeen
IFI and the financieras.
28.       BR has recently been authorized to issue Col.p 100 million in 11,
bonds for reiScounting 11i-ai-ties of enterprises t-ough a ne-wly cret-4

Industrial Finance Fund (IFF). This new facility al:iows rediscounting of
loans on terms up to 5 years granted by financieras and commercial banks to
enterprises with assets not exceeding Col$ 10 million, mainly for working
capital financing in industrial sectors of declared priority. Most finan-
cieras have already begun to utilize this facility.
29.       On balance, and despite difficulties, the financieras have
managed, vith Goveinrinent assistance, to mobilize a significant volume of
resources.
Operational Policies and Record
30.       The policy statements of the five financieras (summarized in
knnex F) are very similar.   They were modified in 1968 by agreement with
the Bank, so as to stress the importance of adding equity features to their
loans whenever possible, in order to counter the erosion of their own
equity caused by devaluation of the peso and to improve their profitability.
This practice is slowlv taking root in Valle and Morte. which are both
active in an environment in which family--owned enterprises are important.
The other financieras appear not to have been able to carry out operaticns
with equity features; they maintain that the environment in which they are
active has not allcwed them to add equiity features to their lonans easily
How,ever, the importance of their trying to do so is not less today than it
w2  when their nol ir'i o were adptd

The substantial increase in the level of commitments in 1967 and 1968 re-
flects the injection of about Col$ 300 million of the first Bank loan,
Col$ 45 m'llion of BR, PIF, and otlher resources, whicch have helped sustain
the level cf industrial investment. The ava.:ilability of adequate funds has
allowed the financieras to make more loans on longer terms and to carry
out more fixed-capital finnncing.
33.       As pointed out above, short-term lendingc is gradually giving
place to medium- and long-term business as appropriate resources become
available. In fact, in the utilization of the second Bank loan the finan-
cieras appear to be! stretching the duration of loans tmade with Bank funds
towards the! maximum allowsed term of 15 years, beyond the needs of the
enterprises tlhey are financing; this matter ha-s been brought to their
attention.
34.       Lending clenominated in foreign exchange and other foreign ex-
change operations such as opening letters of credit, reached a maximum in
1964, when Colombiana and Nacional engaged in operations of this type
amounting to about US$15 million and US$11 million, respectively, partly
because of an agricultural scheme for the export of bananas financed in
conjunction with thle United Fruit Company, with resources provided by the
First National Bank of Boston. Foreigzn exchcnge operations of Coloralbiana,
Nacional, and Caldas are declining in importance; in 1968 they totalled
US$3.0 million, US$l.9 million and US$1.6d million, respectively.  This de-
cline reflects the availability of long-term resources for financing im-
ported fixed capit.l. the decline in demand due to the risk deriving from
foreign exchange indebtedness and to the import restrictions applied after
the 1966 foreign exchange crisis, and the fact that local commercial bariks
appear to be taking care adequately of short-term foreign exchange needs
of their c-Lients. On the other hand. Valle and Norte are giving particu-
lar attention to export Linancing, favored by their geographical location
and by the limited wicight on their Boards of competitors for this type of
business; tihus, their foreign exchange operations are undergoing an iripres-
sive crotjth.  In 1968, Valle s foreign e.change operations totalled
US$7.3 rmilLion and Nortets,US$4.4 million.
35.       Thae financieras' equity investments since 1964 are summarized
below (in ol$ million):

On the whole, the financieras have followed vigorous promotional policies,
which have led to large exposures in some of the companies and, when dif-
ficulties have arisen, to the need for assisting them further, thereby
freezing funds in low-yielding investments. 'Jith the exception of Norte,
they have sustained some losses. In general, the financieras are now
folloving more cautious policies.    For instance, Colombianals equity in-
vestments over the past two years wiere largely due to the need for assis-
ting further companies in which it was already a large shareholder and to
which it had to provide additional capital.
36.       The loans and equity investments referred to above constitute
the principal operations of the financieras, and make up the overwheLming
bulk of their assets. The following table shows how these main items in
their aggregate balance sheets have developed over the past five years
(in Col^) million)

37.       It is notable that Caldas has the largest relative exposure in
share capital investment. This fact is a consequence of the CompanyJs
mission to diversify the Caldas region and of its need to provide, in
marjy cases, the entrepreneurial elcment for new enterprises.  Valle and
Norte, on the other hand, have the smallest equity exposure. They are
also the companies which have had the most rapid growth in the past few
years.  These two companies and Nacional have the largest proportion of
peso loans .-- a reflection of their relatively conservative outlook and
their concentration on existing enterprises.
Cuality of Portfolios
38.       The degree to which the financieras have been active in promo-
tions and the environments in which they are active, have had a marked
influence oni the quality of their portfolios. Colombianals and Caldast
portfolios contain 1the largest elements of risks, and the largest arrears.
These two companies in a substantial way, and Valle and Nacional to a
smaller degree, have suffered losses and will write off additional invest-
ments in the near future. Norte is the only financiera which has not suf-
fered any losses in its first five years of operations and does not fore-
see any. However, most of the companies assisted by the financieras and
which are meeting difficulties are intrinsically sound.   In all cases,
problems are being tackled and it may be expected that portfolios will
improve in qulality, as solutions to the financial and operational problemls
of companies in difficulties are found, and the general situation of the
Colombian economy continues to improve.   Losses have made the managementv
of the financieras more cautious, and new projects are likely to be more
carefully scrutinized.
39.       A more detailed analysis of the portfolio of each financiera is
contained in the Appendices.   Tn all cases, expected losses represent a
small part of the provisions, reserves and unallocated surpluses of the
compni    onerned; +hey are nil in thhe casp of Norte,. 6c in the case of'
Nacional and about 10% for Valle, Colombiana and Caldas.   With very few
exceptions 1loans are amply secured.
F:Jnancial Reesults arnd Structure
)40.      The financ-ieras er.oy sn stantial snreads on funds utilized and,
with the exception of Caldas and Norte, have reasonably low administrative
costs. Since their spreads are similar, returns depend on leverage, size
of equity investraents in new companies and administrative costs.  Their
profitability after taxes over the last two vpars was as follows:

41.       Nacional, Norte and Valle have satisfactory, and growing levels
of profit,  In 1968, net income on their average equity exceeded substan-
tially the rate of inflation and depreciation of the! peso. Administra1;ive
expenses of the year represented 1.0% of average total assets in the case
of Nacional, 1.9% in the case of Valle and 2.8% in the case of Norte, and
may be expected to decrease both for Norte and Valle! as their total
resources increase, improving further the return on total assets. Caldas I
profitabi:lity is :Low and has been declining for seve?ral years. Its adrmin-
istrative costs, 3.5% of average assets utilized in 1968, bite sharply into
its returns, and its leverage is low. (Colombianats profits are also modest,
and the lowest in relation to assets used, but have improved in the past
few months. The profitability of these tw-o companies needs watching. The
lower profCit performance of the two companies must be considered a cost; of
their development effort, and of the costly administrative structure it
entails, and may be compensated in the long run wihen equity investments
come to fruition.
42.       The debt-to-equity ratios as of the end of' 1968 of Colombiana
(3.5:1), Nacional (2.4:1), and Caldas (2.5:1) are well within the limilts
agreed upon with the Bank (five times for Colombiana and Nacional and f'our
times for Caldas).. Accordinglvy there is ample room for additional borrow-
ings. On the other hand, the debt-to-equity ratios of Valle (3.8:1)
and Norte (3.7:1) as of December 31. 1968 are close to the i to 1 limit
agreed upon with the Bank.  These two companies plan to increase their
share  anpLtal.  Nevertheless, the exnected growth of their operations
would cause them to exceed their contractual restriction. Both Valle and
Norte are conservativelv run and have sound nortfolios.   They have len-t out
about 70%. of their own equity, and have lent funds made available to them
on terms shorter than the ones madie to them; so that their cash generatJion
and cash receipts deriving from loan repayments available to cover deblt
seorviceP reuidrements prnvi r1, snhq:t.antAial margins of safPetv_ nlfalults of
the magnitude necessary to hamper their debt-servicing capacity are highly
unlikely.  A relaxvation of their rdenbt. ljmimi.tion to five times their eoquiy
would therefore be in order.

Value of Shares and Dividend Policy

ar1'd Caldas are listed on-, trheu - Colomb..i-cA 'Eockl. -chang r  es J. Vsax L-V._ -1-

163 for ColoMbiana, l"' for Nacional, `h4 for Norte, 137 for Valle and
131 for Caldas.
45.       The financieras have generally followed a prudent dividend policy,
Duilt up reserves or capitalized their earnings. They have often declared
optional dividends, in cash or shares,, iath the expectation (largely ful-
filled), and at times the understanding, that these would be'taken up in
stock. Only Nacional has managed to pay increasing cash dividends since
1963, currently at the rate of !,.h, p.a.  Shares of wel:L-imown companies
are actively traded on the Colombian ;,tocl Fxchanges at yields averaging
12.5;,. If the financieras want to be able to tap the local market for
share capital they must increasingly direct their policy towiards payment
of larger cash dividends as Nacional has done. This is the general thinking
of the managers of the financieras, at the present time. However, they
are aware also of the need for building up reserves in keeping with the
size and quality of their portfolios.
Evaluation
46.       The financieras are fulfilling important and growing roles in the
economic development of Colombia. They have been among the main providers
of term capital for industry in the form of both equity and loans. They
have financed urgent working capital needs in a situation of credit tight-
ness, and assured continuity to the financing of local needs through a
period of crisis in Colombia during which liquid resources wrere scarce.
Portfolio problems encountered by some of them are largeLy the price of the
promotion and development of new industrial activities, and the negative
side-effects of recent stabilization measures. The financieras have mo-
bilized substantial amounts of human and financial resources which would
probably not have been tapped in their absence, and have contributed to
better standards of accounting, project evaluation and capitalization of
companies.
L7.       The performance of each financiera has differed somewhat from
that of the others:
(a)   Following a period of vigorous promotion which led to large
cormitments and some losses, Colombianals new management is giving prioritv
to the problems of certain large clients who are in difficulties.
Colombiana has a large and skilled staff and can be exDected to coDe satis-
factorily with the difficulties the Company has met.   The Company is fol-
lcwing a realistic and prudent nolicv of consolidation. New nommitments
in equities in 1907 and 1968 were generally limited to additional investments



- 15 -
in companies in which Colombiana already had an interest and working
capital fiLnancing loomed large. In late 1968 the availability of new
Bank funds alloweed a new increase in the tempo of approvals and lending
for fixed canital. DePsnite continuing difficulties in its portfolio,
Colombiana's general financial position is reasonably satisfactory.
Profitability, although low owing to poor income from the equity port-
folio and the need for writing off losses, has shown a marked improvement
in the recent few months and efforts to imnrove the nortfolio can be
expected to enhance it further. Its contribution to the country's
economic dievelopmernt continues to he verv important.
(h) NManional anpears to be the strongest and the most consis-
tently profitabTleof the financieras. Its management is conservative.
Tt has a s:mill but competent and nffpe-tve staff- and its administrative
expenses are low. The Company's operations are concentrated in the
lp.annrt.mPn+ nf An+tinni n  nndl i+,A ln-rafs ctlients are amonng tf  hest
Colombian enterprises. The incidence of arrears is therefore negligible,
its portfolio is strong and its equity portfolio produces a hitgh rate nf
return.  Nacional has been trying to maximize its profits as early as
possible E;O as to increase its dividend distribution and thereby develop
a market for its shares, thus assuring its further growth.
(c) Valle has experienced management and adequate staff. Its
profitabi.ity recrd is quite good. TheV Comparny ls active lnM anY area 2

IV.   PROSPECTS
Economic Outlook
48.       Colombia' -splanned Investment effort is intended to support a 6%
annual growth rate.-    It assumes substantial external support.  New
revenue measures and strict control of expenditures have already improved
the Government's financial situation, and further measures to increase
fiscal revenues and improve the fiscal treatment of productive enterprises
are being considered. Measures recently taken and under consideration
would permit total bank credit to increase adequately over the next few
years, with an increasing share of this credit going to the private sec-
tor. The Consultative Group on development assistance to Colombia agreed
in January that Colombia's recent economic performance and development
prospects justified continued substantial assistance from members of the
Group.
49.       Gross domestic Droduct is exnected to grow. at current market
prices, from an estimated Col$ 93 billion in 1968 to Col$ 168 billion in
1973, and gross investment to gmrw Romowhat. more rapidlv frnm ronl  17
billion to Col$ 36 billion over the period. These expectations are
deemed reasonable by the Bank.
',.       On the hasis of the projected total invest.ent, invest.ents in
industry would increase from Col$ 3,015 million in 1969 to Col$ 5,460
mnillion in 19Q7 were it to repres3r+ 1% of total inves+wment;, ad f
Col$ 4,020 million in 1969 to Col$ 7,277 million in L973 at a 20% level.
In the past, ind9ustrial investm.en.t hag already exceeded 20% Of the total
investment, and needs for industrial investment should be even larger if
the sector is to rema-   .ore  A--4C than 4tbe rest of± thJ-e no!,i   ec--
nomy, and if programs for further increases in non-coffee exports receive

The Financieras' Programs
51.        The financierasl projections (Appendices A through E, Tables 7,
8 and 9) assume an average annual increase in total resources utilized of
about 20% over the 1968 level. The assumed total average level of growth
is in line both with the expected growth of the country and with the ex--
perience of the financieras between 1963 and 1967 (which included two years
of recession), and in 1968, when their growth was 26%. In peso terms, the
assets of the financieras increased by 224% between 1963 and 1968; taking
into accouritdeprec:iation of the peso, their growth in dollar terms was about
90%. In peso terms, growth is expected to increase by 160% up to 1973; this
should allow for substantial real growth given the expectations for in-
creased stabilityv
52.        The prog!rams of the financieras assume substantial Bank support,
With such support they should be able to carry on effectively a larger vro-
lume of bus;iness  Additional forei0n exchange requirements for term lending
are expected to be covered from bilateral credits, mainly through PIF.
Recent statements of members of the Consunltative Group seem to inrii ate
that this expectation is reasonable.
53.        The availability of funds to cover local currency requirements
through bond issues, loans from the BR and rediscounting with the newly
created IFF will depend largely on the Governmentts policy towards expansio;3
of the pri-ate sector, which is favorable.  Assumed increases are general.ly
in line with past experience. There are, however, uncertainties about the
future role of IFIT which could blur tIe picture.
54~.       On the basils of past perforrance, projects under study and
Colombiats investment targets, the financieras expect to approve peso
loans of about   ol$ 2 b3illion and to commit Col$ 1.8 billion over
the next two years. Until mid-1966 their level of business was curtailed
b-y the avaiialiiity of resources, and the injection of Bank funds allowEd
them to substantia].ly increase approvals in 1966-1967 and commitments in
1967-1768, mostly against a background of economic recession.  Approvals
of projects for Bank financing represented about 27% of total approvals
for 1906 and 1967, and disbursements of Bank funds in 1967 and 1968 re-
presented about 27% of disbursements for the same period. Apart from
prospects i:or P'±F replenishment the financieras have no foreign exchange
available for undertaking new term operations.
55.        In the past approximately 70% of loans denominated in pesos
have been for local currency expenditures and 30% for imports. On the
basis of the investment expectations of the financieras, their long-term
foreign exchange requirements over the next two years would represent
about US$32 million on a commitment basis. PIF may be expected to cover
between US$5 and US$10 million of -these requirements. By granting a loan
amounting to US$25 million, the Bank would close the resource gap, on a
basis consistent with the rate of approvals and disbursements under the
first two Bank loans. The growth of Colombian industry appears to have



- 18 -
been hampered by inadequate import capacity and US$2 million over a two-
year period wouid represent less than 10% of Colombiais imports of capitaL
goods for industry.
56.       To secure peso funds and to maintain a prudent debt to equity
relationship vwithin the level of borrowrings which their programs call for,
the financieras wil:L have to increase their equities. All plan to do so.
This entails, in addltion to retained earnings, substantial share capita:l
increases over the next five years.
Creditworthiness
57.       The financieras have performed creditably.   Their portfolios are,
in general, of a satisfactory quality and the riskier elements they contain
are amply protected by security and by reserves.   Some losses have alreatf-
been written off and expected losses are limited. The managements of the
financieras are on the whole more cautious than in the past.   The positive
change in the economic environment in which they are active and the fact
that problems are aclknowledged and tackled enhance the prospects of
creditable performance.
58.       The term :Liquidity of the financieras is generally good. Their
earnings prospects are good and their cash generation substantial.   How-
ever, Colombiana and Caldas may experience some proolems of liquidity if
their portfolios do not improve. They are aware of the problem.
59.      AAll the f:inancieras should be able to generate the cash required,
with a corfortable cushion, to service present debt and the proposed Ban1c
loan.
V. PRINCIPAL TERMS OF PROPOSED LOA.N
60.       Th-e previous Bank loans to the financieras were channelled through
the BR. Th:Ls arrangement works satisfactorily, and all the interested
parties agree that it should be retained.
61.       During negZotiation of the first Bank loan, there was discussion of
the role of ER in screening projects submitted for Bank financing. It was
understood -tihat BR would limit its review to considerations of economic
priority, but would refrain from looking into the business merits of projects.
It develo,ed, however, that both PR and the Instituto del Comercio Exter:Lor
(INCOO4EX) became increasingly involved wi-th the merits of individual
proposals, wihich resulted in delayv in the submission of nroiects and in an
increasing examination of the business aspects of projects, and substantia:L
changes in some of them. During negotiation of' the seond loan, the Panlk
explicitly acknowledged the objectives of the Governmentts review of the
economic asuects of nroiercts- hbt. i nsizt.Ptd thJt. re-vik, rshouiild not. corvni er
their business aspects.  Delays in the submlission of projects to the Bank



continue, however, to take olace.   This mnatter w-jas discussed during
negotiations and it wras ascertained that tlhe Government was in fact follow-
ing these guidelines, but that the delays observed resulted from the involve-
ment of twio governmental agencies, in addition to BR: the National Planning
Board, for matters of economic priority, and ITNC01EX, for the issuance of
the necessary import licenses.   BR has given assuranc.es that measures would
be taken to sneed un the nassage of nrojects through these various agencies.
62.       Under the first loan pro;iects were examined and the nroceeds of
the loan credited on a first-come-first-served basis. There was no prior
allotment of the loan among the financipraq. hprnanqp -it. was felt that su2h
allotment would work to the disadvantage of the more active and efficient

which they have unhesitatingly exercised, of borrowing in pesos. The
appropriateness oI the rate and the fee wvas re-examined by the Government,
BR and the financieras in the light of present circumstances, and they decided
to continue the same arrangements for the proposed third loan.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RIBCOMENDATIONS
64.      The financieras may be expected to commit long-term foreign
exchange resources in the next two vears in excess of US$ 25 million.   Thev
are making effective use of the first two Bank loans, and are suitable
recipients for the proposed loan. Such a loan would help ensure continued
improvement of their operations and help strengthen their role in the
economic develonment of Colcmbi-a. It wniild assist the contin-med g_owth of
the most dynamic sector of the Colombian economy.
65.      It is recommended that a loan of US$ 25.0 miJlion be made for the
financieras -  TR trwild borrowen! from +the Bank, an.d the proreeds nf the loanl
would be used by the financieras, as agreed during negotiations, as follows:

of its allocation,
b     T erms and conditions oI the loan would be tnose normal- for
Bank lending to development finance ccmrpanies.
co    Free limits for individual projects would be as in the pre-
ceding loan (uSs 250,000 each for Colombiana and Nacional
and US$ 100,000 for each of the other companies) and the
aggregate amount of projects that could be financed under
the free limit would be US$ 3 million each for Colambiana
and Naclonal and US$ 1.5 mllion for each of the other three
ccmpanies.
do    IR would charge the financieras the rate applicable to the
Bank loan (currently- 6-1/2%) plus a maxim:um of Lo5 p.a. to
cover administrative costs (1/2% in practice).   The
finanicieras would add a minimum of 351 p.a., making an interest
rate of 10%.  If the ultimate borrower does not wish to take
the exchange risk, the BR would be prepared to do so for a
fee of 8%.
66.      The debt/equity ratio of INorte and Valle would be raised from 4:. 1
to 5:1.

CORPOPUCION FINANCIIIIA COLOKBIJAINA
I.  IhTRODUCTION
1.     The Corporacion Financiera Colombiana (Colombiana), which
started operations in 1959, was the first institution of this kind to
be formed in Colombia. The Company, located in Bogota, is active in
most Dapartments c,f the country. Its equity and loan operations cover
a large range of economic activities with special emphasis on metals
and engineering, chemicals and textiles, as well as agriculture and
livestock.. Post operations are concentrated in the Departments of
Cundinamarca (Bogota), Valle, Bolivar and Antioquia.
2.     The Bogota area is the most high:Ly industrialized of tlhe
country. 'It accounts for 26% of the total labor employed and for 23%
of gross industrial production in Colombia. The development of the
industriaL sector in this area should growj at least apace with the
general economic development of -the cOUntry and Colombianals operations
should benefit from it.
II. TME ClCOMPAAY
Share Capital and Ownership
3.     Dissatisfied w,ith the status of Colombianats affairs, a group of
shareholders comprising Banco de Bo,ot&, Compania Cc,lombiana de Seguros
and Banco del Comercio, obtained control of the financiera early in
1967 by increasing their cumulative share capital holdings from 11% to
35%. This transaction had no effect on the distribution of ownership
between foreign and local shareholders.  In 1968, Colombianals share
capital increased fromi Col$ 118.3 million to Col$ 127.8 million
(authorized capital Co1$ 200 million) b;y capitalization of earnings
through distribution of a stock dividend. As may be: seen in Annex 1,
53.1% of the shares are in the hands of Colombian institutions and
individuals, 48.7% of the total being private. IFC, with over 15%, is the
second largest shareholder. 31% of the shares belong to 25 foreign or
foreign-controlled cornpanies.
The Board
4.     Colombianats Board of Directors (Annex 2), elected to serve for
two years, comprises leading Colombian and foreign bankers and business-
men. Its present chairman, Jorge Mej1a Salazar, an influential and
resnected nerson, is President ofi Banco de Bogota. the largest commercial
bank in Colombia, and a member of the llonetary Board.  IIr. MejTa1s

been steadily decreasing, over the past fewJ years. This has been partly 
due to repayments related to a large schqeme for the financing of

Operations
150        A break--down of peso lending operations is given in Annex 3,
Tn 1966I T.rth long-term fwnds readi  avilable fraom the Bank and PUP. the
Company approved loans totallinrg Col$ 317.8 miLLion. Of this total about
80X, was extended4 for a period over 5 years an"d about 90% was for fixed
capital investments.  IWith smaller availability of term funds in 1967 and
196U8, ULh jJpropo-- ofL longer-term. approIvls d ciedI  At the s   t 
Coloambianals new management started giving priority to the support of
com-rparies already in the portfoloi, and workig c      financing
increased substantially in 1967 and 1968. After the second Bank loan
became effective on September 30, 1968, approvals increased an,d the total
for 1968, Col$ 207.2 mi.llion, exceeded the 1967 level by about Coi$ 57e0
million. This level is sti-l substantially lower than in 1966a
16.        Colombiana's lending activity has been well diversified in
various economi.c sectors. The Corpanyrs management has given particular
attention to the support of agriculture and cattle raising and intends to
enter tourism cdevelopment, The geographical distribution of Colombianas
portfolio is the most widespread among the financieras. 60,; of its loans
and an even larger proportion of its equity investments lhave been made
outside its hoae province of Cundinainarca. Because of scarcity in
resources in 19?67 and early 1968, Colombiana extended most of its new
lending to its traditional clients.
17.        Colombiana had been very promotion-minded up to 1966, as a
result of which its exposure in equities (Col$ 130.2 million includ-ing
underwriting commitments) had risen to 68J of its net worth. In 19657
and 1968, new equity investmenits have been confined largely to assisting,
almost entirely by necessity, companies in which it already had consi-
derable exposure. Main recipients of recent equity investments have been
Tolcen,ento in which Colombiana held by end 1968 Col$ 45.lmillion ecluity (an
increase in 1967-68 of Col$ 314.1 million) and Forjas de Colombia, in
which Colombiana increased its equity investment in 1967-68 by Col$ 2.5
million to Col$ 9.0 million. Notwithstanding--the substantial cut-back
in promotional activity and in spite of w-rite-offs in the eqluty pc,rtfollo
totalling Co1$ 1.6 million in 1967-68, Colombianals equity portfolio
continued to rise faster than its net worth. By the end of 1968, Colom-
biana's exposure in equities (Col$ 153.0 million.) had further risern to
734< of its net; worthe
13.        Colombiana has steadily increased its guarantee commitmentsm
In 19657 it eranted five guarantees. totalling Col$ 5.9 million in 'Local
currency and Col$ 7.5 milliorn in foreign exchange, and in 1968 it granted
three totalling Coll 2.0 million in local currency and Col$ 3300 million
in foreign exchange, It has carried out this type of business partly to
off-set the decrease in nrofitabilitv due to the tapering-off of e:xort-
import financing and partly to support one of its large equity investments.,

reserve, has undertaken to allocate to the reserve for the protection of
equity inavestments not less than 30%0 of the ComparyWs annual profit. This
policy was agreed upon by Colombiana during negotiation of the second Bank
loan.
210        Colombiana'ls provisions, reserves and unallocated surplus .Lt
the end of 1968 totalled Col$ 82.2 million and are adequate to cover-
expected losses, which represent only 7 % of retained earnings and un-
foressen losses of the same order of magnitude as the ones which took
place in the past three years, on average about Col.$ 3 million per year.
22.        Annex 6 contains Colorabianals recent income statements. Figures
for 1967 and 1968 are not fully conparable with figures for 1965 and 1966,
since accounts were kept on an accrual basis until the end of 1966 an1 on
a receipt basis thereafter.  In addition, part of the tax provision in
1967 represents an adjustment in respect of 1966 taxes payable. Allotwing
for these elements, profitability (as a percentage of average equity)
declined from 15.7% in 1965 to 8.7%0 in 1966. This was mainly because of
write-offss, a decrease in leverage and the higher incidence of taxation
(decrease in allowJed tax-free allocations to reserves). The declining
trend continued in 1967 when net income declined to 6.3%, reflecting
decreases in technical assistance and promotional fees as well as in
income from dividends and from foreign exchange operations. However, the
trend was reversed during 1968 iwhen net income increased to 8.9% reflecting
mainly an increase in the gross interest spread from 4.3% in 1967 to 4.7%
in 1968, a lower incidence of taxation, and foreign exchange gains tctalling
Col$ 3.1 million.  (Conversion of loans receivable in US$ into Col$).
23.        Colombiana's management of resources has been reasonably Pood.
The Company has been able to cape successfully with the problem of
increasing cost of resources.  It borrows at rates betw^een 4) and l' n.a.
and lends at rates from 8% to 18% p.a, Interest income as a percentage of
the average lnarn portfolio has been increasing faster than financial costs

spread waVfS about 5Co   C ,4 -   .as a   is, ,          411 i-;+  AI1 fwi ds;_
As of Decemaber--31., 1968, Colombiaaa had invested approximately Gol$ 12

interest rate and have a yield of 14-15iA, and Co1$ 2.8 mil7lon in Certi-
ficados de AbonoToritbutario, a sec-Lurity w-hch can be utilized to pay taxes
and which yields 18% p.a.
24.        Dividend income has fallen largely becau3e of the worsening
situation of two companies (El lEabrador and IndustrLa Ganadera Colombiana)g
which in the past provided 50-70, of Colombiana s dividend incomeo   The
yi-eld of the equity portfolio was negligible in 1968.  Loans Tith profi-
sharing arrangements are being repaid and the income they rendered is
decreasing.
25.        Colombiana's loan and guarantee portfolio as of Decemdber 31, 19060,
totalled Col$ 702.4 million, in -favor of about 200 clients, Arrears have
varied substantially from month to month, depending on whether repayments of
loans related to large clients take place or not, or are rescheduled, but
they are generally high.  As of December 31, 1968, loan overdues were Col$27.8
million,representing 4.7% of the loan portfolio, and the total amount of loans
due from ciients in arrears amounted to Co1$i.4r5 Miilion,or 19.3%.
26,        Colombianals equity portfolio contains a. substantial element
of rislk   The prospects of the company in which Co'lombiana has the largest
holding, Tolcemenito, although improved, are still unclear. Petroquilr:Lca
Colombiana is operating at a loss and it has, like Tolcemento, a serious
structural market problem.  Other companies are operating in an unsat:is-
factory way. On the other hand, the prospects of campanies which appeared
in difficulties in the recent past, like Forjas de Colombia, Nylon Co:Lomi-
bianos S.A. and Abonos Colombianos have improved in varying degrees.
Colombiana estinates that the cost of the portfolio exceeds its value by
about Col$ 6eO nillion.
27.        The quality of Colombiana's portfolio continues to be mixed.
Problems are being taclaed, and it can be hoped that the portfolio will
imDrove in qualitv as solutions to the financial and operational problems
of the largest companies are found. In some cases, however, problems may
well be largely structural and solutions difficult to find and implertent.
Market Vralue of Shares. Dividend Policy
28.        Colombianals shares are not listed on a stock exchange and their
trading has taken place mainly in connection with the takeover by the Banco
de Bogot. group. Hence, they do not have a fairly assessed market value-
Their book value increased froin Col$ 12.4 at end-1.965 to-Col$ 16e1 at end-
1966, and was Col$ 16.0 at end-1967 and Col$ 16.3 at end-1968.
29.        In 1967, after two years without dividend distributions, an lLo
dividend was paid, representing an 82iZ payout on the 1966 income after w.rite-
offs for bad debts. In 1968, because of the decrease in reserves, C lorbiana
paid a stocki rather than a casti dividend, at the lower rate of 8A.  En Februar
1969, Colombiana declared an 8,O cash dividend, representing a 58A payout rat o
out of 1968 earnings. Colombianals management feels that a policy of con-
tinuing dividend distributions is necessary in or(ier--to meet shareholder
expectations.   Compatibly with a reasonable build-up of reserves, such a
policy appears justified.



APPENDIX A.
Page 8
III. PROSPEC_S
30.      Colombiana hias prepared projections for the 1969-1973 period
based on a yearly -level of peso commitments averaging about Col$ 320
million and of disbursements averaging about Col$ 270 million p.a.
(Annexes 7, 8 & 9).. The prospects for the industrial growth of the
country are good, particularly in the light of expected growing
financial stability and improving credit conditions. These prospects
justify exoectations of growing business for Colombiana. However,
although the main constraint on Colombiana's past operations was the
availability of resources, the annual level of business assumed for
the next several years is about double that of the past five years and
seems optimistic.  Annual levels of commitments and clisbursements
averaging about Col$ 250 million are more likely to be attained.
31.      To support its forecast commitments, Colombiana assumed that
the Bank would provide three loans for the Colombian financieras over
the five-year periDd, out of which US$22.5 million would be utilized
by Colombiana. Projections of fuinds expected to be obtained from BR,
PIF and otlher internal sources seem on balance to be attainable.  The
net amount of bonds outstanding is expected to increase very moderately.
Proposed share capital increases (Col$ 65.0 million) almost equal the
amount of dividends planned (Col$ 72.0 million).
32.     NIet income after taxes is forecast to reaclh about 17% of average
share capital and 10.5% of average equity by the end of 1970, compared
with 1L.5% of share capital and 8.5% of equity in 1968.  Profitability
waill continue increasing thereafter. The debt/equity ratio would reach
3.8:1 by 1970 and 4.6:1 by 1973, within the 5:1 limitation.  A good
share of the improved profitability is expected to result from the
increased leverage, but fees and dlividend income are also expected to
increase substantially. This may be attainable if the situation of
companies in the portfolio continues to be followed-up closely by
Colombiana. and if Colombiana continues to give them its support.
33.      On balance, Cclombiana's prospects have improved and the
cautious policy fcllowed by the new management is paying off in terms
of improved prospects for the weaker investments in the portfolio.  This
trend may be expected to continue.
IV. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOIDMEDATIONS
3b.      Colombiana is the largest and oldest of the Colombian financieiras
associated witlh the Bank Group, and in general, notwithstanding the exist-
ence of pnroblem. cases in its portfolio. it has perfcrmed creditably.



APPEENDIX A
Pa,ge 9
It has macie a substantial contribution to the economic development of
the country by providing medium- and long-term loan capital, and
substantial amounts of equity capital.  It has continuously operated
on a national scale and followed a vigorous promotional policy.
35.      T'he leading role it took in promoting enterprises led to large
comrnitments in thern and to an exoDsure to considerable risk.  The new
management of the Company inherited a difficult situation, and has, so
far; follomed a cautious policy of consolidation. The prospects of
some of thle largest of Colombianals commitments have improved.  Colombiarn
should continue to give attention to the problem of arrears, by improving
its recovely procedures and devising adequate refinancing schemes for the
larg,est ccmnanies in arrears-
36.      in vT( of'   irmihjjiana - i mportant role within the national
econormy, aLS well as on the basis of recent performance, the Company
continues to 1-be p,'iiwnof1 and is a suitable recipient of the proposed
loan.

I.   INTRODUCTION
1.       The Dbpartment of Antioquia has the second largest concentration
of industry in Colombia, principally in the Mledollin area.    The city of
Medellin itself contains 72;' of the regionts industrial enterprises, and
the surrounding valley of Medellin holds an additionaL 20%.      This valley
has been favorably endowed with natural resources, which include plenti-
ful water power resources from nearby mountains, a temperate climate, and
coal deposits.    The backbone of this industrial compLex is the textile
industrv.    Of increasing importance are the metals and plastics induas-
tries.   In comparison with the country as a whole, Antioquia contains
one-fourth of the industrial worlc force. whose output is eual to 22% of
total industrial production.    Industrial growth has also been favored
by a supply of engineers and busin-ess graruates from the Univnrsitv of
Antioquia and the School of Mines.
2.       Since the middle of the 1'50's, the leading role in the promo-
tion of Co]c)mynhian indust+.ryu has pase  t  he rbat.et    f Cunrlinrimirn

The Board
4.       Fh.l1 powers for conducting NacionalPs affairs are vested in a
ten-member Board (Annex 2), consisting of leading bankers and industria-
lists.   The Board meets weekly and takes a close interest in onerations:
its influence is considerable. It is a valuable source of information
regarding the activities and financial eondition of NcrionalIs clients.
and the management relies heavily on its advice.    Each of the directors
and their alternates is elec-ted for a period of one year, hut the m2-
jority of members have been continuously re-elected.
Mlanagement and Staff
5.       Dr. Jose Gutierrez Gomez has been President since 1959.    Pre-
viously he .Tas Pr,es'idn,t of the National Assoc-iation of Inustrialists,
and Ambassaclor to the United States. He has played the leading role in
the management of the rCompany, a   itQs achievements owe a get deal to
..~~~~~~_   ..-   -  M.z -   -V1  -La" N  V\SAL v  - ;  u S  |s  sl l  UO   VibC-6 UW 'U
his efforts.   The sole Vice President is Dr. Carlos Restrepo, who joined
the Copan- in 1960 and is a la4 - -er by train-ing.  Te other vice presi--
dency has remained vacant since 1965.   Since the Company depends entirely
on otsid  cWlssula4t  for egnrlgskills      it 'I-anigtofl
this position trith an experienced engineer.
6.       Twelve of the Companyls total staff of 35 are professionals.
The present; staff h,as not expanded in the last couple oI years, and manage-
ment    is aware that some new personnel will have to be added if opera-
tions are lo be successIully expanded.   Present pians cali for three new
departments (in addition to the existing six) to be created under the
presently vacant vice presidency.
Appraisal and Foliow-up Procedures
7.      iAppraisals submitted by Nacional have generally ranged from ade-
quate to good, wvith some wealcness in the marketing and engineering aspects
of project3.
8.       Follow-up activity has been limited, and is chiefly restricted
to the Companyts major clients. This is mainly due to limited staff.
The situation has improved, however.   During the first 10 months of 1968,
29 borrowers were visited, as against 24 for the whole of 1967. On the
positive side too, is the concentration of Nacionalts clients in
Antioquia, and the presence of the major regional banks in its Board. As
a consequence, Nacional is wiell awrare in most cases of the financial conI-
dition and prospects of its clients. In addition, where Nacional has an
equity interest, its staff closely watches operations.
Resources
9.       The composition of resources available to Nacional following the
granting of the first Bank loan tc the five financieras has changed to

when the second loan was allocated, and Nacional received 30% of its
total amount.

lending in Antioquia, from 78% of total loans in 1966 to 85% in 1968.
Lending to the textile, and food, beverage and tobacco sectors continues
to be substantial, and has generally been maintained at levels of about
4   and 17oI, respectively. The metals/engineerlne sector con.tinues to  e
increasing:Ly favored. It accounted for 7% of all loans in 1966, 11% in
1967 and 13%o in 1968. Nacionaits policy of lenrding to its traditional
customers in Yledellin is a conservative approach, which minimizes risk
and maximizes near.-term Drofits.  Nacionalls clients in the textilLe in-
dustry are among its largest and most well established.   They include
Coltejer, Fabricato, and Tejicondor, which together control o5% of thbe
Colombian textile market. These companies are also represented on
Nacionalis Board. Loans to new companies accounted for 20% of the totaL
in 1966, but only 5% in 1968.
14.       The effect of the first two Bank loans upon operations is clear
from the follolwing (in Col$ million):
1966       1967       1968
ApDrovals                316.5      142.7      199.6
Commitments               99.8      126.2      204.4
The decrease in approvals in 1967 reflects the lack of resources
available following the commitment of the first loan while commitments
in that year increased because of approvals of the previous year. In
1968,approvals increased again following the granting of the second Bank
loan and of a new loan from BR.
15.       Nacional has not felt the need to engage substantially in
short-term import and export financing since commercial banks appear tc
be rmieeting existing needs, and Nacionalls management feels that the
Company should not compete with the banlcs which are its shareholders
and which provide it with valuable assistance.
16.       Nacional's eQuity investments represent about 60% of its own
equity, well under the policy limitation of 100% of equity.   This reflects
the judgment of management that equity investments in new companies wi-ll
not show as favorable a rate of return as will loaned funds -- the em-
phasis being on profitability in the shorter term.   During 1968, Nacional
increased the amount of its existing investment in six companies. Only
in the case of Ganadera Nacional (Col$ 3.3 million) and Forjas de Colombia
(Col$ 1.2 million) did each increase amount to more than Col$ 600 thou;3and.
Nacional also acquired an interest (Col$ 800 thousand) in Ecuatoriana de
Desarrollo S.A. (COFIEC) and wrote off investments in two promotion com-
panies (see para. 20). In order to participate better in clientls profits,
and as a hedge against inflation, Nacional undertook in connection
with the second Bank loan to make loans with equity features wherever
possible. As yet, no loans granted by the Company ;have contained this

tive policy of management.   Nacional operates well within its debt/equity
limitation of 5:1.  Lte-verage on captal has Increased only slightly in
recent years from 2.1:1 at December 31, 1966 to 2.4:1 at year-end 1968.
The proportion of equity inveStment to total portfolio has decl-ined
slightly due to the greater interest of management in lending operations,
and was equEi to 21.3o% of the total in 1960 and 108.3% in 1968.  Manage-
ment has been careful to maintain reserves at a comfortable level, and at
December 31, 1968, reserves and unappropriated earnings were equal to
10.2% of total portfolio and contingent liabilities, and were ample in re-
lation to expected losses. Nacional has also maintained good liquidity.
l0.       Recent financial statements reflect a marked increase in peso
loans from Coll3 202 million in 1966 to Col$ 348 million in 1968, as well
as a substantial decline in foreign exchange operations (largely import
and export financing to 180 days) from Col$ 68 million in 1966 to Co0$ 16
million in 1968.  Not only were changes in demand a factor for both these
trends, but in the case of foreign exchange operations, the decline has
also resulted from Nacional's oin desire to minimize this aspect of its
operations (see para. 15).
19.       Profitability has shown a continuous upward trend.   Net income
after taxes increased by 28.1% in 1968. Net income as a percentage of
average paid-in share capital which had fallen in 1966 and remained steady
in 1967, rose to 21.5` in 1968, significantly over the 19.8%0 level of
1965.  Net profit was 20.5 of average equity in 1968, back to the level.
of 1965 after the decline in 1966-67. Improved profitability is due to
several factors.  Nacional has managed to increase the spread between its
borrowing and lending rates.   Interest income exceedsfinancial costs, in
relation to assets, by 4.4' in 1965, rose slightly in 1966 and 1967 and
stood at 5..7% in 1968. Dividend income fron equity investments (excluding
stock dividends) has also increased from 7.7; of avera.ge equity portfolio
in 1967 to 8.0% in 1968. Administrative costs have been kept reasonably
low, at around 1.0% of average total assets.

and Colombiana de Carburo y Derivados, all three companies which ha.ve had.
or are experiencing difficuities.  mnka has shown consideraole progress
in recent months. Forjas has started a long-term program to improve its
operations, and its prospects have substantially improved.  On the other
hand, Colcarburo has serious structural problems, which are not expected
to be resolved in the near future.
23.       On the whole, Nacionalts portfolio is a sound one.   Expected
losses represent merely6.0o  of the Companyts reserves and the total of
doubtful accounts (both loans and investments) is covered two times by
reserves.
Market Value of Shares, Dividend Policy
2h.       Nacional's shares are listed on the Medellin exchange, but are
not actively traded.  In 1967, the Board approved the issue of 1.5 million
shares at par (Col'? 10), and 7CO,000 shares were taken up by shareholders.
The book va:lue per share has increased steadiLly, from Col$ 11.7 in 1964,
to Col$ 15.' at December 31, 1968.
25.       D:ividend payments continue to be substantial, equaling 57.55" of'
net income in 1966 (Col$ 8.4 million), 59.5` in 1967 (Col-$ 9.1 million),
and 51.O0 in 1968 (Col$ 10.0 million).   The dividend rate amounted to
12.0'S in 1966 and 19367, and 14.4% in 1968.  Nacionalts dividend policy
is the principal tool of management policy in its goal of creating an
active market for the Company's shares. .Although yield on par value has
recently exceeded the level at wihich shares are actively traded on the
Colombian market, only a few select companies have a ready market for
their shares, and Nacional will have to offer an even higher yield to gain
acceptability by investors. As a consequence, management foresees paying
dividends at a l.h, rate in 1969. and to increase this to 15.6o in 1970,
l6.8, in 1971 and l8.0O? thereafter.

Loanable fimds from other sources are also expected to increase, by
Col$ 80 mLillion frorrm PIF and by Col$ 5 mlllion from Irl and IFF.  A shart
capital increase of Col, 56 million is expected, in addition to retained
earnings oL about Uollh 75 miliion.  Cn tne whole, projected leveis oI re-
sources appear to be attainable.
28.       T'he increase in the Company's resources w-ill result in an in-
crease in leverage from the present debt/equity level of 2.4    to 2.9 in
1969 and 4.O in 1970.   The 4.0 ratio will be maintained through 1973. Al-
though the volume of both loans and investments will increase, loans will
increase at a faster rate.   The equity portfolio as a percentage of total
portfolio will remain stable at about lv   during the period of the
f'orecast.
29.       Total income is forecast to increase substantially in the next
year, from Cola, 52 million in 1968 to Col$ 73 million in 1969, and to
Col", 15 million in 1973 (Annex 9)'. Net operating income during this
period is forecast to rise from Colr 2b million to Col"i 53 million.   Due
to planned increases in capital, profitability after taxes will not rise
substantially over the period. Net profits as a percentage of average
equity will rise from 14.5 in 1968 to 15.2 in 1973, and as a percentaige
of average paid-in capital from 2:L.5% in 1968 to 27.3% in 1973.   Dividend
payments are forecast to continue in substantial amounts, rising from
56.9r of net retained earnings in 1969 to 69.4ho in 1973.   Based upon an-
ticipated levels of operations, forecast total and net income amounts seem
attainable. The sizeable anticipated dividend payments are in line with
Nacional's present policy, and wi:Ll still enable the accumulation of suf-
ficient retained earnings to deal with any normal le-vel of portfolio losses
and to provide reasonable increase in equity.

30.       The main elements of Nacionalts present policy are three-fold.
It involves profit ma'ization, high Aividend aistribution.     and selec-

Nacional's policy has made, and is continuing to make, a substant:ial con-
triLuuiLon uo the economic development of Thne country.  Although uthe Com-
panyrs activities are concentrated in Yiedellin and the Department of
Antioquia, this region is the second largest industr-al centre in Colombia,
and the impact and influence of Nacionalts activities are nationwride.
31.       Nacional has been effective in carrying out; its policies, and it
is at present the most consistent]y profitable of the Colombian fi-nan-
cieras. This success is largely cte to the quality of its management, and
the close relationship which Nacional maintains with the leading banks
and firms of Nedellin.   The prospects of Nacional's shares being estab-
lished in the market in the near future are good. In addition, the Govern-
mentts stabilization measures appear to be having a beneficial effect on
the economy, and consequently on Niacionalts profitab:Llity. The projects
it assists are having a positive effect on economic development, and same
are of national importance.
32.       Nacional has made effec-tive use of its resources.   Its position
is sound and its prospects are good. It would be a suitable recipient of
the proposed loan.

CORPORACIO1l FINANCIEF?  DE VALLE
I.   IlNTRODUCTIOIN
1.       Corporacion Financiera deL Valle (Valle), was established in
April 1961 and began operations in January 1962.   Vallets primary ob-
jective is the economic development of the Cauca Valley in southwestern
Colombia, one of the best agricultu-ral areas in the country, and it has
carried out all of its lending operations in the Departments of Cauca
and Valle del Cauca, with the exception of a few operations made in pool.
with other financieras. The capital of the Valle del Cauca Department,
Cali, is the third largest Colombian city, and its metropolitan area is
the third most industrialized area in the country.   Buenaventura, the mcst
important (Cnlombiar port; on the Pacific Ocean. is located in the zone of
influence of Valle. The area has a dynamic group of entrepreneurs.

Share Capital and 01wnership
2.       As of December 31, 1968, Valle had 157 shareholders (Annex 1).

Government shareholders 11.85o and fo-r foreign sharehiolders 16.9,?.  The
largest shareholders were Banco Cafetero (15.5 1), Dimpresa Colombiana de
Petroleos (Ecopetrol), the Government oil agency (10.7:,) and tTo TU.S.

and Southern International Corp. (5.3%). The Caicedo family group and
Banco del Comtercio, in -wAhich the Caicedo group has a strong interest, own
about 19" of Vallets shares.
3.       Valle has had some success in increasing its share capital.. In
1967, a 12! ; dividend wiich could be taken -up in stockc or cash at the op-
tion of the shareholders was almost fully taken up in stock (Col$ 4.453
million equivalent at par, out of a total dividend of Col$ 1'.680 milllonJ
and additional shares for Col, 3.02 million at par value were subscribed
during the year; in 1968, subscribed share capital increased by Gol$ 9.7
million, of' which Col$ 3.1 million for dividends which had been taken in
stock up to October 31, 1968.
4.       The Company plans to increase its subscribed share capital from the
present Col', 56 million to Col$ 75 million by the end of 1970 and to Col$ 10(:
milllon by December 1973, by placing new common shares at par. Valle has
recently approached IFC for an equity investment in its share capital, in
the expectation that IECts investment will stimulate other investors,

domestic and foreign, to subscribe.   The request is under consideration by
IFC.
The Board
5.        The Board (Annex 2) is elected for a term of' two years.   It
consists of 9 principals and their alternates.   Since only nine members
regularly attend Board meetings, including 3 representatives of the
Caicedo-Banco del Comercio group, the latter tends to have representation
greater than its shareholding.
Management and Staff
6.        In late 1966 and early 1967 management underwent considerable
changes.  Mr. Beniamin Martinez Moriones. former Executive Vice President.
was appointed Acting President in December 1966, and President in Plarch
1967.  He has acauired the confidence of the Board and staff; and, al-
though the Board takes a strong interest in the Companyls operations, he
manages Valle with considerable freedom.
7.        Mr. lIartInez is assisted by an Ececutive Vice President.
Mr. Carvajal, and a Vice President, Mr. Ocampo. Both have a good theoretical
and practical business backrground.  The npst of Teehn:Lcal Vloe President
is vacant and Valle plans to hire an experienced engineer to fill it.
8.        Staff is kept to a minimum but responsibilities are clearly de-
fined and the various departfments and n  iqisnr are on the whole adequately
staffed.   The Technical Department includes one engineer, hired very re-
centlyv anc fonr ecrnomists.   Two more economists are being sought.  ATith
these additions Valle should be able to cope with a growing volume of
businss
AnnpraqisaiI ~l and 1ollcTw-up Proceduresq
9. alur'le has .m.ade gorod appraisals for projects financed w!ith Bank o1'
PIF funds and has effectively made use of consultants when needed. It cie-
votes a good share of its lending to smallfainUy-ownedenterprises for

54% in 1966, 20% in 1967, a particularly difficult year, and by 72% in
1968. an increase of 216% over three vears.    These assets have been
financed by a blend of resources. Valle lhas received the support of share-
holders in the form of newr share canital and sizeable amounts of funds
from ER and PIF; and it has used 12% (US$3.084 million) of the first Bank

Approvals have increased substantially since 1966, when Bank funds were
first made available to the financieras and vwhen there was a strong demand
for working capital financing which was not satisfied by the banking
system. The second Bank loan allowed Valle to increase again its level
of approvals in 1968.
16.       The evolution of loan conmitments shows a nu-mber of interesting
features (see Annex 3). Textile and food projects dominate, but there is
also a good share of lending for mqetals and- engineering, chemicals and
paper projects. Lending in the non-industrial sectors is limited. Valle
has Thnnthened subhstantially t.he t.ermq o)f' itf 1s: onn in lin. -ri th thp

19.       Vaile has not been particularly active in equity investments in
the recent past. W-rite-offs and expected losses in its equity portfolio
totaliing abaut coi$ 3.5 million have induced a more cautious approach to
equity investments. For the present it is following closely the situation
of the investments in its portfolio in order to solve problems and bring
to the operational stage a number of promotional companies (para. 24).
Alfter having invested Col) 4.8 million in 1966, it invested only Col$ 1.2

December 31, 1968 aggregated 33? of its own equity.  However, although
limited in amount, Ville's equity investments (Annex 4) have been instru-
mental in mobilizing a considerable amount of equity funds.
20.       At present Valle is studying a number of possible promotions.
It is cooperating with the Cauca Valley Authority in a study of the agri-
cultural development of the northern area of the Valley, which is likely
to involve a total investment of Colt 280 million. It has also studied a
project for establishing a new hotel, in view of the 1971 Pan American
Games to be held in Cali, and hopes to be the first shareholder to present
a project to the newly created Hoturismo, a company formed with IFC and
other institutions to develop Colombia's tourism potential.
Financial Structure.. Profitability. Qualitv of Portfolio
21        Rece.nt balance sheets are summariZed in Annex 5. Valle's debt/
equity ratio has increased from 2.5:1 as of December 31, 1966 to 3.8:1 as
of 'ecember 31, 1968, and is approaching the )i:l limit to whiich it is
bound by its Policy Statement and under agreements related to Bank loans.
Although Valle is seei4ng to increase its share capital, its debt/equity
ratio should be relaxed.
22.       The steady increase in leverage and in volume of operations has
enablled Va'Le tUUo imp r o ve± Ji ts p r o fits, +   ln absolu  nts and relative

and fees and commissions received have counteracted the increase in finan-
cial costs, and spreads have been substantial . Divide-nd income has re-

to 21.6'1 in 1968; after-tax profits rose from 12', of share capital in 1906
to almost i9c! in 1968.
23.       The quality of the portffolio is good. Arrears as of Dbcember 31,
1968 totalled Col$ 2.1 million and the total amount outstanding with clients
in arrears totalled Col.') 4.3 million, or 1.3 of Ulie portfollo 0. Losses
are expected to total only Col$ 1140,000, involving one loan to a company
in liquidation.  Vulle has granted few guarantees, mostly t o particularly
sound clients. It has, however, oultstanding loans totalling Col$i i.0 mil-
lion and guarantees totalling Col$ 4.9 million in favor of Sucroquilmica
Colombiana which is meeting technical problems. Collaterals received
are generally good.
24.       The situation of the equity portfolio (Annex 4), which was not
clear in late 1967, is now more clearly defined. Valle has liquidated
Risaralda at a loss.  This company was promoted by four of the financieras
but was nol; established.  Valle expects additional losses of Col$ 2.1 to

Camel, one of V llets early investments, and Diseios ry Confecciones in
which it invested in early 1966 in an unsuccessful attempt to save an
earlier investment. Promociones y Desarrollo Agropecuarios (Prodesa) is
expected to operate profitably in '1969. Problems of 'V. Burrowe8-Industrias

in 1968.  Pastas 1-amos y Semola has some problems in its sales organiza-
tion, whichk are being tackled.  The main investment for which prospects
are unclear is Sucroquimica Colombiana, because of technical problems
iwhich appear to be difficult to solve.
M4arket Value of Shares, Dividend Policy
25.       In 1967, Valle paid out as dividends slightly in excess of its
total 1966 net income (Annex 6). SubsequLently, it undertook to make an--
nual appropriations to reserves large enough to build up total reserves
to a level aDpronriate to the size and qua'itv of its nortfolio.   In 1968.
appropriations to reserves wTere about 5)," of net income of the previous
year.  Reservps and unannronriate4 eaarings have groim substantially over
the years, from Co!i 11.0 million as of December 31, 1965, to Col$ 23.1

in 1969, which wou:Ld involve a payout of about 500 of' net income for 1968.
26.      'Valle has been fairly successful in selling new shares at par.
Its shares are not traded. tAs o December 31, 1968, takin   into accoun'.

period 1969-73.  The most rapid growth is expected in short-term foreign
exchange financing and in peso loans.  Tnese expectations are not incon-
sistent with past performance, in terms of both leve'l and growth rate, or
with the projected growth of investment in Colombia -and in the Cauca
Valley in particular. The forecast growth of foreign exchange financing
is very high, a more than trebling of operations over a five-year pericd.
It reflects expected continued availability of Bank, PIF and AID funds,
in connection with which Valle opens letters of credit, and the active role
Valle intends to play in the expected increase in Colombiats imports and
exports, based on its position at the centre of an export-oriented section
of the coumtry. Nor are peso loans, primarily long-term loans based on IF.?i)

and PIF lerLding, out of line with reasonable expectations. Equity invest-
ments and convertible loans are assumed to increase moderately from
Col$ 9 million in 1969 to Col$ 17.5 million in 1973.
28.,      The expected zrowth of Valle's assets would average 23% per
year, substantially lower than the spectacular growth of 1968, around
72%: it is in line with the average growth for the years 1965-1968.
29.       The nrolected increases in resources (Annex 8) assume substan-
tial Bank support, as well as fresh BR funds and credits from PIF.    Bond
nlacenents are assumed to total Col$ 9 million in 1969 and Col$ 14 million
in 1970; their subsequent increase, up to Col$ 42 million in 1973 may be
on the hig?h side. iunless the attractiveness of the bcnds is substantially
enhanced.  On the other hand, Valle has not forecast the utilization of
other resolurces sucnh as, for instannpe  tlhe newlv created IFF.  Overall,
the expectations are not unrealistic.
30.,      The projected capital structure is sound. Valle's debt/equity
ratio is exprnected o be 3hh:1 by the end of i969;  .59:1 by the end of
1970 and 4h5:1 by the end of 1973, Reserves and retained profits are
expected to -owu from the present 606° of the pnrtfonij to ahout 9g;
which provides a safer base for the portfolio.

IV.   CONCLUSIONS AND RECOI*MDATIONS
35.        Valle is carrying out a useful and growing role.    It can
cater to the financial needs of medium.-size industry in the Cauca Valley
more efficiently and at lower cost than larger financieras located else-
where.   It can provide its clients with more immediate follow-up and more
tim.ely advice than can other financieras.   Furthermore. when resources
are scarce, financieras normally active on a national scale tend to limit
their fin-nrceinn, to +.their -raditional a1nri larger clients located in their
immediate sphere of influence; Val:lets presence, therefore, assures some
co'ntinity+r +- +hs f-inancing of loc-al needs.  its export financing is bound
to become of increasing importance if the country?s export targets are to
be met. FJiLally, Valle iS carrJying out a restrained but important role
in investing in equity and promoting new companies, and it has mobilized.

would not have been mobilized in its absence.
36.        Vallets portfolio is sound.    Its reserves, however, need to
be built up further.    Its financial prospects are goodu.  Vall  i
creditworthy and suitable for further Bank loans.    The Company has usecd
well the p.roceeds of the earlier Bank loans and is expected to continue
to do so.   It is therefore a suitable borrower for a. new Bank loan.
37.        In view of the soundness of Valle's portfolio and its presenlt
and projected debt service coverage (para. 31), it is recoimrended that
the 4:1 limit set in the Project Agreement related to the Bank loan be
relaxed to 5:1, and that the Statement of Policies and Procedures be
modified accordingly.

The Board
5.       Caldast present Board (Annex 2) comprises leading businessmen of
the Caldas region., includng representatives of coffee interests and re=
presentatives of its foreign shareholders and IFC. The Board is a working
body whiich meets, nor,i,ally, every forInirJ,,nht. * oreUm of the BJUar  .me,L
are also memlbers of special committees which evaluate Caldast policies arid
uneir efIectiveness, recommena sectoral priorities icr invvsutien'lu c±iu
study credit applications before they are presented to the Board. Local
Board members are the most directly- involved in Caidas: decisions, and
their knowledge of the business environment is one of the Companyts assets,
although it may have caused a certain under-valuation of the importance of
staff appraisal.
Management and Staff
6.       At present management consists of the President and one Executive
Vice President, located in Manizales, and two Vice Presidents, located in
Bogota. The President, Mr. Roberto Ocampo M., has been in office almost
since the start of operations, and has been effective in promoting enter-
prises in the Caldas region and in mobilizing risk capital. The tight li-
quidity situation of the Company, howzever, has recently compelled him to
devote much of his time to the procurement of short-term resources. Mr.
Ocampo has recently placed more emphasis than in the past in strengthening
the Companyts management and staff and in drawing clearer lines of au-
thority and responsibility.   The creation, in early 1968, of the positio31
of Executive Vice President, whose main task is that of improving pro-
cedures, and the increasing importance given to staff committees in the
analysis of projects, are tangible steps in this direction.
7.       Caldast professional staff totals 19, of whom 14 are in Manizalas
and 5 in Bogota.  In addition, a number of part-time outside consultants
based in Bogota are used extensively. particularly for dealings with the
Government and foreign enterprises. Unfortunately, the Bogota staff,
which is the better technically qualified and experienced group and is
devoted primarily to promotion of large projects, is not fully integrated
into the organization; the result :is that appraisal and follow-up of exis-
ting companies is being largely carried out in I4anizales by less qualified
analysts. Although promotions are a crucial part of Caldast activity,
this organizational set-up seems unbalanced and costly and does not re-
flect the priority that should at this time be given to troublesome com-
panies already in raldasl portfolio.
8.       The quality of Caldas' management and staff, on average, is quite
oond and thA teehninal bankgrouind of snme of thiem- is exeellnt.

APPENIDIX D
prepared in Bogota -are normally of better quality tharn appraisals prepared
at headquarters.   Appraisal procedires vary greatly depending on the opera-
tion involved. WHritten, formal appraisal reports are prepared only for
projects to be financed with PIF or Bank funds, for large investments and
for investments in new ccmpanies.   Other investment decisions still take
place mainly on the basis of the managementis and the Board's good knowledge
of the local business sector. The experience gained waith an increasing
volume of business, howqever, has caused a growing awareness of the need to
base investment decisions more on detailed investigations than has been the
case in the past.   A change in this direction is taking place.
10.       Until the end of 1967, follow-up and end-use activities had taken
place sporadically, their main purposes being to ensure that funds were
used as originally agreed upon and to evaluate the goods used as collateral.
In the case of some of the companies in its portfolio which wqere meeting
difficulties, Caldas had occasionally taken corrective action but with cer-
tain delays and uncertainties.   This was done more in connection with re-
quests for additional funds or because of the Boardts or management's know-
ledge of specific situations, than on the basis of recommendations stem-
ming from follow-up activity. Caldas is now setting up a system for an-
alyzing periodically the financial situations of its clients. In order to
determine a, program of visits, the portfolio has been classified by ur-
gency of the problems facing the companies, Caldas' knrowledge of its
clients, and the size of Caldast exposure.   This new approach represents
a substantial improvement.
Resources
11.       Cwldasl assets have increased steadily.    They grew about 8B'
from the end of 1965 to the end of 1968, almost half the grotrth having oc-

12.       Caldas' m-anagement has actively sought deposits for use in its,
operations and it has met with more success in its endeavors than other
Colombian financieras.   However. deposits have been mostly callable on
short notice.  Their utilization in operations not oi' immediate liquidity
forced Caldas. in :1968. to increase the rates it pays for some of the de-
posits fro:m 6-10 , up to 12i; in order to obtain their renewal, and to bor'-
row frorn commerciaI banks at 1hL" on 90-day terms.  Ii;s liquidity problem
has been pointed out to Caldas, and has been the object of close manage-

provals Il 1966 to 49', in i968; and iending on terms oI more than tWO y-ears
increased also somewhat from 54., of approvals in 1966 to 62'9 in 1968.

18.       Foreign exchange operations, mostly for import financing with
lines of credit from foreign commercial banIks, decreased in 1968 from the
level of the preceding three years.   On the other hand, guarantees out-
standing, covering foreign exchange operations almost exclusively, rose
sharply to (ol+, 42.8 million at the end of 1968, about double the 1966
level.
19.       Investment in equities has grown rapidly.   The equity portfolic,
has grown from Col$ 48 million at the end of 1966 to about Col-$ 77 million
at the end of 1968, and by 194, 'in the past three years. Caldas? exposure
aggregates 74 ' of its own equity, the largest among the five Colombian
financieras.  I4bre than half of the investment (56d) is in promoted com-
panies (Annex 4), wlich have accounted for most of the additional invest-
ment in the last three years. Two-thirds of the portfolio of Col$ 76.5
million (valued at cost) is invested in companies in which Caldas holds
more than the 25% share to which it wrants normally to restrict itself.
This has happened because of Caldas' leadership in supporting the indus-
trial development of the region, which has forced Caldas to assume senior
or controlling interest in various new or reorganized companies. Experience
has shown that such an interest entails the moral obligation to provide
further financial assistance and/or consicderable managerial and technical
responsibility, which Caldas is not alwrays equipped to undertake. However,
Caldas has avoided undue concentration of risk by keeping its equity ex-
posures to less than 10g of its own net wortlb well below the 15% limit in.
its Policy 'Statement.
20.       Cealdas has narriosd out or undertaken six ulnderwriting operatiorss
in favor of five companies, of which two in 1967 and one in 1968.   Such
operations atlways irnvolve taldng Up all or most of the issue and then
selling out over a period of time. In 1967, Caldas underwrote an issue in
favor of Productos ,letalizados, totalling ColJ 1. 5 m"llion, o Th
Col$ 0.9 million were sold to the pablic, and a Col-p 1.9 million issue of
m imi caSuramericana, of w*hich only negligib   amounts -vre sold. *In 1968,
Caldas underwrote 5c1$ 2.8 million worth of shares of Fibras tcril'-cas.
As of Deomber 3     106&Caldas had placed with the pubU    Vll ,t -b
of tour of the five companies, and held Col$ 2.0 million of the Fibras
Acrilicas issue.   Gi.ven th'e status of industrial development - n  he Caldas
region and cf the capital market, Caldas1 experience could be considered
fairly successful
Financial Structure, Profitability, Quality of Portfolio
21.       Caldas! current assets (Annex 5) represent about '0,, OI its cur-
rent liabilities. In most cases, cash, bank balances and monthly inflows
of fPnds match liabilities due within 30 ciays, with a small amount of bonds
and liquid equity investments to cover unforeseen cash needs. However, in
order to co-ver a decrease in deposits callable before 30 days from Col$
21.5 million as of December 31, 1967, to Col') 10.0 as of December 31, 1968,
partly offsE!t by increases in deposits due after 30 days, Caldas repeatecly
borrowed from commercial banks funds carirying a 14s0 interest rate.  Amounts
involved are small and no serious risks of large cash shortfalls exist.

22.       Leverage is slowly imnroving. but it is lower tha:n that of the
other financieras, excluding Nacional.
23.       In 1968, Caldas' profit 'before taxes amounted to Col' 7.6 mil-
ll--on and represented   71- of aver.age share capital, 1 q of average
equity and 3.5r of average total assets (Annex 6). All three measures cf
profitabili.ty show stearr decreases since I965.  The decline s+em.s nartlv
from the rapid groath of financial expenses and partly from unusually

tLhii viad the case in tne recent paLst.
25.       Tne loan and guarantee portfolio is covered by guarantees and
collateral totalling about 13051 of it.  Although a number of loans are in-
sufficiently secured, of which several are to companies at the initial
stage of operation or meeting difficulties, Caldast management, based on
encouraging prospects of some of them and on the guarantees available,
does not anticipate any losses from this portion of the portfolio.
2S.       Of the total equity por-tfolio at year-end 1L968, 88, was in com-
panies in operation and 22-, in non-operating companies.  Roughly 50,
of the portfolio is in companies of good quality, 10'5 in companies with
reasonably good prospects, 25 in companies with med:iocre performance and
15'1i in companies iwith serious problems.  This portfo'lio is largely unsea-
soned and some possibility of losses exdsts.   Severa:L companies are facinmg
problems deriving from unbalanced capitalizations, with excessive borroIlngs
and conseq uently high interest charges.  Several need additional funds to
carry on cr expand their operations, and only recapitalizations will solve
their problems in the long run. Equity is over-valued by at least Col$ 2.6
million, representing losses which have takIen place in the liquidation of
four companies (a sugar project, a company producing valves, a shoe fac-
tory and aL small company formed in order to carry out sugar studies), and
w'hich have not yet been wTritten off. However, most of the portfolio is
intrinsically sound and problems are lilkely to be overcome.

27.       Caldas has follo-w7ed a prudent dividend policv.  In 1966 (its
fifth year of operation), Caldas paid its first dividend o.f 7) in stock;
and in 1967 and 1968, it paid 7' in stock plus 1% in cash.   The same
dividend (7T in stock and 1-. in cash) is planned for 1969. Thus, the
ca.sh payout has been sma'l. reDresenting about 95' of net income in 1967

presents a net increase of 51' over the period.

low.  Tlaey w1ill amount to US$1.9 raillion in 1969, hiigher than in 1968

tinued availability of funds from these sources.

33.        Although the expected level of equity investments appears high
and that of foreign exchange operations somewhat low, the projections slhown
in Annexes 7 through 9 seem generally consistent with Caldasl past per-
formance and the overall expected levels of business and income seem at-

losses wrhich have taken place and occasional new ones and avoid tight li-
quldity situations would warrant restraint in th-e Company's dividend

36.        Caldas has made an important contribution to the industrial devo-
lopmlent of the Caldas region and to the diversification of what was formeri-r
a purely coffee-growing area.    Practically all the important companies in
the Caidas region have received CaldasT financial support.     Its promotionr
have been substantial and loans to new companies have been growing over
time.   Its activity has yielded unquantifiable returns in terms of creat-.r..
of an industrial outlook in a purely agricultural area, and of industrial,
manageriaL and labor sectors, however limlited.    It has done so in a dif-
ficult eniironment, thrcugh an imaginative promotional attitude, and a keen
sense of the need for raising and investing risk capital in an area where
this was extremely limited.
37.        In doing so, however, it may have attempted to do too mruch too
fast, with ensuing difficulties in its liquidity position and in its p:lans
for the aale of shares.    Problems met by a number of Caldast clients cannot
be imputed to it, but might have possibly been avoided or solved at an
early stare, had Caldas given more importance to its follow-up work,     QuaL-
fied staff has recently been hired and its utilization in the Company7s
normal appraisal and follow-up work should improve Caldast performance in
theee fields.

38.       At the end of a period of economic recession, several companies
in Caidas; portfolio need further assistance, financial or other-w.ise, and
close w.atching. MIost of the companies, however, are intrinsically sound.
and their problems may be expected to find solutions, particularly if
they are recapitalized on a sound basis.  Caldas can do much in assessing
what this basis should be.  Promoted companies which are not yet operatuiig,
also need f'urther assistance.  Caldas should give priority to the support
and the development of these companies, and exercise much restraint in thr-1e
promotion of new: projects, particularly large projects with a long gesta.-
tion perio(l.  A restrained policy in promoting new companies would also
delay the need for share capital increases - improving Caldast leverage -
and avoid the need for tying up funds unproductively for a number Of years,
and would .improve the Companyts profitability. Although these matters
have alrea(2y been dliscussed they should be taken up again with Galdas7
management.
39.       Caldas is creditworth-y and suitable for further Bank assistance.
It has usedi the proceeds of the previous Bank loans well and is expected
to continue doing so wzith the proposed loan.

I.*  j LJLlJ I . RODCTIO
1.        Corporaci6n Financiera del Norte (Norte) was organized in May
1963 and started operations in Januairy 1964.  Worte was promoted by North
Colombian interests in order to foster the industrial development of tine
no-Eurhern Departments. It aoes 70-ou0 or its term lending operations in
the Departments of Atlantico, Bolivar and the other northern Departments.
Barranquilla, the capital of the Department of Atlaintico, and Cartagena,
the capital of the Department of Bolivar, are the fourth and fifth lar-
gest cities in Colombia and the fourth and sixth most industrialized
areas. Barranquilla, Cartagena and Santa Marta are important ports.
The coast is a populous and important agricultural area.
II.   THE COMPANY
Share Capital and Ownership
2.        Norte has 561 shareholders and the most w:idespread ownership
among the financieras (Annex 1). Two foreign shareholders, Marine
Midland Overseas Corporation and Philadelphia International Investment
Corporation, have the largest ho-Ldings (1h% and 9.7% of the total,
respectively); Ecopetrol, the government oil agency with 8.3%, and Banco
Cafetero, a commercial bank owned mainly by the Colombian Federation of
Coffee Growers with 8.2%, have the third and fourth largest holdings.
3.        Norte intends to issue new shares, at par, in an effort to
increase its peso resources, broaden its borrowing base in order to ex-
pand its volume of business, and be in a position to do larger-sized
operations.  Manaeement is nlann-Lng to increase the paid-in share capita
of the Company from Col$ 25.57 million to Col$ 42.6 million by the end cf
1970. Ncrteo has rfeonflv annronahed TFtC fir nn Pmuity invrectment. in it..q

Barranqui,lla and Cartagena interests are well-balanced.  The absence of
dominating groups on the Board assures management relative independence
from group pressure.
Management and Staff
5.        Norte's President, Itr. Alvaro Jaramillo, has considerable
business experience, and he is competent and forceful.
6.        The Vice President for administrative matters has recently
resigned!. and candidates for the post are under consideration. The
Technica:L Vice President has spent several years with Norte, but has only
recently been apnointed to the position.  Norte's present size does nlot
call for more depth of management, but the anticipated rapid and substan-
tial incrrease in business would sem to reqiuire strengthening of its
second rank.
7.        The technical department, in charge of appraisals and follow-uip
work, is well-staffed, with a director, two econor.nnme indu ist.ria!I
engineer and one agriculturalist. Turnover is small and attention is

up work, and the number of visits carried out is satisfactory.  Norte
feels thtit one of the most important contribution-s it can Iake to th
economic development of the area in which it is active consists in
improving the performance of the companies it assi;sts, through the di:5C.L-
pline of loan covenants and supervision, help in preparing plans and ad-
vice.
9.        As to internal procedures, accounts and cash flow for a six-
month period are prepared monthly. With the introduction of new equip-
ment and of more analytical systems, the use ofI statistics as a manage-
ment too:l is expected to improve.
Resources
10.       The utilization of resources has increased very fast, by 22% in
1966, 38' in 1967 and 43% in 1968. As of December 31, 1968, the distri-
bution of outstanding borrowings and equity in per cent of total liabili-
ties compared witth the same distribution as of December 31, 1966 had
changed -as follows:

Although N\orte's equity increased froma.Col$ 29.3 million as of December
31, 1966, to Col$ 36.9 million as of December 31, 1965, its leverage in-
creased even faster, from 2.0:1 to 3.7:1 over the same period.     The in-
crease in outstanding borrowings was financed by foireign commercial
banks (from Col$ 18.8 million to Col$ 33.3 million), the Bank (from zero
to Col$ 37.9 million), and in smaller amounts, by PIF and bond issues.
Apart from Bank funds, borrowed resources available for term lending were
limited and Norte used substantial amounts of its own funds in lending
operations.  Norte sncceeded in using US$3.2 million, or 12.7% of the
total oi the first Bank loan, and was allocated about US$1.7 million, or
13.3` of the total under the second loan.    The size of its equity, hcw-
ever, lunited the amount of funds made available to it by BR. Finally,
,Tortets bonds, like those of the other financieras, haX .1ot so far met
ready acceptance and their market is limited.
11.       Norte has so far made three sales of early maturities of loans
to IFI, the government-oned financiera, for a total of Col' 7.1 million.
Operations
12        Peso loans,7 including loans for import financingJ with Bank and
PIF funds, constitute the largest share of Norte's activities. They have
grow.nm substantiallwy, although new apnrovals are still substantially below
the level reached in 1966. Loan funds have been used mainly for mania-
factur-ing industry (mostly food and beverages, textiles, metals and engi-
neering, and chemicals), and the Company's portfolio is well-diversified
among industria:l sectors.  The Comppany, howevrer, -also devotes a signifi-
cant proportion of its funds to agriculture and livestock operations.     IL
-te   e    men   of fsh-ing projects       n  to fin.ce
fixed asset, rather than working capital constitute an increasing prc-
portion ofL totUal operatLions, ref Lecing  -_ larger vw*ne of long-term
borrowings. Most loans continue to be given in the Department of
Atlanti.cO,

13.       Foreign exchange operations increased fromrr. US$ 1. 98 million in
1967 to U,$ 4.41 million in 19(.8. Export financing increased from
TJS$ 875,000 to 0T~       114S - 2.2 m o    a- and cment ioomeri large
among recLpient sectors. Working capital financing, and financing of
im,port or equinmment on three to five-year terms with US dollars,
increased from US$ 102,000 to US$ 739,530.   The fact that clients are
read-y 4o t-2ake th  foreigni exchange raisk w'-ch goes, -urJ-tll these operatiori,,,S
possibly points to an improvement in expectations for the stability of
th1e peso.
L4.       Equity investments ha-ve taken place at a cautious pace:  sub-
scriptions totalled Col$ 1.12 million in 1966, Col$ 2.89 million in 1967
and b    1.1  millon in L    .                  Stor'e' Policy "atementu 1W.t it  ho:l-
ings to 25% of the share capital of the companies in which it invests.
Norte has made equity inrvestmrrents, exceeding the limit in a few cases,
those of promotional companies it has set up which involve small amounts
of money, and in a cattle-raising company, Conganado. A nuumbUer of the
companies in the portfolio (Annex 4) are important ones in the area.
15.       During negotiations for the second Bank loan, Norte undertoo'k
to add equity features to its loans whenever possib:Le. Management attempts
to comply with the provision.   Irnterest rates attached to loans with
equity features are normally one.-to-twc percentage points lowier than Lhrose
whhich apply to straight loans, and Norte expects to be compensated for this
in the future through high returns.   it evaluates, therefore, the prospects
of comparnies to wlhich it makes these loans with the same care that it
applies to equity investments, and makes this type of loan only when it call
reasonably assume that it will, in fact, exercise the right to convert loans
to equity or obtain a good return by tying it to the profitability, sales,
or production performance of borrowers. Norte's portfolio includes loans
with conversion rights totalling Col$ 3.0 million, and loans with contingent
interest features tied to the sa:les or production performance of borrowers
totalling Col$ 2.9 million. These loans are in favor of seven companies,
and six were made after negotiations for the second Bank loan.
16.       So far, Norte has not had any undernrriting operations.  It is
studying its first one.   Guarantees, although increasing, are limited and
granted only to well-knowrn clients.
Financial Structure, Profitability, (Cuality of the Portfolio
17.       Recent balance sheets are analyzed in Annex 5.   Norte is bouncd
by its St;atement of Policy and by agreements tied to Bank loans, to
operate wiithin a 4:1 debt-to-equity ratio. Norte expects that the forth-
coming share capital increase will allow it to do so until 1971, but is
operating cl0ose to the limit and has asked a relaxation of it to 5:1. In
order to provide the needed flexibility in planning its operations, the
relaxation should be granted.  T'he strength of Norte's portfolio and
reserves (see below) justifies the relaxation.

18.       Reserves and surpluses are sizeable and have grown rapidly,
although relatively less rapidly than the growth of operations. As of
December 31, 1968, they represented 6.97o of Nortets total portiolio.
They appear adequate in relation to the present size and quality of the
portfolio. Norte's immediate ani the term liquidity are good.
19.       Annex 6 shows Norte's profitability.   Income derives almost
fully from lending operations and has been growing steadily. The cost of
borrowed resources has girown at a faster rate than interest income as a
percentage of the average loan portfolio; but spreads have been substan-
tial, and the growth of operations and leverage impressive, so that the
growth irn profitability has been satisfactory. Profit before taxes grew
from 11.7% of equity in 1965 to 18.9% in 1968; and profit after taxes,
from 12.7% of share capital in 1965 to 16.3% in 1968.
20.       Administrative costs show a slow decline as a percentage of
assets. This decline can be expected to take place more rapidly as
business expands.
21.       The qualitv of the loan Portfolio is good.   Arrears as of
December 31, 1968 totalled Col$ 2.1 million in principal and Col$ 0.6
mill ion ijn interes.t.  The total amount outstanding with clients in
arrears totalled Col$ 10.9 million, or 7.6% of the portfolio. Arrears
for mnre t.han siy months tot_ller1i Gol$ 1 J million, or 1.0% of the port-
folio; the total amount outstanding in relation to these amounted to only
3.   of the portfolio. AProjec-s considered hy Nortes management to be
in difficulty, including projects in arrears, number six and represent a
portfolic of about 001   -.0 million.  In all cases, problemIs are exnpected
to be solved and guarantees are good.
22.       The largest share of Norte's equity investment (Annex 4) is in
corpanies which are operating profitably and have good prospects.   Pro-
blems in Ladrillera El Cerro have been solved, and its accumulated losses
are expected to be absorbed by end-19 69./ Mos - of +he prr.tin    invest-
ments are likely to lead to the establishment of well-conceived enter-
prises.

23).     iNorte declared iS first dVJUtvidend, at /, in 16UU, UoU U.L of7'156
earnings;: it was payable in cash or stock, at the shareholders' option.
The dividend was almost entirely taken up in stock. ±murvue   poLic  1_a
been to build up surpluses, partly because of fiscal incentives to do so.
However, the Company considers its present best strategy is to follow a
prudent investment policy resulting in early profits and to pay out sub-
stantial cash dividends, in order to lay a basis for obtaining new capi-
tal subscriptions.
24.       Norte's shares are not; registered on the stock exchange.  As of
December 31, 1968 the book value of Norte's shares (Col$ 10.00 at par)
was Col$ 14.43, an annual growth of about 8.5% during the five-year period
over which the Company has been active.



Page 7
25.       Norte's assets are forecast to grow (Annex 8) at a reasonable
rate, less than the rate of 1968 and lower than th;e average growth for
the period 1965-1967. The expected 37% growth for 1969 seems already
assured by local, currency ccmmitments already made towards the end of
last year and by' the fact that Norte has already approved projects
totalling about US$1.0 million for financing under the second Bank loan.
Norte should be able to utilize fairly rapidly funds under the proposed
loan. The asswued growth of import-export financing in foreign exchange,
which is expected to more than double between 1969 and 1973, is within
reach and can be attained with a limited number of operations. Equity
investments should reach about Col$ 11.0 million in 1969. In the follow-
ing years, equity investments are assumed to take place at the modest
rate of Col$ 3.5 million to Col$ 6.4 million p.a..
26.       Norte's forecasts of operations (Annex 7) are consistent with
past performance, in terms of both level and growth rate, the projected
growth of investment in Colombia and the relative importance of the
tlorth Coast.
27.       Apart from increases in equity, the projected increases in
resources (Annex 8) assume substantial Bank support, The expnctatioris
are not unreasonable.  Increase in BR funds, PIF funds and bond availa-
bilitiel3 are also proiected at realistic levels and seem to be attairlablea
Fresh BR funds are expected to represent Col$ 4.0 million in 1970 and
Coll L. " million in 1972-  Fresh PTF lending is expected to total Col$
10.0 mi:Llion in 1969, Col$ 12.C0 million p.a. in 1970 and 1971 and Co3$
lJ 0 miLlion p.a. in 1972 and 1973.  BRondr_ r%la emrets are assulmled +o 1o1 al
Col$ 8.0 million in 1969, Col$ 10.0 million in 1970, Col$ 12.0 million in
1971 and Col$ 134.0 million p.a. thereafter.
28R       Foreign exchange resources available or Jn prospect are su'fi-
cient to carry out the forecast foreign exchange operations.
29.       The recently created IFF will provide redis-

gro-wing from Col$  .0 million in 1969 to Col$ 31.0 million in 1973, seem,
therefore, reasonable.
30.       The projected capital structure is sound.  With the proposed
share capital increases and the projected volume of business and alloca-
tions of profits, Norte's debt/equity ratio (Annex 8) is expected to be
3.4:1 at the end of 1969, 4.0:1 at the end of 1970 and 4.4:1 at the end



APPENDIX E
of 1972. Reserves and surplus are expected to grow over the period from
about 7/% to about 1O:o of the portfo-lio, wihich should be adequate to covE.r
any possible losses if Norte continues to follow its prudent investment
policy.
31.       Norte has lent substantial amounts of its own funds, and has
lent ouit DR funds on shorter terms than those made to it. Debt service
coverage is expected to be 1.5:1 in 1969 and 1.6:1 in 1970 and 1971.  it
intends to contirnue doing so, and its projected cash flow is therefore
comfortable.
32.       Profitability forecasts (Anmex 9) involving, increases of net
profi.ts from abo-at 16o of share capital in 1968 to 37% in 1973, and from
11% of eqity in 1968 to 19% in 1973, may be somewhat high, but within
reach, The increase bet."een 1968 and 1973 in interest income from 211.8%
to 16.0% of the average loan portfolio and in the financial costs from
6.2% to ll.6% of the average borrowings and the resulting fall in spread
from 5.6% to 4L4%, reflect the changing pattern of rates charged and paid
and reasonable assumptions about their future development. Net income
before taxes is projected to grow from t,he present 4.7% to 57,7% of average
total asse!ts in 1973.
33.       Administrative costs are expected to decrease from 2.8% of aver-
age total assets in 1968 to l.9% in 1969, 15% in 1970, 1.3% in 1971 an.d
about lsQC10 thereafter. Decreases below the 1.5% level may be difficult
to achieve.
34.       Norte intends to pay in 1969 a 9% dividend out of 1968 earnings
and pro-ncr-ts fnr Rubht-nt-al increases oP its divn-dends. with prudent.
payout rai;ios, appear good.

accruals had been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, net income for 1967
would have been approximately Col$ 881,000 higher than shown. The sharp increase in income tax in 1967
was mainly due to the fact that the tax exemption for annual appropriations to allowances for bacl debts
up to 10% of total receivables was abolished in that year. Income taxes were reduced by Col$ 930,000 in
3965 and Col$ 1,060,000 in 1966 as a resullt of such appropriations.
