INTERNUTIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMNENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT TO THE EKECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO BANCO DE LA REPUBLICA IN COLOMBIA
FOR THE THIRD DEVELOPMENT FINANCE COMAPNIES PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $25.0 million to
Banco de la Republica, the proceeds of which are to be made available to
five Colombian Private Development Finance Companies (Financieras).
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The five Financieras are the same companies that are partici-
pating in Loans 451 CO and 534 CO, which were made in May 1966 and May
1968. The two larger and older of the five, Corporacion Financiera
Colombiana (Colombiana) and Corporacion Financiera Nacional (Nacional)
were established in Bogota in 1959 and in Medellin in 1960, respectively.
The three others, Corporacion Financiera de Caldas (Caldas), Corporacion
Financiera del Valle (Valle) and Corporacion Financiera del Norte (Norte)
were established in Manizales in 1961, in Cali in 1962 and in Barranquilla
in 1964, respectively. IFC has invested in three of the companies as
follows: A $2 million convertible loan to Nacional made in 1961 and lat-
er converted into commcn stock during 1961-63, a $2 million convertible
loan to Colombiana made in 1961 and converted into commoni stock during
1961-62, and a $700,000 equity investment in Caldas made in 1964. IFC
is currently considering an investment in Valle and in Norte of up to
Col.$7.5 million each (approximately $435,ooo). IFC has also been re-
quested to exercise its preemptive right in a proposed capital increase
in Caldas (amounting to the equivalent of about $125,000) which it in-
tends to do contingent upon Caldas raising the balance of the increase
from other sources. Proposals on the investments in Valle and Norte are
being submitted to IFCts Directors at the same time as this loan.
3.        The private sector has suffered for many years from a short-
age of medium- and long-term financing facilities. To help alleviate
this situation, the Bank supported the creation of a Private Investment
Fund (PIF) in 1963 within the Banco de la Republica (BR), the central
bank, which was conceived as a means of inducing and facilitating a sub-
stantial flow of external credits for medium- and long-term financing of
productive investments in industry and agriculture. More recently, the
Government has added to the flow of long-term funds for industrial deve/



-2-
opment by reviving the Instituto de Fomento Industrial (IFI), a public-
ly owned development finance company established in 1940, but hitherto
somewhat quiescent. PIF attracted support from members of the Consult-
ative Group, namely the United States, Germany, Holland and the Inter-
American Bank. In May 1966, the Bank in turn participated in this effort
by making a loan of $25 million (Loan 451 C0) to Banco de la Republica,
to be relent to the five Financieras and to be used by them to finance
the direct foreign exchange costs of investment projects in the private
sector. The loan was committed in about 18 months. In May 1968, the
Bank made a second loan of $12.5 million (Loan 534 CO) for the same
purpose. About 40 percent of this loan was committed within six months
of effectiveness, and the Financieras have approved or under study proj-
ects exceeding the balance of the loan.
4.        To av6id a gap in the availability of this type of financing,
the Government asked the Bank to make a third loan on a basis similar
to the first two loans, but adding IFI as a beneficiary along with the
five Financieras. However, it was not possible to include IFI in the
schedule of appraisal work already planned without delaying the loan to
the five Financieras. I am therefore proposing at this time a third
loan for the benefit of the five Financieras in the amount of $25 million;
an appraisal of a request from IFI for a loan of about $5 million is sched-
uled for the near future. Missions to Colombia appraised the proposed
loan during July-December 1968, and negotiations were held in Washington
during April 14-16, 1969. The Government was represented by Dr. Misael
Pastrana Borrero (Ambassador in Washington), and BR by Dr. Antonio Jose
Gutierrez (Assistant Manager) and Dr. Guillermo Villaveces (Director,
Private Investment Fund). The Financieras were represented by Dr. Ignacio
Copete (President, Colombiana), Dr. Jose Gutierrez Gomez (President,
Nacional), Dr. Roberto Ocampo and Dr. Guillermo Sanint (President and
Vice-President, respectively, Caldas), Dr. Benjamin Martinez (President,
Valle) and Dr. Alvaro Jaramillo (President, Norte).
5.        The proposed loan, which would be the thirty-seventh made to
Colombia, would increase the total amount of Bank loans to Colombia to
$583 million (net of cancellations). IDA has made one credit of $19.5
million for highways to Colombia. The following is a summary statement
of Bank loans and IDA credits to Colombia as at April 30, 1969:

6.         Twenty-three loans have been completely disbursed.  On the
remainder, disbursements are now proceeding normally. The Executive
Directors previously approved an amendment to the Loan Agreement for
Loan 369 CO, under which the Loan was split into two tranches and the
Closing Date was extended by two years to December 31, 1970 (R67-136).
Effective January 1969, $3 million of the undisbursed balance was can-
celled, and on present indications a further $4-5 million will be can-
celled prior to the new Closing Date. With respect to Loan 345 CO, the
Executive Directors also approved on a no-objection basis a further one-
yesr extension of the Closing Date to October 31, 1969 (R68-80).



7.        Together with this loan, I am submitting to the Executive
Directors a proposed loan of $17 million to the Government for use by
the Instituto Colombiano de la Reforma Agraria.
8.        In the next few months I expect to present to the Executive
Directors for approval also a loan of about $18 million to the Govern-
ment for a second livestock project.
9.        IFC has made twenty-seven investments and underwriting commit-
ments in fourteen enterprises in Colombia totalling $14.9 million (net
of cancellations).
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPO6ED LOAN
10.       The main features of the proposed loan are as follows:
Borrower:           Banco de la Republica (Central Bank of
Colombia).
Guarantor:          Republic of Colombia.
Beneficiaries:      The five Private Development Finance
Companies which participated in Loans
451 CO and 534 CO (Colombiana, N4acional,
Caldas, Norte, Valle).
Amount:             The equivalent in various currencies of
$25.0 million.
Purpose:            The financing of development in Colombia
through credits and other investments for
productive purposes to privately controlled
enterprises, for specific projects in ac-
cordance with the Estatutos of the Finan-
cieras. The Bank loan would cover the
direct foreign exchange cost of the proj-
ects.
Amortization:        In semi-annual installments, expected to
begin on June 15, 1970 and end on June 15,
(                          1986.  Payments will be based on a com-
posite amortization schedule made up of
schedules of the investment projects. Terms
for individual investment projects will be
up to 15 years and grace periods are not
expected to exceed three years.
Interest Rate:      6½ percent.
Commitment Charge:  3/4 of 1 percent.



-5-
Relending Terms:    Banik interest rate plus not more than one
percent to the Borrower for administrative
costs; plus no less than 3 percent to the
Financieras; in addition, 8 percent to the
Borrower, to cover the exchange risk in
those cases in which the ultimate bene-
ficiary does not wish to bear this risk.
PART III - THE PROJECT
11.       An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of Five Finance
Companies in Colombia" (DB-48) on the project is attached.
12.       Industry has an important place in the Colombian economy, occu-
pying second place after agriculture. It has been growing faster than
the rest of the economy and now accounts for about 20 percent of gross
domestic product compared to 14 percent in 1950. In recent years, indus-
trial growth has been hampered by the country's limited import capacity
and the scarcity of long-term investment resources.
13.       In this setting, the Financieras have continued as the major
sources of medium- and long-term financing as well as equity financing
to the industrial sector. By December 31, 1968, the aggregate value of
their portfolios had risen to Col.$2.1 billion (from Col.$1.7 billion a
year earlier), and their equity portfolios to Col.$383 million (from
(Col.$318 million a year earlier).
14.       Traditionally the principal resources of the Financieras have
been their equity, credit lines with BR and foreign commercial banks,
PIP and the two loans granted by the Bank. PIF has channelled
through the Financieras about 50 percent of its resources as they became
available from foreign bilateral lenders. PIF has limited funds at pres-
ent, but has prospects for raising about US$15 million of long-term loans
during 1969. BR has been making resources available to the Financieras
under rediscounting facilities and later under credit lines.   In the
recent past, the Bank has been the main source of fresh long-term funds
for the Financieras.
15.       On the whole, the performance of the Financieras has been
satisfactory, even though their profitability records are mixed.
Colombiana and Caldas, which have been the most promotion-minded and
which are consequently the most heavily invested in equities, have at
present the lowest profitability. Nacional, Norte and Valle have satis-
factory and growing levels of profit. The Financieras have established
a good record of operating experience, which is reflected in improved
appraisal techniques and more competent handling of other aspects of
their operations. All five companies are headed by active and expe-
riencedBoards of Directors and Presidents. Their portfolios are of satis-
factory quality, with some excepticns that are the subject of continued
supervision and follow-up efforts. Loans are well secured by collateral.



-6-
and arrears are generally low. The companies are creditwort!y, with
strong equity positions and good buslness prospects that justify the ex-
pectation of substantial increases in earnings. They are suitable recip-
ients of the proposed Bank loan and should be in a position to service
the loan without difficul-ty.
16.       As agreed during negotiations, the five companies would share
equally in $15 million of the proposed loan, while the remaining $10 mil-
lion wou'd be available for joint operations of all five companies and to
companies that had used up their fixed allocation. The limit for projects
not needing the Bank's prior approval was agreed as follows: $250,000
each for Colombiana and Nacional, to an aggregate total of $3 million
each; $100,000 for each of the other Financieras, to an aggregate total
of $1.5 million each.
PART IV - LEGAL D\TSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
17.       The Draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Banco de la
Republica, the Draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Colombia
and the Bank, the Draft form of Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the
Banco de la Republica and each Financiera, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article HII, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement
and the Draft Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
18.       The Draft Agreements contain covenants normally included in
agreements with development finance companies. The provisions contained
under Loan 451 CO and 534 CO in the Projects Agreements between the
Bank and each of the participating Financieras and in supplemental letters
have been incorporated in the Draft form of Subsidiary Loan Agreement be-
tween the Banco de la Republica and each Financiera. The Loan Agreement
has been modified to provide that the Subsidiary Loan Agreements cannot
be changed or amended without the Bank's agreement (Section 5.02). Atten-
tion is drawn to the following other provisions:
(i) pursuant to Section 2.09 of the Loan Agreement, Banco
de la Republica may by notice to the Bank refuse to sub-
mit requests for Bank approval of investment projects
that Banco de la Republica determines are not significant
for the economic development of Colombia;
(ii)  the Loan Agreement provides that if a Financiera is in
default under its Subsidiary Loan Agreement with the
Banco de la Republica, the Bank has the right to pre-
mature that part of the Loan which has been relent to
the defaulting Financiera and is outstanding (Section
7.01);



-7-
(iii) the Loan Agreement can be made effective at the option
of the Bank even if one or more of the Financieras shall
not have complied with the conditions of effectiveness
(Section 8.01).
PART V - THE ECONOMY
19.       Colombia's economic situation was fully analyzed in the IBRD
economic report of December 1968 (WH-18aa), entitled "Current Economic
Position and Prospects of Colombia". The major conclusions of this report
are that economic performance has improved markedly in recent years, and
that there are reasonably good prospects for this improvement to be sus-
tained, and even bettered, in the next three to five years. The growth
rate of GDP has accelerated from an average of 4.4 percent between 1950
and 1967, to 5.8 percent in 1968, and economic indicators suggest a poten-
tial growth rate of around 6.5 percent in 1969. The rate of price increase
as measured by the wholesale price index has been reduced from 17.4 percent
in 1966 to 6.8 percent in 1967 and 6.2 percent in 1968. Price increases
over each of the last two years have been less than the average rate in
the period 1961-1966. Public savings in real terms increased by 60 per-
cent in 1966, 20 percent in 1967, and another 20 percent in 1968. There
has been notable improvement in a wide range of sector policies.
20.       Exchange earnings, still principally from coffee, remained the
principal constraint upon economic growth. However, export diversifica-
tion, which has been proceeding steadily for some years, has now been made
a major objective of Colombian policy. Exports other than coffee and pe-
troleum have grown from $40 million in 1954 to $120 million in 1967 and
$178 million in 1968, accounting for about 30 percent of total commodity
exports in 1968. To illustrate the country's lessening dependence upon
coffee exports, there occurred in early 1969 a decline in the world price
for Colombian coffee (from 43.5 0 per lb in October 1968 to 39.2 ¢ per
lb in April 1969), but this loss of coffee earnings was compensated by
buoyant receipts from minor exports. Thus, for the first time in 15 years,
a decline of this nature in coffee prices did not result in the develop-
ment of serious exchange difficulties. The Government is resolved to take
the measures that are needed to sustain the growth of minor exports.
21.       New external borrowing now being planned would double Colombia's
external public debt outstanding from its present $1.1 billion to $2.3
billion by 1973. The average terms of the present debt are very favorable.
Even if terms harden slightly, as they might, the burden of this debt
should remain reasonable. If exports and domestic savings develop as in-
tended, the debt service ratio would increase from 12.7 percent in 1968
to between 16 and 17 percent in 1973 and tend to level off thereafter.
With the continuation of present policies, Colombia should therefore be
judged creditworthy for the external borrowing in prospect.



-8-
22.       The major policy issue for decision in coming months is the tax
reform (see paragraphs 33 through 55 of Report No. WH-188a). The special
commission upon taxation sent its report to the Government in 1968, as
scheduled. The Government is now preparing legislative proposals on the
basis of this report for Congress to debate during the latter half of
1969. The outcome of this debate will determine the pace of revenue
growth in the next few years and thus the pace at which the Government
will be able to sustain its ambitious development program.
PART VI - COI"IPLIANCE IT]H THE ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
23.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMNENDATION
24.       T recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
