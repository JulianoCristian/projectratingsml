The changes to the project include: (i)\n            modifications to the description of Project components to\n            reflect the cancellation of certain activities and the\n            addition of others; (ii) reallocation of funds; (iii)\n            partial cancellation of Grant funds; (iv) extension of the\n            Grant closing date; (v) revisions to the results framework;\n            and (vi) deletion of certain financial covenants. Following\n            the October 2011 withdrawal of Cambodia from the regional\n            project, activities related to the establishment of a\n            transmission line linking Cambodia and Laos were canceled.\n            The modifications will ensure the achievement of the second\n            project development objective (PDO) 'creating the\n            conditions for eventual interconnections of Lao PDR with\n            other countries in the region'.
