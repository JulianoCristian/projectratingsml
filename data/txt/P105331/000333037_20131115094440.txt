                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A. SUMMARY

The proposed changes to the Project (IDA Grant No. H-300-LA, P105331) include: (i)
modifications to the description of Project components to reflect the cancellation of
certain activities and the addition of others; (ii) reallocation of funds; (iii) partial
cancellation of Grant funds; (iv) extension of the Grant closing date; (v) revisions to the
Results Framework; and (vi) deletion of certain financial covenants. Following the
October 2011 withdrawal of Cambodia from the regional Greater Mekong Region (GMS)
Power Trade Project, activities related to the establishment of a transmission line linking
Cambodia and Laos were canceled. The proposed modifications will ensure the
achievement of the second project development objective (PDO) “creating the
conditions for eventual interconnections of Lao PDR with other countries in the region”.
The changes also reflect the availability of alternative funding to cover costs for the
construction of a load dispatching center and related management and communication
systems, and for technical assistance (TA) to assess collector substation approaches as
alternatives to dedicated transmission lines.

B. PROJECT STATUS

Overall progress towards the achievement of the first PDO “to bring reliable electricity
to selected provinces in the Lao PDR” is largely on track with the successful completion
of the transmission line from Xeset Substation to Saravan in September 2011. This has
resulted in an increase in power demand met from 40GWh at appraisal to 59.8GWh or
92% of the end-of-project target of 65GWh. The feasibility study for the Houay Lamphan
Gnai hydropower project and the review of Electricité du Laos (EdL) tariff structure have
also been completed as planned.

However, the project has been rated Moderately Unsatisfactory as achievement of the
second PDO “to support the creation of the conditions for eventual interconnections of
Lao PDR with other countries in the region” is currently at risk due to Cambodia’s
withdrawal from the regional GMS Project which resulted in the cancellation of activities
to establish a cross-border transmission line from the South of Lao PDR to Cambodia.
Nonetheless, key activities reinforcing the establishment of conditions for the eventual
interconnection of Lao PDR with neighboring countries have been progressing as
planned, including the construction of the building for the Load Dispatching Center
(LDC), and installation of the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
system, both financed through alternative means. The Project is in compliance with audit
requirements.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

Results/indicators

A new PDO level indicator is proposed: “Increased capacity of Saphaothong and Ban Na
substations” to evaluate a proposed new Component L-1-b for upgrading and expanding
the Saphaothong and Ban Na substations. It is also proposed that the PDO level indicator
“Increased capacity of EdL to optimize its system operation and power trade, through the
use of load dispatch center” be dropped as the Load Dispatching Centre (LDC) has been
financed through alternative sources. The intermediate result on the LDC will be
modified to incorporate only the TA financed under the project.

It is proposed that the intermediate result for the development of a cross-border
transmission line linking Lao PDR (Ban Hat) and Cambodia (Stung Treng) be dropped
including related indicators to reflect cancellation of this activity. A new intermediate
result indicator is added for the installation of circuit breakers and transformers at these
two substations. The intermediate result indicator for the Xeset-Saravan transmission line
is revised to indicate the percentage of works completed and a second indicator is added
to capture the core sector indicator "length of transmission line built". All changes are
shown in Annex 1.

Components

Changes to the Project Description under Schedule 1 of the Financing Agreement are
proposed as follows:

(a) Component L-1 “Cross border transmission system from Ban Hat Substation to
    Lao Border”: The cancellation of the component is proposed in view of Cambodia’s
    withdrawal from the regional Power Trade project. No funds were spent under this
    component during project implementation.

(b) New Component L-1-b “Expansion of Saphaothong and Ban Na Substations”:
    Following cancellation of the above component, this component is proposed
    consisting of: (a) the expansion of an existing substation building to accommodate the
    expansion of the substation, (b) replacement of inadequately sized bus bars to align
    with current utility substation standards, (c) installation of an additional 115/22kV
    power transformer to provide secure, reliable supplies to the southern region of Lao
    PDR and neighboring countries, and (d) associated additional outgoing 22kV circuits
    to increase additional power evacuation capacity to new load centers. Minor civil
    works will be undertaken for the installation of the electrical equipment, within the
    compound of the existing substation. The proposed expansion of Saphaothong
    substation in Attapeu province will facilitate the collection of power from the
    generation power plants in the area and dispatch it to the Ban Na substation in
    Champasak province for further power dispatch for export to Thailand and Cambodia
    and will at the same time increase capacity for supplying local national demand,
    contributing to the achievement of project objectives.



                                             2
(c) Component L-3 “Activities to facilitate implementation of L1 and L2”: Activities
    under this component have been completed, except for the TA for the design and
    supervision of the Ban Hat Substation under Component L.1, now cancelled.
    Activities for this component will now include design and supervision for the
    proposed new Component L-1-b: Expansion of Saphaothong and Ban Na substations.

(d) Component L-4 “Load Dispatching Centre (LDC)”: As the LDC was financed
    outside the project, this component will be reduced to cover only consultancy services
    related to defining the scope and technical specifications of the LDC and the
    Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system.

(e) Component L-6 “Technical Assistance for Collector Substation System”: This
    component will be canceled as the Government of Lao PDR (GOL) completed this
    activity in 2010 fully under alternative funding.

Project Costs

The partial cancellation of SDR 3.2 million (US$4.80 million) is proposed following IDA
guidelines for regional projects that allow for only one-third of the balance released from
the original budget to be reallocated to activities if a single country is involved in the
investment. Following the full cancellation of Components L-1 and L-6 and the reduction
in scope of L-4, the revised project cost is SDR 6.7 million (US$10.20 million
equivalent). The cost of Component L-2 saw significant price escalation between
appraisal in 2006 and actual contract signing in 2008.

Closing Date

The closing date of IDA Grant No. H-300-LA will be extended for 14 months from
December 31, 2013 until February 28, 2015. The extension is necessary to ensure
adequate time for the completion of procurement and works for the proposed upgrading
and expansion of Saphaothong and Ban Na substations. EdL has in place an action plan
to ensure completion of the Project by the newly proposed date.
                                            3
The design and supervision contract for the expansion of Saphaothong and Ban Na
substations has been extended, the bidding documents have been issued, and the
feasibility study has been completed. The bid evaluation for the substations expansion
supply and installation contract was concluded this past August. Contract signing is
expected by this October, while physical works are planned to start in December 2013.
This will be the first extension of the Project. The PDO remains achievable.

Financial Covenants

The three covenants on the financial performance of EdL include: (i) achieving a debt
service coverage ratio of 1.3; (ii) ensuring a self-financing ratio of at least 15%; and (iii)
maintaining a long-term debt to equity ratio of 1.5. Subsequent to the project being
appraised, it became clear that following EdL’s institutional restructuring in December
2010, the resulting spinning off of EdL Generation Company (the business-oriented arm
of EdL), and EdL’s large spending program, the covenants are not fully achievable within
the life of this project. Furthermore, the project has no activities directly leading to
achievement of these covenants. Therefore, these three covenants will be dropped. The
Bank is assisting GOL and EdL to address the financial sustainability of EdL through
IDA Grant H-5380-LA “Rural Electrification Project Phase II” and a Second Financial
Action Plan 2013-2017.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

Economic and Financial Analysis. The economic assessment for this restructuring
reviewed the incremental benefits to Lao PDR as a result of the US$ 2 million IDA
funding. The proceeds of the IDA funding will be applied toward enhancing the capacity
of the existing Ban Na and Saphaothong substations, which will allow increased
electricity export to Thailand and Cambodia. The project net present value is estimated to
be US$5.6 million at the economic cost of capital of 10 percent. The economic rate of
return to the project is 34 percent, which exceeds the criteria for a positive economic
return. The sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the project.

Technical Aspects. One of the initial objectives under the Greater Mekong Subregion
Power Trade (GMSPT) project was to establish a high voltage connection for the export
of power from Laos to Cambodia. When cancelation of Cambodia’s component of the
GMSPT project resulted in the cancellation of the Lao side connection, construction of
the originally appraised line became unjustifiable. EdL identified a subproject that could
absorb part of the allocated funds and was aligned with the PDO. The proposed
subproject involves the strengthening of the export link from the Attapeu region to Ban
Na substation, which is effectively the crossroads of the evacuation route. EdL has
already extended the current design and supervision contract to establish bankable design
documents and prepare the bidding documents. The technical feasibility study included
the study of various scenarios for the system operation concerning outages and fault
levels. The study recommended a feeder bay to be built at Ban Na substation to connect
the currently idle second circuit. At Saphaothong substation, a similar feeder circuit will
be required with additional works, involving the changing of the bus bars and an
additional second 115/22kV, 20MVA transformer with the associated 22kV outgoing
                                              4
feeders. Advance procurement has been agreed for this proposed expansion at
Saphaothong and Ban Na substations in order to accelerate implementation. The appraisal
mission confirmed the proposed expansion of Saphaothong and Ban Na substations is
feasible.

Social Safeguards. Implementation of social safeguards under the original project has
been satisfactory. The newly proposed expansion of transmission capacity of existing
substations (Ban Na and Saphaothong) under the restructuring will support minor civil
works only within the existing premises of the substations which have been under
operation. No new land acquisition, physical relocation, asset loss, or any other possible
impact beyond the boundaries of existing substations is anticipated. The field-based
social-environmental officer will continue to monitor all social aspects of the project.

Environmental Safeguards. The proposed expansion of transmission capacity of
existing substations (Ban Na and Saphaothong) will be carried out within the existing
substations already under operation. The expansion activities will involve minor civil
works (such as office building, cable trenches, transformer foundations, and excavation
works). There are likely to be some concerns relating to inconveniences or nuisances
(e.g., dust, noise, construction waste) to surrounding areas during construction. However,
these potential impacts on the environment are deemed to be minor, site-specific, and
reversible in nature, and for which mitigation measures can be readily designed. Given
the nature and small scale of the proposed civil works under the expansion project, a
formal environmental assessment report is not considered necessary. For the purpose of
enhancing environmentally-friendly measures and mitigating any adverse impacts caused
by the construction activities, the existing Environmental Management Plan (EMP) of
Xeset-Saravan 115kV transmission line is updated according to the nature of the new
investment including requirements on monitoring, supervision and reporting.

Although environmental impact is envisaged to be minimal, a field-based social-
environmental officer will continue to supervise EMP implementation through the new
closing date. The officer will be supported by the Social and Environment Division at
EdL, which has good experience in social and environmental management of IDA-
financed projects.

Disclosure. The revised EMP was disclosed locally on June 12, 2013 on EdL’s website
and on June 14, 2013 in The Vientiane Times (local newspaper). It was disclosed in the
Bank’s Info Shop on June 19, 2013, and it will be included in the bidding documents. A
revised Integrated Safeguards Datasheet was also prepared and disclosed in the Bank’s
Info Shop on July 24, 2013.

Implementation Arrangements. To date, all components except those to be dropped or
those involved in the restructuring have been completed. The Project Management Unit
(PMU), established at EdL from the start of the project, will continue to coordinate
implementation until all proposed activities have been completed; the management
structure in place throughout implementation will continue to oversee the PMU as well as
the Site Supervision Teams (SST) at each project site (Saphaothong and Ban Na). The
SSTs in charge of day-to-day supervision will each be staffed by a site manager, two
engineers/inspectors, and a social-environmental officer. A project supervision consultant
                                            5
will review and confirm detail design, supervise and assist in the final acceptance tests
and commissioning, and will provide on-the-job training.

Financial Management Assessment. The PMU at EdL will continue to assure the
financial management of the project. Based on the financial management (FM) review,
the current financial management arrangements are deemed to be acceptable. The
Financial Management Manual needs to be updated with the new project organizational
chart and clearly defining the terms of reference for each project team member. The
overall financial management risk is considered moderate.

Procurement. The project management team at EdL’s headquarters will continue to have
responsibility for procurement under the project. Two procurement packages will be
required for the proposed extension:
       (i)    Package 1: the supply and installation contract for Saphaothong and Ban
              Na substations, with a project execution time of 12 months. The bidding
              process has now advanced toward bid award stage. Contract execution
              will follow approval of this project restructuring.
       (ii)   Package 2: Supervision consultant contract. The ongoing contract has been
              extended.
