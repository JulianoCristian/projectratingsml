Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 To bring reliable electricity to selected provinces in Lao PDR, the project has successfully installed 24.3 km of transmission lines in Saravan Province to
 bring in affordable grid-based electricity. Demand met in Saravan has increased from 40GWh at project start-up to 92 GWh (August 2013), exceeding
 the end-of-project target of 65 GWh.

 To improve achievement of the PDO, a project restructuring was concluded in December 2013. Component 1 (transmission lines to the Cambodian
 border) was dropped after Cambodia withdrew from the project, and the resulting savings were reallocated to fund a new component to expand two
 existing substations in southern Laos, one in Champasak Province and one in Attapeu Province. Expansion of these substations will both increase the
 supply of reliable electricity in those provinces and create the conditions necessary for eventual interconnections between Lao PDR and other countries
 such as Thailand and Cambodia. Regarding the Load Dispatch Center (LDC), the restructuring reduced the project’s contribution to assisting with the
 design and configuration of the system as the LDC was financed with alternative funds.

 Implementation of the new component to expand two substations is under way. Construction completion and contract close out is on track for February
 2015 or earlier.
