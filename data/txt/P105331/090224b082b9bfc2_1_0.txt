Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project will close on February 28, 2015. The project was restructured in December 2013 to account for Cambodia’s withdrawal from the regional
 GMS Project. This restructuring cancelled the cross-border transmission line between Southern Laos and Cambodia, but replaced with substations
 capacity enhancement in Laos that could support future cross-border connections.
 Following this restructuring, the PDO was largely achieved. To bring reliable electricity to selected provinces in Lao PDR, the project has successfully
 installed 24.3 km of transmission lines in Saravan Province to bring in affordable grid-based electricity. Demand met in Saravan has increased from
 40GWh at project start-up to over 90 GWh (December 2014), exceeding the end-of-project target of 65 GWh.
 The construction work on the expansion of the two existing substations (one in Champasak Province and the other one in Attapue Province), which will
 increase the supply of reliable electricity in those provinces and create the conditions necessary for eventual interconnections between Lao PDR and
 other countries such as Thailand and Cambodia has now been completed. The contract close out is on track.
 The PDO and IP ratings are rated Moderately Satisfactory because the overall progress towards the achievement of the first part PDO “to bring reliable
 electricity to selected provinces in the Lao PDR” has been achieved. However, achievement of the second part PDO “to support the creation of the
 conditions for eventual interconnections of Lao PDR with other countries in the region” is diminished due to Cambodia’s withdrawal from the regional
 GMS Project which resulted in the cancellation of activities to establish a cross-border transmission line from the South of Lao PDR to Cambodia.
