                         Implementation Status Overview
                         To bring reliable electricity to selected provinces in Lao PDR, the project has successfully installed 24.3 km of transmission lines in Saravan Province to bring in affordable grid-based
                         electricity. Demand met in Saravan has increased from 40GWh at project start-up to 92 GWh (August 2013), exceeding the end-of-project target of 65 GWh.

                         To improve achievement of the PDO, a project restructuring was concluded in December 2013. Component 1 (transmission lines to the Cambodian border) was dropped after
                         Cambodia withdrew from the project, and the resulting savings were reallocated to fund a new component to expand two existing substations in southern Laos, one in Champasak
                         Province and one in Attapeu Province. Expansion of these substations will both increase the supply of reliable electricity in those provinces and create the conditions necessary for
                         eventual interconnections between Lao PDR and other countries such as Thailand and Cambodia. Regarding the Load Dispatch Center (LDC), the restructuring reduced the
                         project’s contribution to assisting with the design and configuration of the system as the LDC was financed with alternative funds.
