                         To bring reliable electricity to selected provinces in Lao PDR, the project has successfully installed 24.3 km of transmission lines in Saravan Province to bring in affordable grid-based
                         electricity. Demand met in Saravan has now increased from 40GWh at project start-up to 92 GWh now, nicely exceeding the end-of-project target of 65 GWh.

                         However, installation of transmission lines to connect Lao PDR to Cambodia will not be implemented because the Royal Government of Cambodia canceled its portion of the project

                         in October 2011. Furthermore, implementation of the Load Dispatch Center will not be carried out under this project, as the Government has identified alternative financing. For these
                         reasons achievement of the PDO is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

                         To improve achievement of the PDO, the Government has requested a restructuring. Component 1 (transmission lines to the Cambodian border) will be dropped and the resulting
                         savings will be used to expand two existing substations in southern Laos, one in Champasak Province and one in Attapeu Province. Apprasial of these new works was carried out in
                         May 2013 and they can be completed with an extension of the Grant closing date to February 2015. Expansion of these stations will both increase the supply of reliable electricity in
                         those provinces and create the conditions necessary for eventual interconnections between Lao PDR and other countries such as Thailand and Cambodia. Regarding the Load
                         Dispatch Center, the restructuring will also reduce the project’s contribution to assisting with the design and configuration of the system. These changes should allow the PDO to be
                         met.
