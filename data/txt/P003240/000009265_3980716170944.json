Recovery and\n            Investment Promotion Credit Project for Zambia were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, project sustainability\n            was uncertain, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: availability of technical assistance funds\n            can facilitate acquisition of critical technical expertise,\n            if task managers and government have flexibility in\n            allocating these funds to problem areas as they arise.\n            Adjustment programs are easier to implement and supervise as\n            well as more effective, if they have fewer, but more\n            critical conditions, fewer trenches and shorter disbursement\n            profiles. Recovery of the economy after stabilization can\n            take longer than expected, but should not be a reason for\n            despair. The Zambian case illustrates that stabilization,\n            coupled with vigorous structural adjustment will ultimately\n            produce positive results, provided the efforts can be\n            sustained. Continuity of task management is beneficial, as\n            is having the manager of the adjustment operation also\n            responsible for related technical assistance projects."}, "docdt": "1998-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
