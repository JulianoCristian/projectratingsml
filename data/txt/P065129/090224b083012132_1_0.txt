1. Project Context, Development Objective, and Design

   1.1 Context at appraisal

1.     Although Guinea is rich in natural resources, gross domestic product (GDP) growth had
averaged only 2.3 percent over the 2003-2005 period. Real GDP growth was 1.2 percent in 2003
and 2.7 percent in 2004, compared with an annual population growth rate of 3.1 percent. Per capita
gross national income fell from US$ 450 in 2000 to US$ 386 in 2004. Overall poverty rose from
49.2 percent in 2002 to 56 percent in 2005. With the exception of gross school enrolment (77
percent), other key social welfare indicators had deteriorated significantly; for example, 35 percent
of the population was estimated to be underweight, the country had 9 doctors per 100,000
inhabitants, and only 42 percent of the population had access to portable water in 2005.

2.      At appraisal, Guinea’s poor performance was variously attributed to its unevenly
distributed growth, which led to highly skewed incomes; a large, highly centralized public sector
and widespread corruption, which discouraged investment; limited and inefficient public
expenditure; inadequate infrastructure, which contributed to poor social indicators; and a host of
external factors, mostly related to instability throughout the sub-region and a high influx of
refugees. These challenges were compounded by the effects of decades of weak governance:
endemic corruption, weak political institutions, lack of inclusiveness and dialogue, and poor legal
and regulatory frameworks.

3.      The Government of Guinea’s 2002 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) outlined a
plan to address those challenges, based on three pillars: (i) ensure faster economic growth and
create employment opportunities, particularly for the rural poor; (ii) improve access to basic
services; and (iii) improve governance by strengthening institutional and human capacity. The
PRSP identified the government’s policy on decentralization as an entry point for implementing
reforms, but reforms were inhibited by several obstacles. There was resistance to change at the
central level, coupled with a poor understanding of the benefits of decentralization at the local
level. The human, physical, and financial capital to promote and sustain reforms was lacking.
Administrative structures at all levels suffered from ineffective coordination and unclear mandates.
A particular obstacle was the government’s inability to finance the reforms, especially to meet the
recurrent costs of local governments.

4.      The government, in line with its priorities and in consideration of the important role
decentralization plays in reducing poverty, requested World Bank support to improve local
governance and strengthen its decentralized institutions at all levels. The Bank responded with a
three-phased Adjustable Program Loan (APL) to help implement the reforms. Phase 1 of the APL,
implemented as a pilot project over 1999-2007 period, was remarkably successful. It promoted
reforms to support decentralization, including the development of systems (and new budget
nomenclature) to transfer financial resources to local governments in rural communities. It helped
to establish a new regulatory framework for decentralization, in line with the legal framework that
had been developed for local governments (Code des Collectivités Locales, CCL). At the same
time, the pilot project undertook to equip Rural Development Communities (Communautés
Rurales de Développement, CRDs) with the tools and skills for planning and implementing

                                                 1
inclusive local development programs and improving the delivery of services at the local level. To
scale up these impressive results nationwide, the Second Village Communities Support Program
(Programme d’Appui aux Communautés Villageoises, PACV2) was designed. PACV2
complemented the World Bank’s 2003–06 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which focused on
providing support to front-line service delivery, institutional capacity building, and policy reforms
at the local level.

     1.2 Original Program and Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

5.      Program objective. The long-term programmatic objective of the PACV APL series was
to strengthen local governance in rural Guinea and promote social and economic empowerment of
the rural population, including women, youth, and other marginalized groups. The long-term
vision of the program was that, upon completion of its final phase, local communities and their
representative local governments would have developed: (i) the capability to identify, prioritize,
plan, and manage their own infrastructure and service delivery; (ii) the capacity to mobilize and
use transparently the resources necessary to finance the establishment, rehabilitation, and
maintenance of basic community infrastructure; (iii) the ability to oversee the implementation,
operation, and continued maintenance of community infrastructure, either by contracting private
firms or through the support of the de-concentrated government services; and (iv) the capacity to
sustain development efforts and enhance good governance practices. The original long-term
program objective and vision remained valid for the second phase of PACV.


6.      Project Development Objective of PACV Phase 2. The Project Development Objective
(PDO) stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) was: “CRD1s are enabled to fulfill their
mandate by planning and implementing inclusive local development activities, and improving
revenue performance to sustain their recurrent costs” (p. 7). The PDO was stated as follows in the
Grant Agreement: “To support the Recipient’s Rural Development Communities in fulfillment of
their mandate of planning and implementing inclusive local development activities, and improving
their revenue performance to sustain recurrent costs” (p. 5).

7.       To achieve this objective, the following key performance indicators were agreed:

             Percent of citizens in supported CRDs who participated in the local development
              planning process.
             Percent of citizens who consider that their views have been taken into account in the
              local development planning process.
             Percent of infrastructure investments financed by the project staffed on completion.
             Annual head tax (Contribution au Développement Local, CDL) collection rate in
              supported CRDs.


1 In a revision of the Code des Collectivités Locales (CCL), rural municipalities were placed on the same footing with urban
municipalities (Communes Urbaines, CUs) and their name was changed from CRD to CR; the terms are used interchangeably
throughout this report.


                                                               2
    1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
        and reasons/justification

8.     The PDO was not revised, but key performance indicators and their targets, including
baseline values, were revised by the midterm review team2 as follows:

             The targets for PDO indicators 1 and 2 were revised downward due to a revision in
              their baseline figures. The original baseline values for these indicators were taken from
              the PACV1 database which included only the Rural Municipalities (Communes
              Rurales, CRs)3 that had benefited from PACV1 project activities and were therefore
              not representative of all CRs (covered under PACV2). This became clear when the
              new, more detailed information became available from the results of a detailed baseline
              survey that was completed in 2009 with the support from the Development Impact
              Evaluation Initiative (DIME).

             PDO indicator 3 (Percent of infrastructure investments financed by the project staffed
              on completion) became an intermediate indicator, because it measured the performance
              of Component 2 rather than the PDO. It was replaced by a new indicator: Percentage
              of CRs that have implemented their Annual Investment Program (AIP) within the
              timeframe defined by the Project Implementation Manual (PIM).

             PDO indicator 4 (Annual head tax (contribution au développement local, CDL)
              collection rate in supported CRDs) was reformulated to take into account the fact that
              the government canceled the annual head tax in 2011, following the election of
              President Alpha Condé. The reformulated indicator (Percentage of CRs which have
              increased their tax and nontax receipts by at least 10%) took into account the overall
              level of revenues generated by the CRs.

             An intermediate outcome indicator - Percentage of CRs with a single Annual
              Investment Program (AIP) that reflects multiple funding sources (sources in addition
              to PACV, PGCT or PGCMB project resources)4 - was brought up to the PDO level, as
              it measured the performance of the CRs in the annual planning process and in
              mobilizing resources to support their AIPs.

             A new indicator (Number of beneficiaries who have improved access to socio-economic
              services due to infrastructure constructed under the project) was introduced. This core
              World Bank indicator, which measures the number of project beneficiaries had not been
              taken into account when the project was designed.

3 In a revision of the CCL, rural municipalities were placed on the same footing with urban municipalities (Communes Urbaines,
CUs) and their name was changed from CRD to CR.

Gestion Côtière et Maritime de la Biodiversité (Coastal Marine and Biodiversity Management Project).

       1.4 Main beneficiaries

9.      The project targeted residents of 304 CRs who, for the most part, had not benefited from
investment in essential basic social infrastructure and services. The target population was to benefit
directly from construction/rehabilitation of social infrastructure (schools, health facilities, roads
and bridges and crossing, etc.). Institutionally, all the 304 local government administrative
structures (CRs) and the prefectures, regional administration and National Directorate of
Decentralization (DND) were also to benefit from project interventions.

       1.5 Original components

10.    The project consisted of three components: (i) Local Investment Fund (LIF); (ii) Capacity
Building for Decentralized Rural Development; and (iii) Project Management, Monitoring, and
Evaluation.

Component 1: Local Investment Fund (LIF) (Appraisal Estimate US$ 8.9 million; Actual
US$ 8.6 million)

11.     The objective of Component 1 was for CRDs to receive and manage funds transparently to
develop and maintain technically sound infrastructure. Through participatory planning, budgeting,
and financial management, Component 1 provided an opportunity for local governments to
implement their own development plans and activities. Two financing windows were established
under the LIF - one for public socio-economic infrastructure and services identified by CRDs in
their Local Development Plans (LDPs) and a second to integrate activities aimed at ensuring
sustainable management and protection of natural resources. Incremental funding for the second
window came from two complementary, geographically limited pilot projects financed by the
Global Environment Facility (GEF) - the Community-Based Land Management Project (Projet de
Gestion Communauté des Terres, PGCT ) and Coastal Marine and Biodiversity Management
Project (Projet de Gestion Côtière et Maritime de la Biodiversité, PGCMB).5 Resources in the LIF
were intended to complement local governments’ investment budgets as a means of improving
access to basic socio-economic infrastructure in rural areas. Funds from the LIF were also intended
to help local governments leverage additional resources and to support efforts to build local
planning, implementation, and resource management capacity.

Component 2: Capacity Building for Decentralized Rural Development (Appraisal Estimate
US$ 4.2 million; Actual US$ 4.0 million)

12.      The objective of Component 2 was for CRDs to prepare and implement their development
and investment programs in an inclusive manner, with adequate support from de-concentrated
staff. It also aimed to increase CRDs’ capacity to manage the infrastructure they would finance.
To that end, the component would address and improve the technical and fiduciary skills needed
at the different decentralized levels to implement local development activities. It would also help
to develop a legal framework to support the fiscal and administrative decentralization provisions
in the CCL. More specifically, Component 2 had seven aims. First, it would develop CRDs’
capacity to undertake participatory planning and resource allocation based on a simple, results-

5   PGCMB closed on December 31, 2013; PGCT closed at the same time as PACV2 on December 31, 2014.

                                                           4
oriented approach, guided by the principles of community empowerment, transparency, and
ownership. Second, it would strengthen the capacity of de-concentrated staff and recruit
Community Development Agents (Agents de Développement Communautaire, ADCs) to support
CRDs in community-level development planning and investment. Third, it would develop CRDs’
capacity to broaden their revenue base, including ensuring accountability and transparency, and
(fourth) support activities that would promote transparency and accountability related to the LIF.
A fifth aim of Component 2 was to support outreach campaigns conducted by the project to
sensitize communities about the CCL and the roles and responsibilities of decentralized
institutions. Sixth, Component 2 would help to strengthen the government’s approach to
decentralized rural development, including by developing the provisions of the CCL, with a
particular focus on fiscal and administrative decentralization. Finally, Component 2 would support
legal and regulatory reforms related to decentralization, with a focus on fiscal decentralization.

Component 3: Project Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation (Appraisal Estimate
US$ 3.9 million; Actual US$ 4.8 million)

13.      The objective of Component 3 was to support the National Coordination Unit (Cellule
National de Coordination, CNC) so that it could effectively coordinate, monitor, and evaluate
activities under PACV2. The CNC’s project management responsibilities included: harmonizing
implementation procedures, preparing and overseeing the implementation of annual work
programs, providing support to the Project Steering Committee, organizing field supervision trips,
managing the LIF and transferring funds to local governments, and ensuring compliance with
project implementation procedures and guidelines. In addition, Component 3 would help CNC to
perform its monitoring and evaluation (M&E) functions by focusing on the collection of data to
measure the project’s progress and results, inform decisions taken under the project, and evaluate
the project’s impacts. Under Component 3, M&E also had a participatory emphasis; the intention
was for beneficiaries and the government to become involved in monitoring compliance with
technical and fiduciary guidelines as well as social and environmental safeguard policies. The
component also financed seven Regional Support Teams (Equipes Régionales d’Appui, ERAs)—
one for each administrative region—mandated with coordination, facilitation, mentoring, and
skills transfer at the local level.

       1.6 Revised components

14.         The components were not revised.

       1.7 Other significant changes

15.     Project restructuring. The project was restructured three times – in June 2012, May 2013
and December 2013.6 In December 2008, the President of the Republic died and the military took
over government affairs. In line with the World Bank’s operational policy regarding de facto
governments (OP 7.30), the Bank suspended disbursements until April 2011, when elections were
completed and a democratically elected government was formed. In early 2009, the annual work
plan was scaled back in line with the funds available in the Designated Account. By April 2010,
the initial deposit had been fully disbursed and most of the project staff was placed on

6   All were level two restructurings.

                                                5
administrative leave. Following the lifting of OP 7.30 on January 19, 2011, and the payment of
arrears in April 2011, the suspension was lifted on April 21, 2011. The project team was
reconstituted and put together an ambitious work plan to jumpstart implementation.

16.     In letters dated December 2011 and January 2012 the government requested: (i) an
increase in the Designated Account ceiling; (ii) a reallocation of fund proceeds; and (iii) a two-
year extension of the closing date. A revised Disbursement Letter was issued in December 2011
and the June 2012 restructuring granted a one-year extension of the closing date, pending the
outcome of the midterm review planned for October 2012. The Bank also reallocated funds to
cover additional operating costs arising from the two-year hiatus in activities and from the need
for PACV2 to essentially start all over again and scale up rapidly to reach the expanded number
of CRs included in the project’s second phase.

17.     A substantial backlog of AIPs accumulated during the hiatus in the project’s activities, and
to prevent further delays in implementation, the government requested a one-time exceptional
advance payment on April 20, 2012. The aim was to enable the government to quickly disburse
funds and clear the backlog. On May 25, 2012, the Bank approved the request and issued an
addendum to the Disbursement Letter that allowed an increase in the Designated Account (DA-A)
ceiling from US$ 2.5 to US$ 5.5million.

18.     In October 2012, the midterm review found that significant implementation progress had
been made after the Bank’s re-engagement, particularly under the LIF (Component 1). The
disbursement rate had increased from 20 percent in April 2011 to 75 percent at the time of the
midterm review. The implementation of Component 2 (capacity building) significantly lagged,
however. The team developed an ambitious work plan to speed implementation. The government
requested an extension of the closing date from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014 to
complete the activities in the work plan. The midterm review team also reformulated and
simplified some of the intermediate outcome indicators to make them more clear and measurable
(see Annex 10 for details). The May 2013 restructuring granted this extension and updated the
results framework based on the results of the MTR. The final restructuring was carried out in
December 2013 to reallocate proceeds and adjust financing percentages to take into account the
addition of AFD funding (see discussion below).

19.     Termination of “Cooperating Institution” arrangement between IDA and IFAD. As
with the first phase of the PACV, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) co-
financed the second phase under a pari passu financing arrangement, with IDA designated as the
“Cooperating Institution”.7 The IDA Grant Agreement was signed on September 20, 2007, and
the agreement with IFAD signed on October 4, 2007; the financing percentages were 62 percent
IDA and 38 percent IFAD. In addition, IDA was appointed the “Cooperating Institution” for IFAD.
This arrangement functioned well until OP7.30 went into effect. In June 2009 IFAD communicated
its concern to the World Bank over the suspension of disbursements,8 and in December 2009 IFAD
terminated its “Cooperating Institution” agreement with the Bank. At the request of the

7Under   the terms of the Cooperating Institution agreement, IDA was responsible for supervision activities and in particular the
fiduciary supervision. All withdrawal application were submitted to IDA form processing and once approved, instructions were
sent to IFAD to disburse on their share.
8 IFAD did not have OP 7.30 and did not stop disbursement until 2010 due to arrears.



                                                                6
Government, a modified agreement was reinstated after the Bank’s reengagement to allow the
multi-donor pari passu financing to continue.

20.    Modification to funding modalities to include AFD. AFD’s contribution to phase II of
the PACV was conditional on Guinea reaching the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
completion point. This took longer than expected and AFD’s financial support of € 6 million (US$
7.5 million) was only confirmed during the midterm review mission, and approved in December
2013. To avoid disruption to project activities, the government requested that AFD financing be
done in a joint rather than parallel manner. This required a reallocation of the remaining IDA grant
proceeds and a change in the financing percentages to take into account the new three-way pari-
passu financing. The IDA financing percentage changed from 62 percent to 18 percent and the
new ratios were AFD (70 percent); IDA (18 percent), and IFAD (12 percent).


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

   2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

21.      As indicated, the project was prepared as the second phase of a three-phase APL aimed at
strengthening local governance in rural areas and promoting social and economic empowerment
of the rural population, including women, youth, and other marginalized groups. Preparation fully
involved stakeholders from the government and development partners. Key government
institutions involved in preparing and designing the project included the Ministry of Planning;
Ministry of Territorial Administration and Decentralization (MATD); Ministry of Health (MoH),
Ministry of Education (MoE); Ministry of Water and Sanitation (MoWS); and Ministry of the
Environment, Water and Forests (MEEF). The World Bank, AFD, and IFAD were the main
development partners involved in project preparation and design.

22.    The project design was well conceived and very comprehensive. Key design features
included:

          Sound background analysis. In designing the project, the preparation team built on the
           findings and recommendations from targeted studies financed from the Project
           Preparation Facility during the identification and pre-appraisal stages. For example,
           three studies provided a comprehensive assessment of the state of decentralized
           institutions; the decentralization process; the availability and quality of legal
           instruments for decentralization; the relevance of the organizational and institutional
           framework; effectiveness of regulatory measures; competencies of the implementing
           agencies; the organization and functioning of the local tax system; the budget and
           accounting systems of the CRs; weaknesses in the political, institutional, and legal
           frameworks of the CRs; the absence of clearly delineated roles and responsibilities of
           the de-concentrated and decentralized units, and other issues (see annex 10 for list of
           supporting documents).

          Use of current Economic and Sector Work (ESW) to inform policy and institutional
           triggers. The design also benefitted from an ESW on decentralization in Guinea
           conducted by the Bank’s Public Sector Reform and Capacity Building Unit (AFTPR)

                                                 7
              and published in 2008. 9 Among the key issues identified in the report are: (i)
              insufficient revenue levels to allow local governments to assume their assigned role in
              local development; (ii) non-existence of intergovernmental transfer system; (iii) low
              precipitate local revenue which stood at 1.7 percent of national revenue, and far below
              West African levels; (iv) minimal local government spending largely from their own
              revenues; (v) poor local public financial management (PFM) due to low capacity,(vi)
              an incomplete legislative framework and marginal public participation in budgeting;
              (vii) deficient financial reporting and limited external audit of public funds. The author
              of the report was a member of the project design team and the finding of the report
              were instrumental in identifying relevant policy and institutional triggers to address
              some of the binding constraints for moving the decentralization agenda forward (see
              annex 9 for an overview of the triggers and progress toward meeting them).

             Significant government commitment. The government was very committed to project
              preparation and design. The government put together a project team that worked closely
              with the three development partners to design the project. The government also
              demonstrated its commitment by meeting all effectiveness conditions, which allowed
              the project to start as planned.

             A novel design that emphasized learning by doing and public-private partnerships to
              strengthen the capacity of local governments and communities. The design was novel
              owing to its emphasis on strengthening the institutional capacity of local governments
              and communities through learning by doing. Learning occurred throughout the cycle
              of sensitization, literacy training, participatory diagnosis, local development planning,
              definition and development of AIPs, mobilization of community contributions, signing
              of contract with PACV2 for transferring local investment funds, procurement of service
              providers for civil works, monitoring of construction, reception of works, maintenance
              of infrastructure, and reporting back to the communities throughout the process.10 For
              CRs that had completed a previous investment program, the cycle repeated itself from
              the stage of defining and developing the AIP onwards. These design elements were
              meant to improve the performance of CRs. The design of PACV2 also envisaged a
              public-private partnership approach as a new way of mobilizing resources for local
              development programs. The approach was integrated into the project’s results
              framework as a key performance indicator to track the mobilization of private sector
              resources, as follows: Percentage of CRs with a single Annual Investment Program
              (AIP) that reflects multiple funding sources (sources in addition to PACV, PGCT, or
              PGCMB project resources). The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) design was
              innovative in terms of local level data collection and the use of the Service Prefectural
              de Development (SPD) and Agent de Development Local (ADL) to collect, enter and
              report of data to central level.

38664 –GN. Document of the World Bank.
10 The design envisaged the establishment of special operational committees to carry out these functions (procurement

committees, committees to manage the local development fund, transparency committees, sub-prefectural committees, health
committees, public hygiene committees, M&E committees, committees for control and reception of works, and monitoring and
maintenance committees).

              Lessons learned. The preparation team incorporated key lessons from PACV1 into the
               design of phase two. They included: (i) fiscal capabilities were required at the local
               level to ensure the long-term viability of local governments; (ii)  the  supply of basic
               service infrastructure would not necessarily increase communities’ use of services; (iii)
               extra-budgetary procedures for investment funds undermined sustainable structures;
               and (iv) the need for more focused M&E Lessons from PACV1 regarding the allocation
               of project funds to CRs and on community contributions were also incorporated into
               the design. PACV1 had allocated a uniform amount (US$ 50,000) to CRs regardless of
               the size of their population or the area they covered. The preparation team for PACV2
               integrated a formula-based allocation mechanism into the design. The change to a
               formula-based approach was innovative; not only did it provide grants that were
               proportional to the relative needs of the local communities, but it sought to approximate
               an intergovernmental transfer mechanism that was going to be developed.  The team
               also envisioned graduated and progressive community contribution as the uniformed 5
               percent in-cash and 15 percent in-kind contributions instituted under phase 1 proved
               difficult for communities to contribute.

              Design of the implementation arrangements. The design of the implementation
               arrangements was sound and built on PACV1 implementation arrangements. To ensure
               relevance and consistency with government policy, the implementation arrangements
               were aligned with the provisions of the CCL, ratified by Parliament in 2006. The CCL
               outlined institutional and implementation arrangements for local governments. The
               PACV2 preparation team designed the project to incorporate activities aimed at
               strengthening the institutions under the CCL. At the operational level, activities related
               to Components 1 and 3 were managed by the CNC, and those under Component 2 were
               managed by DND in MATD. To ensure smooth execution of project funds and
               activities, as well as coherent reporting and accountability, an autonomous accounting
               and M&E system was established under DND and linked with the CNC system. The
               public institutions had a direct role to play in the management and implementation of
               project activities.

              Project risks. Project risks at appraisal were rated substantial. 11 The project team
               identified potential risks to project implementation and outcome and specified
               mitigation measures where possible. Some of the risks and their mitigation measures
               were: (i) disruption of project implementation by political instability (this risk was
               mitigated by exogenous factors) and (ii)  centrally appointed administrators at the
               regional, prefecture, and sub-prefecture levels undermine the effective functioning of
               CRDs (mitigated by establishing clear “rules of the game” that would transform de-
               concentrated entities into supporters of local development at the CRD level).

   2.2 Implementation

23.    The project was approved on August 14, 2007 and became effective on March 28, 2008.
The government met all conditions for effectiveness on time and the project started as planned.
However, nine months after effectiveness, as activities on the ground were getting underway,
disbursements were suspended due to the political situation (see Section 1.7). Following the
general elections in 2010, a democratic government was installed, and the Bank was able to lift
the ban on disbursement and re-initiate the project. As noted, the disbursement freeze  caused a
backlog of unfunded AIPs to accumulate and ended the “cooperating institution” arrangement
between the Bank and IFAD.

24.    Despite the slow-down, and eventual halt, in implementation due to the 28-month
disbursement freeze, the PACV2 was able to get “up and running” quickly, and implement an
ambitious work program, once activities resumed. Some of the factors that aided this positive
outcome were the following:

          The government was strongly committed to the project. Government officials at
           all levels of the decentralized system were very committed to the success of the
           project, and this strong demonstration of political will smoothed implementation.
           At the regional and prefecture level, the majority of governors, prefects, and sub-
           prefects were heavily involved in day-to-day implementation. A similarly strong
           sense of ownership made itself felt at the community level, where the mayors
           and other local elected officials were the linchpin of project activities.

          An experienced project management structure was in place. Because PACV2
           took advantage of the project implementation and management structure
           established under PACV1, few new staff needed to be recruited for key positions.
           The financial management, procurement, and M&E officers were all retained to
           continue project implementation.

          Staff of the project coordination unit (CNC) were highly competent and
           committed to the project’s success. Having been involved in the implementation
           of PACV1, the CNC staff had already become accustomed to and conversant
           with the World Bank’s operational procedures and instruments. They maintained
           their high level of commitment throughout implementation. Even when the
           project was suspended, the CNC maintained contact with development partners
           and key stakeholders. (In addition to managing PACV2, the CNC also managed
           PGCT and PGCMB to a high standard of excellence).

          Effective fiduciary control teams were in place at the community level. At the CR
           level, the project supported the local authorities to establish 10-member
           procurement committees charged with ensuring transparent and efficient
           procurement for the implementation of micro-projects/subprojects. These
           committees, to a large extent, executed their functions effectively. A technical



                                                10
              audit12 conducted to ascertain the quality of infrastructure built with support from
              the project emphasized the effectiveness of the local procurement committees.

             Beneficiary communities exhibited a high level of awareness and ownership of
              the project’s purpose and activities. In all communities where PACV2 was
              implemented, awareness of the project was high, and communities demonstrated
              strong ownership of activities. As discussed, by design the project introduced a
              learning-by-doing mechanism that involved the communities in implementing
              project activities. In all CRs, PACV2 is well known and is seen as a project for
              the people.

             A skeleton project staff was maintained while activities were suspended. The
              skeleton staff, maintained at the project coordination unit level, was tasked with
              safeguarding the project’s assets and remaining in contact with technical and
              development partners while disbursement was suspended. This approach helped
              to keep the project alive to some extent during a long, difficult period.

             The midterm review team was pro-active. The relatively long delay in
              implementation affected a substantial number of the project’s activities. For
              example, by the midterm review, the implementation of major activities,
              including the capacity building under Component 2 and the decentralization
              reforms, had not progressed as expected. The midterm review team developed
              an action plan to speed the implementation of activities (especially local
              development planning and the CR-level training programs) and to set up
              coordination teams (cadres de concertation) at the regional and prefecture level.
              The midterm review team also revised and reformulated project indicators and
              targets to ensure that they were simple, measurable, and achievable. These
              actions significantly improved implementation.

     2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

25.     M&E design. M&E was designed to incorporate a baseline survey and midterm and end-
of-project evaluations, which would provide information to monitor implementation and
ultimately measure the project’s impact on beneficiaries. The M&E design envisaged that a
management information system (MIS) would be set up to track and document project results
systematically. The design was innovative by using SPDs and ADLs to collect, enter and report of
data to the central level. As noted, the baseline (and therefore targets) for some of the project
indicators were based on data from PACV1, because the baseline survey for PACV2 had not been
completed prior to project approval. This resulted in a number of revisions during the mid-term
review (see Section 1.2).

26.     M&E implementation. The implementation of M&E was also hindered by the suspension
of disbursement. As a result, the midterm review noted that: (i) M&E was functioning in a limited
way at the prefecture level; (ii) data collection systems were not integrated at the regional level;

Villageoises, PACV-2, July 2013 (page 23).

                                                           11
(iii) the establishment of a computerized database was delayed in the prefectures; and (iv) the
establishment of a participatory M&E system was delayed in the CRs. The CNC addressed those
issues, and by time of the ICR, the project had established an M&E system in all regions,
prefectures, and CRs; data collection tools had been developed and made available to all
implementing agencies, including the installation of a database in every region and the M&E
manual had been internalized by the key actors. Personnel at each level were provided with
significant training to manage the database. To further strengthen the M&E system, a participatory
M&E approach, which took into account institutional changes at all levels of the decentralized
system, was developed and established in 21 CRs. These actions improved data collection and
overall M&E implementation. The M&E performance was in part measured by intermediate
outcome indicator 12: Percentage of prefectures that provide the required monitoring data in a
timely manner. At baseline none of the prefectures were able to provide the required monitoring
data (see Section F), whereas by the end of the project, 50 percent of prefectures (the target)
provided monitoring data in a timely manner.

27.      During the midterm review the results framework was reviewed in detail. Changes were
made to a number of indicators to provide more clarity and allow for more consistent measurement.
In addition, several targets were revised (both downward and upward) based on the results of the
baseline survey that was delayed due to the political situation, but completed (thanks to AFD
funding) in 2009 during suspension period. The aim of the revisions was to make them measurable
and achievable over the remaining life of the project. These actions helped improve data collection
at all levels of the M&E system.

28.     The baseline survey was conducted in 2009 (and its results used to revise the baseline
indicators, as mentioned), a midterm evaluation survey was not conducted because disbursement
had been suspended. Two end-of-project surveys were conducted, however, to obtain data to
measure the achievement of the outcome indicators and otherwise assess the project’s impacts and
outcomes.

29.     M&E utilization. M&E data informed decision making at all levels. Regular supervision
reports, which focused on progress in implementing agreed actions and recommendations, were
the main instruments used to inform decision making. These reports were extensively discussed at
the end of each supervision mission. In addition, the impact evaluations were widely disseminated
through stakeholder workshops. Workshops were also organized to train key actors and
disseminate the participatory M&E procedures manual.

   2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

30.     Safeguards. The project was classified as category B and triggered two safeguard policies:
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) and Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12). An Environmental
and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) were
prepared at the project’s inception to mitigate any potential issues related to land acquisition or
loss of economic activity on the part of individuals or groups of individuals in the project’s
intervention areas. These frameworks were updated to take into account the institutional and
legislative requirements of the country. Various safeguard reports during the implementation of
the frameworks showed no significant environmental and social impacts associated with the
implementation of the subprojects.

                                                12
 
31.     Financial management. Overall, the project operated a sound financial management (FM)
system, focused on the decentralized financing of interventions. PAVC2 complied fully with the
Bank’s operational policies on financial management (OP/BP 10.02). At the time of the ICR, all
Interim Financial Reports had been submitted on time, and the previous year’s audit reports had
been received and issued with an unqualified audit opinion. The target for financial audit
performance was fully achieved - namely, that at the end of the project, 100 percent of financial
audits were unqualified. In addition, all withdrawal applications had been completed. The last FM
supervision mission found that the FM system established by the project was acceptable. These
achievements reflect, among other things, the steps taken to resolve four FM issues identified at
midterm, which led the Bank’s FM team to issue a moderately satisfactory rating. First, the lack
of an internal auditor made it challenging to ensure that adequate internal controls were in place;
second, the voluminous FM procedures manual made it difficult for the CRs to comprehend the
steps they needed to take in order to carry out their FM responsibilities; third, the financial
accounting software did not automatically consolidate financial data; and fourth, the capacity of
fiduciary staff in the ERAs (operating at the regional level) and at the local level needed
strengthening. The midterm review mission discussed these issues with the project team and made
recommendations for improvement, which the project team diligently implemented. FM
performance improved significantly and subsequent FM supervision missions rated FM
performance as satisfactory.

32.     Procurement. The project team ensured compliance with the Bank’s procurement policies
(OP/BP 11.00). At the beginning of implementation, an 18-month procurement plan was prepared.
This plan was regularly updated to reflect increased activities undertaken under the different
components. Most procurement activities occurred at the local level, as the project established
local procurement committees in all of the beneficiary CRs. However, the disbursement freeze
resulted in some delays. For example, the acquisition of solar panels and computer equipment for
prefectures were not procured on time leading to delays in getting the decentralized M&E system
in place. The intermediate outcome indicator used to measure procurement performance was
Percentage of procurement activities that are carried out according to guidelines; at the end of
the project, 100 percent of procurement activities were carried out according to procurement
guidelines. The target was 100 percent.

33.    Disbursement. Overall disbursement was satisfactory. At the time of the ICR, project
funds were fully disbursed (see Annex 1 for details on project costs and financing).

     2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

34.    A number of measures have been put in place to consolidate the gains under the project.
For example, a local tax revenue generation strategy has been developed, validated, and is being
implemented. Its implementation includes the assignment of Community Receivers (Receveurs
Communautaires) 13 to all the beneficiary CRs to strengthen local expenditure and revenue
generation capacity. At the project’s inception, there were no Receveurs Communautaires; their

13 The functions of Receveurs Communautaires are to: (i) maintain accounts of the CRs; (ii) execute tax collection and recovery

tasks authorized by the President of the CR; (iii) keep money and assets of the CR; (iv) verify the regularity of any task given to
him/her by the President of the CR; (v) establish end-of-year account management.

                                                                13
functions were performed by administrative assistants who lacked competencies in managing
funds and collecting revenue. A mechanism for intergovernmental fiscal transfer of recurrent
expenditures to the CRs has also been established and is functional. Since 2011, the government
has regularly allocated an operating/recurrent budget to the CRs. Although the allocation is not
proportional to the needs of the CRs, the size of the allocation progressively increased from GNF
5 million in 2011 to GNF 45 million in 2014.

35.     To boost local resources, a new mining code that dedicates 15 percent of mining revenues
to finance local government has been developed. Systems for managing fiscal transfers from the
central government to local governments have improved significantly, and a budget nomenclature
that takes local revenues and expenditures into account has been developed. A legislation that
defines the roles and responsibilities of the deconcentrated territorial administration and technical
staff in specific sectors has been reviewed and harmonized with the provisions in the CCL. The
implementation of the CCL would bring about major changes in the roles and responsibilities of
government institutions, financing arrangements, staffing, and accountability mechanisms.

36.      Effective measures are being implemented to ensure sustainable maintenance of
infrastructure constructed and renovated under the project. At present 57.1 percent of CRs allocate
at least 1 percent of their budget to maintaining infrastructure. Citizens of CRs have been mobilized
to undertake regular maintenance activities; the data available show that over the past 12 months,
87.7 percent of districts have mobilized citizens to maintain health centers or health posts; 67.5
percent have mobilized citizens to maintain public buildings; and 87.7 percent have mobilized
them to maintain roads. Despite these efforts, finding personnel to run local facilities, particularly
education and health facilities, is a challenge. Some CRs have taken the initiative on their own to
hire teachers and health workers.

37.      Follow-on activities. The envisioned third phase of the PACV will consolidate the gains
from the PACV2, as well as integrate and scale-up pilot activities initiated under the PGCT. AFD
has already committed € 15million for the third phase and preparation activities are underway. The
Bank has recently confirmed US$ 10 million in support of the third phase; preparation is expected
to start in fiscal year 2016.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

     3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

38.     Relevance of objectives. The relevance of objectives is rated high. The project objectives
remain highly relevant and are consistent with the government’s development priorities, as
emphasized in PRSP2 (2011–12) and PRSP3 (2012–15).14 Chapter three of PRSP2 outlined the
key actions needed to improve the population’s access to social services (for example, improve
access to quality education for all, and improve the population’s access to health and nutrition
services, particularly for the rural poor). In PRSP3, subchapter 2.2.1.3 discusses the key strategic
pillar of strengthening decentralization and local governance, promoting local development, and

reducing regional imbalances. As mentioned, when the project was being designed, the overall
poverty rate in Guinea had increased and social indicators had worsened, including indicators for
nutrition, health, and access to potable water. By providing health centers and health posts, water,
schools, market infrastructure, public latrines, and other types of infrastructure and services to the
rural population, PACV2 buttressed the government’s policy objective of improving social
services and reducing poverty in the rural areas. The PDO is also relevant to the government’s
policy paper on decentralization, Lettre de Politique Nationale de Décentralisation et de
Développement Rural, and CCL, which outlines key strategies for ensuring territorial
development, strengthening institutions involved in decentralization and de-concentration,
strengthening the capacity of all stakeholders involved in the decentralization process, improving
the financing of decentralization, and improving the decentralization and local development
process.15

39.     The project is also consistent with the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY
2014–17, which has three strategic focal areas: (i) improving governance and service delivery; (ii)
stimulating growth and economic diversification; and (iii) strengthening human capital. By
strengthening the local government systems and providing social infrastructure in rural areas,
PACV2 directly supports the first strategic focal area of improving governance and service
delivery. It also contributes to stimulating growth and economic diversification at the local level
due to the decentralized procurement of small and medium-sized local enterprises for construction
of infrastructure.

40.     Relevance of design. The relevance of design is rated high. The design was relevant to the
achievement of the PDO, and the results framework was logical and relevant. The menu of
activities stated in the PAD was logically linked to the PDO, which was to support CRDs in
planning and implementing inclusive local development activities and to improve their revenue
performance to sustain recurrent costs. For example, Component 1 transferred resources from the
Local Investment Fund (LIF) to allow CRDs to develop and maintain social infrastructure through
a participatory planning, budgeting, and financial management process based on Local
Development Plans (LDPs). Component 2 provided the capacity building necessary to allow CRDs
to prepare and implement their own local development plans and annual investment programs in
an inclusive manner. It included targeted capacity-building interventions (such as training in
administration and in financial, accounting, and procurement management for the CRs) to improve
the management of expenditures and broaden the revenue base of CRs. It also supported the
implementation of awareness campaigns to broaden communities’ understanding of the roles and
responsibilities of the decentralized actors. APL financing – targeting institutional change through
a “learning-by-doing” approach - was an appropriate instrument/approach for addressing the
government’s goal of strengthening decentralized structures throughout the country.

    3.2 Achievements of Project Development Objectives

41.    PACV2 has substantially achieved its development objectives. The PDO was to support
the Recipient’s Rural Development Communities in fulfillment of their mandate of planning and
implementing inclusive local development activities, and improving their revenue performance to

15 Ministère de la Décentralisation et du Développement Local, Lettre de Politique Nationale de Décentralisation et de

                                                              15
sustain recurrent costs. The PDO encompassed three objectives: (i) to support CRDs to fulfil their
mandate of planning inclusive local development activities; (ii) to support the CRDs to fulfil their
mandate of implementing inclusive local development activities; and (iii) to improve local
development communities’ revenue performance to sustain recurrent costs.

42.     The first objective (support CRDs to fulfil their mandate of planning inclusive local
development activities) has been achieved, and all targets for its three key performance indicators
have been met. PDO indicator 1: Percentage of citizens in supported CRs who have taken part in
the local development planning process was fully achieved and its target surpassed. An end-of-
project impact assessment16 conducted by the National Statistics Institute (Institut National de
Statistique, INS) to measure the achievement of this indicator and project impacts showed that 30
percent of citizens participated in the local development planning process of their CRs, exceeding
the 27 percent project target by 11 percentage points. At baseline only 7.3 percent of citizens had
participated in the development of their LDP.

43.     Achievement of the first objective is also measured by PDO indicator 2: Percentage of
citizens who have participated in the planning and consider that their opinion has been taken into
account. The target for this indicator was fully achieved and surpassed. At the end of the project,
33 percent of citizens (against a target of 32 percent) who had participated in the local development
planning process considered that their opinions had been taken into account. At baseline, only 12
percent of citizens who participated in the local development planning process considered that
their opinions had been taken into account in developing their LDPs. Major interventions that
contributed to the achievement of the first objective were the targeted capacity-building and
sensitization programs conducted by the project through the ERAs under Component 2. Key
activities included information dissemination, awareness creation, support to develop and update
the LDPs, and especially training, which was provided to more than 232 de-concentrated and
decentralized staff, 137 local development agents (ADLs) and for 55 local elected officials (who
received training in local development planning and project management techniques).
Intermediate outcome indicator 5: Number of CRs who have a current (new or updated) Local
Development Plan increased from 159 at baseline to 304. At the end of the project, all 304 CRs
(100 percent) had current and updated LDPs that are subject to annual reviews during the process
of developing their AIP. The project initiated a review of planning guidelines to further improve
quality and take into account all the strategic areas of socio-economic development at the local
level. The participatory and inclusive planning process, coupled with targeted training in
development planning, were the key drivers behind the achievement of the first objective. The
inclusive planning process translated into improved capacity of the CRs in development planning.

44.    Objective 1 was also measured by PDO Indicator 5: Percentage of CRs with a single
Annual Investment Program (AIP) that reflects multiple funding sources (sources in addition to
PACV, PGCT, or PGCMB project resources). The target for this indicator was fully achieved and
surpassed. At the end of the project, 45 percent of CRs had AIPs that reflected multiple funding
sources (against a target of 40 percent). Based on the information available, a significant number
of CRs leveraged PACV2 funding for their AIPs with financing from other sources. For example,
in Kouakan CR in Macenta Prefecture, GNF 725,036,375 of the 2013 AIP of was jointly financed

funded by Rio Tinto-Simfer (a mining company based in Belya in N'Zérékoré Region). As shown
in Table 1, the CNC mobilized US$ 10,511,425 from sources outside of PACV2 to support the
development and implementation of communities’ LDPs. Through local authorities, the project
reached out to companies operating in the CRs through its sensitization activities and policy
dialogues. PACV is considered a flagship project for harmonizing the interventions decentralized
and local development projects. To that end, the project supported all local initiatives within the
framework of participatory local development, including providing support to some mining
companies to strengthen capacity in the local communities that were directly affected by the
companies’ activities. The CNC also obtained financing for an education project to test the
community approach in the context of a decentralization policy in the education sector. The
achievement of objective 1 is rated high.

45.     The second objective (support CRDs to fulfil their mandate of implementing inclusive local
development activities) was measured by PDO indicator 3: Percentage of CRs which have
implemented their Annual Investment Program (AIP) within the timeframe defined by the Project
Implementation Manual (6 months from the receipt of funds until the receipt of the AIP). The target
for this indicator was fully achieved and surpassed. At the end of the project, 75 percent of CRs
(against a target of 50 percent) had implemented their AIPs within the timeframe stipulated in the
Project Implementation Manual, exceeding the target by 25 percentage points. The project
financed the development and implementation of 358 AIPs which included 510 micro-projects
(see Annex 2). AIP implementation was strongly supported by targeted capacity-building
interventions implemented under Component 2. At the end of the project 7,870 people (of whom
354 were women) had received training in implementing AIPs. Specifically, the project
strengthened the capacity of staff in the beneficiary communities, including ADLs and local
elected officials, in: (i) the environmental and social safeguard policy; (ii) project management
and procurement procedures; (iii) financial management; (iv) procedures for LIF; (v) the
participatory M&E process; (vi) project M&E procedures; (vii) community procurement
procedures and techniques; and (viii) local planning techniques and local development
management (see Annex 2 for details). The achievement of objective 2 is rated high.

46.    Achievement of the planning as well as the implementation mandates was buttressed by
intermediate outcome indicator 6: Percent of local development plans in which the sub-prefecture
and prefecture sector staff have participated in the full project cycle (diagnosis, planning, and
implementation) (baseline 30%, target 60%, actual 100%). At the end of the project, 100 percent



                                                       17
of the local development plans had been implemented with the participation of sub-prefecture and
prefecture staff during the whole process.

47.     The third objective (improve the local development communities’ revenue performance to
sustain recurrent costs) was also achieved. Achievement of objective 3 was measured by PDO
indicator 4: Percentage of CRs which have increased their tax and nontax receipts by at least
10%. The economic impact assessment shows that the target for this indicator was surpassed. At
the end of the project, 52.6 percent of CRs (against a target of 50 percent) increased their tax and
nontax revenues by at least 10 percent, mainly because the resource mobilization capacity of CRs
improved as a result of project interventions. At baseline, only 25 percent of CRs had increased
their tax and nontax revenues. The project (i) strengthened the CRs’ capacity in local resource
mobilization techniques and budgeting, (ii) helped to develop new local community budget
nomenclature as well as administrative, financial, accounting, and procurement management
procedures, (iii) provided an introduction to using computers, (iv) developed a guide in the
fundamentals of community public accounting, and (v) developed participatory budgeting
procedures. The project also introduced innovative participatory budgeting and M&E tools in 21
CRs lent impetus to project activities at the local level; as a result, financial management and
accounting practices improved at the CR level. More than 4,323 people benefited from these
targeted training initiatives to improve local resource mobilization (see Annex 2 for details).

48.     The project also helped develop a strategy for the deployment of the Receveurs
Communautaires who were public servants recruited by the Ministry of Economy and Finance
(MEF) to work in the communities to support local budget management, accounting, and tax
collection, as well as the custodianship of royalties from mining companies operating in the mining
areas. The project also provided them with the requisite training that would enable them to
effectively carry out their duties. At the project’s inception, this role was performed by community
secretaries, who were not trained in financial management and accounting. The training and
placement of Receveurs Communautaires was one of the triggers for the third phase of PACV (see
Annex 9 for a full description of the triggers and level of attainment) and significantly improved
transparent management and mobilization of local resources.

49.    Improved revenue performance was also due to the financial transparency exhibited by the
CRs, which was measured by Intermediate outcome indicator 1: Percentage of supported CRs
that use some means to inform citizens on financial details. At the end of the project, all the
supported CRs (100 percent, against the target of 87 percent and the baseline of 50 percent) used
some means of informing citizens about financial activity (through posters displayed at
administrative buildings and other public places, as well as in mosques, churches, and village
meetings). The INS survey also found that 100 percent of the sampled CRs published their
financial information. The achievement of objective 3 is rated high.

50.    PDO indicator 6: Number of beneficiaries who have improved access to socio-economic
services due to infrastructure constructed/rehabilitated under the project17 measured the well-
being of rural citizens as a result of local authorities’ ability to fulfil their mandate of inclusive
planning and implementation of local development projects. Through the implementation of
Component 1 (LIF), the project increased access to basic social infrastructure and equipment for

17   This core indicator was added at MTR but no target was set due to the demand-driven nature of project activities.

                                                                 18
an estimated 2,325,966 direct beneficiaries (about 20 percent of the population of Guinea). By the
end of the project, over 510 micro-projects were completed including the construction or
rehabilitation of 216 schools (393 additional classrooms), 118 health posts, 49 bridges/crossing,
40 market structures, 30 administrative buildings, 26 youth/cultural centers, 17 water points and
10 public latrines (see Annex 2 for details).

51.     According to the results of the INS survey, the construction/rehabilitation of this basic
infrastructure significantly improved beneficiaries’ access to basic social services. Over 72 percent
of respondents indicated that it took them 15 minutes or less to get to a water point, versus 0.5
percent of respondents who reported needing more than 2 hours to reach a water point. To reach a
primary school, 40.9 percent of respondents needed 15 minutes or less, compared to 7.8 percent
who needed more than 2 hours. In contrast, 24 percent of respondents still needed more than 2
hours to reach a health post, compared to 18.2 percent of respondents who could reach one in 15
minutes or less. Findings from the economic impact assessment also showed that beneficiaries’
access to portable water and education increased significantly. The average time for a beneficiary
to walk to the nearest water point decreased from 37 minutes in 2009 to 21 minutes in 2014.
Similarly, the average time for a beneficiary to walk to the nearest primary school decreased from
52 minutes in 2009 to 49 minutes in 2014. The survey also showed that the beneficiaries’ access
to access to public transport, as a result of the construction and rehabilitation of bridges and
crossings, had increased significantly. The average time for a beneficiary to reach the nearest place
to get public transport decreased from 120 minutes in 2009 to 91 minutes in 2014 (see Annex 6).

53.     The project also contributed significantly to the long-term objective of the PACV APL -
to strengthen local governance in rural Guinea and promote social and economic empowerment

                                                        19
of the rural population, including women, youth, and other marginalized groups. The vision of the
program was that, upon completion of the final phase (Phase 3), local communities and their
representative local governments will have developed:

                The capability to identify, prioritize, plan, and manage their own infrastructure and
                 service delivery.
                The capacity to mobilize and use transparently the resources necessary to finance the
                 establishment, rehabilitation, and maintenance of basic community infrastructure.
                The ability to oversee the implementation, operation, and continued maintenance of
                 community infrastructure, either by contracting private firms or through the support of
                 the de-concentrated government services.
                The capacity to sustain the development efforts and to enhance good governance
                 practices.

54.     Although no specific indicators are associated with this vision, the INS survey and
independent economic impact assessment provide evidence of PACV2’s contribution to each
vision statement as described below.

55.     Vision statement 1: The capability to identify, prioritize, plan, and manage their own
infrastructure and service delivery. The INS household survey and independent economic impact
assessment of subprojects show that local communities and their representatives significantly
improved their ability to identity, prioritize, plan, and manage their infrastructure and service
delivery, which in turn has translated into the capacity of CRs to maintain their infrastructure.
Results of the INS survey at the community level show, for example, that the majority of districts18
that benefited from social infrastructure (67 percent) maintain their infrastructure. At the more
disaggregated level, the survey shows that three-quarters of the districts in the regions of Mamou
(78.3 percent), Kankan (78 percent), and N’Zérékoré (74.5 percent) repair their infrastructure,
owing to the communities’ ability to mobilize citizens for the maintenance. Citizens renovated or
maintained health centers or health posts in 35.2 percent of districts; public buildings in 67.5
percent of districts; and rural roads in 87.7 percent of districts over the past 12 months. More than
three-quarters of districts in the regions of Boké (87.5 percent), Labé (86.2 percent) and Faranah
(76.9 percent) mobilized citizens to renovate or maintain school buildings over the same period.

56.     Vision statement 2: The capacity to mobilize and use transparently the resources
necessary to finance the establishment, rehabilitation, and maintenance of basic community
infrastructure. CRs significantly improved their capacity to mobilize and use resources in a
transparent manner. Throughout project implementation, the CRs’ capacity to mobilize revenues
improved. The INS survey shows that average tax revenue of CRs increased consistently between
2011 and 2014, growing from GNF 22.1 million in 2011 to 23.2 in 2012 and then steadily
increasing to reach GNF 36.2 million in 2014 (Figure 1).

57.    The CRs have also shown that they can manage their resources transparently. The
economic impact assessment survey shows that in compliance with Article 530, subparagraph 3 of
the CCL, which requires the public disclosure of AIPs 15 days after their adoption by the council
(“Un exemplaire du programme annuel d’investissement est déposé dans chaque bâtiment
administratif de la collectivité, où il demeure à la disposition du public, dans les quinze (15) jours
suivant son adoption par le Conseil”), the dissemination of budget information is on the rise in
many CRs. Table 3 indicates that the use of posters in office buildings increased from 35 percent
in 2009 to 63 percent in 2014. Beyond this legal requirement, other channels of information
dissemination improved over 2009–14. Posters in public places in the city center of the CRs rose
from 10 percent to 29 percent, public disclosure in the marketplace increased from 21 percent to
22 percent, public notices in villages went from 4 percent to 7 percent, and radio announcements
increased from 17 percent to 23 percent. Nonetheless, other means of information dissemination,
including village meetings and public notices in mosques and churches, decreased. Results of the
INS survey also confirm that 7 of 10 CRs published their accounts in the last 12 months preceding
the survey; 74.4 percent of the CRs in Mamou and 75 percent in Labé Regions published their
accounts.

58.     Vision statement 3: The ability to oversee the implementation, operation, and continued
maintenance of community infrastructure either by contracting private firms or through the
support of the de-concentrated government services. The project considerably strengthened the
capacity of the local communities and their representatives to oversee local development projects.
The establishment of various local committees—for procurement, transparency, M&E, control and
reception of works, and monitoring and maintenance—has proven a particularly effective means
for CRs to manage and oversee implementation of their development projects on daily basis. The
ICR team’s investigation with prefects and sub-prefects also found that they provided substantial
oversight of development projects implemented in the CRs under their jurisdiction by working
collaboratively with local authorities to ensure that development projects are on course and
implemented according to plan.

59.     Vision statement 4: The capacity to sustain the development efforts and to enhance good
governance practices. Governance at the CR level has improved considerably, as shown by results
of the INS survey on the archiving and availability of documents in the CRs, the composition of
management structures, and general information on the communities. CR offices have archived
information on LDPs (99.1 percent), AIPs (99.1 percent), CR budgets (98.3 percent), vouchers
(97.4 percent), and registry meetings (97.4 percent). Further  analysis by administrative region
shows that all (100 percent) of the CRs in Kankan region, 99.4 percent in Labé region, and 91
percent in N’Zérékoré region have properly archived their records. Procurement documents exist
and are well archived in 84 percent of CRs. Most CRs keep minutes of commune council meetings,
and 88 percent have the board’s letter of invitation in their archives.


       3.3 Efficiency

60.     The financial and economic analysis done at appraisal was largely qualitative. A cost-
benefit analysis based on calculations of the project’s economic rate of return (ERR) and net
present value (NPV) was not done. The reason stated was that the demand-driven nature of project
activities did not lend itself to standard cost-benefit analysis, thus alternative means of analyzing

                                                              22
efficiency were used. Based on the analysis summarized below, project resources appear to have
been used efficiently. However, given the lack of a cost-benefit analysis, efficiency is rated modest.

61.     Analysis of the quality of infrastructure constructed or rehabilitated under PACV2.
A technical audit of a sample of subprojects at the CR level showed that the infrastructure
constructed and/or rehabilitated under the project was generally of good quality. Over 78 percent
of subprojects were satisfactory, mainly due to the effective and transparent procurement system
established in all CRs. The procurement capacity of the CRs were significantly strengthened and
translated into transparent procurement processes, including contract management. In most CRs,
bidding documents are filed appropriately. Procurement documents from the CRs show that cost
estimates and quotations are all realistic and overall below planned expenditures in the AIPs. In
fact, the project saw net gains of GNF 126.7 million in the cost of implementing micro-projects
because the total contract costs of works executed was less than the planned expenditures indicated
in the AIPs (see Annex 3 for a details). The strong procurement capacity of the beneficiary CRs is
also evident in the findings of the economic impact assessment conducted as part of project closure.
The competencies of a sample of 120 CRs participating in PACV2 were compared with those of
projects supported by other donors in the sector. The CRs supported through PACV2 were more
competent in carrying out procurement activities to recruit a firm than projects supported by other
donors. Overall, the building or renovation of 67 percent of schools under PACV2 was done
through competitive bidding compared to 54 percent of projects implemented by other donors.
Similarly, 70 percent of health posts were built through a competitive bidding process, compared
with 50 percent of those built under projects supported by other donors (see Annex 3 for details).
As noted in Section 2.4, evidence of improved procurement capacity is seen in the achievement of
intermediate outcome indicator 10: Percentage of procurement activities that are carried out
according to guidelines (baseline 0, target 100%, actual 100%).

62.     Comparison of unit costs of PACV2 infrastructure with non-PACV2 infrastructure.
An analysis of the unit costs of PACV2 social infrastructure revealed that PACV2 interventions
are cost effective compared to non-PACV2 projects. The ICR team analyzed unit costs of health
and education infrastructure (schools, health posts, and health centers) built or renovated under
PACV2 and unit costs of similar infrastructure built by government ministries (MATD, MoH, and
MoE). Despite the difficult environment in which PACV2 operated, the unit costs of the project’s
physical outputs for which comparable data were available compared favorably with those of other
projects. Under PACV2, a fully equipped health center was completed at a unit cost of GNF
277,289,437, compared with GNF 365,000,000 for a health center constructed by MATD and GNF
346,697,431 for a health center constructed by MoH. In addition, a fully equipped health post
completed under PAVC2 cost GNF 277,289,437, compared with GNF 275,000,000 for a post
completed by MATD and GNF 227,146,573 for one built by MH. A fully equipped primary school
constructed under PACV2 cost GNF 328,788,612, compared with GNF 350,000,000 for a school
built by MATD and GNF 450,000,000 for one built by MoE.

    3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

63.    The overall outcome rating is moderately satisfactory. The relevance of the objectives and
design were high and the development objectives were substantially achieved, however efficiency
was rated modest given the lack of a cost-benefit analysis.

    3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

    (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
64.     Impact on employment. Through the construction and renovation of subprojects, the
project created significant employment in the beneficiary CRs. Available data in PACV2’s
geographic information system database shows that a total of 7,912 quarterly employment (31,648
per year) were created by the project as shown in table 4 below, education and health infrastructure
projects created more employment compared to other sectors, together creating 5,931 jobs
(education-3,871 and health-2,060) of the total employment created.

         No. of jobs (quarterly)           1,361          3,877       1,478       1,196       7,912
         No. of jobs (yearly)              5,444         15,508       5,912       4,784       31,648

2014. 

65.     Impact on gender. Gender impacts were not discernible from the project documents or the
end-of-project impact assessment done by INS, but some data on gender impacts were provided in
the economic impact assessment survey. That survey showed encouraging findings on women’s
participation in development planning and management of public institutions: 20.4 percent of
women participated in development planning for their CRs compared to 35 percent of men. Of the
women who participated in the development planning process for their CRs, 14 percent considered
that their opinions had been taken into account, compared to 26.3 percent of men. Only 23.6
percent of women are in management positions in their CRs.
    (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

66.     Major impacts on institutional development occurred at the national and subnational
levels. At the national level, the project strengthened the DND’s capacity for overall project
management. By virtue of housing the M&E activities under Component 2, as well as establishing
an autonomous financial accounting unit, staff of MATD had the opportunity to be actively
involved in their national development. DND staff benefited from various capacity-building
interventions supported through the project, and the department was also equipped with the tools
required to perform their functions effectively.



                                                       24
67.     At the subnational level, the project strengthened the ability of the prefectural offices to
improve their operational capacity. In addition to renovating the prefectures’ administrative
buildings, the project equipped the Prefectural Development Services (Services Préfectoral de
Développement, SPDs) and Technical Development Services (Services Techniques de
Development, STDs) with office equipment such as computers, solar kits, and bicycles. To
improve the capacity of these services to participate in local development, the project supported:
(i) development of their operational plans; (ii) establishment of cadres de concertation at regional
and prefecture levels; (iii) the development of guidelines for local communities for public
accounting; (iv) the revision of budget nomenclature for local communities; and (v) the updating
of administrative, financial, accounting, and procurement manuals. At the community level, all
304 CRs have now developed or updated their respective LDPs. To strengthen local governance,
the project helped establish operational committees, such as committees to manage LDFs; sub-
prefectural committees, health committees, public hygiene committees, transparency committees,
and procurement committees.

   3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey

68.     The methodologies and findings of the end-of-project beneficiary survey and the economic
impact assessment are presented in Annex 5. The end-of-project beneficiary survey had a sample
size of 160 beneficiaries (CRs), whose citizens and authorities generally expressed favorable views
on the project. The sample for the economic impact assessment was 120 beneficiaries (CRs). These
were the two key studies conducted to gauge the project’s development impacts.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcomes

69.      The PAD outlined risks to development outcomes and mitigation measures at the national,
sectoral, and operational level. Project-specific risks, which were related to technical and design
issues, implementation and institutional issues, and fiduciary issues were identified and mitigated.
The capacity building interventions supported by the project helped strengthen the public
institutions at all level, government ownership at national and local level has improved as it has
been supportive to further strengthening the relevant institutions. For example, a National
Commission is in place for the development of draft decrees that establish the FNDL and EPA.
Government and rural citizens are also committed to the maintenance of the infrastructure
supported by the project as noted in section 2.5 above. Capacity building interventions support
by the project has provided the rural communities with the skills and tools for championing their
own development agenda. Despite these efforts, the likelihood that development outcomes may
not be maintained is substantial. The previously identified political risk, which materialized and
stalled implementation for two years remains significant at project closure. The current political
atmosphere is somewhat volatile. General elections are expected to take place soon, and the
opposition and government are not in agreement over whether local elections should be conducted
before the general elections. The opposition believes that local elections should precede general
elections (a tacit deal agreed upon in 2013 between the ruling party and the opposition); the
government has a different view. Although there is an ongoing discussion between the government
and the opposition to better resolve the issue, this may affect development outcomes. In addition,
some of the social infrastructure constructed under the project has no accompanying facilities. For
example, during a visit to some youth centers in Labé district, the ICR team noted that the centers

                                                25
lacked water points, which hinders full use of the facilities. The functionality of some facilities is
a major concern as well, because no personnel are available to run them, a particular problem in
education and health facilities.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

   5.1 Bank Performance

   (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

       Rating: Satisfactory

70.     Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated satisfactory. The Bank team worked
closely with the government team to design the project. The design benefited from a sound sector
analysis, undertaken through targeted studies funded from the Project Preparation Facility. In
addition an ESW on decentralization in Guinea was particularly useful in identifying relevant
triggers for the third phase of the APL. The design was aligned with the government’s Lettre de
politique de la decentralization, Code des collectivités locales and PRSP as well as the World
Bank CAS/CPS. The team incorporated valuable lessons from PACV1 in the design and with slight
modifications maintained the implementation arrangements established under PACV1. The
design was novel in supporting established local government systems, with strong control
mechanisms at the CR level, to implement the project’s interventions. Prominent control
mechanisms included local procurement committees, which were tasked with managing
procurement activities and contracts. A training of trainer’s approach was implemented whereby
CNC and DND staff were trained to build capacity in the fiduciary teams established at the regional
level. These teams in turn provided training to CRs and supervised their activities. This
arrangement supported transparency immensely at all levels of implementation. The World Bank
and government teams effectively coordinated preparatory activities. The Bank also liaised
effectively with IFAD and AFD to establish a basket funding mechanism to finance project
interventions.

71.     To ensure smooth implementation of activities, the World Bank worked with the project
team to develop a comprehensive list of risks and identified mitigation measures to incorporate
into the project design. The Bank and the team also developed a sound results framework, which
captured PDO outcome and intermediate outcome indicators, including putting in place an
affective M&E system. The PDO and key performance indicators and intermediate outcome
indicators were largely linked. Although data was available from the PACV1, the baseline survey
for the PACV2 (which placed a greater emphasis on behavioral changes at the CR-level) was not
completed prior to project approval. Therefore the targets of several indicators had to be revised
once the baseline survey results were available – these changes were incorporated at the time of
the mid-term review (see Annex 9).

   (b) Quality of supervision

       Rating: Satisfactory


                                                 26
72.    Bank performance during project supervision is rated satisfactory. The Bank organized
two missions per annum to provide implementation support to the government. The mission team
included technical specialists who provided hands-on solutions to key implementation issues,
including transferring knowledge to their government counterparts. The Bank maintained good
working relation with government officials throughout implementation.

73.     With its key fiduciary staff based in the country, the Bank worked closely with the
government team to discuss and resolve fiduciary issues. The team kept management informed of
implementation progress through systematic reporting in aide-memoires, back-to-office reports,
and ISRs. Regular and timely supervision with an appropriate mix of skills contributed
significantly to improve project implementation. One task team leader (TTL) who knew the project
very well remained with it for six years, building and maintaining strong relations with the
project’s staff.

74.     The Bank was very proactive during the suspension. It held regularly video and audio
conferences to maintain some momentum and worked with the project team to retain a skeleton
staff responsible for maintaining contact with key stakeholders and safeguarding the project’s
assets. When implementation resumed, the Bank responded positively to the government’s request
to reallocate funds and extend the closing date to scale up implementation. To improve operational
effectiveness, the Bank, with IFAD and AFD, organized a joint midterm review mission from
October 8–26, 2012 to review progress toward the achievement of the PDO. The midterm review
team fine-tuned and revised indicators considered unmeasurable and unachievable; in particular,
it revised baseline figures in light of results from the 2009 baseline survey, which had not been
available at preparation. Given that the suspension of activities lasted for two years, the midterm
review team also set more realistic targets for the indicators. New indicators were introduced, and
others moved between the PDO and intermediate outcome levels. The revisions to the indicators
clarified the project team’s understanding of the indicators and how they would be measured
against their targets.

   (c) Justification for Rating Overall Bank Performance

       Rating: Satisfactory

75.     Taking into account the Bank’s efforts in ensuring quality at entry and quality of
supervision, the overall performance of the World Bank is rated satisfactory. The design was
comprehensive and took into account the lessons from the first phase and finding of an extensive
ESW on decentralization in Guinea. Although some indicators could have been formulated with
greater precision, the team was proactive is addressing this issue during the mid-term review.
While OP7.30 was in effect in Guinea, Bank maintained steady contact with the project team,
which helped the project to resume more rapidly than it could otherwise have done.

   5.2 Borrower performance

   (a) Government Performance

       Rating: Moderately satisfactory


                                                27
76.     Government performance is rated moderately satisfactory. The government was
committed to achieving the project objectives, facilitated preparation and design, and met all
conditions for effectiveness. The government’s inability to maintain a stable socio-political
atmosphere significantly affected implementation, however. The move to military rule following
the President’s death led the Bank to suspend disbursement and delayed project implementation
for two years. After activities resumed, the new government showed a renewed commitment to the
project’s success. MATD (a department of DND) participated heavily in implementation and
worked collaboratively with CNC to implement activities under Component 2. The government
demonstrated its renewed commitment at the regional, prefecture, and CR levels, where regional
governors, prefects, sub-prefects, and mayors of CRs showed a real sense of ownership of the
project.

      (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

         Rating: Satisfactory

77.     The implementing agency’s performance is rated satisfactory. During implementation, the
CNC (directly responsible for the implementation of Components 1 and 3, plus overall project
coordination) worked collaboratively with line ministries, the Bank, IFAD, and AFD to coordinate
all stakeholder-related activities. Benefitting from the experience and lessons of PACV1, the CNC
performed remarkably well. During implementation, the CNC maintained good relations with line
ministries and all technical and financial partners, working closely with each of them to address
implementation challenges. The CNC exhibited high reporting standards and promptly responded
to all queries. The ICR team’s discussion with IFAD and AFD revealed that the project’s success
was largely a result of the CNC’s diligence. Perhaps the most commendable effort of the CNC
was the fact that it continued to work with stakeholders during the difficult period when
disbursements were suspended. The skeleton staff ensured that the project’s assets were
maintained and kept in touch with the TTL, mainly through video and audio conferences. The
DND’s performance in implementing Component 2, with support from the CNC, improved over
time, allowing the project to largely achieve its objectives under the component.

      (c) Justification for Rating Overall Borrower Performance

      Rating: Moderately satisfactory

78.     The overall borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory. The government was
committed to the project’s success, although socio-political upheaval rendered the project inactive
for a considerable amount of time, which delayed implementation.


6. Lessons Learned

79.      Several key lessons were learned during the implementation of PAVC2.

            Empowering communities by introducing a participatory M&E mechanism ensures
             real ownership of community development. PACV2 provided rural communities with
             the opportunity to identify, prioritize, plan, and manage their own infrastructure and

                                                 28
    service delivery through a participatory, learning-by-doing approach. When
    communities are empowered and given the requisite tools, they can address their own
    development issues. 

   The involvement of decentralized institutions in planning and implementing
    community activities does not necessarily mean that a decentralization policy will be
    adopted in the various sectors. The success of decentralization is tightly linked to the
    effective transfer of knowledge, skills, and competencies to local authorities. It would
    be inaccurate, however, to conclude that transferring skills to local authorities would
    lead to central government institutions to withdraw from their responsibilities. Rather,
    the transfer of knowledge and competencies provides a new framework for central
    government and local government institutions to partner and share responsibilities in
    delivering public services. The process of decentralization depends on recognizing all
    players involved and taking into account their objectives and their approaches to
    carrying out those missions. To that end, a good practice is to define, develop, and
    implement - in a progressive and participatory manner - a sector-by-sector
    decentralization and devolution action plan that results in an integrated and coherent
    strategy for transferring skills and competencies. Such an effort could focus on
    education, health, water, urban planning, and environment sectors as the main
    priorities. 

   Increasing the tax revenues available to the CRs is not simply the result of
    establishing market infrastructure or implementing income-generating activities; it
    also depends on the development of civil society and good governance at the local
    level. Good governance mechanisms introduced by the project at the local level raised
    the level of trust between citizens and local institutions. The implementation of LIF is
    currently building on that foundation to develop a new mode of governance. Through
    planning and implementing inclusive, transparent community action plans, citizens
    have become more involved in and committed to local tax and nontax resource
    mobilization. 
     
   The regular transfer of financial resources to communities is essential to improve
    local competencies and ensure that local institutions are sustainable. Aside from
    mayors’ allowances and recurrent expenditures, local institutions receive no other state
    budget dedicated to development activities. Revisions to the tax system, however, have
    provided CRs with variety of taxes and local tax benefits. Several factors affect
    mobilization of local taxes, including difficulty in collecting taxes, the shared tax
    management system (between the state and the CRs), and the complexity of the overall
    tax system. With increased demand for a variety of local services, and the increase in
    recurrent costs associated with local development, a consistent government allocation
    (based on an equalization system that reflects real needs) is essential for CRs to remain
    viable.

   Participatory budgeting and M&E are key project management tools that should be
    made available to local stakeholders to effectively drive the local development
    process. One of the goals of decentralization is for the government and its institutions

                                         29
          to operate where they are closer to citizens and their needs, respecting the principle of
          subsidiarity and be responsible for responding to needs and executing tasks at the
          lowest possible decentralized level. The results of the introduction of participatory
          budgeting and M&E tools in 21 local CRs show that when the local authorities are well-
          equipped and resourced, planning is better, and they can implement their own
          development plans.

         Ensuring inclusive local planning and development with a focus on gender and the
          marginalized groups will contribute to the full achievement of program goals.
          PACV2’s objective was to ensure inclusive local development, but data for its
          performance indicators were not disaggregated by gender and marginalized group,
          obscuring PACV2’s impacts on these groups. Future projects should be designed to
          ensure that information on gender and marginalized groups is disaggregated in project
          performance indicators.

1.      Project cost, financing, and disbursement. At appraisal the estimated total project cost
amounted to US$ 56 million, of which IDA was to finance US$ 17 million, IFAD US$ 10 million
(pari passu financing), GEF US$ 10 million, and US$ 12 million was expected from other sources,
including AFD. The government’s counterpart contribution was estimated at US$ 1.5 million, and
local communities’ contribution was estimated at US$ 5.5 million. The GEF financing was used
instead to prepare a complementary environment project (PGCT), which was implemented and
closed together with PACV2 on December 31, 2014. Table (c) provides appraisal cost estimates.

2.       Various financing sources are discussed below:

             Project costs. IDA project costs by component are shown in Table (a). Total estimated
              amount was US$ 17.0 million, of which US$ 17.4 million (102.1%) was spent.
              Component 3 was the only component that disbursed over and above the estimated
              amount (by 23%, or US$ 900,000), due to a reallocation of funds proceeds in favor of
              operating expenses on two occasions.

             Donor financing. Total estimated IDA financing was US$ 17.0 million, of which US$
              17.4 million (102.1%) was spent. Total FAD financing was estimated at US$ 10.0
              million, of which US$ 9.6million (96.0%) was spent, and total estimated AFD
              financing amounted to US$ 7.5 million, of which US$ 7.5 million (100.0%) was spent.

             Borrower financing. Due to the macroeconomic and fiscal challenges facing the
              government as result of the socio-economic crises, the estimated government
              counterpart funding contribution of US$ 1.5 million was waived as the donors absorbed
              the entire project costs.

             Local government financing. The actual amount of community contribution was
              lower than expected (US$1.8) because the capitation tax for communities was
              abolished; and as a results the 15% community contribution was revised downward to
              10% (8% in-kind and 2% in cash). The actual community contribution of US$1.8
              million, represented 32.7% of the appraisal estimate of US$ 5.5 million.

   Expenditure categories. US$ 241,630.36 in the Designated Accounts A was
    reimbursed by IFAD, and the amount has already been returned to the Bank. US$
    431,347.20, which was refinanced by AFD, fully utilized and justified. The project
    team is now in discussion with the loan department in Nairobi to close the account.

   Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Local Investment Fund (LIF) (Planned US$ 8.9 million vs. Actual US$ 8.6
million)

1.      This component financed socio-economic infrastructure and services identified by the CRs
in their LDPs, which increased local communities’ access to basic social infrastructure in rural
areas. Specifically, the component financed rehabilitation, construction, and equipment of basic
social infrastructure. To track and measure implementation progress, two core indicators of
intermediate outcomes were used: number of health facilities constructed, renovated, and/or
equipped and number of additional classrooms built or rehabilitated at the primary level resulting
from project interventions; At the end of the project, 118 health facilities were constructed,
renovated, and equipped, and 393 additional primary school classrooms were built/rehabilitated.

2.      To ensure quality and functionality of the infrastructure constructed/rehabilitated, two
indicators were used: percentage of technical audits of infrastructure financed under the Annual
Investment Program that conform to technical norms and percentage of infrastructure financed by
the project that are staffed on completion. At the end of the project, 75% of technical audits of
infrastructure found that it conformed to standard technical norms, compared to 60% at baseline.
An analysis of technical reports from missions monitoring technical services shows that on
average, 75% of completed facilities and equipment were considered to conform to technical
standards. A technical audit conducted as part of project closure further supports these results. The
results of the technical audit showed that 78.2% of micro-projects are found to be of good quality.
The main drivers of the good quality of the infrastructure built under the project were the local
implementation committees established by the project, which diligently carried out their tasks.

3.       The functionality of the infrastructure was measured by two indicators. The first one was
the percentage of infrastructure financed by the project that are staffed on completion (baseline
75%, target 85%, actual 98%). At completion, 98% of the infrastructure financed by the project,
particularly education and health infrastructure, was staff, against the target of 85%. At baseline
75% of the infrastructure was staffed. The second one was the percentage of CRs that allocate
adequate funds (at least 1% of their annual budget) to maintenance of infrastructure (baseline
28%, target 50%, actual-57%). The results of the survey conducted in 2014 by the INS also
showed that 57.1% of CRs increased funding for maintaining infrastructure and community
facilities by more than 10%. The contractual agreement on maintenance, coupled with
improvements in CRs’ revenue-generating capacity, led to the achievement of this indicator. A
key feature of the project’s design was that a standard contract had to be singed to transfer LIF
from PACV2 to the CRs. Article 6 of the contract required CRs to commit to allocating sufficient
funds in their annual budgets for the regular maintenance of infrastructure on a sustainable basis.
Component 2: Capacity Building for Decentralized Rural Development (Planned US$ 4.2
million vs. Actual US$ 4.0 million)

4.      This component financed activities aimed at empowering CRs to prepare and implement
their development and investment plans in an inclusive manner, with adequate support from de-
concentrated staff. For example, the project helped to establish: (i) procurement committees; (ii)
transparency committees (iii) M&E committees; (iv) committees for control and reception of civil

                                                 34
works; and (v) monitoring and maintenance committees. Through the capacity-building
interventions, the project increased the knowledge and skills of the members of the committees in
all aspects of project implementation and management, including project management and
procurement, procedures for managing local investment funds, participatory M&E procedures,
project M&E procedures, procedures and techniques of community procurement, and so on. A
total of 7,870 people benefited from the capacity-building intervention. Of this number 5,479
(69.6%) were de-concentrated and decentralized staff.

5.     Achievements under this component were measured in part by the percentage of supported
CRs that use some means to inform citizens on financial details (baseline 50%, target 87%, actual
100%). This indicator measured the CRs’ ability to demonstrate financial transparency. At the end
of the project, all 304 CRs (100%) used some means (publication of financial information, for
example) to inform citizens about commune financing.  According to the results of the survey
conducted by the INS, all CRs (100%) use various means to disseminate information on local
finances.

6.      Through the training in program planning, the CRs’ capacity in development planning was
significantly strengthened, as measured by the number of CRs who have a current (new or updated)
Local Development Plan (baseline 159, target 304, actual 304). The target was fully achieved. At
the end of the project, all 304 CRs (100%) had current and updated LDPs, which are subject to
annual reviews during the process of developing their AIPs. At baseline, only 159 CRs had current
and updated LDPs. The project initiated a review of planning guidance to further improve quality
and take into account all the strategic areas of socio-economic development at the local level.
Women’s participation was also enhanced in local planning and management; the percentage of
women on management committees of the CRs was estimated at 26% in the survey conducted by
the INS in 2014. Although the target was 30%, at baseline only 15% of management committees
had women members. Sub-prefecture and prefecture staff also participated in planning and
implementation of the local development activities. Their participation was measured as the
percent of local development plans in which the sub-prefecture and prefecture sector staff have
participated in the full project cycle (diagnosis, planning and implementation) (baseline-30%,
target 60%, actual 100%). At the end of the project, all (100) sub-prefectures and prefectures
participated in the planning of local development activities. The project entered into partnership
agreements with the 33 SPDs, and 100% of subprojects financed through the AIPs of CRs led to
the participation of prefecture and sub-prefecture staff in subproject planning and implementation.

7.     The attainment of policy-related and institutional results has been impressive: In
collaboration with the CNC, the DND reviewed the CCL, translated of different codes, established
the cadre de concertation and conducted various studies, including study tours for sustainable local
development financing mechanisms to inform decentralization reforms.
Component 3: Project Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation (Planned US$ 3.9 million
vs. Actual US$ 4.8 million)

8.     This component financed two main activities: (i) support to the CNC to enable it to carry
out project coordination activities and (ii) support the CNC to carry out M&E of project
interventions.
 

                                                35
9.      Support to the CNC to enable it to carry out project coordination activities. Achievement
of this activity was measured by project management performance—in other words, evidence of
effective implementation of the project’s fiduciary (procurement and financial management)
responsibilities. Key intermediate outcome performance indicators include: percentage of
financial audits that are unqualified (without reserve). The target of 100% was fully met. At the
end of the project, 100% of financial audits were unqualified. At the initial stages of project
implementation (before the midterm review), significant FM issues existed, including: (i) lack of
an internal auditor to ensure adequate internal controls were in place; (ii) long and complex
financial management procedures manual, which made it difficult for the CRs to comprehend the
steps in financial activities; (iii) the financial accounting software did not allow for automatic
consolidation of financial data; and (iv) lack of capacity of fiduciary staff at ERAs and local levels.
The issues were discussed at the midterm review and recommendations to improve FM
performance were advanced. The project team implemented the recommendations and enhanced
FM performance.

10.     Project management performance was also measured by the performance of procurement
activities. The key intermediate outcome performance indicator that measured project procurement
management performance was: percentage of procurement activities that are carried out
according to guidelines. The 100% target for this indicator was also fully met The improved
performance of the various procurement committees established in the CRs, coupled with regular
revision and updates (five times) of the project procurement plan (PPM) by CNC led to the
achievement of this indicator. In 2013 and 2014 the ERAs conducted  a review of reports on
procurement activities conducted by the procurement committees at CRs level. The results of the
review showed that procurement activities conformed to acceptable procedures and guidelines (by
98% and 100% in 2013 and 2014, respectively). A total of 716 procurement meetings were
conducted at the local level (358 for works and 358 for services, such as meeting to select
Consulting Engineers). This was reinforced by training of over 3,500 local actors in community
procurement procedures.

11.    Support the CNC to enable it carry out monitoring and evaluation of project interventions.
Monitoring and evaluation of project interventions was measured in two ways. The first was the
percentage of quarterly annual reports from regional teams submitted on time to the CNC
(baseline-50%, target 100%, actual 100%). At the end of the project, 100% of periodic technical
reports from the regional teams (ERAs) were submitted to CNC on time. This led to improved
database management, which increased from 90% in 2013 to 100% in 2014. The second
measurement of M&E performance was the percentage of prefectures that provide the required
monitoring data in a timely manner (baseline 0%, target 50%, actual 50%). At the end of the
project, 50% of prefectures provided the required monitoring data in a timely manner. Major
drivers of M&E performance was installation of an M&E system (management information
system) in all seven ERAs. The ERA staffs capacity in M&E was strengthened through training in
database management. At the prefecture and regional level all data collected from the CRs were
regularly consolidated. M&E performance was also enhanced by providing computers to the staff
of 33 SPDs and training them in their use. The participatory M&E system was installed in 21 pilot
CRs in three administrative regions. The system was supported by a manual that takes into account
institutional changes in the area of decentralization during the last two years of project
implementation.

      Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

 1.     No cost-benefit analysis was done at appraisal to calculate the projects ERR and NPV. The
 appraisal team’s analysis was largely qualitative and based on the argument that the project did
 not lend itself to standard quantitative economic analysis. Thus, the ICR team looked at other
 aspects of project implementation that contributed to efficiency.

 2.     One key aspect of the project examined by the ICR team to ascertain efficiency gains was
 the technical quality of the infrastructure constructed/rehabilitated by the project. As part of the
 project closure, a technical audit was conducted. The team used the audit report20 as the main
 source of information on the quality of infrastructure constructed/rehabilitated.

 3.      Methodology and sampling techniques. The methodology for the technical audit included:

             Desk review of project documents. The audit team reviewed a significant number of
              project documents, including the aide-memoire of the October 2012 midterm review,
              the report of the technical audit of PACV1 conducted in 2007, the CCL,
              decentralization and local development policy paper, and several others.
             Consultations with stakeholders at national and subnational levels. The team had
              intensive consultations with the project coordination unit (CNC) and the technical units
              of MATD involved in implementing PACV2, including the DND and DNDL. At the
              regional, prefectural, and local level, the team had discussions with the ERAs, SPDs,
              ADLs, the Ingenieur Conseil (IC), and the specialized technical services involved in
              the monitoring and supervision of subprojects. Led by the ERA, the team also visited
              a significant number of CRs and prefectures where implementation took place. The
              audit team was divided into two teams; and each was led by a consultant. For the
              fieldwork, the first team covered the administrative regions of Kankan, N'Zérékoré,
              Faranah, Mamou, and Labé, and the second team covered Boké and Kindia Regions.
              To maximize time and cover many more subprojects, three senior consultants were
              added to the team.
             Interview with local elected officers. A plenary interview was organized and attended
              by local elected officials, secretaries general, subprefects, members of local
              procurement committees, monitoring and maintenance committees, civil society
              organizations, and entrepreneurs and other citizens. The meeting focused on
              identification of subprojects, procurement, monitoring and supervision of works
              completed, and functionality and maintenance of the infrastructure built.
             Analysis of technical studies. The team carried out an analysis of technical studies to
              assess compliance with sector-specific policies and standards for different types of
              infrastructure (schools, health, water, administrative and cultural buildings, and so on).
             Quality control of works. The team also inspected the quality of works based on
              physical observations of the infrastructure as well as inspections of the work plans and
              other documents (PV construction, construction specifications, and others).

                                                            39
              Verification of safeguards policy compliance. The team investigated compliance with
               safeguard policies to ascertain whether any negative impacts on the environment had
               resulted from implementing subprojects.

 4.     Sampling technique. A total of 32 subprojects in 26 CRs were sampled. The criteria for
 the sampling included: (i) geographical distribution of subprojects and (ii) type of infrastructure
 to be audited (schools, health posts, youth centers, administrative buildings, drillings, crossings,
 and others). The CRs were chosen regardless of the success or failure of their subprojects. This
 approach made it possible to assess the involvement of stakeholders and beneficiaries, evaluate
 the extent to which the infrastructure was functional and used, and assess stakeholders’ and
 beneficiaries’ understanding and ownership of the local planning and development process. The
 sample covered 100% of the administrative regions (7 of 7), 58% of prefectures (19 of 33), 8.6%
 of the CRs (26 of 304), and 11.81% (32 of 271) of subprojects completed between 2011 and 2012.

 5.      Table A3.1 provides detailed on the infrastructure that was sampled and audited. As shown in the
 table, the 26 CRs in the sample are sufficiently representative of the CRs covered by the project,
 and were selected independently from the microprojects and their design and implementation
 processes.

 6.    Results. The technical audit showed that overall the infrastructure constructed and/or
 rehabilitated was of good quality (over 78.2% of the construction was satisfactory). This result
 was mainly due to an effective and transparent procurement system established in all CRs. The
 project helped establish 10-person procurement committees at the CR level. The capacity of the
                                                    40
 members was significantly strengthened through targeted procurement training, which translated
 into transparent procurement processes, including contract management. In addition to skills and
 knowledge acquired by the members, classification of procurement documents also improved in
 the offices of the CRs. In most CRs, bidding documents are organized well and properly filed. An
 examination of procurements of the CRs shows that cost estimates and quotations are all realistic
 and overall below planned expenditures in the AIP. In fact, there were net gains of GNF 126.7
 million in the cost of implementation of the subprojects as the total contract costs of works
 executed were below the planned expenditures indicated in the CRs’ AIPs.

    8.     The strong procurement capacity of the beneficiary CRs is also evident by the findings of
    the economic impact assessment survey conducted as part of project closure. In a sample of 120
    CRs, the study compared the level of competencies of the beneficiary CRs with other donors’
    projects in the sector (Table A3.3). The study showed that PACV2 CRs are more competent in
    carrying out procurement activities for the recruitment of a firm than those of other donors.
    Overall 67% of constructed and renovated schools underwent competitive bidding for the
    recruitment of a firm compared with 54% of projects implemented by other donors. Similarly, the
    construction of 70% of health posts was managed through competitive bidding to recruit a firm,
    compared with 50% for other donors.

    9.     Comparison of unit costs of PACV2 infrastructure with non-PACV2 infrastructure. In order
    to ascertain whether PACV2 interventions are cost-efficient, the ICR team analyzed unit costs of
    PACV2 social infrastructure (health and education) compared to with similar projects
    implemented by government ministries (MATD, MoH, and MoE). The team found that despite
    the difficult environment within which the project was implemented, unit costs of the project’s
    physical outputs (constructed/renovated schools, health posts, health centers) for which
    comparable data were available compared favorably with outputs of projects implemented by the
    government in the country. Under PACV, a fully equipped health center was completed at a unit
    cost of GNF 277,289,437, compared with GNF 365,000,000 for health centers constructed by
    MATD and  GNF 346,697,431 for health centers constructed by MoH. In addition, the unit cost
    of a fully equipped health post completed under PAVC2 amounted to GNF 277,289,437,
    compared with GNF 275,000,000 by MATD and 227,146,573 by MoH. Similarly, the unit cost of

                                                                     42
 a fully equipped primary school constructed under PACV2 amounted to GNF 328,788,612,
 compared with GNF 350,000,000 for MATD and GNF 450,000,000 for MoE. Table A3.4
 compares unit costs of PACV2 education and health infrastructure with those of other government
 ministries.

     Annex 5. Beneficiary/Impact Assessment Survey

1.     A key aspect of the project’s M&E design was an impact assessment survey to measure
the project’s impacts on beneficiaries and to track key performance indicators. To this end, two
impact assessment surveys/studies (Deuxième Enquête pour l’Evaluation des Indicateurs de
Résultats (ODP et intermédiaires) et des Indicateurs SYGRI du PACV2 and Economic Impact of
the Subprojects’ Infrastructure on Local Communities) were conducted at the end of the project.
These assessments show that the project contributed significantly to improving the well-being of
beneficiaries. The methodology and results of the assessments are summarized as follows:

Deuxieme Enquete pour l’Evaluation des Indicateurs de Résultats (ODP et intermédiaires) et
des indicateurs SYGRI du PACV2 (National Institute of Statistics)

2.      Methodology and sample size. The methodology was based on (i) data collection and (ii)
data entry and treatment; and (iii) data analysis. Data analysis focused on population characteristics
and indicators; beneficiaries’ capacity to plan and resolve problems; social inclusion of the
population, including the vulnerable population; discussions with local elected officials; and their
relationship with the local administrative institutions. A total of 120 randomly sampled CRs were
selected for the analysis. The sample size was compared with the 2009 baseline survey, which had
a sample of 160. The analysis covered seven administrative regions of the country. Table A5.1
shows the sample size.

3.       Results. The points that follow summarize the survey results.

            Average tax revenues increased consistently in CRs from 2011 to 2014. Average tax
             revenues in CRs increased from GNF 22.1 million in 2011 to GNF 23.2 million in
             2012, and then from GNF 30.4 million in 2013 to GNF36.2 million in 2014.
            Improved capacity of local administration management. The survey probed into the
             level of capacity of CRs in terms of: (i) availability of documents in the archives of
             CR; (ii) composition of the existing management structures; and (iii) general
             information. The results of the survey showed improved availability of documents in
             the archives of CR offices: 99.1% of LDPs and AIPs, 98.3 % of budget documents,
             97.4% of vouchers, and 97.4% of meeting registries were all available in the files. An
             analysis by administrative region showed that 100% of the CRs in Kankan and 99.4%
             in Labé Regions respectively archived documents. In addition, 91% of CRs in
             N’Zérékoré Region have their documents archived, and 84% of their procurement

                                                  46
               documents are archived. Also the CR has minutes for 88% of municipal council
               meetings and the Board's letter of invitation.
              Improved local planning. Local planning has significantly improved as indicated by the
               availability of reference documents used by the CRs.. According to the communal
               council, LDPs (28.9%) and AIPs (25.9%) are the main reference documents used by
               the CRs for local planning and development management.
              Improved transparency in the management of local funds. The survey shows that the
               local authorities are able to verify local administrative and financial account
               information; 97.7% of elected officials declared that the higher authorities are able to
               verify administrative accounts, and 91.2% said the higher authorities verify the CRs’
               financial status.
              Increased communal works on operation and maintenance of facilities. Data were
               gathered on whether citizens had been mobilized to renovate or maintain a school
               building, health post or health center, or road over the last two years. In the previous
               12 months, 35.2% of districts had mobilized citizens to work on health centers, 67.5%
               on public buildings, and 87.7% on roads.
              Increased accessibility to social services. The survey measured households’ access to
               basic social services as result of project interventions. Specifically, the survey
               measured the time needed for beneficiaries to access potable water, health, school, and
               other facilities. Overall, 72% of respondents indicated that it took less 15 minutes to
               get to a water point compared to 0.1% who mentioned that it took more than 2 hours.
               It took 40.9% of respondents less than 15 to reach a primary school, compared to 7.8%
               who needed more than 2 hours. In addition, 18.2 % of respondents stated that it took
               them less than 15 minutes to reach a health post compared to 24% who indicated that
               it took them more than 2 hours to reach a health post.

6.      Results. The main results are shown in the following series of tables and include:

           Contribution of infrastructure funded by PACV 2 to budget of the CRs. The CRs
            mobilized about GNF 2.8 billion as counterpart funding between 2011 and 2014. Table
            A5.3 summarizes CRs’ contributions to the implementation of subprojects and
            microprojects.
           Increased tax revenues and savings. The average tax revenues per annum are shown in
            Table A5.4. Average savings are shown in Table A5.5.
           Social infrastructure impacts. The impact of education infrastructure on tax revenues
            is shown in Table A5.6, and the impact of health infrastructure on tax revenues is shown
            in Table A5.7.
           Improved capacity to plan activities and resolve problems. As shown in Table A5.8,
            improvement in the planning capacity of the CRs is manifested by improvement of key
            budget, revenue, and social welfare indicators.
           Increased allocation to maintenance of infrastructure by sector is shown in Table A5.9.
           Gender impact. Women’s participation in development planning is encouraging, as
            shown in Table A5.10.
           Impact on employment. Significant employment has been created by the subproject
            implementation, as shown in Table A5.11.

Summary of achievements
 1.        Strengthening the CRs’ capacity and financial support to implement their AIPs
 have helped lay a solid foundation for responsible management and a concerted local
 development process. The infrastructure built under the project has had a significant
 impact on the well-being of the beneficiaries. Indeed, access to primary education, health
 care, and potable water have greatly improved thanks to the project’s interventions. In
 addition, the construction of market infrastructure led to an expansion of communities’
 tax base. Strengthening the capacity of the CRs resulted in the improement of
 administrative services. For example, an end-of-project survey carried out by INS
 indicated that overall, the CRs now have established and maintain archives, especially for
 LDPs (99.1%), AIPs (99.1%), the CR budget (98.3%), vouchers (97.4%), and registry
 meetings (97.4%). From the point of view of accountability, 98.7% of advisors were
 satisfied with relationships with district presidents in the implementation of decisions. The
 survey results showed that at least 7 out of 10 CRs issued information on
 administrative/financial accounts during the past 12 months.

2.       To ensure coverage of all CRs in Guinea, the project supported participatory local
planning initiated during the first phase in 145 new CRs. Thus, 351 AIPs were developed
following this process and co-financed by the resources of the LIF, which supported the
implementation of socio-economic infrastructure and capacity-building activities. The
capacity of decentralized services/units was also strengthened. Furthermore, available
data on mobilizing citizens for renovation or maintenance of district infrastructure over
the last 12 months showed that overall, 35.2% of districts mobilized their citizens for
renovation of health posts, 67.5% for public buildings, and 87. 7% for roads. The CRs’
average tax revenues also increased from GNF 22.1 million in 2011 to GNF 36.2 million
in 2014. The survey also showed that at least 85% of local authorities held from three to
five sessions/meetings during in 2013.
Achievements by component
 3.     A few months after the launch of the project, the technical and financial partners
 withdrew their support due to a military takeover in the wake of the Head of State’s death
 in December 2008. This situation had a significant impact on project implementation.
 Although some CNC staff were kept to stay in touch with stakeholders, activities could
 not be implemented as planned. Upon resumption of activities, the project started
 activities previously undertaken in difficult conditions.

4.     Component A: Local Investment Fund (LIF). This component was severely
affected by the suspension of the project. The suspension of project came at the time when
the project was supporting the CRs to update their LDPs and introduced the development
and financing of their AIP. Therefore, financing of the AIP only started after resumption
of activities in 2011.

5.    Financing of Annual Investment Program (AIP). Since the resumption of activities,
the project, through the LIF, financed 358 AIPs, through which 510 subprojects were

                                             51
 implemented under the management of the CRs. Total amount disbursed amounted to
 GNF 117,066,001,413 (US$ 16,723,000). Overall, all the 304 CRs benefited from
 financing of their AIPs with 100% coverage. Available data shows that 276 of the CRs
 benefited from financing of their AIPs. Through the implementation of the AIP, the CRs
 have been able to manage their own local development. To date, 75% of the CRs have
 executed their AIPs within a six-month period. Table A6.1 summarizes the number of
 AIPs and subprojects financed per year.

 6.     The education sector took the lion’s share of the subproject funds, accounting for
 42% of the total, followed by the health sector (23%), bridge crossings (10%), market
 infrastructure (8%), local government (6%), and village water points (3%). There is an
 increase in demand for market infrastructure from 3% in 2012 to 8% in 2014.

 7.      Mobilization of resource for financing of AIPS by the CRs. In accordance with
 agreement signed between the project and the CRs, the CRs contributed 10% (8% in kind
 and 2% in cash) of total allocation. Total amount mobilized by the CRs to finance the 358
 AIPs amounted to GNF 13.3 billion (US$ 1.9 million). The establishment of management
 of LIF procedures and huge involvement of citizens in the CRs’ budget decision making
 enabled transparency in the management of local resources. On average, 74% of citizens
 declared that their suggestions were taken into account by the local officials during
 meetings, according to INS survey. The CRs affected by commercial mining received
 additional resources dedicated mainly to local investment. Although this contribution is
 still being formalized through the elaboration of the mining code, it allowed those CRs to
 obtain additional resources for LIF as well as other community subprojects. Thanks to this
 contribution, the CRs have been able to finance about 20–60% of their investment budget.
 Furthermore, other CRs received external support through decentralized cooperation.
 Thus, the CRs in Kindia and Boffa Regions have received support from an NGO Guinea
 44 (Loire Atlantique) and Charentte Maritime Cooperation. Also, PAVC2 collaborated
 with other projects and programs in the same geographical areas to finance subprojects
 from the same AIP. In particular, the project signed partnership agreement with PDGL,
 PSE, and Plan Guinea. In areas such as Popodra (Labé) and Kobhe, citizens co-financed
 water project with PACV2 in the capital of the CRs.

 8.     These contributions combined with outreach and training efforts have led 46% of
 CRs to develop and implement their AIPs with multiple funding sources. Despite these
 results, stakeholders, including sectors and some mining companies, still continue to carry
 out community development outside of the investment framework developed by
 communities and recognized by law. The harmonization of the various interventions is
                                                    52
    still a major challenge to consolidate the process of decentralization and local
    development.
 
    9.     Functionality of the infrastructure developed. The functionality of infrastructure
    developed as part of the implementation of PACV2 gradually improved from 69% in 2011
    to 99% in the last quarter of 2014. The question of maintenance of community
    infrastructure and equipment is not yet resolved in a sustainable manner, even though,
    CRs have implemented certain initiatives which include budget allocation, the
    establishment of management committees and maintenance, and recruitment of contract
    staff. For its part, the state has regularly allocated operating grants to local authorities
    since 2011. This allocation, which is still not on the basis of an equalization system that
    takes into account real needs, has however been growing gradually from GNF 5 million
    in 2011 to about GNF 45 million.

    10. Access to basic social services. Access to basic social services has significantly
    improved the living standards of rural households. The survey indeed revealed that the
    population's access to basic social services has improved significantly compared to the
    project baseline data in 2009. For example, access to safe drinking water, primary school,
    and health center was 92.3%, 59%, and 28.7%, respectively. The survey respondents said
    they had less than half an hour walk to these basic facilities. The implementation of
    subprojects has also allowed access to new infrastructure such as youth centers, libraries,
    sports grounds, and shelters. Bridges and crossings built on rural roads have also improved
    the population’s mobility and exchanges. Finally, through advocacy and sensitization, the
    environmental dimensions of priority infrastructure have been considered in the
    implementation of the AIPs. Component A is rated satisfactory.

    11. Component B: Capacity Building for Decentralized Rural Development. This
    component covered all the 304 CRs in the country. Through the technical intermediaries
    such as the ADLs, services techniques, and ERAs, the project implemented several
    activities such as information, sensitization, training, advisory support on development
    and updating LDPs, and development and implementation of AIPs. The following sections
    list key achievements under this component.

    12.     Local planning process led by the CR. At the start of PACV2, a harmonized
    planning guide which would allow the communities to take into account all aspects of
    their local development needs was developed. The application of this guide showed
    deficiencies, especially with respect to certain crucial aspects of local development such
    as environmental management, local capacity building, development of market
    infrastructure, support groups, youth employment, promotion of female leadership, and
    so on. To address these issues, the project supported the National Directorate of Local
    Development to develop a new, second-generation local planning guide. This guide,
    promoted by key actors and widely distributed at the local and prefectural levels, became
    a reference tool for conducting a participatory planning process. It allowed the update of
    99 LDPs while broadening the consultation level of the beneficiaries (from the district to
    sector level). In this regard, according to the survey results, 30% of citizens interviewed
    said they had participated in the process, and 26% of which reported that their concerns

                                                53
have been taken into account during the planning process. To date, with the use of these
first- and second-generation planning guides, all 304 CRs have updated their LDPs. This
process has been fully supported by the SPD.

13. Capacity building of local decentralization actors. Since the start of the project, a
series of training sessions for key local actors of decentralization, aimed at building the
operational capacity of the communities, has been organized. Major areas of focus were:
(i) planning and management of local development; (ii) legislation relating to the CCL;
(iii) local governance; (iv) exercise of local contracting; (v) administrative, financial, and
accounting procedures; (vi) local taxation; (vii) participatory M&E; and (vii) participatory
budgeting and information technology (IT). In total, 7,870 persons, including 354 women
(elected officials, members of civil society, and technical, prefectural, regional, and
central personnel) have been trained.

14. Strengthening operational capacity building of local institutions and provide
technical support to local communities. In terms of operationalization of local structures
and accompanying technical services, the project, after renovating administrative
buildings for prefectures, equipped these structures and the technical services (SPD and
STD management, forestry officers, agricultural extension officers) with computers, solar
kits, and motorbikes. It also financed: (i) operational action plans for these services in
order to create better conditions for participation in the community development process;
(ii) establishment and operationalization of the framework for regional and prefectural
level; (iii) the development of a basic guide for public accounting for local authorities;
(iv) the review of the budget nomenclature for local authorities; (v) the development of
participatory budgeting manuals and participatory M&E; and (vi) the updating of the
administrative management, financial, accounting, and procurement manuals. At the end
of the project, all 304 CRs have new LDPs or updated LDPs, 98% of the education and
health infrastructure that was completed is staffed, subprefecture sector staff and
prefecture staff participated in the cycle (diagnosis, planning, and implementation) of all
subprojects (100%) financed by the project from the LDP, 89% of local management
structures (LIF management committee, subcommittee of the prefectural APEAE, health
and sanitation committee, transparency committee, the procurement commission, and
others) have at least one female member, and 26% of the members of the local
management structures are women.

15. Mobilization of local tax revenues. The percentage of CRs that have increased their
revenues by at least 10% increased from 47.2% between 2011 and 2012 to 55.1% between
2012 and 2013. This substantial increase in the level of tax revenues of rural municipalities
is mainly due to three (3) factors: the payment of royalties by mining companies;
improving the management of financial resources by allocating Community Tax
Collectors; and actual completion of infrastructure reassured taxpayers. Tax revenues
reduced by 46.1% between 2013 and 2014. This was mainly due to the reduction of
economic activities following the outbreak of the Ebola disease.

16. Support to decentralization and institutional reform process. The project has
supported policy and institutional reforms aimed at deepening decentralization. As the

                                             54
government’s primary tool is participatory and decentralized local development, PACV2
provided technical and financial support in the following areas: (i) the development and
validation of the Letter of National Policy on Decentralization and Local Development;
(ii) participation in efforts and concepts for the establishment of a sustainable mechanism
for financing local authorities; (iii ) the establishment and operationalization of cadres de
concertation at the regional and prefectural levels; (iv) revision of the budgetary
nomenclature of local communities; (v) the review of administrative management,
financial, and accounting manuals; (vi) the revision of the harmonized guide for local
planning; (vii) the revision of the CCL and development of implementing legislation; and
(viii) piloting a 2D approach (de-concentration - decentralization) in health and education
in the CU Kindia. This component is rated satisfactory.

17. Component C: Project Coordination, Management, and Monitoring and
Evaluation. The CNC coordinated activities and project management. Meetings of the
Technical Implementation Committee (CTE) were regularly held in order to inform the
various technical services partners to resolve implementation difficulties. Also, the annual
work program and budget and the annual activity reports were submitted to the Steering
Committee for review and approval. Overall, the project has made considerable progress
in the implementation and management of activities. The cumulative budget execution as
at December 31, 2014 is US$ 33,467,207, or 96.6%, of which 100% for IDA, 97.3% for
IFAD, and 94.4% for AFD.

18. Capacity building for stakeholders supporting the decentralization process in
partnership with other stakeholders (private and public), and the financing of AIPs and
operationalization of the M&E system were the key areas in which the project devoted
significant efforts to coordination. The project team consists of 69 people, divided
between the CNC (26), ERAs (36), and DND (7). This staff has a renewable contract of
one year. During PACV2, administration was marked by the recruitment of an internal
auditor.
19. Separation and implementation of disengagement strategy. In general, the different
strategies adopted by the project are essentially based on the progressive implementation
of effective measures of institutionalization or sustainability of the achievements of
decentralization, based on lessons learned from the procedures implemented by PACV
and support mechanisms for CRs. The project has gradually reduced its role in annual
support strategies, giving a greater role to the permanent institutions of the administration.
Thus, the number of ADLs recruited by the project decreased from 165 to 125 with more
than half placed at the prefectural level.

20.       Safeguards. To carry out the environmental and social management of the
project, funds were reserved by the project each year in the annual work program and
budget to mitigate any environmental impacts. Also, forms for environmental screening
of microprojects were made available to field workers to facilitate the identification of
these potential adverse impacts. These forms are integral parts of the AIPs. As part of the
ESMF developed in December 2006 became obsolete in view of institutional and
legislative changes, the framework was updated in an interdepartmental workshop and
disseminated widely to all stakeholders and development partners involved in the local

                                             55
development process. A total of 930 field staff were trained in the safeguard policy and
environmental safeguards. They have familiarized themselves with the new and simplified
form and Environmental and Social Management Plan. Land security measures have been
taken within the allocation domains with community infrastructure in the ground plan and
transfer certificate duly signed by the Mayors of the Communes. Also, generic
environmental and social clauses for microprojects infrastructure have been introduced in
various tender documents and monitored by the ERAs. These environmental clauses and
screening forms were introduced in the LIF implementation manual. Periodic reports on
the implementation of environmental safeguard policies were developed and regularly
shared with the World Bank and the Office of Guinean Study and Environmental
Assessment (Bureau Guinéen des Etudes et Évaluation Environnemental) of the Ministry
of the Environment.

21. Audit and procurement. The financial statements as at 31 December 2011, 2012
and 2013 have been audited and certified without qualification. The audit reports were
sent to donors by June 30 of each year. The different reports of internal control sometimes
noted some weaknesses in the management of rural communities’ finances, which were
gradually corrected. Since the beginning of the second phase of the project, procurement
activities at the local level have involved the selection of Consulting Engineers and offices
for technical studies and supervision of works on community infrastructure. A total of 716
procurement meetings were conducted at the local level in 358 markets, and 358 works in
intellectual services (selection of Consulting Engineers). Overall, remarkable progress has
been made in terms of CR compliance with procurement procedures. Over 3,500 local
actors were trained in community procurement procedures. To date 100% of procurement
activities comply with procurement procedures. Providers currently use legal means of
redress for violations of procedures. The PACV2 Procurement Plan was regularly updated
according to activities by component. The plan was revised five (5) times with the latest
on March 13, 2014. The status of PPM execution is as follows:

       Supplies. The 25 markets planned for construction at an estimated cost of US$
         2,145,660 have all been completed for an actual cost of US$ 1,509,180.
       Works. The two (2) contracts planned at an estimated cost of US$ 98,000 have
         been completed at an actual cost of US$ 89,013. 
       Consultants. Of 32 markets planned at an estimated cost of US$ 1,005,850, 25
         contracts were executed at a cost of US$ 802,270, and 7 were canceled for
         lack of resources.

22. Monitoring and evaluation. The M&E system implemented in the ERAs,
prefectures, and CRs was reinforced by the organization of regional workshops on the
project M&E manual. Data collection and consolidation tools were made available for all
actors involved in implementing the M&E system. A new database was installed in all
regional offices and their staff received training. A participatory M&E manual that takes
into account institutional changes related to decentralization during the last two years of
project implementation has also been developed. Workshops were conducted on the
participatory M&E procedures manual. The participatory M&E system has been installed
in 21 pilot CRs in three administrative regions. Looking ahead to the third phase of PACV,

                                            56
the M&E Unit has developed a questionnaire and conducted a field survey to establish a
typology of CRs to adapt services to the needs of the community and streamline
interventions.

23. Communication and visibility. During the first phase, PACV established a
communication strategy to promote better visibility of program results. Experience has
shown that many communication efforts were made, focusing mainly on the dissemination
of information and technical advice. In addition to consolidating decentralization
strategies and participation, the CRs were mandated to place special emphasis on
transferring competencies to the communities in accordance with the CCL. A new
communication strategy was developed in 2011 with the support of a consultant. During
the second phase, the communication component was mainly devoted to the
implementation of this new strategy, which involved the distribution of small items (key
rings, pens), calendars, and custom calendars available to stakeholders (politicians, civil
society, service technicians) and authorities involved in the implementation of
decentralization and local development policy. A documentary on the achievements of
PACV2 and two (2) television debates on the impact of PACV2 on the process of
decentralization in Guinea (émission Grands Dossiers) was also produced in 2013.

24. A national assessment workshop, preceded by regional review workshops and
summaries of local budget workshops in the region, was held in December 2014 in
Conakry under the aegis of the Government of Guinea and the Office of the Prime
Minister. This meeting between elected officials (77 mayors) and the highest
representatives of the administration provided the opportunity for the stakeholders to
evaluate the activities implemented. Finally, the project financed the production of a short
film about the program's philosophy and achievements.
Conclusion

25. PACV2 was one of the best projects implemented in Guinea as part of the
government’s decentralization and local development program. By empowering
communities, civil society, and local technical services the project has brought changes to
the design and execution of joint activities at the local level and thus contributed
significantly to the promotion of democracy and good governance in Guinea. The
implementation of PACV2 took place in a global context of consolidating the
achievements of the program and mobilizing sufficient resources from technical and
financial partners to address the needs of rural communities. Specifically, the activities
focused on the implementation of the project management strategy, which consists of: the
institutional organization and adaptation of the major tools for local authorities to different
provisions of the community code [CCL], including the coverage of all rural communities
in the country; support to the decentralized and participatory development in the CRs; the
definition and implementation of a system of effective M&E; and conservation and
preservation of natural resources and development of public-private partnership with other
stakeholders at the local level. Through grants, the program succeeded in introducing
autonomous and transparent management of the operations of the CRs. It also used a
participatory approach to stimulate the effective involvement of all social groups,

including young people and women, and the state's technical services in the local
development process. All these achievements contribute to local people’s ownership of
the decentralization process. More community empowerment is needed to improve
relations between administrators and the people to ensure success. It would be desirable
for all stakeholders in the program to undertake efforts to institutionalize this approach in
the third and final phase of PACV.

     Annex 7. Comments from Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

1.      The following are comments from government and development partners.

2.      Borrower. We have read the PACV2 ICR. We confirm that the report has evaluated
project implementation performance and we agree with the conclusions.

3.      Agence Française de Développement (AFD). AFD agrees with the content of the
report. Our commitment in the third phase shows the confidence we have in the PACV2
implementation team, which shows that local-level competencies could effectively be
improved and that funds transferred directly to the communities have had real impacts on
poverty reduction. The establishment of an institution in charge of local support and the
financing of the CRs is one of the challenges of the third phase for which we hope the
World Bank would collaborate with us and the government to ensure sustainability of
project outcomes during the final phase.

4.      International Fund for Agricultural development (IFAD). IFAD agrees with the
content of the report, which touches all the essential issues discussed during the ICR
mission. For IFAD, PACV2 is a successful project. However, the functionality of some
infrastructure must be strengthened. Also during the last supervision mission it was
proposed that agricultural areas developed under PACV2 be transferred to PNAAFA
(Projet d’Appui aux Filières Agricoles), which would continue to support the beneficiary
groups and communities in agricultural production in local areas. We expect a proposal for
an official meeting between PNAAFA and PACV.
