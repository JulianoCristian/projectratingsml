                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Following the Bank’s re-engagement in Guinea, the government requested a two-year extension of the closing date to make up for the implementation period lost under the

                         disbursement freeze and suspension. An extension of one year (from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013) was approved, pending the outcome of the October 2012 mid-term review.
                         The multi-donor mid-term review found the project to be making satisfactory implementation progress; however it will fall short of reaching its development objective without an
                         extension of the closing date. Additional financing from the ‘Agence Français de Développement’ (AFD) was confirmed during the mid-term review and will complete the financing
                         plan envisioned in the Project Appraisal Document. The additional financing, along with an extension of the closing date from June 30, 2013 to December 31, 2014, will significantly
                         increase the likelihood of attaining the phase 2 development objectives by allowing all ‘Communes Rurale’ in Guinea to prepare and complete a minimum of two annual investment
                         programs.
