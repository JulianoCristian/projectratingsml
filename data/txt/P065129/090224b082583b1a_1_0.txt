                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation progress has been steady. The project is now intervening in all 304 Communes Rurales (CR) of Guinea. 271 of these CR (89%) have benefitted from the Local
                         Investment Fund (71 in 2013) and a total of 401 micro-projects (89 in 2013) have been financed since the Bank re-engaged in Guinea in 2011. Of the 401 micro-projects already
                         financed, 44% are in the education sector (largely primary schools), 23 % in the health sector (largely health posts), 10% in transport sector (rural road repairs, small bridges and
                         dalots), 6% for market infrastructure and 4% in water and sanitation.
