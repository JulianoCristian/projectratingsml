Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Implementation progress has been steady and the project is expected to substantially achieve its development objectives by December 31, 2014. The
 project has succeeded in expanding its capacity building activities and access to the Local Investment Fund to all 304 Communes Rurales (CR) of
 Guinea – in 2014, the remaining 53 CR’s completed one cycle of Annual Investment Programing. A total of 78 Annual Investment Programs (96 micro
 projects) were financed in 2014 - 499 micro-projects have been financed since the Bank re-engaged in Guinea in 2011. Of the 499 micro-projects
 financed, 43% are in the education sector (largely primary schools), 23% in the health sector (largely health posts), 9% in transport sector (rural road
 repairs, small bridges and dalots), 8% for market infrastructure and 4% in water and sanitation. The closing date for the second phase IDA grant
 is December 31, 2014 ; the co-financing grant from the ‘Agence Française de Développement’ (AFD), which became effective in December 2013, will
 continue until June 30, 2015. In the meantime, AFD has already started the preparation of the third phase which was endorsed by their board on
 November 20, 2014. The third and final phase will consolidate the program's overall achievements in terms of support for decentralization reforms and
 local institutional capacity.

 Overall Comments
 The original PDO was “Local rural governments (CRDs) are enabled to fulfill their mandate by planning and implementing inclusive local
 development activities, and improving revenue performance to sustain recurrent costs”. In fact the majority of participating CRDs have filled their
 mandate. The sub-objectives are (i). inclusive local development planning; (ii) inclusive local development implementation of the projects; and
 (iii) improving revenue performance to sustain recurrent costs. The project has achieved it's main objective and the three sub-objectives to a large
 extent. Actually, all PDO level indicators have reached or surpassed their targets. Figures are summarized as follows: By end November this
 year, 2.3 million people have improved access to socio-economic services due to infrastructure constructed under the project compared to a
 number of 1.6 million a year ago; 29 % (target 27%) of citizens have taken part in local planning process; 49 % of CRs (target 50%) have
 increased their tax revenues by at least 10 %; 45 % (target 40%) has set up at least a single Annual Investment Program (AIP) that reflects
 multiple funding sources (sources in addition to PACV, PGCT or PGCMB project resources); 50% (target 50%) of CRs have implemented their
 Annual Investment Program (AIP) within the timeframe defined by the Project Implementation Manual (PIM).
