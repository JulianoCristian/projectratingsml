Some lessons learned included: the\n            involvement of decentralized institutions in planning and\n            implementing community activities does not necessarily mean\n            that a decentralization policy will be adopted in the\n            various sectors. Increasing the tax revenues available to\n            the CRs is not simply the result of establishing market\n            infrastructure or implementing income-generating activities;\n            it also depends on the development of civil society and good\n            governance at the local level. The regular transfer of\n            financial resources to communities is essential to improve\n            local competencies and ensure that local institutions are\n            sustainable. Participatory budgeting and M&E are key\n            project management tools that should be made available to\n            local stakeholders to effectively drive the local\n            development process. Ensuring inclusive local planning and\n            development with a focus on gender and the marginalized\n            groups will contribute to the full achievement of program goals."}, "docdt": "2015-06-29T01:59:01Z"}
