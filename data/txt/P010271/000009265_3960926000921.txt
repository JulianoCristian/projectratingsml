POWER IX: DISTRIBUTION EXPANSION AND REHAILITATION PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower             s Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.
Beneficiary          : Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).
Amount-              : SDR 43.2 million (US$52.0 million equivalent).
Terms                :  Standard.
Onlending Terms      3 The Government would relend the credit proceeds to
CEB at an interest rate of ten percent per annum,
repayable over 20 years, including five-year grace
period. The Covernment would bear the foreign
exchange risk.
Project Description : The principal objectives of the Project are to improve
the reliability and quality of power supply, to reduce
losses to economic levels, and expand the distribution
system to meet the forecast demand for electricity.
The Project consists of a four-year time slice of
CEB's distribution rehabilitation and expansion
program. The project would comprise the erection of
about 950 km of 33-kV lines, extension and rehabili-
tation of low voltage distribution networks in Colombo
city and elsewhere in Sri Lanka, and technical assist-
ance to CEB.
Risks:                  The Project is straightforward and no unusual risks
are foreseen. Delay in implementation is, however,
possible since the project is spread over a large
geographical area and has many interfaces with the
existing network. This risk would be minimized
through the provision of project management assistance
by cossultants. The packaging of the Project, which
uses supply and erect contracts and clearly identifies
contractual responsibility, would also minimize this
risk. Slippage could occur due to delays in appoint-
ing contractors and problems in acquiring right of
way. Any delays in the appointmerlt of contractors
would be minimized by engaging consultants prior to
credit effectiveness. Most of the distribution lines
would be constructed adjacent to public roadways and
Sri Lanka's existing laws give adequate powers to CEB
to acquire right of way. Thus the acquisition of
right of way is not expected to delay project imple-
mentation.

POWER IX: DISTRIBUTION EXPANSION AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. ENERCY SECTOR
A. Energy Resources
1.01    Sri Lanka  has few indigenous  energy resources.  There  are no known
hydrocarbon reserves, but a modest petroleum exploration program is uiderway.
The major  indigenous energy  resources are  hydropower  and  fuelwocd.   The
hydropower potential is estimated to be about 2,000 HW, with an energy poten-
tial, under average hydrological conditions, of about 5,800 GWh a year. The
major hydropower resources are concentrated in the southern half of the
country in basically five river systems: Mahaweli Ganga, Kelani Canga, Kalu
Gar.ga, Nihwala  Ganga  and  Walawa  Ganga.   The  centerpiece  of  hydropower
development has been the Accelerated Mahaweli Program (AMP), which will add
533 MW (Victoria 210 NW, Kotmale 201 MW, and Randenigala 122 MW) to Ceylon
Electricity Board's (CEB) installed capacity by 1988. The lack of detailed
knowledge of the remaining hydropower potential and the technically feasible
developments is one of the major constraints affecting hydropower development
in the country.  This issue will be addressed in a study of hydropower poten-
tial under financing by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany
through the  Gesellschaft fur  Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ).   Consultants
(Lahmeyer/Decon) were appointed in January 1986 and the study commenced on
April 1, 1986.
1.02    At present-fuelwood  is estimated to supply  about 55% of Sri Lanka's
gross energy supply. However, incremental wood production from the natural
regeneration of forests, agricultural residues and rubber replanting, etc.,
is estimated to be tess than half of the annual consumption of fuelwood
(about five million tons). The balance of wood supply has come mainly from
deforestation, and the island's natural forest cover has declined from about
7 million acres in 1960 to about 4 million acres in 1980. Deforestation will
increase the demand for commercial energy, with the substitution of petroleum
products for fuelwood.   This could result  in a substantial  increase in the
fuel import bill. The Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) is aware of these
issues and agrees with the Association that a key element in their resolution
would be a large and comprehensive reforestation program. A forestry Master
Plan is being prepared as part of the Bank-assisted Forestry I Project
(Credit 1317-CE). Reforestation programs, under which GOSL is planning to
treble both the acreage and density of tree planting, are being developed
within the context of ongoing United States Agency for International Develop-
ment (USAID) and Asian Development Bank (ADS) assisted fuetwood projects.
When completed, the USAID project aims at providing between 10% and 15% of
the country's fuelwood requirements. Efforts to improve the supply of fuel-
wood are being complemented by action on the demand side to encourage the use
of more fuel-efficient woodstoves. A new woodstove has been developed under
the auspices of the energy conservation task force (para 1.03), and GOSL is
promoting its use through a demonstration program and by providing incentives
to consumers to acquire the new woodstove.

B. Organization of the Energy Sector
1.03    Until late 1982, a major  institutionat constraint was the relatively
large number of ministries and line agencies involved in the different energy
subsectors, and  the lack  of  effective  coordination  between  them.   GOSL
initiated a major institutional reform in October 1982, when it created an
Energy Coordinating Team (ECT) in the Ministry of Power and Energy. The main
purpose-of ECT is coordination of the work of the relevant ministries and
line agencies and tne  prevention of duplication.  ECT  consists primarily of
three coordinating task forces, covering^energy planning, energy conservation
and renewable  energy, and, their support  staff.   In  September- 1985,  the
Secretary, Ministry of Power and Energy, was appointed to manage ECT. Energy
policy coordination was also strengthened in 1984 when the Ceylon Petroleum
Corporation was transferred from the Ministry of Industries to the Ministry
of Power and Energy, thus reducing the number of ministries involved in the
energy sector, and in 1983 when Lanka Electric Company (LECO) was created, to
gradually take over local authority distribution systems (paras 2.04 and
2.05). The organizational structure of the energy sector is shown in
Annex 1.1.
C. Energy Consumption
1.04    Per capita  consumption of  commercial energy  in Sri Lanka  is about
145 kgoe per annum, just over 50% of the average for the low-income
countries. Total per capita consumption of energy is about 240 kgoe per
annum, about 65% of which is supplied by non-commercial energy, principally
fuelwood, about  30% by  petroleum products  and 5%  by  hydropower.   Energy
consumption has been growing relatively slowly.   Between 1973 and 1983 total
energy consumption increased at the average annual rate of about 2.5%, com-
pared with 3.4% for commercial energy, and an annual growth rate of 5.2% for
real GDP. Thus the GDP energy elasticity was relatively low at only about
0.5 during the period 1973-1983. GOSL has projected an annual growth rate
for real GDP of 5% for the period 1986-1990. If the energy elasticity
remains at 0.5, then the total consumption of energy would inc-ease from
about 3.6 million toe in 1983 to about 4.3 million toe in 1990.
D. Energy Pricing
1.05    Until 1978, for  social and political reasons,  energy prices did not
reflect the economic costs of supply. Since then, however, petroleum product
prices have been generally set at or above border price levels. In July 1983
the price of kerosene was increased by about 27% to this level following the
elimination of the general subsidy on kerosene. The purchasing power of
low-income households was protected by the simultaneous increase in the value
of kerosene stamps, which are provided to about half of the population. In
early 1986 petroleum product prices were substantially above border price
levels. GOSL did not reduce retail prices following the fall in interna-
tional prices but used the opportunity to mobilize resources to reduce the
budget deficit. CEB's electricity tariffs have been raised several times in
recent years, most recently in March 1985. During the period 1978-1985,
average revenue per kWh, including the fuel adjustment charge (para 4.08),
increased at the average annual rate of about 46%, representing an average
annual increase in real terms of 26%. The increases in tariff rates were



-3-
accompanied by significent changes  in the tariff structure.   Thus, the 1978
tariff revision included provision for a £zel adjustment charge, and the 1980
tariff replaced the declining block tariff for domestic consumers by an
increasing block tariff, including -a lifeline rate to enable low income
consumers to afford the electricity required to meet their basic needs. In
1980, CEB agreed under the Sixth Power Project (Credit 1048-CE) to carry out
a tariff study based on long-run marginal cost (LRMC), to implement any
agreed recommendations, and to update the study periodically. A study was
undertaken in 1981 and a revised tariff was introduced in June 1982. The
study was updated in 1984 and revised tariffs were introduced in March 1985
(Annex 4.5). The 1985 tariff structure includes separate energy and demand
charges for hotel, industrial and general purpose consumers with contract
demands  exceeding- 40 kVA, -and  optional  time  of  day  energy  rates  for
industrial and hotel consumers. The average revenue per kWh, which is set to
meet CEB's financial objectives (para 4.01), is  estimated to be about 80X of
LRMC.
E. The Bank Group's Involvement in the Energy Sector
1.06    To date the  Bank Group has  supported the development  of the energy
sector through eight operations in the power subsector, involving five loans
and three  credits.  The  amount of  the Bar:  Group funds  committed through
these operations totals US$166.7 million, representing about 17? of total
Bank Group resources committed to Sri Lanka up to December 31, 1985. The
Bank Group's involvement with Sri Lanka's power subsector began in 1954 when
a loan of US$19.1 million (Loan 101-CE) was made to GOSL to help finance a
25 KW expansion of the Aberdeen-Laksapana hydroelectric scheme. Since then,
the Bank Group has continued to be actively involved in providing the resour-
ces needed for the development of the subsector, in terms of both its
capacity to  meet demand  at least  cost and  institutional reforms.   Of the
eight projects, six have been completed satisfactorily and two (Sixth Power
Project, Credit 1048-CE, and Seventh Power Project, Credit 1210-CE) are still
underway. These two projects have proceeded slowly because of a number of
difficulties, including civil unrest and the limited capability of CEB's
management to cope with the ever growing workload associated with the
increasing size  and complexity  of  the  power  system.   This  problem  was
apparent before the Sixth Power Project was approved in 1980. Consequently,
the Association financed consultants' studies of CEB's management and
organization under the Sixth Power Project (Credi- 1048-CE). The consultants
recommended a new organizational structure to make CEB more responsive to the
requirements of  a  greatLy  expanded  system.   Their  recommendations  were
accepted and CEB is implementing the suggested reorganization, which involves
its decentralization (para 2.02).   Although much still  remains to  be done,
particularly in staffing (para 2.07), the Bank Group agrees that the new
organization provides an adequate operational framework and addresses some
key management deficiencies.
F. GOSL's Strategy in the Energy Sector
1.07    GOSL's energy strategy includes measures that address both the demand
and supply of energy. On the demand side, GOSL has been promoting energy
conservation and the reduction of waste, and has been encouraging the effi-
cient use and allocation of energy resources by relating energy prices to
their economic costs of supply. On the supply side, particular emphasis has



-4-
been placed  on substituting  imported  petroleu-  products  with  indigen0us
resources, principally hydropower.   Other majoz objectives  being pursued by
the government in the energy sector include: (a) improving the quality and
reliability of electricity supply and efficiency in the operation of the
power system; and (b) improving efficiency of use and increasing the
availability of renewable resources to meet the growing demand for energy in
rural areas.  In  line with the  priority given to  energy development, about
13% of the public investment program for 1985-89 is allocated to projects in
the power subsector.
G.  The Bank Group's Strategy in the Power Subsector-
1.08    The objectives of the Bank  Group's assistance in the power subsector
have been determined in the course of a continuing dialogue with GOSL on icS
strategy for the development of the energy sector. Assistance both has been
and is aimed  at supporting  efforts to:   (a) meet  the forecast  demand for
electricity at least cost through the development of an appropriate mix of
generating plants and the development of efficient transmission and distribu-
tion systems; (b) assist in institution building and strengthen the financial
management of CEB through the provision of consulting services (para 4.02)
and training for CEB staff; (c) rationalize the consumption of energy through
the reform of tariff structures and setting tariff rates based on the costs
to Sri Lanka of meeting consumers' demands for electricity (para 1.05); and
(d) increase resource mobilization in the power subsector by setting
appropriate financial objectives for CEB and controlling accounts receivable
(paras 4.10  and 4.11).   Although progress  has been  made in  all of  these
areas, further improvements are necessary. In particular, additional efforts
are  needed  to:    (i) reduce  losses  in   transmission  and  distribution;
(ii) reinforce and extend transmission systems to supply new consumers and
improve the quality of supply; and (iii) further strengthen the management
and staffing of CEB by improving the conditions of service and through train-
ing. These issues are addressed by the Project.
II. THE BORROWER
Organization of CEB
2.01    CEB, the beneficiary,  is a statutory corporation  established by the
CEO Act, No. 17 of 1969 (1969 CEB Act). It is responsible for the generation
and transmission of electricity throughout Sri Lanka, and for distribution
except in those areas where distribution systems are operated by licensees
(local authorities) and, since 1984, Lanka Electric Company (Private)
Limited (LECO). CEB's management consists of a seven-member Board, the
members of which are appointed by the Minister of Power and Energy and may be
removed at any time, serve a three to five-year term and may be reappointed.
The Chairman is appointed from among the Board members. While the Chairman
is responsible through the Board for policy matters and close liaison with
the  government,   the  General   Manager (GM)  is   CEB's  Chief   Executive
Officer (CEO). He is responsible for the overall direction and control of
CEB's day-to-day business.   The GM is  appointed, on the  basis of seniority
and merit, from-CEB's staff. In recent years there has been a rapid turnover
of persons holding this position (there were three GMs in the period



-5-
1982-84), and this led to discontinuity and an increase in the Chairman's
involvement in CE8's day-to-day business. However, the situation improved
with the appointment of the present GM in 1984, who is playing an active role
as the CEO.
2.02    CEB's original organizational structure was designed by Urwick Inter-
national Ltd. (United Kingdom), management consultants, in the early 1970s
under Loan 636-CE. In 1981, CER again retained the services of these con-
sultants under the Sixth Power Project (Credit 1048-CE) to: re-examine its
organizational structure, since the existing structure was considered to be
inappropriate for the enlarged size and responsibilities of CEB; redesign
CEB's accounting organization and systems; and implement a modern system for
inventory  control   and  management   (para 4.02).   Urwick   recommended  a
decentralized organization consisting of (i) seven departments at CEB's
Headquarters; (ii) two operating regions with several divisions under them;
and (iii) a Generation Group responsible for three complexes and a system
control center. In September 1982, CEB's Board agreed to restructure CEB in
accordance with the consultants' recommendations, and implementation began in
January 1984 (CEB's organization chart is shown in Annex 2.1). Under the new
organization the regions are responsible for the extension and reinforcement
of distribution systems. Construction units are being established in the
regions to  allow them  to undertake  this work.   However, CEB  is to  cease
undertaking major construction work using its own directly employed labor.
Contracts for large projects will be let to outside contractors under the
supervision of CEB's Headquarters.
2.03    Implementation of the new organization has proceeded at a slower pace
than expected, and consequently many of the new management systems are
operating only partially. In an effort to expedite implementation, CEB
requested the consultants to prepare detailed procedures for the new
organization, provide systems training to selected staff, and prepare manuals
for systems operations  for all CEB's  activities.  The  consultants produced
drafts for twenty-six operating and four  functional manuals for CEB approval
and eventual distribution. The finalization of these manuals has proceeded
slowly and some of  the manuals are still  in the draft stage.   Thus some of
the major benefits anticipated from the reorganization exercise have not
materialized, and CEB  is still operating  many systems under  the old proce-
dures. In recognition of this problem, CEB extended its contract with Urwick
International Ltd. (pare 2.02) to assist in monitoring the implementation of
the new procedures. Subsequently, CEB agreed to hire local consultants to,
in effect, monitor the stage of implementation of the new procedures.
Monitoring is now underway under the supervision of Urwick International Ltd.
in association  with M/S Macan  Markar, a  local firm  of accountants.   Full
implementation of the new organizational structure and the finalization of
the associated operating manuals is considered to be an important step in
strengthening CEB, and is required to enable it to manage operations and
investments efficiently,  including the  Project.   Therefore,  in  order  to
ensure that CEB's organizational structure does not hinder its development as
a modern utility, the completion by CEB of the restructuring of its
orgnization as approved by its Board of Directors in September 1982 and
completion and distribution of all related operational and functional
manuals, would be conditions of effectiveness of the Credit (para 6.05(a)).

2.04    The new  organization is concerned  with improving the  efficiency of
CEB given its present functions. The perennial problems of local authorities
with regard to their electricity distribution functions require longer term
policy  decisions  by  GOSL  to   rationalize  the  electricity  distribution
industry. Under the existing organization of the power subsector, CEB is
directly responsible for about 80% of total sales at the distribution level,
with licensees (local authorities) being responsible for the other 20%. Until
early 1985 there were 218 licensees, but that number is -gradually being
reduced as Lanka Electric Company (LECO), which GOSL formed in September 1983
in an effort to  address the deterioration in  the quality of  service at the
distribution level, takes over the distribution systems operated by licen-
sees. LEGO was established under the Companies Act. Its shates are held by
CEO, the Urban Development Authority (UDA), and local authorities (non-voting
shares only).  One reason  for the establishment of  LECO under the Companies
Act was to ensure that  it would not be subject  to government regulations on
conditions of service for  its employees.  LECO,  has so far  taken over five
licensees and has identified another 15 to be taken over in the near future.
GOSL's policy for the reorganization of electricity distribution is supported
by both the Bank  Group and the ADB.   The latter is  supporting LECO through
its Secondary Towns Distribution Project.
2.05    A major defect  with the current arrangements  to reorganize the stub-
sector is that LECO, in taking over licensees, does not achieve a viable
consumer mix; in particular it has a preponderance of domestic consumers and
insufficient high-voltage consumers. In addition, the long-term takeover of
all licensees by LECO would lead to a fragmented area of operations due to
the geographic separation  of many licensees.   The solution to  this problem
may involve LECO taking  over both licensees  and consumers served  by CEB in
areas contiguous to those now served, or to be served in the future, by LECO.
In recognition of the issues posed by licensees, LECO commissioned the
development of a Master Plan (the draft of which was completed in mid-1986 by
consultants funded by ADB) which will suggest a framework for its future
development and determine the investment required to rehabilitate the dis-
tribution systems of licensees. This Master Plan should be complemented by a
similar plan for the distribution systems operated by CEB, and the two plans
integrated to provide an overall plan to rationalize electricity distribution
in Sri Lanka. The resources required to rehabilitate licensees' distribution
systems, in order to facilitate their takeover by either CEB or LECO, could
be the subject  of future Bank  Group operations  (para 2.14).   During nego-
tiations, CEB agreed to prepare and submit to the Association for review by
July 31, 1988, a master  plan for the development  of distribution systems in
Sri Lanka; and GOSL agreed to initiate  by October 31, 1988, alpro1rn satin-
factory to the Association to  rationalize the institutional arrangemento for
the distribution of electricity in Sri Lanka (paras 6.01 and 6.03(a)).
CEB Management and Staffing
2.06    In  January 1986,  CEB had  about 12,500  employees and  served about
390,000 consumers, representing a consumer/employee ratio of about 3211.
Although it is Low, this ratio represents a considerable improvement over the
1975 ratio  of 13:1.   CEB has  been suffering  from  a  number  of  manpower
problems, which mean that it is simultaneously oversteEfed in some depart-
ments and deficient in key personnel in many important functional grebe*
CEB's manpower policy is to limit the recruitment of new otaff and to improve



-7-
staff productivity through appropriate training  at its proposed new training
school (para 2.08).  In  order to develop  a medium term  strategy to address
its manpower problems, during negotiations, CRB agreed to prepare and submit
to the Association by March 31, 1987, planned staffing levels and numbers for
the period 1987-1989 (para 6.03(b)).
2.07    In  recent years  CEB has -had considerable- difficulty in  retaining
experienced engineers and accountants, and this has caused a shortage of key
personnel. At the end of 1985 it had only about 300 qualified engineers; of
whom less  than 101  had-more  than five  years experience  with  CEB.   Many
engineers had left to take higher paid posts in the private sector or over-
seas. The exodus of staff has been increased by a promotion system which
emphasizes seniority rather than merit. In 1984, CER engaged management
consultants Urwick International Ltd. (United. Kingdom) to study its staffing
jroblem.  Urwick's  main  proposal  concerned  the  removal  of  the  govern-
ment-imposed ceiling on remuneration and the introduction of a new salary
etructure with increases of 200% at the highest levels. Government regula-
tions on conditions of service generally limit total monthly remuneration to
RG 5,200 plus a cost of living allowance of Rs 500. These regulations apply
throughout the public sector and thus the remuneration issue is a public
nector issue.   However, CEB  does have  some room  for maneuver  through the
payment of risk and productivity allowances and bonuses up to the equivalent
o-f one month's salary a year. Keeping in view both CEB's long-term manpower
requirements and the government-imposed ceiling on remuneration, CEB, during
negotiations, agreed to submit to the Association by June 30, 1987, and put
ii,ia effect not later  than December 31, 1987,  a scheme of  incentives and a
prormfition,policy based on merit and other appropriate factors (para 6.03(c)).

-8-
2.10    CEB has a  shortage of staff trained  in modern methods  for the con-
struction and maintenance of its distribution systems. This is partly due to
its inadequate training facilities. The Project contains a training element
to address this issue (paras 3.03 and 3.08).
Existing Facilities
2.11    tn  December 1985  CEB's  total  installed  generating  capacity  was
949 MW, comprising 679 MW hydroelectric plant (including 210 MW at Victoria
and 134 MW at Kotmale, the first stations commissioned under the Accelerated
Mahaweli Program), and 270 MW thermal plant (including 120 MM gas turbines
and 80 MW of diesel capacity--Annex 2.2). Total installed capacity increased
at the average annual rate of about 101 in the period 1975-85 (it was 361 KW
in 1975). During this period the hydro thermal plant mix changed from 81:19
to 72:28. The major generating stations and load centers are interconnected
by  a   132-kV  transmission   grid  (805 km),   consisting  of   double  and
single-circuit lines.   There are  also 286 km  of 66-kV  transmission  lines
which are to  be replaced largely  by 132-kV connections.   Under the Seventh
(Mahaweli Transmission) Power Project (Credit 1210-CE), 220-kV lines are
being constructed with planned completion by mid-1986 to meet larger trans-
mission capacities required to transmit the increasing Mahaweli hydropower
capacity to the  Colombo area.   The transmission  network is,  generally, in
good condition.
2.12    The subtransmission system  comprises about 7,800 km  of 33-kY lines,
about 2,500 km  of 11-kV  lines and  about 5,000  consumer substations.   The
physical condition of the distribution networks is generally unsatisfactory,
partly because many of the networks are overloaded as a result of the large
increase in the number of consumers in recent years and partly as a result of
poor maintenance (para 2.13). CEB's management consultants, Urwick Interna-
tional Ltd. (United Kingdom), recommended, and CEB accepted, that each Area
should prepare and maintain plant and equipment registers, and prepare
quarterly maintenance plans. However, in a number of Areas the implementa-
tion of such maintenance plans has been hindered by shortages of skilled
linesmen and other staff.   The Project would upgrade  the physical condition
of the distribution networks and provide training for linesmen.
Maintenance of Facilities
2.13    The high level of  losses and poor performance  of some of generating
facilities is attributable in part to inadequate maintenance because of a
shortage of technical personnel. The shortage of personnel for the main-
tenance of distribution systems will be addressed through the Project by
training CEB staff in modern techniques for the construction and maintenance
of distribution systems (para 3.08). Tools and equipment to upgrade the
present distribution facilities would also be procured under the Project
(para 3.03). This needs to be complemented by the implementation of a dated
program for the planned maintenance of its thermal and hydropower generating
facilities and upgrading plant maintenance systems. During negotiations, CEB
agreed to submit to the Association by November 30, 1986, the maintenance
program for its generating facilities for 1987(para 6.03(d)}. The implemen-
tation of  this program  will be  monitored during  supervisions.   CEB  also
agreed to employ consultants with adequate experience in the operation of



-9-
similar plant to review by December 31, 1987, the plant maintenance system at
the Sapugaskanda diesel power station and thereafter implement the improve-
ments recommended by the consultants according to a schedule acceptable to
the Association (para 6.03(e)). CEB would thereafter review the maintenance
systems at the other thermal generating stations based on the experience
gained at the diesel power station.
System Losses
2.14    Losses, as a  percentage of gross generation,  on CEB's supply system
increased from 10.5% in 1975 to a peak of 19.6% in 1981 and then declined to
about 17.1% in 1985 (Annex 2.3). Most of the losses (about seven percentage
points) occur in the 33-kV subtransmission system. Non-technical losses are
low in CEB's system, being only about one percentage point. The problem of
losses has been studied by the UNDP/World Bank Energy -Sector Management
Assistance Program (ESMAP), I/ and in 1983 CEB established a Loss Reduction
Cell (LRC) to  address the  problem. 2/   According to  both that  report and
analysis undertaken by LRC, the principal cause  of the high losses is under-
investment in medium and low voltage distribution lines, resulting in over-
loading and poor voltage conditions, and low power factors. The ESNAP report
identified a number of measures to reduce technical lossea. These have been
included in the Project. Losses are also high in the distribution systems
oper4ted by  local  authorities  (licensees).   In  1985  these  losses  were
estimated to be about 25Z of CEB's bulk supply to licensees. The problem of
losses in licensees' distribution systems is being addressed by the ADB
through its FY84 Secondary Towns Distribution Project and a planned operation
in FY87. However, due to the large number of licensees (over 200) the reduc-
tion of losses in their distribution systems in a timely manner may require
Bank Group support through a future operation.
2.15    Although dated loss  reduction programs have not  been formulated, it
is anticipated that the implementation of the measures included in the
Project would reduce system losses from about 18% of gross generation in 1986
to about 12% in 1994.
Planned Generation
2.16    Generation planning for CEB's interconnected system is carried out by
its Generation and Transmission Planning Department using the computer based
WASP-III optimization model. CBS has an annual generation expansion planning
cycle; this begins with the preparation of the load forecast by the Commer-
cial branch in July and is followed in August/September by the preparation of
the least  cost generation  expansion plan  using  WASP-III.   This  plan  is
integrated with the transmission and distribution expansion plans, and the

Branch (DDRB).



-10-
resultant aggregated plan is used by the Finance Department for the prepara-
tion of CEB's annual financiat plan.   Details of the latest (September 1985)
least cost generation expansion plan and forecast energy and capacity balan-
ces are given in Annexes 2.5 and 2.6, and the phasing of expenditure in
Annex 4.6. The expansion plan has been reviewed by IDA and found to be
satisfactory. At negotiations, CEB and GOSL agreed to annually update and
review with the Association the long-term development plan of the Board
(para 4.16).
2.17    CEB's total  installed capacity is  projected to increase  from about
950 MW in 1985 to about 1250 MW in 1990 and about 1700 MW in 1995. Effective
capacity is projected to increase from about 728 MW in 1985 to about 1151 MW.
in 1990 and about 1476 MW in 1995. Hydropower projects under construction or
firmly  planned  comprise:   extensions  at   Canyon  (1x30 MW)  and  Kotmale
(1x67 MW) to be commissioned in 1987 and 1988 respectively, the commissioning
of the  Randenigala project  (122 MW) in  1987, to  be followed  by  Rantambe
(49 MW) in 1990, Samanalawewa (120 MW) in 1991 and Broadlands (20 MW) in 1992
(Annex 2.5). Thermal projects comprise: rehabilitation of the Kelanitissa
oil-fired plant (50 MW) in 1989, and construction of the Trincomalee
coal-fired station, with the first unit (150 MW) being commissioned in 1993.
With the exception of the Trincomalee and Broadlands projects, financing has
been secured or is being negotiated for all of these projects and they should
be commissioned  as planned.   Annex 2.6 shows  that the  completion of  this
program as planned would enable CEB to meet its load forecast at its planned
quality of service.
Transmission
2.18    Transmission  plaUahl.ag is  the  responsibility  of  the  Transmission
Planning branch in the Generation and Transmission Planning Department.
Planned major transmission works include lines to connect the projected
generating facilities at Rantambe, Samanalawewa and Trincomalee with the load
centers. The former lines are expected to be 220-kV, while the major lines
from Trincomalee are expected to be 400-kV. CEB also plans to extend and
reinforce the 132-kV transmission system, and replace overloaded power trans-
formers with larger ones at 132-kV substations.
Distribution
2.19     The  planning  of  subtransmission  and  distribution  projects  has
recently been strengthened by the establishment of the Distribution Develop-
ment and Rehabilitation Branch (DDRB) of the Transmission and Generation
Project Department.   The  development  of  the  subtransmission/distribution
systems has not kept pace with the rapidly increasing demand; consequently
losses are excessively high, voltage drop often exceeds the original design
levels, and the number  of outages has increased.   The Project would address
these issues.



-11-
III. THE PROJECT
Project Setting
3.01    Electricity sales increased at the average annual rate of 7.8% during
the period 1977-1985. Although this increase was matched by adequate expan-
sion of CEB's generation and main transmission facilities, there was insuffi-
cient investment in subtransmission and distribution facilities. Conse-
quently, system development was not balanced, leading to increased system
losses which, in 1985, were estimated at about 17% of gross generation. It
was, in part, in the context of these losses that priority was accorded in
GOSL's strategy (para 1.07) to improving the quality and reliability of
electricity supply  and the  operating efficiency  of the  power system.   In
keeping with that objective, GOSL and CEB initiated a study in 1983
(para 2.14) to identify the measures to reduce losses to economically accept-
able levels. Following completion of the study, and in accordance with its
recommendations, CEB established a group to formulate and implement a plan to
reduce system losses. The group prepared a plan for the period 1985-1995 to
rehabilitate, reinforce and expand CEB's distribution system which is coor-
dinated with planned expansion of generation capacity. The Project is a
four-year time slice (mid 1987-mid 1990) of that plan and is based on a
project document 1/ prepared by CEB which identified an investment program
for mid 1987-mid 1990 that would maximize the economic benefits to be derived
from improving CEB's distribution system.
Project Objectives
3.02     The  principal  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to:  improve  the
reliability and quality of power supply; reduce technical losses; extend and
reinforce the distribution system; and improve CEB's capability to construct
and maintain its distribution system. In addition, the Project would assist
CEB in developing a more appropriate balance between generation, transmission
and distribution facilities in order to meet the forecast demand at least
cost.
Project Description
3.03    The Project would consist of the following components:
(a) construction of about 250 km of double circuit and about 550 km of
single circuit 33-kV main distribution lines;
(b) construction of about 150 km of single circuit 33-kY lines, about 50
km of single circuit 11-kV lines, and about 50 33-kV switching sta-
tions; installation of about 50 MVAR of capacitors; and strengthening
and upgrading of about 500 km of 1l-kV lines;

(c)  installation of about 1,200 33-kV/LV and about 300 11-kV/LV distribu-
tion transformer  stations and  transformers, and  the conversion  of
about 200 km of LV lines to three phr e;
(d) construction of two 33-kV/11-kY and 125 11-kV/LV substations, the
installation of about 15 km of 33-kV, 120 km of 11-kV and 125 km of
low-voltage cables for the underground network in the city of
Colombo; 
(e) line-materials, vehicles, tools and instruments, to rehabilitate the
low-voltage network; and
(f) consulting services for detailed engineering, project management,
project accounting, training CEB staff in modern methods for the
construction  and  maintenance  of   the  distribution  systems,  and
preparation of a distribution master plan.
A detailed description of the Project is presented in Annex 3.1, and the
geographic area which it would cover is shown in Maps IBRD 19433R and 19434R.
Project Cost
3.04    The estimated total cost of the Project, including price and physical
contingencies, duties and taxes, is US$108.1 million based on mid-1986
prices. It comprises US$65.0 million in foreign exchange, US$16.0 million in
taxes and duties, and US$27.1 million in local costs. Physical contingencies
of 10% are assumed for equipment, materials and services on the basis of
previous experience with similar projects in the Region. Price contingencies
for foreign costs are assumed at 7.0% for FY86 and FY87, 7.5% for FY88, 7.7%
for FY89, 7.6% for FY90, and 4.5% thereafter. Price contingencies for local
costs are assumed at 10% for FY86 and FY87, 9% for FY88, 8% for FY89, 7.6%
fcr FY90, and 4.5% thereafter. Total price contingencies amount to 18X of
base costs including physical contingencies. A summary cost estimate is
presented in Table 3.1 and detailed estimates are given in Annex 3.2.

Project Financing
3.05    The financing  requirements are  US$43.1 million  in local  costs and
US$65 million in foreign exchange. Local costs would be financed by CEB from
internal sources (para 4.15). The foreign exchange cost of the Project would
be covered by the Association financing of US$52.0 million and cofinancing of
about US$13.0 million by the Overseas Development Administration (ODA), UK.
ODA has appraised the rehabilitation of the Colombo City network part of the
Project and expects to present the project to its project comm'ttee by
October 31, 1986, and to obtain Ministerial approval shortly thereafter.
During negotiations, CEB presented a financing plan for the Project accept-
able to the Association. Table 3.2 summarizes the financing plan.

CEB would bear  any cost overruns  and GOSL would  bear the  foreign exchange
risk in accordance with the provision of the 1969 CEB Act. In order to
ensure that the Project is adequately financed in a timely manner, fulfill-
ment of all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the ODA Grant is a
condition of Credit effectiveness (para 6.05(b)).

Onlending terms
3.06    During negotiations, GOSL agreed to reLend the proceeds of the Credit
to CEB under a subsidiary Loan agreement to be entered into between GOSL and
CEB under  terms and  conditions acceptable  to IDA.   The term  of onlending
would be 20 years (including five years of grace) and at an annual interest
rate of 10X.   The conclusion of  the Subsidiary Loan  Agreement between GOSL
and CEB, under terms and conditions acceptable to the Association, would be a
-condition of Credit effectiveness (para 6.05(c)).
Project Engineering and Consulting Services
3.07    The Project has four components:  (a) the expansion and reinforcement
of the main 33-kY system and rehabilitation of the Colombo City distribution
system; (b) ratior.alization and rehabilitation of CEB's MV and LV distribu-
tion systems; (c) development and introduction of updated design standards
and construction guidelines for the distribution system; and (d) introduction
of improved work methods and planning techniques for construction and main-
tenance of the distribution system, and training of CEB's staff in the use of
these methods and techniques. Implementation of these four components would
be a major undertaking for CEB as it exceeds in-house design, construction
and management  capabilities for  distribution projects.   Consequently,  CEB
would require considerable external assistance in project implementation and
in the training and transfer of technology required to enable CEB to maintain
and develop the distribution system in the future. CEB would, therefore,
engage three separate organizations to provide consultancy services to assist
in project implementation. The bidding documents for component (a) should be
ready by October 1986 to adhere to the project implementation schedule. In
accordance with this schedule, in February 1986 CEB appointed Ewbank Preece,
UK,  who   are  presently   engaged   under   the   Seventh   Power   Project
(Credit 1210-CE), to prepare these bidding documents and to provide engineer-
ing services for component (a). IDA concurs with the appointment of Ewbank
Preece. The consulting services required for this purpose woulld amount to
about 30 manmonths, and their cost would be financed from the Credit. CEB
has also agreed to appoint consultants, satisfactory to IDA, to prepare
bidding documents for equipment and services required for components (b) and
(c), and provide project management services for all four components. This
would require about 170 man months of consulting services, which would be
financed from the Credit. The appointment of consultants for preparation of
bidding documents, design standards, construction guidelines, and project
management would be a condition of Credit effectiveness (para 6.05(d)). CEB
has also agreed to engage a utility (parg 3.08) to assist in the implementa-
tion of component (d).
Project Implementation
3.08    CEB has limited  experience in coordinating an  extensive program for
the construction  and rehabilitation  of distribution  networks.   It  would,
therefore, be assisted by consultants in project management for all four
project components (para 3.07).   Project implementation within  CEB would be
supervised by DDRB under the Additional General Manager (Projects). DDRB
would supervise the work of the consultants, provide counterpart staff to be
trained in the design and management of distribution projects and coordinate
project implementatioh within  CEB.  DDRB, which  is at  present inadequately



-15-
staffed, is being strengthened in order to undertake these functions effec-
tively. CEB has provided to IDA a satisfactory schedule for the addition of
qualified staff to DDRB. In order to expedite project implementation and
facilitate work coordination, supply and erect contracts -would be used,
except for  the rehabilitation  of  the  LV  network.   CE8  would  implement
rehabilitation work under force account, since it is highly dispersed and
involves close coordination with the operation of the existing distribution
system. However, the planning, work methods and equipment presently used by
CEB for construction and maintenance of the distribution system are inade-
quate, and must be-improved to increase staff efficiency and productivity.
In recognition of this situation, CEB has agreed to engage an operating power
utility, as consultants, to assist in the introduction of improved work
methods, equipment and planning techniques for the construction and main-
tenance of the distribution system and to train CEB's force account staff in
their use. The appointment of consultants to assist CEB in the introduction
of improved work  methods and  planning techniques  for the  construction and
maintenance of the distribution system would be a condition of effectiveness
for the Credit (para 6.05(e)).
3.09    The project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 3.3.  Construc-
tion of the Project would be completed by June 30, 1991. The Project invol-
ves a large number of activities which would proceed concurrently. A major
portion of line construction would be through supply and erect contracts,
which are expected to be won by contractors with adequate resources and
experience of similar work. The proposed schedule is, therefore, considered
to be realistic.
Procurement
3.10    The procurement  of the various  components of  the Project- would be
arranged as shown in Table 3.3. Procurement of equipment and works for the
main 33-kV lines, MV network rationalization and rehabilitation of Colombo
City network would be grouped in several supply and erect contracts, and the
other equipment and materials would be procured through supply contracts.
All equipment and materials financed by IDA would be subject to ICB. As a
result, about 70% of the cost of works, goods and services fur the Project
would be procured under ICB. Documents for individual contracts exceeding
US$200,000 would be subject to IDA's prior review and will apply to about 90%
the estimated cost  of IDA-financed elements.   Local suppliers  and manufac-
turers competing for the supply of goods under ICB would have a preference of
15% or  the applicable  customs duty,  whichever is  less.   Consultants  for
project engineering, project management and training would be selected and
employed in accordance with the Bank guidelines. Advance procurement and
retroactive financing to cover expenditures in respect of consulting services
incurred after January 1, 1986, and prior to Credit signing would be financed
retroactively up to an amount of US$1.0 million equivalent. The planned
schedule for procurement of the equipment and material to be financed from
the Credit is: (a) first bid invitation - November 1986; (b) first bid open-
ing - February 1987; and (c) first award decision - June 1987.

N.A. - Force account.
Disbursements
3.11    Disbursements from the  Credit would be made  against 100% of foreign
expenditure or 100% of ex-factory price, if manufactured in Sri Lanka, of the
cost of equipment, and materials and erection services procured under ICB,
and 100% of the cost of consultancy. The estimated disbursements from the
Credit are shown in Annex 3.4. In order to facilitate disbursements, a
Special Project account would be established in a commercial bank in accord-
ance with terms and  conditions satisfactory to IDA.   The initial deposit in
the Special Account would be US$5.00 million, representing the estimated
average expenditures for a four-month period for the items financed by the
Credit. The proposed closing date for the Credit would be June 30, 1992 to
allow for  payment of  retention monies.   The disbursement  profile for  the
Project is that for a four-year program to expand the rehabilitate CEB's
distribution system. The Bank's standard disbursement profile for transmis-
sion and distribution projects is not applicable to the Project, for two
reasons:   firstly,  the  standard   disbursement  profile  is  predominantly



-17-
weighted by projects involving the construction of extra high voltage trans-
mission lines rather than the expansion and rehabilitation of distribution
systems; and, secondly, the Project would be implemented through a number of
contracts proceeding in parallel.
Project Monitoring
3.12    CEB  would submit  quarterly progress  reports covering  the work  of
consultants, physical progress,  project cost, disbursements  and administra-
tive aspects of the Project. In addition, it would also submit annual finan-
cial and administrative reports and other pertinent information to IDA. CEB
would also undertake not later than six months after the closing date, or
such later date as may be agreed for this purpose, to prepare and furnish to
IDA a Project Completion Report of such scope and in such detail as IDA shall
reasonably request, on  the execution and  initial operation of  the Project,
its costs and the benefits derived from it, the performance of CEB and the
accomplishment of the objectives of the Credit.
Ecological Effects
3.13    Most  of the  distribution lines  included in  the Project  would  be
constructed adjacent to public roadways and would be similar in visual impact
to existing lines. The ecological impact of distribution lines is regulated
by Sri Lanka's existing laws, namely, Section 15 of the Electricity Act, The
Flora and  Fauna Act,  and the  Forestry Ordinance.   These  laws  adequately
regulate any adverse ecological impact which could be associated with the
construction of the Project.
Risk
3.14    The Project  is straightforward  and no  unusual risks  are foreseen.
Delay in implementation is, however, possible since the project is spread
over a large geographical area and has many interfaces with the existing
network. This risk would be minimized through the provision of project
management assistance  by consultants.   The packaging  of the  Project which
uses supply and erect contracts, and clearly identifies contractual respon-
sibility, would also minimize this risk.   Slippage could occur due to delays
in appointing contractors and problems in acquiring right of way. Any delays
in the appointment of contractors would be minimized by engaging consultants
prior to Credit effectiveness  (paras 3.07 and 3.08).   Most of the distribu-
tion lines would be constructed adjacent to public roadways and Sri Lanka's
existing laws give adequate powers to CEB to acquire right of way. Thus the
acquisition of right of way is not expected to delay project implementation.
IV. FINANCES
Introduction
4.01    The financial  activities of CEB  are regulated by  the provisions of
the CEB Act of 1969 and the Finance Act of 1971. The CeBs Act requires the
Board to operate along commercial lines and ensure that revenues generated
from sales of electricity cover operating costs, including depreciation, debt



-1I8-
service, and an adequate percentage of the cost of the development program.
The Finance Act outlines procedures for the performance of audits and sets
the  ceiling  on  the: remuneration  of  employees  in   the  public  sector
(paras 2.07, 4.02, 4.04). In 1973 following the approval of the Fifth Power
Project (Credit 372-CE), CEB's statutory obligations were amended to allow
depreciation to be based on revalued assets.   In 1980, under the Sixth Power
Project (Credit 1048-CE), an 8% rate of return  on revalued assets was set as
a financial objective for CEB.
Accounting Systems and Organization
4.02    In -1981, CEB engaged management  consultants from the United Kingdom,
Urwick International, under the Sixth Power Project <Credit 1048-CE) to set a
framework for modern accounting systems and procedures to provide the basis
for better financial  reporting and  control (para 2.02).   ImpLementation of
the new systems  and procedures, based  on the  consultants' recommendations,
siarted in  January 1984.   Substantial progress  has been  made since  then:
accounting  activities,  with  the  exception   of  revenue  accounting,  was
decentralized, billing automated, steps initiated to automate other areas of
accounting and financial reporting, and an internal audit unit established
(para 4.03). These changes have resulted in streamlined financial reporting
procedures and improved CEB's control over its finances by providing manage-
ment with detailed and timely information for financial planning and control;
however, despite these developments, their benefits have not been fully
captured by CEB because of its inability to recruit and retain qualified
accountants due to the low salaries paid by CEB relative to the ceiling on
remuneration set under the Finance Act of 1971 (para 2.07).
Audit Arrangements
4.03    Urwick International recommended (para 4.02)  the establishment of an
internal audit unit in CEB to improve control over its finances. The unit
was established in 1984. Its manager, the Chief Internal Auditor, reports
directly to the Board of Directors. At that time, however, the unit was
inadequately staffed and, as a result, its activities were limited to revenue
audit. In 1985, CEB initiated steps to expand the unit's responsibilities
and strengthen its staff to enhance financial control. These initiatives are
expected to provide CEB with a more effective management tool.
4.04    As  with other  public corporations,  the  external  audit  of  CEB's
accounts is carried out by the Auditor General (AG) of Sri Lanka, under the
Finance Act No. 38 of 1971 (para 4.01). The AG is an autonomous agency that
reports to the  House of Representatives.   As agreed  under the  Sixth Power
(Credit 1048-CE) and Seventh Power (Credit 1210-CE) Projects, CEB has com-
plied with the Bank Group Covenant for Audit by submitting its unaudited and
audited accounts  to the  Bank Group.   Although the  quality of  audits  was
satisfactory, there were often delays in the submission of CEB's accounts,
primarily because of the inordinate time required for the finalization of
accounts by CEB. The delays were caused by the complex reporting procedures
in the utility. In 1984, the Board restructured its organization and stream-
lined its  reporting procedures  to improve  management and  control.   As  a
result, delays in the finalization of accounts were shortened significantly.
The audit report for 1984 was two months late, mainly because of the time it
took to set the new procedures in place. The submission of audits in the



-19-
future is expected to be timely because of CEB's efforts; for instance, CEB
has finalized and submitted to the Bank Group its unaudited 1985 accounts
within the  covenanted  four-month  period.   However,  in  order  to  ensure
accountability for resources used by the utility and compliance with the
Finance Act of 1971 which the Association supports, the audit covenant agreed
under the Sixth Power Project (Credit 1048-CE) is repeated under the Project.
CEB alreed during negotiations to submit to the Association its unaudited
accounts within four months from the end of the year under consideration, and
audited accounts accompanied by the Auditor's Report within ten months
(Para 6.03(f)).
Fixed-Asset Accounting and Depreciation
4.05    CEB's fixed  asset registers do  not accurately reflect  the value of
its plant and equipment.   The value of some  assets are understated relative
to their replacement cost because they are recorded in historical costs,
while the value of other assets are overstated since unproductive assets have
not been  written off.   Furthermore, depreciation  schedules  are  based  on
average rather than economic lives of assets. The management and operation
of a modern power utility requires accurate knowledge of the assets employed,
which also provide the basis for setting financial performance criteria for
the utility. In recognition of this, CEB engaged in 1985 under the Sixth
Power Project (Credit 1048-CE), Davidson & Associates (UK) as consultants to
undertake a  fixed asset  accounting study.   The study  covers the  physical
verification of CEB's assets, their classification into generation, transmis-
sion, etc., and the establishment of suitable depreciation schedules. The
study would be completed by December 31, 1986. In order to ensure that:
(i) the recommendations of the study are consistent with acceptable utility
practices; and  (ii) are implemented,   CEB agreed  during  negotiations  to:
review the results and recommendations of the Fixed Asset Accounting Study
with the Association by March 31, 1987; and implement the agreed recommenda-
tions by not later than July , 1987. (para 6.03(g)).
Insurance Arrangements
4.06    CEB bears  its own insurance  risks and for  this purpose  has estab-
lished an insurance reserve. CEB makes an annual contribution of 1/10 of 1l
of its revalued gross fixed assets, which is appropriated from net profit, to
the reserve. On December 31, 1984, the reserve had an accumulated balance of
about Rs 78 million.   However, this  reserve has  been used  in the  past to
partly finance CEB's development program.   If this practice continues, funds
earmarked for replacement of damaged plant and equipment could be depleted.
In order to ensure that the funds accumulated are only used for replacement
of damaged plant and equipment, the transfer of the balance in the insurance
reserve accumulated  as of  December 31, 1985,  to an  escrow account  with a
financial intermediary that could be utilized only in the event of damage to
CEB's assets  is a  condition of  Credit effectiveness  (para 6.05(f).   CEB
agreed, during  negotiations, that  beginning fiscal  year 1986,  annual con-
tributions to the insurance reserve would be deposited into the escrow
account on the last day of the fiscal year (para 6.03(h)).

Past Financia.l Performance
4.07    CEB's income statements, sources and applications of funds statements
and balance sheets are given in Annexes 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, respectively, for
the years 1980-1985.   The Board's  operations for  the years  1980-1985 were
characterized by increase in gross generation (481), increase in state (474)0
and substantial increases in average revenue per kWh (1262) due to tariff
increases of 1102, 421 and 632 in 1980, 1982 and 1985 respectively and
increase in  revenues collected  through the  fuel adjustment  charge.  CEl'a

considerable efforts to meet that target, its accounts receivable have per-
sistently exceeded the  agreed level.   Measured in  terms of  the equivalent
number of months billings, receivables increased from 4.1 at December 31,
1981 to 7.0 at June 30, 1983 and then declined to 6.3 at September 30, 1984
and 5.4 at December 31, 1985. The three categories of consumers which were
responsible for  most of  the accounts  receivables as  of December 31,  1985
were: local authorities (40% of total accounts receivable and 11.6 months'
billings); private consumers (37% of total accounts receivable and 4.1
months' billings); and Government departments (9% of total accounts receiv-
able and 7.9 months' billing).   In 1985 CEB initiated  a number of measures,
including the implementation of a strict time schedule for billing and col-
lection of revenue  from high tension  consumers and faster  disconnection of
defaulting private consumers, to reduce accounts receivable. In addition, in
September 1985 GOSL assumed responsibility for the payment of arrears and
future accounts for street lighting; the accounts receivable for which had
exceeded 48 months in mid-1985 but have now been settled.
4.11     The  persistent  high  level   of  accounts  receivable  from  local
authorities has been addressed at the highest level of government, but
without significant success until early 1986. The high accounts receivable
are largely the result of their poor financial position, which is also
manifested in the poor quality of electricity supply in their service areas
because of underinvestment in their distribution systems. In some instances
local authorities utilize the monies collected from electricity sales for
non-power current expenditures, and in other cases, the principal problem
concerns inadequate collection from consumers as a result of billing disputes
and consumer protests.   The fastest way  for the accounts  receivables to be
reduced to a satisfactory level would be for the Government to assume respon-
sibility for their payment. However, this solution would not address the
root causes of the problem, which are related to the inefficiency of many
local authorities in carrying out the function of electricity distribution
and their poor quality of electricity supply. The long-term solution to this
problem requires the reorganization of the power subsector with regard to the
distribution of electricity and upgrading the distribution systems which are
now operated by local authorities (para 2.05).   GOSL initiated this with the
creation  of  LECO  (para 2.04)  which  is   to  gradually  take  over  local
authorities' distribution  systems and  rehabilitate them.   The  Bank  Group
supports this institutional reform which addresses the root causes of the
accounts receivable from local authorities.   However, pending this long term
solution to the accounts receivable problem, as an interim measure in Decem-
ber 1985, GOSL and CEB submitted to the Association a dated and monitorable
action program to reduce the Board's accounts receivable to three months'
billing by September 1, 1987. During negotiations, CEB informed the Associa-
tion that the action program has been substantially implemented, and that
overall accounts receivable were 3.6 months' billing in May 1986. In order
to ensure that the accounts receivable would be reduced to covenanted levels
by September 1, 1987, COSL  and CEB, during negotiations;  areed to the fol-
lowing   monitoring   targets   for   the   critical   consumer   categories:
i) reduction in receivables from local authorities to six months' billings
as a condition of Board presentation of the Project, five months' billings as
a condition of Credit effectiveness, and three months' billings by Septem-
ber 1, 1987; and (ii) from government departments and agencies (other than
corporations) to  three months'  billings by  September 1,  1987.   CEB  also



-23-
eed that beginning September 1, 1987,  total accounts receivable would not
exceed three months' billings (paras 6.02(a), 6.04 and 6.05(g)).
Present Financial Position
4.12    CER's balance sheets  reflect fixed assets revalued  as per agreement
with the Association under the Fifth Power Project (Credit 372-CE). A sum-
mary of the methodology, including the indices used for the revaluation of
fixed assets, is given in the project file, and the proforma revaluation of
fixed assets for the years 1986 to 1995 based on forecast inflation indices
is given in Annex 4.7.  CEB's balance sheet  for 1985, the accounts for which
are being audited, is presented in Annex 4.3 and summarized in Table 4.2:

4.13    Government equity contribution, primarily in  the form of transfer of
Mahaweli assets (para 4.09) to CEB, increased from 141 of total equity as of
December 31, 1980 to 32% as of December 31, 1985 and was a major reason for
the Board's strong capitalization position with a debt/equity ratio of 18/82.
In addition to the strong capitalization position, the coverage of debt
service by gross funds generated internally was satisfactory at 3.1.
However, CEB's current ratio, the ratio of current assets to current
liabilities, is  high at  4.3  because:   the  high  accounts  receivable  of



-24-
Rs 1,169 million, equivalent to 23% of current assets (paras 4.10 and 4.11)
and the high level cash-on-hand of Rs 2444 million or 49Z of current assets.
CEB recognizes that a large working capital requirement represents idle funds
that do not contribute to improving its performance. Consequently# under the
Project, CEB has prepared and implemented a dated and monitorable action
program to reduce and maintain the level of accounts receivable to three
months' billings (para 4.11).   CEBS has also  initiated steps to  utilize the
cash-on-hand to finance part of the capital investment program (para 4.15).
Investment Program and Finan6ing-Plan
4.14    CEB's  investment program  for the  period 1986-95  is  presented  in
Annex 4.5 and summarized in Table 4.3:

Expenditures to increase  generation capacity  would account  for 65Z  of the
planned investment, about 14%  for extension and reinforcement  of the trans-
mission system, and about 16X for distribution.  The remaining 5% would cover
the cost of the new training center (para 2.09) and other miscellaneous
capital expenditures. -The Association concurs with the size and mix of CEB's
investment plans. Traditionally, investment in development of the transmis-
sion system account for about 20Z of the overall investment; however, in view
of the fact that over the past few years considerable investments have been
made in transmission facilities, including those under the Sixth and Seventh
Power Projects (Credits 1048-CE and 1210-CE), the proposed investment in
transmission development is considered satisfactory in order to evacuate
power to the load centers. As for distribution, the planned investments are
for the extension and reinforcement of CEB's distribution systems and thus do
not include the investments being made by LECO and local authorities. Never-
theless, planned investment in distribution is considered to be satisfactory
pending the preparation of the Master Plan for the optimal development of the
distribution systems (para 2.05).
4.15    Based  on the  above  investment  progrAm,  a  forecast  sources  and
applications of funds statement for the period 1986-1995 is shown in
Annex 4.2. The financing plan reflects the tariff increases required to
enable it to meet the entire local cost requirement of Rs 40,788 million
(US$1,488 million) over the 10-year period from funds generated internally.
This is an objective set by CEB and agreed to by GOSL. The objective allows
CEB to take all necessary actions, including tariff increases, to ensure that
all local costs for the development program are met from internal sources.

During this  period, the  requirement for  funds would  be Rs 49,496  million
(US$1,807 million), consisting of Rs 46,980 million (US$1,715 million) for
capital investment and Rs 2,516 million (US$92 million) for increase in
working capital. CEB's capital investment includes an investment of Rs 4,500
million (US$164 million) for Mahaweli facilities, although the actual invest-
ment is being undertaken directly by GOSL (para 4.09). Of the total sources
of funds, net internal cash generated from operations would contribute
Rs 17,178 million (US$627 million) while equity contributions by GOSL would
be Rs 5,904 million (US$215 million). GOSL's equity contributions would
consist of Rs 4,500 million (US$164 million) in the form of transfer of
Mahaweli (Randenigala) assets and Rs 1,404 million (US$51 million) as a
financial contribution to the utility to implement Rural Electrification
Project (para 4.17). Consumer contributions would amount to Rs 2,396 million
(US$87 million). About 40X of the requirements would be met from internal
sources (para 4.18) and about 121 from equity. Borrowings would finance the
balance 48Z, or Rs 24,018  million (US$876 million).   Including the proposed
IDA financing of Rs 1,425 million (US$52 million) , about Rs 6,185 million
(US$225 million), or 26% of the required borrowings have been secured.
Another Rs 8,312 million (US$303 million), or about 35% is likely to be
financed by the Bank Group and ADB for the proposed Trincomalee. Thermal

Project and related transmission development, leaving a financing gap of
Re 9,521 million (US$348 million) representing 39t of the total financing
requirement. The financing gap would occur in the later years, particularly
1989 and after, and GOSL and CEB are actively seeking to secure finances to
bridge the  gap.  In  view of  CEB's and  GOSL's recent  success in  securing
suppliers' credit and bilateral financing, the AMP being a case in point, it
is expected that the resource gap would be closed in a timely manner to
ensure that the utility' s development program is implemented. In order to
ensure that Development Plan to be implemented is least cost and is ade-
quately financed, CEB agreed during negotiations: (i) to annually review by
December 31 of each year beginning with 1987, its long-term Power Development
Plan with GOSL and the Association; and Uii) to take all necessary actions to
implement the plan resulting from such review (paras 6.03(i) and 6.03(j)).
Future Financial Performance
4.17    CEB's forecast income  statements, sources and  applications of funds
statements  and  balance  sheets   for  the  period  1986-95   are  shown  in
Annexes 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, respectively. In order to make CEB an autonomous,
financially viable entity and to reduce its dependence on the national budget
for capital investment, GOSL has agreed to CEB's self-imposed objective that
the utility could take all necessary actions, including tariff increases, to
meet the entire local costs of its investment program from internal sources
during the forecast period, with the exception of local costs of the ADB
financed Rural  Electrification Project.   This financial  objective of  CEB,
which is supported by the Bank Group, would direct CEB's financial activities
during the  forecast period.   The forecasts  through  1991  reflect  average
annual tariff increases of about 10% in nominal terms, and assuming a
projected average annual rate of inflation of 7% for the period, the average
annual tariff increase would amount to about 3% in real terms. A summary of
forecast operating results for the period 1986-91 is shown in Table 4.5:

-27-
losses from 18X of gross generation in 1986 to 15% in 1991.  Forecast operat-
ing expenses  are based  on normal  hydrological conditions  and  on  planned
system expansion.   CEB's asset  base will  increase rapidly  beginning 1986,
because of the transfer of assets constructed under AMP (para 4.16) and its
own investment  program (para 4.14).   COSL concurs  with CEB's  self-imposed
objective of meeting all local costs of the development program from internal
sources (para 4.15); however, in order to ensure that future changes to this
objective do not result in the erosion of CEB's financial viability, the
covenant governing the financial performance of the Board (para 4.01) would
be repeated under the  Project.  Therefore, GOSL and  CEB agreed during nego-
tiations to take all necessary actions, including tariff increases, to
achieve a minimum annual rate of return of 8% on the current value of average
net fixed assets in use (para 6.02(b)).
4.18    The transfer of the Randenigala assets  to CEB is expected to be made
in 1986, the first year of the financial forecast. In keeping with the
existing practice of such transfers (para 4.09), these assets would be trans-
ferred as equity, and their full cost (Rs 4,500 million) would be included in
CEB's investment program for 1986. Despite the relatively large investment
program in 1986, CEB would achieve a self-financing ratio of 30% for the
year, primarily because of the full impact of tariff increases effected in
March 1983.   The self-financing  ratio would  remain at  satisfactory levels
thereafter, as a result of the tariff increases required to enable CEB to
achieve the 8% rate of return on revalued assets (para 4.17). In the years
1987 to 1991, the ratio would annually average about 38%.
4.19     Forecast  balance  sheets  (Annex  4.3)  show  that  CEB's  revalued
(proforma) gross fixed assets are expected to increase from Rs 27,276 million
in 1985 to Rs 85,485 million in 1991. About 39% of the increase would be
financed from CEB's internal sources, about 10% from equity, and 51X from
borrowings. As a result, equity is expected to increase by about 160%, from
Rs 21,775 million in  1985 to Rs 57,496  million in 1991.   Long-term debt is
projected to increase by about 440Z from Rs 4,909 million to Rs 26,586 mil-
lion, resulting in a deterioration of the debt/equity ratio from 18/82 in
1985 to 32/68 in 1991, which is wholly satisfactory for a power utility of
CEB's size  and functions.   Both the  ratio of  current  assets  to  current
liabilities and the debt service coverage ratio would continue to be satis-
factory. However, because of the projected large increases in debt, CEB's
debt servicing position should  be monitored carefully.   Therefore, in order
to ensure that CEBts debt service coverage by gross internal cash generation
is satisfactory, CEB agreed during negotiations to consult the Association
before incurring new  debt which would  cause its gross  internal cash gener-
ation to fall below 1.5 times the debt service requirement (para 6.03(k)).
Invome Taxes
4.20    In April 1981,  the basis for the  calculation of annual depreciation
allowances to determine tax liability was changed. This allows CEB to claim
an annual depreciation allowance over an eight-year period of 12.5% on newly
commissioned assets, as compared to the previous allowance of 100% in the
first year, and to carry fo ward any tax losses to subsequent years. Conse-
quently, despite the proposed transfer of Randenigala (Mahaweli) assets in
1986, CEB would be liable for the payment of the income tax in that year.
The assets projected to be commissioned in 1987 are the transmission lines



-28-
being financed under Credits 1048-CE and 1210-CE, and some distribution/rural
electrification assets. The additions to the asset base in this year, there-
fore, would be relatively small, thus making CEB liable for income tax.
Thereafter, through 1995, because of its relatively large investment program
and additions to asset base, the Board would not be Liable for income tax.
V.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Electricity Demand Forecast
5.01    Total electricity sales increased at  the average annual rate of 6.0%
in the period 1973-78, and 8.4% in the period 1918-85 (Annex 2.3). A sig-
nificant change occurred in  the percentage shares of -sales accounted for by
CEB's major  consumer groups  in the  latter period.   Annex 2.3 shows  that,
comparing 1985 with 1975, there was an increase in the relative importance of
sales to residential consumers and a decrease in the shares of sales to
industrial consumers. The increase in sales during the period 1978-85 was
driven by the increase in the number of new connections. The total number of
consumers served by CEB increased at the average annual rate of about 16.0% a
year in 1978-85, representing a doubling of the number of consumers in less
than five years.
5.02    The load forecast  for the period  1985-95 is given  in Table 5.1 and
Annex 2.6. Total energy sales are forecast to increase at 10.2% a year,
while energy generated is forecast to increase by only 9.5% a year.

The sales forecast allows for the effect on sales of the anticipated improve-
ment in the reliability and quality of electricity supply associated with the
Project. The Bank's general experience with loss reduction projects where



-29-
technical losses  are relatively  high is  that the  reduction in  losses  is
accompanied by substantial increases in electricity sales. The load forecast
also reflects the projected continuing high rate of connections, which
averaged about 39,100 a year in the period 1981-85 and is projected to be
about 41,200 a year in the period 1984-88. Significant changes are forecast
to occur in the relative shares of sales to the major consumer groups served
by CEB. The major change concerns an increase from about 17Z to 24X of total
sales going to residential consumers and a decrease from about 41% to 28X for
industrial consumers.
B. Least Cost Alternative
5.03    CEB prepared the Project to  reinforce and extend its subtransmission
and distribution systems to meet the forecast demand for electricity at least
cost. The assumptions used, methodology and results for each component of
the Project  have been  reviewed and  found to  be satisfactory  to IDA  (see
project file, Annex 6.1).
C. Economic Internal Rate of Return
5.04    Although  the Project  is expected  to play  a crucial  role  in  the
optimal development and  operation of  CEB's supply  system, its  benefits to
consumers cannot be separated from those of other least cost generation,
transmission and distribution development programs. In these circumstances,
having established that the Project is part of the least cost expansion
program, it is appropriate to carry out the cost-benefit analysis on the
entire  program  to  ensure  that  it  is  justified.   For  this  purpose  a
"time-slice" of CEB's investment programs for generation, transmission and
distribution for the period  1986-2000 has been analyzed.   Capital costs for
these programs, together with incremental fuel costs, are shown in Annex 5.1.
All costs  were expressed  in terms  of their  equivalent border  values.   A
minimum measure of the benefits associated with these programs is given by
incremental sales revenue.   In early  1986, the  average tariff  revenue was
Rs 1.51/kWh. CEB recoups the costs of thermal generation through a fuel
adjustment charge (para 4.08), which was set equal to zero in the average
tariff revenue of Rs 1.51/kWh. The rate of return analysis assumes that fuel
costs of thermal plants will continue to be recouped through the fuel adjust-
ment charge. 1/ On this basis, the rate of return is estimated to be 9.0%
(Annex 5.1).
5.05    The  foregoing revenue-based  measure of  rate of  return is,  by its
nature, more a measure of the adequacy of tariffs than of the true economic
merit of the  investment programs which  include the Project.   The estimated
revenue-based rate of return of 9% is less than the estimated opportunity
cost of capital of 10%, and this indicates that tariffs are currently less
than long  run marginal  costs  (para 1.05).   In  these  circumstances,  the
1/ Annual fuel costs for the period 1986-1995 were estimated using the
WASP III planning model. The average fuel cost per kWh would be recouped
through the fuel adjustment charge. Consequently, the cost and revenue
effects of using thermal plants would exactly offset each other.



-30-
Project will confer benefits in excess of those measured by incremental
revenue.
5.06    A better measure of the rate  of return can be obtained by estimating
consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for the incrementaltelectricity sales. A
conservative estimate of WTP  was made as follows:   for residential, commer-
cial, street lighting, local authority and government consumers, it was the
weighted average tariff rate for incremental consumption in the respective
tariff categories, while for industrial and hotel consumers, it was the
marginal fuel cost of captive diesel plant (in 1984 these consumers had a
total installed capacity in excess of 26 MW). This gave a weighted average
WTP of Rs 2.44/kWh.   On this basis  the EIRR is  estimated to be  about lIZ.
However, it should be stressed that this is only a partial measure of EIRR.
The use of the weighted average tariff rates. for incremental consumption in
all tariff categories with the exception of hotels and industry means that
WTP is underestimated since  it generally excludes any  measure of consumers'
surplus. In addition, no allowance has been made for consumers' WTP for the
improved reliability and quality of electricity supply.
D. Justification for Bank Group Involvement
5.07    In addition  to providing additional  capacity to meet  forecast load
growth at least cost, the Project will, through IDA'S involvement:
(a) improve the efficient use of resources by reducing system losses;
(b) assist GOSL in evolving an institutional framework in which the power
system can be operated and maintained in an efficient and reliable
way;
(c) rationalize the consumption of energy through the setting of tariff
rates in relation to the costs to the economy of meeting consumers'
demands for electricity; and
(d) provide training for CEB staff and work crews in methods for the
efficient construction and maintenance of distribution systems.
VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01    During negotiations, GOSL agreed to  initiate, by October 31, 1988, a
program satisfactory to the Association to rationalize the institutional
arrangements for the distribution of electricity in Sri Lanka (para 2.05).
6.02    During negotiations, GOSL and CEB agreed to:
(a) reduce the level of accounts receivable from local authorities and
government departments to three months' billings by September 1, 1987
and, thereafter, ensure that total accounts receivable would not
exceed three months' billings (para 4.11); and



-31-
(b)  take all necessary actions, including  tariff increases, to achieve a
minimum annual rate of return of 8X on the average current value of
net fixed assets in use (para 4.17).
6.03    During negotiations, CEB agreed to:
(a) prepare and submit to the Association for its review by July 31,
1988, a master plan for the development of distribution systems in
Sri Lanka (para 2.05);
(b) prepare -and submit to the Association by March 31, 1987, planned
staffing levels and numbers for the period 1987-1989 (para 2.06);
(c) submit to the Association by June 30, 1987, and put into effect not
later than December 31, 1987, a scheme of incentives and a promotion
policy based on merit and other appropriate factors (para 2.07);
(d) submit to the Association by November 30, 1986, the maintenance
program for its generating facilities for 1987 (para 2.13);
(e) employ consultants to review by December 31, 1987, plant maintenance
systems at the Sapugaskanda diesel power station and thereafter
implement the improvements recommended by the consultants according
to a schedule acceptable to the Association (para 2.13);
(f) submit its unaudited accounts to the Association within four months
of the end of the fiscal year, and audited accounts accompanied by
the auditor's report within ten months (para 4.04);
(g) review with the Association by March 31, 1987, the results and recom-
mendations of the fixed asset accounting study, and implement the
agreed recommendations not later than July 1, 1987 (para 4.05);
(h) deposit, beginning FY86, annual contributions to the insurance
reserve in an escrow account with a financial intermediary on the
last day of the fiscal year (para 4.06);
(i) annually review its long-term Power Development Plan with GOSL and
the Association (para 4.16);
(j)  take all necessary actions to  implement the long-term Power Develop-
ment Plan agreed between CEB, GOSL and the Association (para 4.16);
and
(k) consult the Association before incurring new debt which would cause
its gross internal cash generation to fall below 1.5 times the debt
service requirement (para 4.19).
6.04    The  reduction  of  the  level  of  accounts  receivable  from  local
authorities to  six months'  billings (para 4.11)  is a  condition  of  Board
presentation for the Project.
6.05    The following would be conditions of effectiveness of the Credit:



-32-
(a)  completion  by CEB  of the  restructuring  of  its  organization,  As
approved by its Board of Directors in September 1982, and completion
and distribution of related operationat and functional manuals (para
2.03);
(b) fulfillment of all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the
ODA Grant (para 3.05);
(c)  conclusion of a Subsidiary Loan  Agreement between GOSL and CEB under
terms and conditions acceptable to the Association (para 3.06);
(d)  appointment of  consultants for detailed  engineering, preparation of
design standards and construction  guidelines, and project management
(para 3.07);
(e) appointment of consultants to assist CEB in -the introduction of
improved work methods and planning techniques for the construction
and maintenance of the distribution system (para 3.08);
(f) transfer of the balance in the insurance reserve accumulated as of
December 31, 1985 to an escrow account with a financial intermediary
that could be utilized only in the event of damage to CEB's assets
(para 4.06); and
(g) reduction of the level of accounts receivable from local authorities
to five months' billings (para 4.11).
6.06    Subject  to the  above conditions,  the Project  is suitable  for the
Association financing of SDR 43.2 million (US$52.0 million equivalent).

POWER IX:  DISTRIBUTION EXPANSION AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
Analysis of System Losses
1.      Energy losses  in CEB's supply  system are relatively  high, and were
about 16.6% of gross generation in July 1985. Technical losses, excluding
station service usage, were  about 15.11 of gross  generation which, for this
system, translates into a demand loss at peak of about 221. Thus more than
one-fifth of the peak demand  is caused by losses.   The economic energy loss
level for a system like CEB's is about 10 to 1 of gross generation, which
is the level expected after the proposed Project is completed. In addition,
the successful implementation of CEB's plans to improve its billing and
metering system would reduce non-technical losses from the present level of
about 1.1 of gross generation to about 0.6%.
2.      Table 1 shows the trend of losses on CEB's supply system from January
1981 to July 1985. Losses fell to 151 of gross generation in 1983 but then
increased to 16.61 in 1985. There appears to be no technical explanation for
this trend, and thus the variation probably is due to non-technical losses.
3.      Tables 2 and  3 show estimated  breakdowns of losses  for the present
and following completion of the proposed Project; the energy losses are shown
in Table 2 and the demand losses in Table 3.
4.      The highest  losses occur on  the MV  distribution system  (33-kV and
II-kV), and consequently most of the effort of the proposed Project is
directed to this level. This is unusual since in most supply systems the
highest losses are usually on the LV system, but CEB sells only about 25Z of
its energy at the LV retail level. The project would reduce losses at the NV
level by: (a) establishing 33-kV as a distribution voltage; (b) converting
some 11-kY feeders to 33-kV operation; (c) reducing the length of existing
33-kV feeders; and (d) adding capacitors for power factor correction. Recon-
ductoring some existing 33-kV feeders would have had the same effect as
introducing express feeders to break up existing feeders into shorter runs.
However the latter approach was chosen since it has a considerable advantage
in improving system reliability and is also easier to implement.
5.      Losses at the  LV level would be  reduced by using  more MVILV trans-
formero, thus reducing the Length of the LV feeders. Also in some places two
additional LV phases are added where there is single phase distributior.
This has the effect of reducing significantly the current on any one phatse
and thus the losses.
6.      Pinally,  the rehabilitation  portion of  the project  would  improve
connections, especially bimetallic connections which are prone to corrode and
cause heating.

SRI LANKA
POWER IX: DISTRIBUTION EXPANSION AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
Economic Internal Rate of Return
As described in Chapter 5, the proposed Project forms an integral
part of CEB's least cost expansion plan and, therefore, cost-benefit analysis
needs to be carried out on the whole plan rather than on the project in
isolation. CEB's investment program for the period 1986-2000 has, therefore,
been analyzed. Incremental capital costs, operation and maintenance costs,
and benefit streams (all in terms of early 1986 prices), are shown in
Table 1. Assumptions underlying these figures are detailed below.
Capital Costs
Anticipated capital expenditure on generation (from the WASP-III
generation planning model), transmission and distribution at financial prices
was converted to economic prices by (i) expressing the import content at
c.i.f. prices; (ii) valuing unskilled labor at 0.80 of the market wage rate;
and (iii) applying the estimated standard conversion factor of 0.75 to local
costs.
Operation and Maintenance
Annual operation and maintenance costs were estimated as the follow-
ing percentages of cumulative capital costs: generating plant 2%, transmis-
sion 2%, distribution 3%, and other 5%.
Benefits
Benefits in the base case were estimated solely in terms of revenue
using the average revenue per kWh in early 1986. Forecast incremental sales
revenue associated with the investment program is shown in Table 2. The
forecast allows for the impact of the projected reduction in system losses in
accordance with the targets given in para 2.11. The average revenue of
Rs 1.51/kWh in 1986 was taken to represent the weighted average tariff rate
defined over existing tariffs. Projected fuel costs for thermal generation
were assumed to be recouped through the fuel adjustment charge in the tariff,
in line with CEB's tariff policy. On this basis, and with costs measured in
economic terms, the rate of return is about 9.0%.
The foregoing rate of return is not based on estimates of consumers'
willingness to pay (WTP) for electricity. It is thus more a measure of the
adequacy of tariffs than of the worth of the proposed Project. A better



-66-
ANNEX 5.1
Page 2 of 5
measure of the rate of return can be obtained by estimating consumers' WTP
tor the incremental electricity sales.   A lover bound estimate of WTP was
derive.i as follows: for residential, conmmercial, street lighting, local
authority and government consumers, it was the weighted average tariff rate
for incremental consumption in the respective tariff categories. For con-
iutferf in the industrial and hotel tariff categories, WTP was measured in
termp ot the incremental economic fuel costs of meeting their demands for
electricity using auto-generators which are displaced by the public supply of
VlcctritiLy.  Calculated on this basis, the weighted average WTP for all
consumer groups is Ro 2.44IdWh.  The economic rate of return (EIRR) on this
baAsif  fi abf}out 11.0%.  It should be stressed that this is Only a partil
