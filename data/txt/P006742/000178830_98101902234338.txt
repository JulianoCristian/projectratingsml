REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PF.SIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO
INSTITUTO NACGINAL DE FONENTO MUNICIPAL
FOR A SECOND MULTI-CITY WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Instituto Nacional de Fomento Municipal (INSFOPAL) with the
guarantee of the Republic of Colombia for the equivalent of US$27 million
to help finance a Second Multi-City Water Supply and Sewerage Project.
The loan would have a term of 25 years, including 5 years of grace, with
interest at 8% per annum.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        The Bank's most recent economic report (Economic Position and
Prospects of Colombia, 138-C0) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on May 18, 1973. A note on major developments in the economy since that
time is included in Annex I.
3.        The Colombian economy has shown impressive gains in the recent
past. The rate of economic growth has accelerated to more than 7% per
annum, and the expansion of non-traditional exports has been remarkable.
Such improvements are very much needed in order to accelerate employment
generation and to raise gross national product per capita, currently US$400,
one of the lowest in Latin America, to a more acceptable level. Colombia
also needs to spread the benefits from growth more widely in order to
surmount problems of poverty and population pressures in both rural and
urban areas. Concentration of land ownership, technical backwardness, and
under-employment characterize most rural areas. In urban areas, pressures
of population growth, compounded by heavy migration from the countryside,
have generated serious unemployment and a severe housing deficit.  Prospects
for coping with these problems seem brighter as a result of the accelerated
growth upon which the Colombian economy has embarked in the past several
years.
4.        Recent Government administrations have reacted to rural poverty
and urban unemployment in a more systematic fashion than in the past, but
much remains to be done. In spite of the passage of an Agrarian Reform
Law and the creation of the Agrarian Reform Institute (INCORA) in 1961,
only modest results have been achieved in alleviating rural poverty. Addi-
tional legislation has been enacted which lays a better basis for land



-2-
reform but much remains to be done to raise income in rural areas. In
recognition of the problems of urban concentration and unemployment,
Colombia's previous Government placed greater emphasis on urban development,
particularly in the housing field, but despite such action unemployment
continued to increase in most of Colombia's major urban centers. Preliminary
indications suggest that the new Government, which took office in August 1974,
will strive to sustain a high rate of economic growth while simultaneously
attempting to achieve a more equitable distribution of its benefits, inter
alia through expansion of employment opportunities and increased investment
in education, health and agriculture. There is likely to be more emphasis
on the development of agriculture and industry, and less reliance on the
urban construction sector to provide a stimulus to economic growth. Export
diversification will continue to be a major component of development
strategy and the Government is currently rationalizing the export promotion
system. These development programs have necessitated and will continue to
require a strengthening of the fiscal effort.
5.        At the latest Consultative Group meeting held in June 1973, members
of the Group expressed the view that growing needs for public investment and
other public expenditures called for increases in domestic fiscal efforts.
While the Government then expressed the intention to further increase
revenues by new tax measures and by increasing the savings of public enter-
prises, little progress was achieved, and the fiscal situation remained weak.
To overcome these problems, Colombia's new Government has instituted a
comprehensive structural reform of the fiscal system which includes major
modifications of the sales and income taxes, and a strengthening of the
fiscal contribution of decentralized public enterprises. Discussions
between the Government and the Bank on fiscal issues are continuing.
6.        Colombia's efforts to expand exports have been amply rewarded in
recent years. Merchandise exports amounted to US$1,334 million in 1973, of
which over half came from non-coffee items. Allowing for price increases,
this represents a fourfold increase (representing an average annual real
growth of 24%) in non-traditional exports since 1965-67. Flowers, clothing,
emeralds, cotton thread and cloth, chemical and pharmaceutical products,
sawwood, and wood products enjoyed particularly large gains, although raw
cotton, sugar, meat, and other agricultural products continued to account
for the greatest absolute amounts. Coffee receipts were up largely as a
result of high international prices as the volume of coffee exports has
increased relatively little in recent years.
7.        Rapidly expanding exports accompanied by more slowly rising imports,
despite progressive removal of import restrictions, have created substantial
balance of payments surpluses. Net foreign exchange reserves of the Banco
de la Republica reached at the end of February 1974 nearly US$600 million,
or the equivalent of about five months' imports of goods and non-factor
services at the 1973 rate. This compares favorably with the US$345 million
and US$170 million held at the end of 1972 and 1971, respectively, and to the



-3-
deficit positions that were common prior to 1968. Since February, accele-
rated import payments resulting from liberalization of import restrictions
and lengthening of the lag between export registrations and exchange
surrender together with lower world prices for coffee, moved the current
account of the balance of payments from a surplus position in 1973 to a
deficit for the first eight months of last year. Sharply reduced external
borrowing by the Government has further lowered the inflow of foreign
exchanges and reserves probably declined by about US $120 million during
1974o Care will have to be exercised in foreign exchange reserve
management since world coffee prices may remain weak for some time and
prices of several of Colombia's non-traditional agricultural exports appear
to have peaked, while those of imports are expected to continue to rise.
The new Government is aware of the possibility of some weakening in the
balance of payments, and since taking office in mid-August has more than
doubled the rate of depreciation of the peso, ahead of domestic price
increases, in an effort to hold down the rapid growth of imports and sustain
adequate incentives to exporters. A longer-term problem is that, unless
appropriate action is taken, Colombia will become a sizable net importer
or crude petroleum near the end of the decade, and the pressure oni the
balance of payments from petroletum imports, should they become necessary,
could be considerable. A high-level Energy Council is studying exploration
incentives, taxation and foreign-exchange arrangements, product pricing,
P1.l othler aspects of this problem.
e.        The rapid growth of Colombia's GDP in 1972-73 was accompanied by
a sharply accelerated rate of price inflation. Consumer prices jumped 22%
in 1973, as compared with 14% in 1972, 12% in 1971, and an average of 7%
yearly in 1967-70. Food prices, which have a weight of about 50% in the
cost of living index, increased by 30% in 1973. The authorities have taken
a number of measures to dampen price pressures, including liberalization of
import controls, reduction of tariffs, and tighter controls on public expendi-
ture, but given the weak state of public finances, inflation continued
being a problem throughout 1974 and is expected to have reached 25% by year end.
To deal with this situation, the new Government has invoked emergency economic
powers and is moving forcefully to implement a comprehensive fiscal and
monetary reform aimed at strengthening public finances and at producing
a more balanced flow of resources through Colombia's financial system and
at providing the authorities with greater monetary control.
9.        Colombia's public external debt repayable in foreign currency
amounted to US$2.6 billion at the end of 1973, or US$1.9 billion excluding
undisbursed commitments. The Bank's share of this external debt (disbursed
only) as of end 1973 was about 28%, but this share is expected to decline
to 25% in 1978 as Colombia relies to a greater extent on other external
borrowing. Service on this debt is modest (12% of foreign exchange earnings
in 1973) relative to other developing countries. Since exports have risen
more rapidly than debt service in recent years, there has been a decrease
in the debt service ratio at a time when economic growth has accelerated.



-h -
The debt service ratio is expected to rise moderately and peak in the
mid-1980s at about 18% as a result of greater capital inflows associated
with a high growth rate. The Bank's share of total debt service is expected
to peak at about 28% in 1975 and is likely to decline thereafter. Should
economic growth continue at a rapid pace, which appears feasible, and should
that growth be accompanied by a further strong expansion of non-coffee
exports and the maintenance of sound economic and financial policies, Colombia
should find it possible to secure the amounts of external capital it needs
and to service the indebtedness that this borrowing would generate. Some of
this capital will have to be provided to finance local costs if total foreign
assistance is to be large enough to enable the country to cover its resource
gap on appropriate terms and maintain its rate of economic growth at an
acceptable level.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN COLOMBIA
10.       The proposed loan l/--the fifty-eight to be made to Colombia--would
bring the total amount of Bank loans to Colombia to US$1,112.8 million (net
of cancellations). Of the foregoing amount, US$854.6 is now held by the
Bank. IDA has made one credit of US$19.5 million for highways in Colombia
in 1961.
11.       Disbursements have been completed on 33 loans and the one IDA
credit. IFC has made effective investments and underwriting commitments in
20 enterprises in Colombia, totalling about US$27 million of which IFC now
holds US$13 million. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans,
the IDA credit, and IFC investments as of September 30, 1974, and notes on
the execution of the 23 on-going projects.

-5 -
12.       Since 1968, Bank lending in Colombia has become more diversified
than in earlier years. All three loans in the education sector have been
made since then as were one-half of the eight agricultural loans, four of
the five loans in the water supply sector and four of the loans for industry.
This compares with six loans during these past five years in the sectors
where the Bank has been traditionally active, i.e., power and transport.
Bank efforts have been focused on production-oriented activities and activi-
ties which carry social as well as economic benefits. Projects being
developed will seek to combine the objectives of increasing output with
maximum benefits in terms of employment and improving the income of the
poor, particularly in rural areas.
13.       We expect over the next several years to make an increasing
contribution to the agricultural and industrial sectors, with particular
emphasis on projects involving small and medium size farmholdings and
industrial enterprises. The other major focus of our activities would be
in such social sectors as education and water supply. We would continue
to support projects in the traditional sectors of Bank lending--electric
power and transportation--in those cases where support is required for
necessary institutional development. Projects are currently in an advanced
stage of preparation for rural settlement and irrigation rehabilitation.
1a.       The operations of external lenders in Colombia are shown in Annex
I, pages 3-1. While IBRD, IDB, and AID provided about four-fifths of total
external financing to Colombia in the 1961-72 period, their share has de-
creased since then. The IDB has assisted projects in low-cost housing,
university education, agrarian reform, ports, electric power, water supply,
transportation, and industry. AID has shifted the emphasis of its lending
in recent years from program to sector loans, particularly for education,
urban development, and agriculture.
PART III: WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR IN COLOMBIA
15.       Like most other developing countries, Colombia is experiencing
a process of very rapid urban growth, far in excess of the national rate
of population growth, which recently has been about 3.2%. Unlike many
other developing countries of Colombia's size and stage of economic develop-
ment, the country has a number of major urban centers. Bogota, the capital,
has a population now estimated at about three million. It is growing
rapidly at an estimated rate of 6.8% per annum. The population should
reach five million by 1980. Two other cities, Cali and Medellin, have
already surpassed the one million mark. Barranquilla has over 700,000
while Cartagena, Bucaramanga, Manizales and Pereira have about 300,000
inhabitants. Thirteen other cities have over 100,000 inhabitants. In
recent years, the growth rate of the cities in the 100,000-700,000 range
has averaged about 5.5% per annum.



-6-
16.       The Colombian Government has pursued a policy of providing public
facilities in the medium size cities in order to help divert some of the
rural migration to the large number of such cities instead of encouraging
a further inflow into the three largest urban centers. An important
expression of this policy has been a program of lending for medium sized
cities by the National Institute of Municipal Development (Instituto
Nacional de Fomento Municipal, INSFOPAL) which was supported by a Bank loan
of US$9.1 million in 1972 to provide improved water and sewerage facilities
in seven medium size towns with a total population of 1.2 million. In the
proposed project, a second loan of US$27 million to INSFOPAL would help
provide improved water and sewerage facilities in eight cities with popula-
tions of 50,000 to 700,000, increasing the total population served in these
cities from 1.3 million in 1973 to 2.1 million in 1980.
17.       Even though the growth of water supply and sewerage systems has
been fairly rapid during the last eight years, one-fourth of the urban
population (living in towns of more than 2,500 inhabitants) still does not
have direct access to public water supply. About 50% of the urban population
has access to sewerage services and less than 30% of the rural population is
connected to public water supply and sewerage networks.
18.       The insufficiency of water supply and sewerage services has been
due primarily to institutional problems, especially poor planning by the
local entities and inadequate allocation of central government investment
funds, and to traditionally low tariffs which have made it impossible to
raise the large capital sums needed for new works. Inflation has aggravated
the situation and local opposition to tariff increases has perpetuated it.
A vicious circle has been created where deteriorating services have made it
more difficult to convince the public of the necessity of tariff increases.
The Government favors such increases and the National Public Services Tariff
Board created in 1968 advocates the implementation of adequate tariffs which
will cover operating costs and generate funds for P 'Are investments.
19.       The Colombian water and sewerage sector is made up of three main
groups:
(a) The Empresas
Twenty-one cities with populations ranging from 25,000 to 3 million
have their own municipal utilities ("empresas") to provide public ser-
vices. These cities have a combined population of about 8.0 million or
a third of the total population. From 70% to 90% of this population
receives water supply services; 50% to 80% is connected to the sewerage
system. In general the empresas are reasonably well-run and finance
their system expansion with internal funds, suppliers' credits, and
loans from the National Government and foreign lending institutions.
The Bank has been active in lending to the empresas, making four loans
totalling US$122.5 million to the empresas in Bogota, Cali and Palmira.



-7-
Five other empresas in cities with a total population of one million
obtained financing under the First Medium Cities Loan and it is now
proposed that four empresas in cities with a total population of
1.3 million benefit under the proposed project. Thus, Bank lending
for the sector would reach about 80% of the population in cities
served by the empresas.
(b) INSFOPAL
The remaining cities with more than 2,500 inhabitants have their
water supply systems operated by INSFOPAL. The total population served
by these systems is about 6.0 million or a fourth of Colombia's popula-
tion. Approximately 70% of the inhabitants in this group have a supply
of water but only 50% are connected to the sewerage system. The quality
of services is poorer than that of the empresas previously described,
administrative competence is usually less, and their operating deficits
and investments are generally financed with government grants. Of the
cities in this group, two, with a total population of 2h0,000, benefitted
under the first Bank project for medium cities. Four with a total
population of about 0.5 million would benefit under the proposed loan,
which would also provide 30 smaller communities with additional ground-
water facilities. Under the proposed project, a reorganization of
INSFOPAL would be carried out whereby all the systems now operated by
the agency would become independent and autonomous entities. The basic
Presidential Decree authorizing this transformation was signed on
April 20, 1974. Implementation of this decree is expected to be
completed by mid-1976.
(c) INPES
The rural communities (less than 2,500 inhabitants) have their
systems planned and executed by the "Instituto de Programas Especiales
de Salud" (INPES). Only an estimated 30% of the population in this
group receives water supply and sewerage services. These communities
are too poor to afford adequate services and rely on Government funds
to finance their operating deficits and investments, although direct
water charges will cover operating expenses and some depreciation.
20.       Annual investments in the sector increased from US$21.6 million
in 1965 to US$46.3 million in 1971 and the total investment for that period
was US$253 million.  Of this, 75% were by the empresas, 20% by INSFOPAL and
only 5% for INPES communities.  About 35% of the total investment was
financed from the national budget, 20% from external sources and the remain-
ing 45% with internally-generated funds and domestic credits.
21.       External assistance for the sector started about twelve years ago
and US$196.1 million was committed from 1961 to 1972. Of this amount, 70%
was from the Bank, 25% from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and
the remainder from USAID, Eximbank and the German Kreditanstalt. In addition,



- 8 -
USAID made a sector loan of US$29 million in June 1971 for urban development.
IDB has made 10 loans in the sector, totalling US$h3.h million. Two of these,
made to INSFOPAL in 1962, amounted to US$10.6 million and were for 327 towns.
22.       The Government objective is to extend by 1980 water supply and
sewerage facilities to at least 80% of the urban population. This would
require large annual capital investments, estimated in 1972 (in prices of
that year) at Col$1,000 million (US$50 million) for the large and most of
the medium cities, at Col$630 million (US$31 million) for the smaller cities
and at Col$550 million (US$27 million) for rural communities. These are
commendable objectives but the Government goal can only be reached if funds
of this magnitude can be provided. In this connection, the mobilization of
internal resources through increased tariffs is of vital importance. The
magnitude of the required increases, however, is such that resistance by the
public is to be expected. Therefore, it may well be that the Government
goals may not be reached within the next five years.
23.       Sewage and industrial wastes are largely untreated in Colombia.
So far, pollutant loads have been low compared with the natural self-
purification of the receiving rivers and waste waters have been dispersed
without much nuisance or causing harmful deoxygenation of the river waters.
No serious problems are foreseen in the next few years, except in Bogota
and Cartagena. In the case of Bogota, the Bank's second loan for water
supply and sewerage has helped finance a study of River Regulation and
Pollution Control which will assist in the preparation of a Bank project.
In the case of Cartagena, the preparation of a master plan for treatment
and disposal of domestic and industrial waste waters in the Cartagena area
could be included in an urban study for which UNDP financing is being
sought.
24.       The Bank's first medium cities project not only provided funds for
priority projects in the seven cities covered but was also aimed at convert-
ing INSFOPAL into a more efficient agency that would be better able than
in the past to identify, plan and evaluate projects in the sector. Initially,
progress under several of the subloans of the first project was slower than
expected, mainly because of delays in implementing the tariff increases
required in the subsidiary loan agreements (as a condition of effectiveness),
interference of the Boards of Directors in the daily management of some of
the empregas and a shortfall of internal cash generation. Moreover, water
demand has not increased at quite the rate forecast and consequently the
empresas have experienced difficulties in financing their 25% share of the
investment costs. (This experience has been taken into account in making
demand projections for the proposed second project and the new projections
are more conservative.) This slow start in part must also be attributed
to the low capability of the personnel of D.t1SPAL and its External Credit
Office (ECO) which had been established to administer the operation financed
by the Bank loan but did not provide the utilities with adequate assistance.
ECO has recently hired more competent staff who are now effectively helping
the empresas. Project execution under the first project is now proceeding
satisfactorily.



-9-
25.       The proposed loan would continue to develop INSFOPAL's capacity
to assist the empresas and its subsidiary systems (the so-called "acuas")
in technical operations, administration, finance and project preparation.
It again would aim at helping the agency to become a competent national
institution through which a major share of investment funds for the sector
would be channelled. This would mean the gradual elimination of the
operational functions of INSFOPAL through making the acuas and similar
utilities now dependent on it into independent entities. At the same time,
INSFOPAL's financial and advisory functions would be strengthened.  The
groundwork for this reform has already been laid through the issuance of
a presidential decree, reorganizing INSFOPAL and redefining its functions.
The new status of INSFOPAL would be furthered by the establishment under
its direction of a revolving fund to receive repayments by the empresas
and acuas of Government budgetary funds lent to them by INSFOPAL. An
increasingly important function of INSFOPAL would be to oversee the tariffs
of the local water systems so as to ensure that operating costs are covered
and sufficient savings generated to cover an important proportion of future
investments.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
26.       The appraisal of the proposed Multi-City Water Supply and Sewer-
age Project was carried out in November-December 1973; project data were
revised in November 1974. Loan negotiations were held in Bogota during
September-October 1974 with a Colombian delegation led by Dr. Cristian
Mosquera, Director General of Public Credit, Ministry of Finance.
27.       The proposed loan would be made to INSFOPAL, the national water
supply agency, and would help finance water supply and sewerage projects
to be executed from 1975 to 1979 in eight cities with populations between
50,000 and 700,000, namely Barranquilla, Cartagena, Cucuta, Ibague, Pasto,
Popayan, Valledupar and Villavicencio. The projects in Valledupar and
Villavicencio will not include sewerage works. In addition, the project
will provide some 30 small communities with additional groundwater supplies
and assist the installation of about 100,000 water meters in the systems
operated by INSFOPAL as well as providing staff training and management
assistance to INSFOPAL and the beneficiaries; the installation of these
100,000 meters as well as 91,000 in the eight cities financed under the
proposed project will further implement the policy of introducing into the
sector more rational charges for water. A loan and project summary is
attached as Annex III to this report and an appraisal report (464a-co) is
being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
28.       The total cost of the project is estimated at USA52.9 milliorn in-
cliudir,g funds for managerial assistance to INSFOPAL and beneficiaries, as
weli as training or the water supply utilities stanf.  lhe cost ot consult-
irc services for INSFOPAI anc the beneficiaries is estimated at US$2.6 million.



- 10 -
About 51i` of the project cost would be financed with the Bsnk loan which
would cover the foreign excharge component estimated at US$16.7 million and
part of the local expenditures, or US$10. 3 million equivalernt. The financing
of local currency costs is justified on the grounds indicated in paragraph 9
above. lJ
29.        The financing plan includes US11.24 million of works not related
to the project to be carried out by the empresas during the construction
period (1975-79), interest during construction of US$6.58 million, and an
increase in the working capital of the empresas of USW3.LO million. This
bri ngs the total need for funds to US$67.5L million.  Of this amount, US$27
million will be provided by the proposed Bank loan, US$16.5L million would
be provided as a Government grant for onlending by INSFOPAL, US$19.02 million
from the net internal cash generation of the beneficiaries, andr US$L.98 million
from an industrial complex in Cartagena.
30.        The Bank loan would be re-lent to the beneficiaries under substantial-
ly the same terms as extended to INSFOPAL (Section 3.03 (a) (i) of the draft
Loan Agreement) and the sub-borrowers would bear the exchange risk.  The Govern-
mernt grant to INSFOPAL (excluding grants totalling about US$0.29 million
equivalent for the acquisition of fixed assets to Ibague, Pasto and Vallendupar)
would be onaent to the beneficiaries at an interest rate of 12% to be repaid in
20 years after a 5-year grace period (Section 3.03 (a) (ii) of the draft Loan
Arre ement .  The funds being repaid would constitute a revolving fund, admin-
is.ered by INSFOPAL, for future lending in the water supply and sewerage sector.
31.       IINSFOPAL has been running a recurring operating deficit which has
beer covered by the Goverrznent. The Government also pays INSFOPAL's capital
investment program and service on loans made by IDB and USAD to it for re-
lending to the municiralities.  With the separation of the operating agenc es
Lroa INSFOFAL, and the tariff increases contemplated under the reorganization
of the sector, INSFOPAL's operating deficit would be eliminated in the future.
The draft Loan Agreement (Section 3.03 (a)(v)(2)(3) requires INSFOPAL tc obtain
assurances from the sub-borrowers, in the eight main project cities, that they
will maintain. water supply and sewerage tariffs and other charges for their
services at levels sufficient to cover their operating expenses, debt service
and a percentage satisfactory to the Bank of project investment costs; in the
case of the 30 smaller cities, the required tariffs would be sufficient
tc cover operating expenses and debt service.  In the eight major cities, the
wrter and sewerage rates would be set at levels aiming at the generation by
th:e enterprises of some 28% of the costs of their investment program. In the
subsidiary loan agreements the enterprises will be required to achieve the
followinig rates of return on their assets which are to be revalued at least
annually in a manner satisfactory to the Bank:

Villavicencio           1.2         2.8         6.2
Such fixed assets of the Barranquilla and Cartagena empresas, in particular
for sewerage, will substantially increase during the construction period and
a temporary decrease in the rates of return will be allowed which would be
regained by 1982. Except for Barranquilla and to some extent Cartagenia, the
finpncial situation of the sub-borrowers is difficult and immediate tariff
irncreoses wi]l be required in order to meet the standards established under
the Bank loan. Such increases are established as conditions of disbursement
under the subsidiary loan agreements (sub-paras. (iii) and (iv) of paregraph
(,b of Schedule 1 of the draft Loan Agreemert).
32.       Except for civil works under US$100,000, all contracts would be
placed by means of international competitive bidding. Foreign suppliers
are expected to win most of the contracts for treatment plant and pump sta-
tion equipment, water meters and operation equipment, amounting to about
US$8.8 million. Colombian contractors are expected to win all civil works
and pipe supply contracts. For bid evaluation purposes, a 15% margin of
preference (customs duties are substantially higher) would be allowed for
equipment manufactured in Colombia. The beneficiaries are not liable to
pay customs duties, and consequently no regional preference will be accepted
in bid evaluation.
33.       The loan would be disbursed against the full CIF cost of all
direct imports, the foreign exchange cost of consulting services and a
varying percentage of the cost of all supplies, civil engineering works
and services procured locally.
IL.       The populations of the eight cities are growine at rates from
i.+ 5to 6vs annually and their present population of 1.8 million is estimated
tc rise to 2.3 million in 1980. The project would ensure that a population
of 2.1. million would have access to wholesome water supply and sewerage.
Many of the new consumers would be from the lower income groups. Sanitary
conditions would be substantially improved in the urban areas involved

through construction of sewers and the pollution of streams in built-up
areas will be considerably reduced. The inclusion of the relatively
populous cities of Barranquilla and Cartagena on the Caribbean coast will
benefit lower income groups in the coastal areas and it will bring new
areas under the influence of INSFOPAL, and thus strengthen its constructive
role within the sector.
35.       The internal financial rate of return for the individual sub-
projects are: Barranquilla 10%, Cartagena 11%, Cucuta 15%, Ibague 12%,
Pasto 8%, Popayan 8%, Valledupar 10% and Villavicencio 12%. The financial
rates indicated are lower than the expected economic return on the project
because all benefits, such as for health and environment, are not fully
reflected in the prices charged for water services.
PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
36.       The draft Loan Agreement between INSFOPAL and the Bank, the
draft Guarantee Agreement between the Bank and the Republic of Colombia
as well as the Report of the Committee provided for in Article Im,
Section 4 (iii), of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft
Resolution approving the proposed loan, are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
37.       The draft Agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans
for water supply and sewerage projects.
38.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI: RECOMMENDATION
39.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

COLOMBIA - MEMORANDUM ON RECENT ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS
A. Recent Economic Developments
Economic Growth
1.         The Colombian economy has performed impressively in a number of
important respects in the past several years. Real growth of gross domestic
product accelerated from an average of 4.7 percent in 1950-67 to an average
of 6.4 percent over the 1967-72 period. During the past two years, Colombia
has sustained even higher rates of growth, 7.1 percent in 1972 and 7.3 percent
in 1973, the highest rates of growth achieved in 25 years. Strong expansion
of the industrial, agricultural, and in 1973, construction sectors, rapid-
growth of non-traditional exports, and favorable coffee prices were the key
factors in this achievement. Preliminary indications are that GDP growth has
decelerated slightly in 1974 as a result of a slowdown in the construction
boom and a weakening of coffee prices.   While industry continues to be the
leading growth sector, expanding by 10 percent in real terms in 1973 and
accounting for about 30 percent of growth of GDP, a boom in construction
generated an increase in value added by that sector of 12.6 percent. Despite
rapid growth of the labor-intensive construction sector, unemployment has
continued to increase in most of Colombia's major urban centers, in part as
a result of accelerated rural to urban migration. While the rate of growth
of agriculture (4.8 percent in 1973) was well above the historical average,
most of the growth was concentrated in agricultural commodities for export.
Lagging production for domestic consumption, insufficient to keep pace with
domestic demand has contributed to inflationary pressures. Mining production
has declined steadily for the past several years as a result of declining
petroleum production.
Inflation
2.         Inflation has become a serious problem in Colombia and seems likely
to persist for some time, despite a number of measures taken in recent months
to combat it. The cost-of-living index is expected to have risen by about 25 percent
in 1974 as compared to 22 percent last year, 14 percent in 1972, 12 percent
in 1971, and an average of 7 percent per year between 1967 and 1970. Accelera-
tion in the rate of inflation during 1973 and the first quarter of 1974 was
the result of a surge in the level of demand stemming from (a) the substantial
increase in the income of the export sector; (b) the large fiscal deficit in
the cash operations of the,public sector; and (c) continued strong private
investment. Rising cost of imports, labor and credit, combined with tight
controls on imports and a decline in the output of agricultural production
for domestic consumption further aggravated inflationary pressures. Measures
adopted in late 1973 and early 1974 to limit the rate of expansion of aggregate
demand and increase aggregate supply have begun to take hold and the rate of



ANNEX I
Page 6 of 12
inflation has declined during the second and third quarters of 1974. However,
increasing pressure for substantial upward wage adjustments from organized
labor and the need to eliminate some subsidies and allow upward adjustment
in prices of a number of items which have been controlled for the past 12
months have caused some increase in the rate of inflation during recent
months. Progress in reducing the rate of inflation in 1975 will depend
heavily upon the Government's success in arresting the deterioration in
public finances which has taken place since 1972.
Balance of Payments
3.         Colombia's rapid growth in 1972-73 was sparked by strong growth of
coffee and most minor exports which permitted a large accumulation of foreign
exchange reserves. Coffee exports increased an estimated 34 percent to
US$630 million, largely as a result of continuation of the upsurge in world
coffee prices (an average of US$0.73 per pound in 1973 as compared to US$0.57
in 1972) which began in mid-1972 as Brazilian coffee production declined. Of
even more significance from the point of view of the long-term growth of the
Colombian economy was the continued strong performance of minor exports which
increased 48 percent to US$680 million. Price rises for these goods accounted
for a significant proportion of the increase, but volume exported also rose
by a substantial 15 percent. Despite the impressive 40 percent increase in
total export earnings which took place in 1973, Colombia continued throughout
most of the year to maintain tight controls on imports. As a consequence the
value of imports exceeded the 1972 level by only 22 percent, not substantially
more than the increase in import prices. The increased real availability of
imported goods accordingly did little to dampen domestic inflationary pressures.
Despite official measures to speed up import payments and to reduce foreign
exchange inflows to the Bank of the Republic arising from private borrowing
abroad, official reserves increased from US$345 million at end-1972 to US$524
million at end-1973.
4.         Export performance during the first seven months of 1974 was out-
standing.  Higher world coffee prices and a 32 percent increase in the volume
shipped resulted in a 36 percent increase in coffee export registrations
during this period as compared to the same period of 1973. Registrations of
non-traditional exports increased 51.4 percent through July, an increase of
over 30 percent in real terms. Exports of manufactured products have been a
major element in the strong expansion of non-traditional exports with earnings
from textiles increasing three-fold, while those from chemicals and pharmaceuti-
cals, and metals and metal products, doubled. Import liberalization has led
to accelerated import payments and there has been a lengthening of the lag
between export registrations and exchange surrender. Thus, despite strong
export performance the current account of the balance of payments has shifted
from a surplus of over US$100 million during the first seven months of 1973
to a deficit of US$80 million during the same period of this year. Sharply
reduced external borrowing by the Government has further lowered the inflow
of foreign exchange, and reserves probably declined by about US$120 million
during 1974.



ANNEX I
Page 7 of 12
5.       The estimated decline in foreign exchange reserves of US$120 million for
1974 should not present any problem to Colombia since an appropriate cushion of
reserves, sufficient to cover about 4 months of imports, probably still existed
by year end. Foreign exchange reserve management over the next eighteen
months should aim at preventing further losses, since world coffee prices may
remain weak for some time, and prices of several of Colombia's non-traditional
agricultural exports appear to have peaked, while those of imports are expected
to continue rising.  The new government is aware of the possibility of some
deterioration in the terms of trade and is attempting to sustain the high rate
of growth of non-traditional exports by accelerating devaluation of the peso
so as to compensate exporters for the differential between internal and ex-
ternal inflation. Since mid-August the rate of depreciation of the peso has
been substantially greater than the differential between domestic and world
inflation and the Government intends to continue this policy for the fore-
seeable future.
Public Finances
6.         Deterioration of Colombia's public finances since 1971 has made
it increasingly difficult for the authorities to manage aggregate demand so
as to contain inflation while maintaining a desirable pace of development.
Despite an average annual real rate of growth of GDP in excess of 7 percent,
National Government tax revenue has failed to show any significant increase
in real terms and, as a percentage of GDP, declined from the peak of 9.4 per-
cent in 1971 to an expected 7.4 percent in 1974. This weakening in domestic
resource mobilization through the tax system was, in 1972 and 1973, reflected
in increased Government recourse to general purpose external borrowing to
cover the Government's cash deficit, and in declining real levels of public
investment. In order to overcome these problems, the new Government has
initiated a comprehensive structural reform of the fiscal system which includes
major modification of the sales and income taxes, elimination of the wheat
subsidy, reduction of fiscal incentives for non-traditional exports, and
strengthening of the fiscal contribution of decentralized public enterprises.
The reform has not yet been fully put into effect, but it could, if fully
implemented and supplemented by an urban property tax and measures to eliminate
the subsidy of gasoline consumption, produce a substantial strengthening of
public finances.
B.  Development Problems and Policy Requirements
7.         Wlile Colombia's growth, and balance of payments performance has
been excellent in recent years, lagging performance in several important
areas could, if permitted to continue, jeopardize the country's development
effort. The key areas where policy action is required include improving
the performance of the petroleum sector, strengthening public finances and



ANNEX I
Page 8 of 12
investment, maintaining the appropriate balance in the flow of resources
through the financial system, further improving income distribution and the
employment situation, and assuring continued strong expansion of non-tradi-
tional exports.
Petroleum
8.         Colombia is fortunate in having sufficient crude petroleum supplies
to escape any immediate adverse balance of payments' effect of recent in-
creases in world oil prices. However, an unrealistic pricing policy has, in
recent years, encouraged excessive consumption and contributed to a decline
in output. While the internal reference price paid to producers for "new"
crude oil was increased to US$4 per barrel in February 1974, prices to
producers for petroleum flowing from existing fields as well as prices at
the refinery and consumer levels have not been changed since June 1971, and
are far below prices in international markets.
9.         Crude oil production has declined 20 percent since 1970, and crude
exports have stopped altogether. Creation of appropriate incentives for in-
creased exploitation of oil from fields already in production, and a modest
dampening of domestic demand by means of long-overdue price increases, would
permit Colombia to hold off crude oil imports until 1979-80. If decisive
action is taken in the months ahead to encourage exploration and drilling,
it is entirely possible that new oil, sufficient to meet domestic demand,
could become available in 5-6 years. Failure to act in the immediate future,
however, could, in the early 1980's, result in a heavy burden on Colombia's
balance of payments.
10.        Prices of petroleum products are controlled by the Government and
the retail price of gasoline is among the lowest in the world (regular
gasoline is US$0.12/gallon). Considering the country's supply and demand
situation, product prices to the consumer and at the different stages of
production should be increased so as to be more in line with international
prices. Such a price adjustment should be done as soon as possible since
low petroleum product prices have not only discouraged production of petroleum,
but have diverted attention from development of the abundant coal, natural
gas, and hydroelectric resources which Colombia possesses. Hydropower, coal,
and natural gas currently account for only 4 percent, 12 percent, and 17 percent,
respectively, of energy production and there is considerable scope for sub-
stituting these alternative energy sources for petroleum. To develop them
will, however, require careful planning and sizable capital outlays, as well
as proper pricing to encourage an appropriate energy balance. There is a
close relationship between petroleum pricing policy and the fiscal situation
since price increases of petroleum products would increase the Central Govern-
ment's fiscal resources through further improved finances of the State-owned
oil company, ECOPETROL, and through increased gasoline tax collections. This
would help to overcome the revenue shortfalls which hamper the investment
program and which limit the government's ability to reduce present inflationary
pressures.

Public Savings and Investment
11.        Notwithstanding the booming production and trade conditions of the
economy over the past few years, Colombia's public finance performance has
been disappointing. Largely because of poor tax collections in 1972 and 1973
(especially for the income tax) the real current surplus in both years was
below that in 1971. The real decline in income tax collections in 1973 oc-
curred despite a 7.3 percent increase in real GDP and reveals a serious
weakness in income tax administration. Real public investment spending in
1973, covered in part by severe compression of current outlays and by
US$80 million in Eurocurrency borrowing, fell sharply despite the continued
pressing need for expanded social and economic infrastructure. Preliminary
data for 1973 indicate that the decline in public investment has not been
offset by an increase in private investment and that the share of total
investment in GDP has fallen from an average 21.4 percent in the 1969-72
period to 19.3 percent in 1973. Without substantial strengthening of public
finances, public investment could continue to decline in real terms and the
expansion of the private sector could be constrained by lack of complementary
social and economic infrastructure.
12.        Reliable data are not yet available concerning Colombia's overall
public sector accounts for 1971-74, but enough is known to make it clear that
the decline in National Government investment during this period was not
offset by spending in the rest of the public sector. The new Government is
aware of the need for increased investment by decentralized public sector
agencies and is expected to move rapidly in the coming months to assure an
appropriate increase in the internally generated resources of these agencies.
Deficits of public enterprises in the electric power, water and sewerage,
and telecommunications sectors, with the exception of Empresa Nacional de
Telecomunicaciones (TELECOM),have risen in recent years as a result of lagging
tariffs. Three decentralized enterprises, Empresa Colombiana de Petroleos
(ECOPETROL), TELECOM and Empresa Colombiana de Puertos (COLPUERTOS), have in
the past few years accounted for 90 percent of the total current surplus of
the public enterprises. Dissaving of public enterprises was concentrated in
four enterprises; IDEMA (the-Government's agricultural marketing agency), the
Railways (CNR), Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario (ICA), and Instituto Colombiano
de la Reforma Agraria (INCORA). In the rest of the public sector the tendency
has been for savings to decline also since 1969. As a result total public
savings fell from 7.0 percent of GDP in 1969 to 5.0 percent in 1973.
13.       The recently completed fiscal reform contains an impressive array
of measures aimed at (a) increasing tax revenue; (b) improving the progressivity
of the tax system by reducing the tax burden on the lowest income groups, increas-
ing taxes on the highest income groups, and by closing numerous loopholes which
have permitted high income groups to avoid paying taxes; (c) increasing the
elasticity of the tax system; and (d) improving tax administration. While it
will be several months before the revenue implications of the fiscal reform
become completely clear, preliminary estimates indicate that new tax revenue
of about Col$ 2.5 billion will be generated in 1975. In addition, elimination
of the wheat subsidy has reduced the need for transfers to IDEMA by an esti-
mated Col$ 1.2 billion in 1975.   The outlook for 1975 is for a sharply



ANNEX I
Page 10 of 12
reduced National Government deficit as the recent revenue generating measures
begin to take hold. The Central Government deficit should be reduced from
about 2% of GDP in 1971-72 to 0.2% in 1975; but it must be noted that this
is likely to be achieved only with the help of a further reduction in real
terms in investment expenditures by the National Government.
Reform of the Financial System
14.        In August 1974, the new administration introduced a series of execu-
tive decrees and resolutions aimed at domestic monetary reform. These measures
involve restructuring of interest rates, including establishment of a maximum
ceiling on the rate of monetary correction, a simplification of Colombia's
complex reserve requirement system, the elimination of numerous portfolio
requirements, the elimination of several rediscount facilities, and the
adoption of more stringent controls over existing facilities. in broad terms,
these measures should produce a more balanced flow of resources through
Colombia's financial system and provide the authorities with greater control
over the functioning of the monetary system.
Income Distribution and Employment
15.        Despite the paucity of suitable statistics it seems clear that t:!2
existing distribution of personal income is markedly unequal. The poorest
fifth of the population appears to be receiving 3 percent of total income,
while the richest fifth gets about 60 percent. Not much can be said about
changes over time, but since rural incomes seem to be more highly skewed than
urban incomes, the increasing demographic importance of the towns and cities
would seem to present a prima facie case for presuming a modest improvemenT-
in the overall national income distribution. This conclusion is to some
extent supported by national income accounts data which indicate that the
share of wage and salary income of GDP increased from 36 percent in 1950
to 40 percent ii 1970. Few Colombians would accept past rates of improvement
as adequate, however, and a great deal remains to be done in order to s-r-
the benefits of economic growth more widely. Rural land redistribution,
more effective taxation, higher public spending for education and health
services, and a vigorous effort to boost overall production and employment
growth are all needed, together with continuing efforts to prevent abuses
arising from monopoly power. Colombia's authorities have accelerated their
efforts to do all of these things in recent years.
16.        The employment goal is perhaps the most important of all the major
national objectives in the economic sPhere. Increasing and spreading employ-
ment opportunities is the single most effective way to raise the level and
improve the distribution of national income. Data on unemployment are sparse,
but the available figures for 1972 point to an improvement in Bogota accom-
panied by deterioration in Medellin, Barranquilla, and other urban centers.
If rough weights by city are applied, a slight overall deterioration seems
to have occurred. Since 1972 rural to urban migration appears to have
increased and as a result unemployment in Colombia's najor urban centers has
increased. The one exception to this has been in Cali where accelerated
rural to urban migration has not been as pronounced because of its rich agri-
cultural hinterland and decentralized agro-industries located in a number of



ANNEX I
Page 11 of 12
smaller cities throughout the Departments of Valle and Cauca. The challenge
facing Colombia's authorities is to encourage and shape growth of employment
through the use of excise taxes, depreciation allowances, import tariffs and
general monetary/fiscal policies. Special incentives should be provided to
industries which are labour-intensive and to firms willing to undertake
multiple shifting as a means of increasing employment.
External Borrowing
17.        Available data indicate that Colombia's public external debt out-
standing at the end of 1973 came to US$2.6 billion, of which US$1.9 billion
had been disbursed. During 1973 contracts were signed to borrow US$421
million (of which US$305 million were project loans).   The levels and composi-
tion of 1973'borrowing closely approximated the amounts set forth'in the 1973
project list (as described in the May 1973 IBRD Economic Report net of expected
slippage and droppage). An estimated disbursement of US$340 million on public
external borrowing occurred in 19-73, as compared to US$355 million in 1972 and
US$223 muillion in 1971.  While disbursements on project loans increased 20
percent in 1973, a slowdown of such disbursements has taken place since late
1973, reflecting a scarcity of local counterpart funds stemming from the
deteriorating fiscal performance. However, the fiscal actions now being taken
by the Colombian Government, and those under consideration may to some extent
ameliorate this situation, and it is hoped that by the time of the 1975
Consultative Group Meeting   sufficient action will have been taken to enable
the Group to proceed with consideration of a full assistance program for
1975-76.
C. The Growth Perspective and Capital Requirements
18.        Recent IBRD Economic Reports on Colombia have concluded that the
economy can sustain a 7 percent annual rate of growth over the long-term
without excessive foreign borrowing, provided that exports can be increased
at a reasonable rate. During 1972-73 this growth target was attained, and
it is likely that in 1974 real growth will again reach about 7 percent. These
high rates of growth were accompanied by a strong export and balance-of-payments
performance, which made possible a large build-up of foreign exchange re-
serves, and a decline in the debt service ratio. The long-term projection
made last year is being revised, to take into account recent developments and
new information on the outlook for commodity prices and world inflation.
19.       For the time being it seems safe to assume that the volume of coffee
exports will increase 1.5 percent annually from 1975 through the remainder of
C 'r an decade 'and t1iht 6kxprt earnings ftoMt coffee hi current prices will
increase an average 7.6 percent annually, until 1979. Growth in the volume of
other exports whi'ch include a wide ranRe of manufactured and agricultural exports,
can be assumed on that basis to decline from 20 percent in 1975 to 10 percent
for 1979.  Total exports would increase in current prices at an average 14.3

per year from 1974 on.   In real terms the growth rate of total exports may thus
be between 7% and 7.5%.   Imports may be assumed to be about 15 percent of GDP
throughout the projection period provided that Colombia will not require sub-
stantial imports of crude oil. Under these assumptions Colombia will require
public external assistance disbursements totalling about US$3.5 billion during
the five-year period 1975-79. This level of external assistance implies new
commitments averaging US$700 million annually. These public external assistance
requirements imply only modest increases in real terms over recent levels.
20.       In the past the strqucture of Colombia's external debt has been strongly
influenced by the receipt of large amounts of development assistance from inter-
national development agencies. This, together with the successful export per-
formance, explains the low and relatively stable debt service ratio which Colombia
has experienced over the past decade. As a result of continuing rapid growth of
non-traditional exports and favorable coffee prices, the burden of debt service,
on the balance of payments declined moderately in 1973. The debt service ratio..
(principal and interest payments as a percentage of exports of goods and nonfactor
services) amounted to a modest 12 percent in 1973 compared to 12.9 percent in 1972
and 14.3 percent in 1971. The debt service ratio is now'lower than throughout
most of the 1960s.   Despite the expected shift away from external assistance
from international development agencies and the large increase in total external
borrowing (in current prices) which is foreseen at least until the end of the
current decade, the debt service ratio would remain well manageable during that
period.  In these circumstances, and assuming that Colombia is able to sustain
its export expansion and avoid external borrowing on unfavorable terms to cover
fiscal shortfalls, the country should have little difficulty in obtaining the
required external capital and in servicing its external debt obligations.
However, some of this capital will have to finance local costs, if the
country is to cover its justifiable resource gap, since the foreign exchange
content of the projectizable portion of the investment program is likely to
be comparatively small.

C.    PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
1.         Summarized below is the current status of all loans signed but not
fully disbursed:
Ln No. 502 Irrigation (Atlantico I); US$9 million, June 1967.
Closing date: original - December 31, 1973;
current - December 31, 1974.
2.         While all physical works should be completed by the current clos-
ing date, final payments to contractors will not occur until March or April
1975. A further extension of closing date to June 30, 1975, is therefore
being considered. The delays in project execution have been occasioned by
poor selection of areas suitable for irrigation, technical problems in the
construction of irrigation and drainage works, and non-compliance by con-
tractors with established schedules. Agricultural development has also been
slow, due to poor project management and lack of adequate supporting services
to the farmer. However, INCORA has now appointed a very capable Project
Manager who has brought with him a competent agricultural team who, it is
believed, have the potential to develop the project satisfactorily under its
less than ideal circumstances. Citrus has now been abandoned as a project
crop. Rice is now proposed as a temporary irrigated crop in order to allow
the leaching of salts from the soil profile. The intensive cropping pattern
needed to justify the investment in irrigation facilities will be several
years in development.
Ln No. 536 Water Supply (Bogota I); US$14 million, June 1968.
Closing date:   original - June 1972;
current  - December 31, 1975.
3.         As of September 30, 1974, US$13.6 million or 97 percent of this
loan has been disbursed. Notwithstanding that the Project is essentially
completed, the Closing Date was extended because of delays in procurement
and to permit final payments to suppliers.
Ln No. 575 Electric Power (Interconnection): US$18 million, December 1968.
Closing date: December 31, 1974.
4.         The original project was completed and commercially operational
in 1971. The Bank agreed that an undisbursed balance could be used to fi-
nance a 220 kv transmission line, Guatape - Barrancabermeja, which would

the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

be completed in the first quarter of 1975, one year behind schedule. The
cost is estimated at US$7.2 million of which about US$4.1 million represents
the foreign currency component. The Bank is seriously concerned about ISA's
financial situation which is being discussed with the borrower and the Govern-
ment.
Ln No. 624 Agricultural Credit II, US$17 million, June 1969
Closing date: original - December 31, 1973;
current - June 30, 1975.
5.         After disappointing performance in the first three years, changes
in project management and organization and an increase in technical personnel
provided the basis in February 1973 for the Bank's agreeement to enlarge the
project area and include lending to small farmers under the project. As a
result, the project is now proceeding in a satisfactory manner. All project
funds are expected to be committed by end 1974.
Ln No. 625 Development Finance Companies III: US$25 million,
June 1969.
Closing date: June 30, 1974
6.         The loan is fully committed to sub-projects.    The Bank will ascertain
whether the Borrower wishes the Closing Date postponed or the small undisbursec
balance cancelled.
Ln No. 651 Livestock II; US$18.3 million, December 1969
Closing date: July 31, 1975
7.         After a disappointing performance during the first three years after
signing, 1970-72, CAJA's project administration was reorganized and the project
area was extended to cover the entire country. The project has, since early
1973, progressed satisfactorily. Demand for on-farm investments is high an
disbursements have been accelerating. All loan funds are expected to be cuIii-
mitted by end 1974 and disbursements might be completed befor'e the original
closing date of July 31, 1975.
Ln No. 679 Education II; US$6.5 million, June 1970.
Closing date: original - June 30, 1973;
current - December 31, 1974.
8.         Major civil works have been completed and all nine project schools
have been in operation since January 1973. However, operation of schools is
below the expected level because of inadequate organization and shortage
of local funds to meet current expenditures. Procurement of equipment and
furniture has been delayed. All contracts will be signed before the extended
closing date, but disbursements should continue later on. A further post-
ponement of the closing date is therefore planned.
Ln No. 680 Hlighway VI; US$32 million, June 1970
Closing date: original - November 30, 1974;
current - November 30, 1976.



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 8 pages
9.         The largest component of the project, the paving program, has ex-
perienced considerable cost increases and is still experiencing delays. The
Ministry of Public Works has taken many steps (approved by the Bank) which
have reduced, although not avoided, delays and contractor bankruptcies. Due
to cost increases, the Bank's participation in the paving program has been
reduced to 15 percent. The status of the other components of the project
is more satisfactory.
Ln No. 681 Chivor Hidroelectric Power; US$52.8 million, June 1970.
Closing date: June 30, 1977.
10.        The Chivor Hydroelectric Project is expected to be put into ser-
vice in June 1975, six months behind schedule. The project's foreign and
total costs are expected to be 35 percent higher than originally estimated.
Because the shareholders have not made their financial contribution to ISA
when due, ISA has not been able to pay its contractors on time. Another
problem facing ISA is the present ownership of its capital stock, which
permits three of the four shareholders holding individually more than 25
percent of the shares to block any resolution requiring a 75 percent majority.
The Bank is seriously concerned abbut ISA's financial situation. The
Government has now formulated a plan of near term action which is expected to
shortly restore ISA's financial viability.
Ln No. 682 Cali Water Supply and Sewerage; US$18.5 million, June 1970.
Closing date: original - June 30, 1974;
current - December 31, 1975.
11.        As of September 30, 1974, about 42 percent of the loan amount was
disbursed. Disbursements were delayed due to a late project start, but the
entire project is under execution, and it is expected that construction
activities will be finished by June 1975.
Ln No. 738 Palmira Water Supply and Sewerage; US$2 million, May 1971.
Closing date: March 1, 1975.
12.        As of September 30, 1974, about 40 percent of the loan amount was
disbursed. Disbursements were delayed due to initial management and fiscal
problems. A financial crisis in early 1973 has now been resolved through
higher tariffs and tight budget control. Construction is expected to be
terminated in late 1975.
Ln No. 739 Land Settlement Caqueta I; US$8.1 million, May 1971.
Closing date: April 30, 1975.
13.        Because of considerable price increases and unexpectedly difficult
physical problems, project objectives were reduced to about 70 percent of
appraisal targets in August 1973, halfway through the project period. Since
then, the livestock credit program has picked up speed so that the revised
goal for this component should be achieved ahead of time. On the other hand,
the road construction program has fallen behind schedule so far that not

Page 6 of 8 pages
enough time remains to catch up, even with an accelerated work pace. Despite
these problems, the project is making a substantial contribution to the suc-
cessful colonization of the Caqueta area. A second-phase project was ap-
praised in February 1974.
Ln No. 740 Telecommunications II; US$15 million, May 1971.
Closing date: June 30, 1975.
14.        Due to initial delays in the procurement of project equipment, a
slippage of about one year in the completion date of some works on the
project is now anticipated.
Ln No. 741 Water Supply (Bogota II); US$88 million, May 1971.
Closing date: June 30, 1978.
15.        Disbursements up to September 30, 1974 amounted to 17 percent of
this loan, only 42 percent of the appraisal estimate. Slow progress in the
construction of the vital Palacio - Rio Blanco Tunnel is the main reason for
the project's delay; the orevious foreign contractor has been replaced
by another firm. EAAB's financial situation was weak, but important mea-
sures to improve it have been taken by the Empresa.
Ln No. 742 Development Finance Companies IV: US$40 million, May 1971.
Closing date: December 31, 1974.
16.        This loan is fully committed.  Disbursements are ahead of schedule.
The Borrowers will soon request postponement of the Closing Date.
Ln No. 842 Development Program and Export Expansion Project; US$ 60 million,
June 1972. Closing date: December 31, 1974.
17.        The US$10 million DFC portion of this program loan is now almost
fully committed. The last subproject which will utilize the unallocated
balance of the loan (US$943,000) was oresented to the Bak before the final date for sub-
project submission September 30, 1974, and is now under review. Disburse-
ments are proceeding satisfactorily and amounted to US$5.2 million as of
October 31, 1974. However, itwiUl be necessary to extend the present clos-
ing date of December 31, 1974 to allow commitments to be fully disbursed.
Ln No. 849 Irrigation (Atlantico II), US$5 million, June 1972.
Closing date: March 31, 1978.
18.        Construction of drainage facilities is lagging far behind schedule
primarily due to the poor performance of the contractor having the major re-
sponsibility for the drain construction financed under this loan. Steps are
being taken to either force compliance with the contract or replace the con-
tractor with another. With the high world prices of livestock products, it
appears that more of the project area will be devoted to combination cattle
feeding and milk production than was previously envisaged. The returns per
ha from such enterprises will not differ too much from the field crops
originally contemplated.

La No. 860 Medium-Size Cities Water Supply and Sewerage Project;
US$9.1 million, October 1972. Closing date: September 30, 1976.
19.        As of September 30, 1974, about 6 percent of the loan amount was
disbursed. Disbursements were delayed due to initial serious management pro-
blems. Lower demand than estimated has prompted investment reprogramming and
it is expected that-construction activities will not be finished until 1979.-
Ln No. 874 Guatape II Hydroelectric Power Project; US$56 million,
January 1973.  Closing date:   December 31, 1978.
20.        The progress of the work is generally satisfactory except for delays
in the resettlement of El Penol and Guatape villages, which will make-it' difA
ficult to start filling the Santa Rita reservoir before mid-1977, two years    ;-
behind schedule.  If filling of the reservoir does not begin in mid-1976,
an energy deficit in the interconnected system of at least 10 percent fromi
1978 to 1981 is expected. The revised project cost estimate (US$119.2 mil-
lion) is 21.3 percent above appraisal estimates, mainly due to higher costs
of the works at El Penol and Guatape. EPM has failed to achieve the 9 per-
cent rate of return required under the Loan Agreement and it has fallen
behind in its payments to ISA, thus contributing to the problems experienced
by the latter (see Loan 681). The Bank is seriously concerned about EPM's
financial situation which is expected to be adequately improved soon by a
substantial increase in EPM's electricity tariffs.

Closing date: June 30, 1977.
21.        Commitments of the loan were interrupted for several months this
year pending agreement on a revised interest rate. Commitments are proceeding
well, and it is expected that the balance of US$27.2 million unallocated at
October 31, 1974, will be fully committed early in 1975. Currently, loan
applications pending approval exceed the unallocated funds available. Disburse-
ments are still behind schedule, but in view of the rapid rate of commitment,
they should be completed by the closing date, June 30, 1977.
Ln No. 920 Education III; US$21.2 million, July 1973.
Closing date: June 30, 1977.
22.        This loan became effective on January 9, 1974.   Shortage of counter-
part funds delayed to September 1974 the opening of construction bids for the
first 22 project institutions.   Construction works are expected to proceed
smoothly by April 1975. Procurement of teaching equipment has been progressing
satisfactorily and 60 percent of the purchase orders have been placed. Im-
plementation of the technical teacher training program is expected to commence
within the next six months.   Various studies for the sector analysis are also
expected to begin within the next four months.

Ln No. 926 Sixth Railway Project; US$25 million, August 1973.
Closing date: June 30, 1976.
23.        Implementation of CNR's Investment Plan is progressing satisfac-
torily; track rehabilitation and maintenance, together with workshop produc-
tion, continue to improve. Project objectives probably will have to be reduced
by 35 percent because of the large increase in the price of materials. CNR's
financial picture has continued to improve because of increased traffic and
tariffs. However, the Government's recent emergency program, which intends
to halt imports of wheat, will have a serious adverse impact on that traffic
between Santa Marta and Bogota. The Government's performance under the fi-
nancial provisions of the Guarantee Agreement was satisfactory to the end'of
J=e but subsequently has been inadequate. The matter is currently under
review.

Financing Plan:             The financing plan includes US$11.24 mil-lion
of works not related to the project to be
carried out by the Empresas and acuas during
the construction period (1975-79). It also
includes an increase in the working capital
of the empresas of US$3.40 million. This
brings the total need for funds to US$67.54
million. Of this amount, US$27 million will
be provided by the proposed Bank loan, US$16.54
million would be provided as a Government
grant for onlending by INSFOPAL, US$19.02
million from the net internal cash generation
of the empresas, and US$4.98 million from an
industrial complex in Cartagena.

preference (customs duties are substantially
higher) would be allowed for equipment manu-
factured in Colombia.
