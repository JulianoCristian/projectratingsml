The key lessons learned\n            from this project include: 1) Rural electrification program\n            must be financially sustainable and the implementing\n            organization must be financially accountable. 2) Holding\n            management accountable for financial performance down to\n            region and branch levels is required to increase cost\n            efficiency of RE services. 3) Productive uses promotion was\n            effective in increasing economic benefits and revenues. 4)\n            Electricity consumption by key consuming categories must be\n            included as Key Performance Indicators as this is a better\n            indicator of benefits from a project, rather than just the\n            number of connections made. 5) Centralized project\n            management was effective in monitoring progress but less\n            effective in directing change. 6) Complex procurement\n            procedures cause implementation delays and inefficiencies.\n            7) Management commitment supported by timely, accurate and\n            accessible information is essential for effective management\n            and increasing the efficiency of rural electrification."}, "docdt": "2000-09-11T00:00:00Z"}
