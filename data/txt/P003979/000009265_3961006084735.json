     will support the development and implementation of an\n            efficient Rural Electrification (RE) program in Indonesia\n            and consists of two components, for the State Electricity\n            Corporation (PLN) and the Ministry of Cooperatives and Small\n            Enterprises Development (MOC). The PLN component includes:\n            (a) electrification of 7000 rural villages in the second and\n            third years of Repelita VI; (b) economic subtransmission\n            schemes aimed at promoting private sector participation in\n            small scale generation by interconnecting captive power\n            plants, cogeneration plants and other small power producers;\n            (c) development of five mini-hydro power projects; (d) pilot\n            projects to test the adaptability of low cost \"low\n            tech\" equipment designs, low cost network reticulation\n            designs and more efficient construction management methods\n            for full scale implementation at a subsequent stage; and (e)\n            expansion of the ongoing rural business services component\n            to promote productive uses of electricity, including the\n            participation of the nongovernmental organizations; and (f)\n            provide technical assistance for systems planning capability\n            and institutional reform. The MOC component include: (a)\n            implementation support for expansion of schemes of local\n            participation by village level cooperatives and\n            organizations in power distribution related activities; and\n            (b) preparation of up to two geographic areas for possible\n            conversion to a \"Pola III\" mode of organization,\n            wherein responsibility for all distribution functions\n            include ownership of assets is transferred from PLN to a\n            third party."}, "docdt": "1995-02-03T00:00:00Z"}
