                   Support for Poor and DisadvantagedAreas Project (SPADA)
                                              InAceh and Nias

I.TheProject


1.       The earthquakes and tsunamis which struck Indonesia and several other countries in the Indian
Ocean region on December 26, 2004, resulted in one of the worst natural disasters in recorded human
history. Across Indonesia, Aceh and Nias bore the major brunt of the disasters. In addition, another
earthquake struck Nias on March 28,2005, killed more than 700 people, leveled or badly damaged some
10,000-12,000 houses, and significantly changed the very physical layout of the island.

2.       Community-based recovery planning has been at the core of the AcehMias reconstruction
planning process virtually since the disaster struck on December 26, 2004. It is not difficult to understand
why. Global as well as Indonesian experience show that community-based recovery strategies are under
most circumstances quicker, involve more affected people in their own recovery, and are more likely to
leadto sustainable solutions than top-down strategies can achieve.

3.       Community driven and other participatory approaches to development planning are also likely to
promote local solutions to problems of social conflict, which is extremely common in reconstruction
situations where differential damages translate into different entitlements. Studies elsewhere in Indonesia
document that community-level negotiations can overcome the most common sources of conflict, and
conflict-sensitive reconstruction planning can help ensure that in most cases, other, incipient sources of
conflicts are monitored and mitigated.

4.       However, community-based approaches also have their limitations. For conflict affected regions
of Indonesia, the role of district authorities in arbitrating disputes and deploying authority is critical.
Following Indonesia's "big bang" decentralization over 2002-2005, the role of district line agencies and
planning bodies is fundamental for development service delivery. How, then, to link up the positive
lessons of community-based planning with the technical and administrative regime of decentralized
district government?

5.       The purpose of the proposedSupport for Poor and DisadvantagedAreas Project
InAceh andNias (SPADA Aceh) project is to provide amechanismby which participatory planning
procedurescan be incorporatedinto district government-decisionmaking. The project will deliver
significant quantitiesof economic infrastructure and improved social services to recovering areas, and it
will allow for an extended public discussion of long-term recovery planning across Aceh. The objectives
of the project are to strengthengovernance, promote growth and improve service delivery in participating
provinces and participating districts, and support the recovery of affected areasthrough (a) strengthening
of local participation in development planning; (b) promotion of private investment andjob creation; and
(c) an increase in the utilization of effective education health and dispute resolution services.

6.       Although SPADA Aceh is intendedto support the BRR's reconstructionplan for the tsunami
areas of Aceh, the project is also closely linkedto a large program of World Bank support to Indonesia's
100poorest kabupatenthat was prepared in 2004 and negotiatedin May 2005. The objective of this
project is to build on the participatory processes put inplace through the national Kecamatan
Development Project and other successful community development projects to align bottom-up planning
procedureswith the newly empowered district governmentsof Indonesia.




                                                       1

7.       The project's design solves three particularlychallengingproblems for supporters of local level
development management.First, while community development projects such as KDP work for building
small-scale infrastructure such as farm roads, primaryschools, and simple irrigationsystems, they are not
suitable for projectsthat require more technical input or long-termnetworkplanning, such as larger,
secondary infrastructure, teachertraining, or healthdiagnostics. Second, for local projects to be
sustainable,they must fit into local government planningandbudget support. Aceh's reconstructionfor
the moment is benefitingfrom the large-scaledonor presence, but for the longer term development will be
plannedand managedby district governments empoweredby Indonesia's decentralization laws.Third,
while community development projectshavea goodtrack recordof deliveringhighquality infrastructure
and services to villages, alltoo often the economic environment that they work in remains highly
distorted inways that block localtrade and growth amongthe poor.

8.       The design, therefore, is intendedto eventually supersede KDP by anchoringbottom-up planning
in local government institutions.The projectdesignaddresses all three problems identifiedabove. It
provides a link so that community andkecamatanproposalsthat are too large or complex for KDPhavea
mechanismso that they can feed intokabupatendecision making. The project also provides a strongrole
for local government agenciesbothby making local governmentschair the decision-making body that
reviewsproposalsand by providingincentivesfor technical agenciesto collaborate with kecamatan
representatives.Third, SPADA providesbothanalyticalwork on local trade distortionsand a large
investmentcomponentto help local governmentsrehabilitateor upgradebasic productiveinfrastructure.

9.       Becausevirtually all o fthe poor kabupatenwhere SPADA works inIndonesiaare also
characterizedby highlevels of local conflict, SPADA's design includes a number o factivities intendedto
promote peace-building, reconciliation,and local re-development.The appraisal includedclose attention
to developinga programo f post conflict activitiesthat would support the government's effortsto provide
a post-MOUre-developmentprogramfor the areas o f Aceh affected notjust by the tsunami, but by
conflict.

10.      Evenbefore the tsunami, SPADA was already programmedto launchpreparationin five o fthe
poorest districts.Followingthe tsunami andthe establishment ofthe BRR, the governmentaccelerated
SPADA's launchpreparation. Indonesia's national parliament(DPR) reviewedthe overall SPADA
project in early September 2005, andproposedthat the projectbe expandedto cover all 17 kabupaten
includingtwo kabupateninNias. The Governmenthas also asked that SPADA's programsfor post-
conflict reintegration anddevelopment be substantially strengthenedfor Aceh. These include damage and
vulnerability assessments, support for localjustice sector reform, andpracticaltrainingto help local
governments mediateconflict successfully.

11.     The BRR's medium-term strategy for the reconstructionandrehabilitationof Aceh Nias is based
on four main priorities: (a) strengthen local government; (b) institutionalize participatory planning; (c)
promote MDG achievement in Aceh and Nias; and (d) support institutions for social justice and
community rebuilding. Funds will require closer integrationand co-financing, where feasible, between
the MDTF, local governmentsand the BRR.

12.      SPADA's design fits with the BRR reconstruction strategy and supports BRR's exit strategy in
2009. BRR's 2005 assessment o f the current status o f reconstructionshowedthat:

        Remaining resources should be predominantly used for the reconstruction and development
        broadly defined, at the community level and at the districtlprovincial level. The reconstruction
        and development should be closely matchedwith capacity-buildingefforts for local governments
        (through a "learning by doing" approach) and community participation for enhanced governance
        to preparefor the BRR's exit in2009.


                                                      2

     0   Though the initial focus will be on the areas most heavily damaged by the tsunami and
         earthquake (with a particular focus on Nias), infrastructure support and related capacity-building
         should be gradually extended to other districts of Aceh with less severe tsunami-relateddamage
         but where years of conflict and associated poverty have also damaged basic infrastructure or
         preventedadequatedevelopment of infrastructure conducive to the further economic development
         necessary for a sustainable peace.

Donor coordination

13.      Ina large, comprehensive projectsuch as this one, ensuringthat projectactivitiesdo not replicate
or contradict similar programs supportedby other donors is key.SPADA is usinga number of
mechanismsto minimizeoverlap, maximizecoordination with donors and government agencies,and
identify opportunitiesto work cooperatively with other programsthat are contributingto Aceh andNias
recovery.The following sections summarize the general strategy.

overview ofthe entire projectso that they can assess where convergenceor overlap wouldbe most likely
to occur. But an equally importantpurpose was for them to identify existingsuccessful donor funded
projects that could be extendedto SPADA-Aceh/Nias. The projectappraisalteam included
representativesfrom the major donor agencies.

15.      The secondmajor mechanismto support donor coordinationis the proposedplanningprocessthat
defines the project.BecauseSPADA is based inthe Bappeda, it sits at the center o f where donor
coordination shouldhappen. SPADA contracting and activitiesare nearly all locatedwithin the kabupaten
itself, which means that projectactivitiesdo not face the normalproblems of higher levelcontract
commitmentsthat cannot be changed. Ifa different donor already has an operating program in place, the
kabupatencan re-allocate SPADA funds to other priority activities.

16.      The third major mechanismlies inthe domainofthe project's transparency policy.Donor
duplicationanddouble dippingoften takes place because informationis missing, whether deliberately or
simply because informationis not easy to come by. SPADA Aceh builds on KDP's experienceto promote
broad-basedinformationsharing. BecauseSPADA is coordinatedthrough each district's planningboard,
proposalscomingto the district forum can be discussedin a multistakeholder forum before final decisions
are made by the representatives.

ProjectComponents

17.     The total proposedprojectcosts for SPADA is US$37.07 million. Fundingof US$22.47 will
come through an MDTF grant, and the remaining $14.6 million will be providedby Go1from its national
funding, all of which will be usedto fillout the block grants. The MDF grant consists ofthe following
components andactivities:

        Component A: District Grants (US$ 12.76 million). The purposeof the district grants is to
        support larger or moretechnical proposalsemerging fromthe subdistrict planningprocessthat
        also contribute to reconstruction, cooperation, and development. Projects are selectedby the
        district development forum on a quarterly basis usingcriteriathat include demonstrablebroad-
        basedbenefits, cost and local contribution,andtheir technical andfinancial feasibility.Projects
        that benefit morethan one subdistrict are favoredby the scoring system, but there is no absolute
        rulerequiringthis. For the first two years ofthe project, the maximum size o f an individual
        proposal is US$50,000 (a procedure was developed for its operationalmanualto allow exceptions


                                                     3

in special cases).Subdistricts are encouragedto partnertheir proposalswith lineagency or NGO
funding. Thirty percentofthe district grant is reservedto support quality improvements in health
and education. Bothsectors have developedpre-definedpositivelistsof eligible activities.
Resultsfrom the quarterly meetingsare published in localnewspapers.

The projectis budgetedto cover all 17 kabupatensinAceh and, after detailed assessment during
the appraisalthe governmentproposedto addthe two kabupatensinNias. District grant amounts
beginat an aggregate o fRps. 3.0 billion (approx. US$300,000) inthe project's first year. Each
year an independentaudit commissionedby the nationalmanagementunit under TORS              '


acceptableto BRR, reviews the physicaland financial performance of the grants. Satisfactory
performance allows the size ofthe district grant to increase by an additionalbillion rupiah, up to a
maximum o f 8.0 billion rupiahinthe project'sfinal year. Districtsreceivinga qualifiedaudit are
demotedto Rps. 1 billionuntilthe qualificationshavebeenlifted. Districtsthat do not fix the
problems after a reasonableperiodwill be droppedfrom the program.Finalappraisal for this
proposalwill verify the budget amounts and also explore options for counterpartfund
contributionsinthe project's later years.

Proposalsthat are approvedby the forum are passedover to the Project ImplementingUnit. This
managementunit is supportedby the financialmanagementand procurement specialist as well as
relevant membersof the district line agencies.Project proponentsmust form a three-person
project implementationteam per approvedproposalto supervise projectimplementationand to
provideaccountabilityreportsto the PMUandthe sponsoring forum.These teams are madeup of
representativesofthe project's proponent and a technicalspecialist. The PMUreviewsthe
detailedprojectproposal, cost estimate, implementationprocedures, and implementationteam
beforetenderingthe contract. Project implementationis independentlymonitoredby a monitoring
unit attachedto the district forum, and by localNGOsthat are contracted for that purpose.

ComponentB: CapacityDevelopmentPlanningGrants (US%1.16 million). SPADA is
working in districts and subdistricts o fextremely low capacity. They require a substantial
investmentin improvingthe capacity of local stakeholders. SPADA tackles capacity questions
through a combinationoftraining, practicalexercises, professionaltechnicalsupport, and by
developing learningnetworks. It is expectedthat, as defined below, SPADA will partner with
pre-existingdonor programs such as USAID's LocalGovernment Support Project.Additional
technicalcapacity support providedto localgovernments andthe communitiesthrough SPADA
includehealthand education diagnostics, support for the privatesector forums, andtraining
district legislators inpublicexpenditureanalysis and formulation. At the local level, SPADA will
work closely with the AusAid programto provide supportto kecamatangovernments. The project
will also fund support to the provincialgovernment, particularlyfor monitoringprogress on
improvinglocal investmentclimates.

Projectappraisalhas identifieda potentialmechanismby which local governments can screen
capacity programsalready underway inAceh that are funded by other donors. Rather than launch
and develop entirelynew programs, SPADA couldthen approacha donor to amend its program
to cover SPADA areas. The technicalmechanismsfor such an approachare relatively simple; the
challenge is findingthe appropriate fiscal transfer system, which would have,tobe ready prior to
negotiation.However, sucha systemwould be very desirable, It would make capacity work
entirely demand-driven, and it would be an excellent way to coordinate the many donor capacity
programsalready operating inAceh.

This component also includesseveralactivitiesspecificallyrelatedto post-conflictreintegration.
The two key features o fthe law and alternative dispute resolutionprogramare a programof

  facilitated mediation and court referrals so that disputes can be resolvedpeacefully; and a
  provincial and district working group that involves representativesfrom the police, the Attorney
  General's office, the Ministry of Home Affairs, and legal NGOs. Smaller pilot programsthat
  work to develop community-basedreconciliation activities, youth employment and other
  incentivesto promote nonviolent dialogue, and pilot work on community-based land mapping for
  dispute resolution will be launchedinthe project's second and third operational year.

  Component C: ImplementationSupport ($8.14 million) SPADA includes three major types                                                                                                                                                                                                  --
  of implementation support. The different levels of government are backedby a technical
  assistance structurethat includesanational management team, an oversight and monitoring unit
  ineach province, and amulti sectoralsupportteam ineach participating district. Linked to this
  management structure is a recruited procurement consultant, who will work with the
  procurement committee to manage procurement during the project's startup period and gradually
  hand over procurement functions to local counterpartswho complete a certification and internship
  program. The second consists of the technically specializedservices neededto carry out baseline
  inventories, investmentclimate surveys, and needs assessments, deliver the educational and
  health services, and to provide training and operationalsupport for an alternative dispute
  resolution program. The third type of implementation support covers programs for information
  dissemination, includingradio and public awareness programsthat address issues relatedto
  reconciliation.

  Component D: Monitoring, Evaluation,and Studies($0.41 million). SPADA requires a
  sophisticated system for monitoringand evaluation(see Annex 2 for more detail). Project
  managers needto know inmore than casual ways whether the project is on course and whether
  interventions are having their desiredeffect. But more than inmost project designs, policy makers
  also needto know more about how to deal effectively with conflict and recovery. The core ofthis
  component is a package of quantitative and qualitative baseline and intermediate surveys and case
  analyses that can track impacts due to project interventions. This category also includes programs
  for conflict resolution that show promise but should be pilotedon a two or three province scale
  before expandingacrossthe conflict regions, such as community land mapping or options for
  community based trauma recovery. $0.2 million is budgetedfor independentaudits that will
  begin inthe project's second year.

Institutional and ImplementationArrangements

18.     All components of SPADA support the same bottom-up facilitatedplanningprocessto identify
andprioritize perceivedreconstructionneeds.Subdistrict and district decision forums will identify these
inthe form of results (Le. childrenvaccinated, bridges rebuilt, etc). There are, however, different ways to
respondto these needs once they are identified.For simple infrastructure, grants given directly to
communities are sufficientfor small works and simple services. For healthandeducationservices,
communities may be clear about the resultsthey want, but specialized advice andoversightwill be
neededto help identify the activitieswhich wouldbringabout those results. For bigger subprojects that
benefit larger groups, proposalsmust receiveatechnical verificationbeforethey are contractedout to
qualifiedcontractors.

19.      SPADA's planningandimplementationframework are built around Indonesia'sformal bottom-up
planningprocess.That is, all ofthe planninganddecision makingunits -- village councils, inter-village
fora, districtplanning boards etc --are part of Indonesia'sformal administration.However,under
SPADA, each level is enrichedwith various mechanismsintendedto provide additionalparticipationand
technical support to planningand implementation.These are explainedbelow.

20.     National Government. Bappenasis the overallproject managingunit.BRR will be the
executingagency for SPADA's blockgrants and will receivethe overallbudget, but implementationwill
be throughthe Ministry o f DisadvantagedAreas, which is the executingagency for all ofthe technical
assistance and implementation support providedthroughthe project.The Ministry will issuethe General
Guideline(PedomanUmum)and an OperationalManual(Juklak) for the project.Bothhave been
reviewedby IDA andwill be issuedbefore effectiveness.To providepolicy advice, solve implementation
bottlenecks, and ensurethat results from SPADA are monitoredandfed back into policy, the Ministry o f
DisadvantagedAreas will also chair a coordinating committee that includes the Ministriesof Home
Affairs, Bappenas, andFinance.

21.     Province. BRRwill form a coordination committeethat is responsiblefor overallproject
supervision, technical oversight, andevaluation. This functionwill eventually moveto the provincial
planningboard (Bappeda). All SPADA funds are recordedinthe provincialbooks, butthey do not enter
provincialaccounts, proceedingdirectlyto the districtsor subdistricts.

22.     District. The policyanddecision-makingbody for SPADA at the district level is the district
planningcommittee. This body is made of representatives selectedfrom each subdistrict forum, and is
chaired by the headofthe districtplanningboard.Nonvotingrepresentativesfrom NGOs, the private
sector, and citizengroups are invited.Eachplanningcommittee is supported by a projectsecretariat that
synthesizesthe technical inputs providedby the sectoralassessments, andalso manages detailed designs
and contracting (Figure 1 providesan overview ofthe overall implementation design). Once designs are
finished, subprojects are contractedout throughprojectimplementationteams made of the relevant
executingagency andthe projectproponent, supportedby the procurement specialist

23.      Subdistrict Fora (FAD) also knownas Forum Antar Desa, or FAD, are made ofthe elected
representatives from eachvillage council, plus a number o frespectedleaderswho are selected in the
beginning o fthe planning cycle. InAceh, KDP now covers every kecamataninthe province; alongwith a
number of NGOs, kecamatansare receivingan intensiveprogram in capacity development.For KDP,
each subdistrict is supportedby an experienced consultant who disseminates projectrules, provides basic
trainingin book-keepingandfinancialmanagement,andhelps implement the referralsystemthat passes
proposals from the subdistrict to the district.KDP will collaborate with the SPADA team to transparently
select the kabupatenrepresentatives and to ensurethat proposalstoo large for KDP are referred upwards
to the kabupatenboard.

24.      Private sector involvement.To providea mechanismfor introducingprivatesector priorities
intothe planningcycle, SPADA facilitatorswill form subdistrict and district businessfocus groups using
a methodology developedandtestedduringprojectappraisal.Basedon focus group discussions, business
foraproposepublic economic activities, goods andregulatory reformsthat would remove constraints on
investment. Proposals are submitted to the subdistrictfora ("FAD' inthe diagram), where they are
evaluatedusingthe same criteriaas everyoneelse's proposal(contributionto rebuildingand
reconciliation,poverty benefitsetc) Proposalslikely to be too large for subdistricts are passedup to the
district business fora for approval and prioritization.(Regulatory reformsproposedby the business forum
go to the district parliamentand Bupati).Figure 2 describesthis process.The selectedprojects are then
verified by the district technical verificationteam, which is supported by experienced privatesector
engineers andprocurement specialists.

25.      Finalizedproposalscan then be cosponsoredthrough a subdistrict fora SPADA grant, or else
forwardedto other fundingsources available inthe district or province. All contractingand cost
informationis sharedwith the businessforum, which must form its own projectoversight team as part of
project implementationfor its proposals which are approved.

26.      Education. Sub-( istrict educationant. ..salth working groups wil be established or
strengthened ifalready existing). The role ofthese bodies is toprioritize the needs and provide technical
recommendationsto the decision-making forums at the respective levels. Sub-district and district
decision-makingforums are shared with other SPADA components.These decision-making forums will
receive recommendationsand technical support from the sub-district educationworking group and district
school boardduring their deliberations over which proposalsto fund.

27.      The sub-district educationand healthworking groups will compile proposals and prioritizethem
basedon needs. This working group will also create sub-district education and health proposalsthat
addresses issues proposedby multiple schools or clinics and which could be combined as one proposalto
achieve economies of scale and resourcepooling (e.g. teacher or midwife training, etc). Prior to the
decision-makingsubdistrict meeting, verification teams will review all proposals. District verification
teams will verify sub-district proposals, and ateam from the province will verify proposals going to the
district (see Figure 3).

28.      Most health proposalswill require technical support. Inthese cases contracts will be awardedto
NGOs, private professionals, etc. The implementation team will include at least one local government
sectoral official. Contracts will be signed by the implementation team and held by the procurement unit at
the respectivelevels. Grants can also be usedto provide incentive paymentsto government providers, but
government agencies cannot be contractedto provide services for which they are already paid. The sub-
district educationand healthworking groups and the district educationand health committees will serve
as an advisory body when the implementation teams needtechnical advice.

Project Appraisal Process

29.     Documents that were reviewed by the appraisal team include:

    a) Project fund flow mechanism
    b) Operational Manuals
    c) TOR and tender documents for technical assistance
    d) TOR for procurement and financial management advisers
    e)  Procurement plan
    f ) Summary budgets
    g) Anti-corruption action plan
    h) Monitoring and Evaluation framework
    i)  Environmental and Social Impact mitigation framework
    j)  Financial management risk assessmentand mitigation plan

30.     SPADA preparation inAceh began in June, 2005. Preparation activities included mapping o f
social economic situation, social tensiodconflict, resources ( material, human capacity, CSOs ,NGOs
etc..)and local government capacity assessments. Preparationalso mapped out donor funded district
governance support programs.

3 1.    Project appraisal conducted on May 22 -27,2006 verified the project's institutional and
fiduciary design, evaluated the readiness o f local government and other stakeholders, and completed
economic analysis. Five areas proposed by MDTF for appraisal review were:

    (a)     SPADA coverage areas -Appraisal confirmed BRR's request for SPADA coverage of all
            Aceh and Nias kabupaten. MDTF subsequently confirmed that based on BRRs policy
            decision o f June, 2006 that all o f Aceh qualified as affected areas, the appraised scope of the
            project was acceptable.

    (b)     Governancecapacity programs-Rather than design and tender an entirely new program
            for local government capacity work, SPADA will collaborate with the already active,


                                                              9

           successful Local GovernanceSupport Program(LGSP), which is managedby USAID.
           LGSPwill expandtheir coverageto SPADA districtsand sectors.The fundflow optionfor
           doingthis is through a free-standinggrant to the USAID.

           Institutional management-Appraisal confirmed that BRR will be the executingagency for
           SPADA AcehMias. For disbursingblock grants, BRR will releasefunds to the districts
           directly from the "KPKN khusus", the specialtreasury branchset upto support Aceh
           reconstruction.For technical assistance contracts, BRR will transfer funds to the Ministry of
           DisadvantagedAreas, which holds the TA contracts for the nationalSPADA program.
           Oversight will be through a nationalcoordinating committee chairedby BRR and including
           all agenciesparticipatingin SPADA. Appraisal also confirmed that these arrangements are
           acceptableto Bappenas, MOF, andMinistry o fDisadvantagedAreas.

           Vulnerable groups -Appraisal confirmedthe gender action program, which will work in
          tandem with other Acehnese gender programssupportedby BRRand DSF. DFID is co-
           financingSPADA with an approximately $11million grant to support post conflict and
           livelihoodactivities,ofwhich some 60% support vulnerable groups.

           Financing plan-Appraisalconfirmedthe detailedbudgetstructure andfinancingplanfor
           the project. MDTF will provide $22.47 million andBRR $14.6 million. MDTF support is
           frontloaded.Localgovernment funds are expectedto become increasingly available in the
           project's outer years as sources suchas specialautonomy funds, revenuesharing funds,
           DAU, and emergency funds providedfrom the national budget.

RiskAssessment

32. SPADA will not be an easy projectto implement While a full-scalerisk assessment was carried out
   duringthe appraisalofthe nationalprojectand is available on file, three particularrisks associated
   with the SPADA Acemias projectshould be flagged for managementreview and longterm
   monitoring:

   a.      Institutional weaknesses -The Ministry of DisadvantagedAreas is a newly restructured
           mandate.Ithas a special mandateto develop programs such as SPADA.However, the
           ministrylacks experience and it is also vulnerable to internal capture.Furthermore, the
           parliament's decisionto transfer all Aceh budgets to BRR rather thantheir executingagency,
           whichthen requires an extra stepto transfer budget over to them, introduces an extra levelof
           complexity.The projectteam and Bappenashave discussedthis risk. Should performancenot
           be satisfactory, the project will be movedto HomeAffairs, which is already the homeo f
           KDP.

   b.     Post-conflict-Aceh is benefitingfrom a truce betweenthe Government andthe FreeAceh
          movement(GAM), which broughtto an end 30 years of armedconflict.However,the peace
          agreement is fragile and the reintegrationagency createdby the government to supervise its
           implementationis exceedingly weak. As a result, expectations for a peace dividendare high
          while the government's ability to deliver one is low. Complicatingthis landscapestill further
          are the upcominglocal elections requiredby the peace agreement. GAM will field candidates,
          and it is likely that they will win a substantial share of the vote. To address this risk, DFID is
          providingSPADA with a parallelgrant specificallyto support post conflict reintegrationand
          development.The Bank will providetechnical support to the BRA (the reintegrationagency)
          and provide hands-onhelpto the overallM&E effort that assesses progress on reintegration.



                                                    10

c.   Corruption and the breakdownof localgovernance-OverallcorruptionrisksinAceh are
    very high. They are beingcompoundedby the suddeninflux of bothformer combatants who
     havethe means and interest incapturingdevelopment funds, andalso by the dramatic
     increase inlocal revenues introducedthrough the decentralizationand local autonomy
     program.As documentedby the Bank's 2006 Aceh andNias public expenditure review, large
     sums o fmoney are poolingin local government budgets,which lackthe capacity to disburse
    them. Donor programs for capacity strengtheningare already underway, but the risks remain
    high. SPADA will include extra Bank oversight from its Aceh office to ensurethat the anti
    corruptionaction planis fully implemented.

d.  ProcurementImplementationArrangements -Procurement arrangements for the Support
     for Poor and DisadvantagedAreas Project inAceh andNias consist o f selection o f
     consultants, andprocuremento fsimple goods and works under the district grants. The
     selection of all consultant services for the project is the responsibilityo fKPDT.The
     channeling o fthe district grants and assistingthe district governments on project
     implementationmatters (includingprocurementsupport) is the responsibilityo fthe BRR.
     The district governments will be responsiblefor carryingout procurementunder the district
    grants, with assistance andguidance from BRR. BRR is also responsiblefor assuringfor
    upgradingthe capacity of district governments in carryingout procurement.

e.  FinancialManagementand DisbursementArrangement. The project has a major risk on
    district grants implementation, particularlyon how effectivelygrant beneficiaries use and
    account for the funds that have beenusedfor intendedpurposes.There is another risk with
    the capacity of local government (PIU) to manage the project implementation. Some risk
    mitigationsteps havebeenproposed,as follows:

     e   To provide technical assistancesto the PMUandPIU;
     e   To providetechnical assistance to local implementationteams (TPK) who executesub-
         projectactivity;
         To provide independentmonitoringby a monitoringunit attachedto the districtforum by
         local NGOs andjournalistthat are contractedfor that purpose;
     e   To link externalaudit resultsto further allocationo fthe sub-grants ;
     0   To conduct internaland performanceaudit to the projectimplementation; and
         Annual financialstatement will be auditedby auditor acceptableto the Bank.Inthis case,
         BPKP would be considered acceptable.

    Overall, the project financial management risk is assessed as being High risk. This
    assessment has concluded that with the implementation of the action plan, the risks will be
    substantially mitigated, and the proposedfinancialmanagementarrangements will satisfy the
    Bank's minimum requirements under OP/BP10.02 and are adequate to provide, with
    reasonable assurance, accurate and timely informationon the status of the grant required by
    the Bank. More details of the financialmanagementassessment are given below.

f.  Internal Controls and Internal Audit. The internal audit department of BRR will be
    responsible for reviewing internal controls at PIU and TPK at local level. The internal audit
    manager agreed to include the project activities in the annual audit work plan. The internal
    auditor should conduct a review on internal control system in the implementing unit,
    including payment validation. Copies of these reports should be made available to the Bank
    upon request. The term of reference for such audit will include a check on the substance of
    transaction and direct confirmationthat funds disbursedhave reachedbeneficiaries.



                                               11

g.  External Audit Arrangement. The audit for the financial statement will be carried out by
    an independentauditor acceptableto the Bank. The annualaudit report will be furnished to
    the Bank no later than six months after the endof the government's fiscal year. The audit
    assignmentwill be inaccordancewith the agreedTerms of Reference.The TOR will
    basicallyinclude an assertion on the reliability o fthe project financial statements, and will
    also include a verification of accountinginformationat TPK levelon a sample basis. The
    annualauditedfinancial statementwill include a review andreconciliationof Special
    Account transactions andquarterly IFR.The audit reportswill be made accessible to the
    public.

h.  DisbursementArrangement. The applicable disbursementmethods include: 1) Advance,
    and 2) Reimbursement.The DA will be solely usedto finance eligible project expenditures.
    Although managementofthe DA will be under the responsibilityof DGTreasury MOF, the
    PMUat KPDTwill bethe one responsibleto reconcile the DA andto prepare the application
    for withdrawalfor advances andreportingthe use ofthe DA, duly approvedby DG Treasury
    before their submissionsto the Bank. Copies of the DA's bank statement will be provided to
    the PMUby DGTreasury, MOF.

    The ceilingof the advance to DA will be variable, andthe advance(s) will be made on the
    basis ofthe six monthprojectedexpenditures. At early stage of project implementation an
    initial advance ofthe DA at $ 4 million would suffice. Applicationsfor reportingof use o f
    the DA funds would be supportedby: (i)list paymentsfor contractsunderBank's prior-
    reviewandrecords evidencingsuch expenditures, or (ii)statement of expenditures (SOEs) for
    all other expenses. Applicationsfor the advanceto the DA will consist o f (a) projected
    expenditures for six months; and (b) DA reconciliationstatement.Reporting of use o f DA
    funds and applicationfor an advanceto DA may be submitted in a single application. When
    the PMUhas capable producingthe quarterly InterimFinancialReport (IFR) timely,
    reportingthe use of funds would be basedonthe IFR.

    All documentation for expenditures submitted for disbursement will be retained at the
    implementingunit and shall be made available to the auditors for the annual audit and to the
    Bank and its representatives ifrequested.

1.  Supervision Plan. Supervision of project financial managementwill be performedon a risk-
    basedapproachat leasttwice a year. The supervisionwill reviewthe project'sfinancial
    managementsystem, includingbut not limitedto sub-grant expenditures, accounting,
    reportingand internalcontrol.The financialmanagementsupervisionwill be conducted by
    financial managementspecialist and Bank consultants.

33.      Procurementarrangements.Procurementfor the proposedproject would be carried out in
accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines: ProcurementUnder IBRDLoans and IDA Credits" dated
May 2004; and "Guidelines: Selectionand Employment of Consultantsby World Bank Borrowers" dated
May 2004, and the provisions stipulated inthe MDTF Agreement. The general description of various
items under different expenditurecategory is describedbelow. For each contract to be financed by the
Grant, the different procurementmethods or consultantselectionmethods, estimatedcosts, prior review
requirements, and time frame are agreed betweenthe Recipient andthe Bank project team inthe
ProcurementPlan. The Procurement Plan will be updatedat least annually or as required to reflect the
actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity. At time of this Appraisal,
the detail implementation planunder the district grants has not been identified yet, and therefore, the
activities under the district grants are not includedyet inthe procurement plan. The updated procurement
plan will include these activities once they become available.

34.      Special procurementprovisions.None. The Project will follow the normal procurement
procedures.

35.      Procurementof goods and works:Goods and works under this project will include printing of
materials by KPDT, and goods and works that will be procured by district governments as part of the
district grants'. Individual proposalsto be considered under the district grants would be limited to a
maximum amount of US$ 50,000 equivalent. The district grants per district may be up to US$ 300,000
for the first year, and may be added the following years up to a maximum amount of US$800,000
equivalent at the final year. Works would include rehabilitation and reconstruction works of public
facilities and simple infrastructure. Goods would include any purchase of goods under the district grants.

36.      The procurementwill be done usingthe Bank's Standard BiddingDocuments (SBD) for all ICB
and National SBD agreed with (or satisfactory to) the Bank. The thresholds for procurement methods
applicable for goods and works, as well as the prior review thresholds for goods and works will be
determinedinthe ProcurementPlan. However, inthe meantime, the following thresholds are established
for the initial stage of implementation.

Goods:            ICB for contracts above US$200,000 equivalent
                  NCB for contracts betweenUS$50,000 and US$200,000 equivalent
                  Shopping for contracts below US$50,000 equivalent
                  Prior review for contracts above US$ 100,000 equivalent

Works:            ICB for contracts above US$3,000,000 equivalent
                  NCB for contracts betweenUS$50,000 and US$3,000,000 equivalent
                  Shopping for contracts below US$ 50,000 equivalent

              Three consultantfirms for the following: training consultant, impact study, and identification
              for healthand education programs, for contracts betweenUS$200,000 up to US$450,000
              each);
              Four NGO contracts for the following activities: private sector development, conflict
              resolution, provincial basedmonitoring, and independentjournalist monitoring, with
              individual contract amount from US$100,000 up to US$985,000 equivalent.

38.      The selectionprocess for all consultancy contracts will follow QCBS, except for contracts below
USD200,000, which the selectionmay follow CQS. All agreedselectionmethodwill be defined inthe
approvedprocurement plan.

39.      Assessment of the agency's capacity to implement procurement. The selectionof consultants
and the procurement of printingof materials will be carried out by KPDT, who has prior experience in
carrying out procurement and implementation ofthe Bank financed SPADA Project (LN 52800). District
governmentswill be responsible for carrying our procurementunder district grants. The BRR2will ensure
that capacity exists within the district governmentsto carry out procurement, and will provide the
necessary guidance and assistance to expedite procurement process. Inday to day work, BRR will be
supportedby a Procurement and Financial Management Consultant(financed by this Grant). On
providingprocurementtraining, the BRR will be supportedby Crown Agent (not financed by this Grant).
Procurementtraining materials have been developedby Crown Agent, with severalminor improvements
neededwhich will be completed by the grant effectiveness.

40.      Based on prior experience in interactionswith KPDT, and considering the low capacity of the
district governments incarrying out procurement, coupledwith the BRR's overloadedcapacity in
effectively exercising its role in supervising procurement under the district governments, the following
risks have been identified for the project:

         Corruption and collusive practices: This is a national and systemic issue. This risk is more evident
         inthe process for the selectionof consultants(where subjectivity ofthe procurementcommittee is
         apparent) comparedto the one on the procurement of goods and works.
         Procurementdelays: As currently shown for the implementation of SPADA Project, significant
         procurement delays occur due to (i)non availability of qualified procurementcommittee, and (ii)
         non availability of adequately independentprocurementcommittee who will be able to lead as
         "effective drivers" for the procurementprocess.
         Implementation risk: At the moment, the implementation under the district grants has not been
         identified as such it is very difficult to develop a more strategic and targeted capacity building
         program for the district governments. In addition, the effectiveness of BRR insupervising and
         providingsupport for capacity buildingfor district governments is not apparent.



 Basedonthe currentassessment, none ofthe district governmentsis familiar with proceduresunderBank financed
projects, and no capacity in carrying out procurement.With the assistance from the procurementconsultant, as well
as the DFID financedCrown Agent, BRR is expectedto exercise its role in upgradingthe capacity o f district
governments.

41.    With the above description, the procurementrisk remainsat HIGH.To mitigatethis, the
following actions havebeenincludedas part ofthe projectdesign:

    0  Enhanceddisclosure & monitoringsystem: all informationrelatedto the consultantcontracts
       (includingtheir amount and correspondingdetailprogresspayments, as well as sanctions) will be
       putonthe web-site (www.brr.go.id).Strengthenedcomplainthandlingresolutionis also
       developedwithin the BRRoffice. Monitoringby civil society is also includedinthe project
        design, includingthe independentjournalist monitoring.This kindof system has been
        successfully implementedunder KDP (KecamatanDevelopmentProjects).


    0   Enhancedcapacity:          A procurement consultant(firm) will be hiredat the provinciallevel, and
        which will have staffineach district,to assist BRR in supervisingandprovidinghands on
        assistance to the district governments. In addition, CrownAgent will be hiredby DFID3to
        continue providingassistance to this project, particularlyin assistingBRR in conducting the
        procurementtraining for district governments.

    0   Enhancedcapacity of staff involvedin procurement: Capacity buildingprogramand materials
        have beendevelopedfor staff involvedin procurement, and regular procurementtrainingwill be
        implementedto particularlystaffof district governments.

        To safeguardthe capacity and independenceo f members of procurement committee, it is agreed
       that the qualificationof membersofprocurement committee is establishedas follows:

         a.   General: At least 75% of members are familiar with Keppres 80/2003 as demonstrated by
              their involvementinthe procurement of at least three contract packagesinthe last two years.
              Experience onNCB acceptableto the Bank and on procurement under Bank financed
              projects is an advantage.

         b. For the committee for the selection of consultants, the chairman and 50% o f other members
              havesatisfactory prior experience in dealing with the competitiveselection of consultants
              following Bank Guidelines (Le. selectionmethods other than CQS and SSS) for at least two
              contractpackagesinthe last three years.

         c.   At leastone member is familiar with the GO1budgeting and payment systems, and can play
              a role for facilitatingthe closure of issuesrelatedto these matters, including, ifnecessary,
              obtainingclarificationfrom other relevant agencies such as KPPNofficesMOF,
              BAPPENAS, and auditors.

         d. At least 60% o f membersare experts on the technicalmatters, who havethe knowledge on
              the goods/servicesbeingacquired(for the selection of consultants, these peopleare ones
              who havethe integrity and expertise on the areas of: technicalexpertise for services being
              contracted), or inthe case of procurement o f goods, who havethe knowledge on the
              substance o fthe technicalspecification.More detailedguidanceon this will be defined in
              the Project OperationManual

42.    Procurementplan. The Grant Recipienthas developeda ProcurementPlanfor project
implementation. This planwas agreeduponbetweenthe Grant Recipient andthe ProjectTeam. The plan

ProcurementPlan will be updatedannually, or as required, in agreement with the Bank's task team to
reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity.

43.      Prior review. Prior review thresholds will be determined inthe ProcurementPlan,

44.      Frequencyof procurementsupervision. Inaddition to the prior review supervision carried out
by the Bank offices, the capacity assessment ofthe Implementing Agency recommendsan annual

                                             In Aceh and Nias


Executive Summary and Conclusion

46.      The Support for Poor and Disadvantaged Areas Project (SPADA) is a national project that was
signedon August 4,2005 andbecameeffective on December 1,2005. Evenbefore tsunami, SPADA was
already programmedto launch preparation in five of the poorest district in Aceh. Following the tsunami
and establishment of BRR, the government accelerated SPADA launch preparation. Indonesia national
parliament (DPR) reviewedthe overall SPADA project in early September 2005 and proposed that the
project be expanded to cover all 17 districts, includingtwo districts in Nias. The government has also
asked that SPADA programfor post conflict reintegrationand development be substantiallystrengthened
for Aceh. In Aceh and Nias, these additional areas to be covered under this grant will replace the ones
planned under the approved SPADA national project. This grant will be financed by the Multi Donor
Fund(MDF).

47.      The project will have three years of implementation.The project management arrangements are
somewhat different from the national SPADA. The project executing agency will be BRR. However, the
project implementation will be through Project Management Unit (PMU) in Ministry o f Disadvantage
Areas (KPDT) which will manage the national SPADA. PMU will issue the general guidelines and
operational manual for the project. At the central level, PMU will be responsible for managing project
activitiesand also preparingthe project financialreports. However, the implementationdesign and nature
o f funded activities and project accountability arrangements are the same as for the national SPADA.
These factors have beenconsideredincompletingthis assessment.

48.     The purpose of the project's financial management assessment is to determine whether the
financial management system o f the implementingagency, has the capacity to produce timely, relevant
and reliable financial informationon the project activities, and if the accounting systems for the project
expenditures and underlying internal controls are adequate to meet fiduciary objectives and allow the
Bank to monitor compliance with agreed implementationprocedures and appraise progress towards its
objectives.

49.     The project has a major risk on district grants implementation, particularly on how effectively
grant beneficiaries use and account for the funds that have been used for intended purposes. There is
another risk with the capacity of local government (PIU) to manage the project implementation.Some
risk mitigationsteps have beenproposed, as follows:

     0  To provide technicalassistancesto the PMUand PIU;
     0  To provide technicalassistanceto local implementationteams (TPK) who execute sub-project
        activity;
     0  To provideindependent monitoringby a monitoringunit attachedto the district forum by local
        NGOs andjournalist that are contractedfor that purpose;
     0  To link externalaudit results to further allocationo fthe sub-grants;
     0  To conduct internalandperformanceaudit to the projectimplementation; and
        Annualfinancialstatementwill be auditedby auditor acceptableto the Bank. Inthis case, BPKP
        wouldbe consideredacceptable.




                                                     18

50.     Overall, the projectfinancial managementrisk is assessed as beingHighrisk. This assessment has
concluded that with the implementationo f the action plan, the risks will be substantially mitigated, and
the proposed financial management arrangements will satisfy the Bank's minimum requirements under
OPlBP10.02 and are adequate to provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely informationon
the status o f the grant required by the Bank. More details o f the financial management assessment are
given below.

Summaryof Project Description

51.     The total proposed grants will be finance by MDF amounted to USD25million. The Project
covers 17 kabupaten, including two kabupaten in Nias. The project will consist of the following
components and activities:

    0   Component A: District Grants (US$ 12.76 million). The purpose of the district grants is to
        support larger or more technical proposals emerging from the sub-district planningprocess that
        also contribute to reconstruction, rehabilitationand development. Sub-projects are selected by the
        district development forum on a quarterly basis using criteria that include demonstrable broad-
        basedbenefits, cost and local contribution,andtheir technical and financialfeasibility.

    0   Component B: Capacity Development (US$ 2.93 million). The project will provide substantial
        investment in improving the capacity of local stakeholders through a combination of training,
        practical exercises, professional technical support, and by developing learning networks. The
        project will also fund support to the provincial government, particularly for monitoringprogress
        on improvinglocal investment climates.

    0   Component C: ImplementationSupport ($ 8.14 million). SPADA includes three major types of
        implementation support. The different levels o f government are backed by a technical assistance
        structure that includes a national management team, an oversight and monitoring unit in each
        province, and a multi sector support team in each participatingdistrict.

    0   Component D: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Studies ($0.41 million). The core of this component
        i s a package of quantitative and qualitative baseline and intermediate surveys and case analyses
        that can track impacts due to project interventions. This category also includes programs for
        conflict resolution that show promise but should be piloted on a two or three province scale
        before expanding across the conflict regions, such as community land mapping or options for
        community based trauma recovery. $0.2 million is budgeted for independent audits that will
        begin inthe project'ssecondyear.

Strengths and Weaknesses

52.     The project has strengths andweaknesses inseveral areas. The projectdesign has strengths as
follows:
        Community and other stakeholders (local government agency/Dinasand CSO) participate in sub-
        project preparation and implementation which creates transparency, ownership and public
        control.
    0   Local Project Implementation Team (TPK) will receive the funds directly from central treasury
        (KPPN), insteado f local government treasury. This will facilitateflow of fund.
    0   Local NGOs andjournalist are to be assignedas external oversight unit. These will hiredby PMU
        to provideoversight over sub-projects.

53.     Some weaknessesnoted inthe project financial managementarrangement are as follows:
    0   Capacity of PMUto manage and implement the projectmay be weak.
    0   Capacity of PKJto superviseandassist TPK may be weak.

               Indonesia:Support for Poor and Disadvantaged Areas Project (SPADA)
                                             In Aceh and Nias



Introduction

72.     A solidmonitoringand evaluation (M&E) system is vital to allow projectmanagers and others to
assess whether a project is being implemented as planned and to evaluate project outcomes and impact.
SPADA works indiverse poverty andpost-conflictsituations rangingfrom large-scalenatural disasters to
areas of ethnic and religious strife. The context poses unique challenges not only to capture and
document local dynamics but also to monitor and evaluate the effects o f SPADA interventions on them.
A more informedunderstanding o f what affects the root causes and levels o f socially caused poverty, as
well as what works inpost-conflictrestoration-basedupon solidM&E data can help ensurethat project
                                                                              -
interventionsbuild community resilience.

73.     In Aceh and Nias , a larger and comprehensive project such SPADA challenged is not just to
ensure that project activitiesdo not replicate or contradict similar programs supported by other donors but
also how to have a single comprehensive M& Eframe work that can be use        .

74.     Duringthe project appraisal the donors agreedthat SPADA have a single comprehensive M & E
frame work that can be used overallSPADA activitiesco-financingby donors.

 SPADA Monitoring and EvaluationFramework

75. The SPADA M&E system will serve several purposes:

    0   Monitoringactivitieswill allow a range of stakeholders, includingprojectmanagers, participating
        communities and leaders,to track progress andassess whether the Project is beingimplemented
        as plannedandtake corrective action as necessary.
        The evaluationcomponentwill assess the outcomes and impact ofthe project.Didthe project
        reachits statedobjectives?
        Informationcollectedduringthe course ofthe Projectwill attempt to answer several research
        questions andhypotheses relatedto Project interventions and its objectives. The project tests
        some important and fundamentalhypothesesrelatedto the nexus o f conflictandreconciliation,
        poverty reduction, and empowermentofthe poor.

76. The development o f the SPADA M&E framework is premised on several important lessons learned
    from community-drivendevelopment andpost-conflictprojectsaroundthe world:

        Usinga mix of methodologiescan improvethe robustness andcredibility o f findings. Findings
        can then be cross-checkedor triangulated to compareresults. The SPADA M&E systemwill use
        both quantitative and qualitativemethods for collectingdata. In addition, the Project will gather
        informationfrom a variety of sources.Project implementersas well as independent, external
        parties such as NGOs will conduct monitoring.
        M&E findings must feed into managementdecisions andthe redesignor adjustment of project
        interventions. To do so, the informationgatheredmust be timely and reliable. The Projectmust
        makea substantial commitment andtime investmentto ensure that reportingsystems work
        effectively and that Project managersand stakeholders use the findings constructively.For



                                                    25

        example, the IndonesianKecamatanDevelopmentProgram(KDP) hadto counter a mindset
        amongfield consultantsthat reportingproblems wouldreflectbadly upontheir individual
        performance andthere was little incentiveto act as "whistle-blowers", Inorder for the M&E
        systemto work, managersmust senda clear messageregardingthe importanceo f and
        expectations for reporting.
        The Project Management InformationSystem(MIS)must strikea balance between
        methodologicalrigor and the practicalitiesof projectimplementationand localcapabilities.
        Fieldconsultants and governmentofficials are often busy with projectimplementationand pay
        less attentionto regular reporting. Project reportingformats must be kept simple yet also capture
        key projectperformance informationthat will be usefulfor M&E purposes. Inaddition, local
        capabilitiesare often limited interms of reportingskills and dataanalysis, so these skills must be
        enhancedover time. This is especiallytrue o f post-conflictareas where statisticaldata collection
        may not haveoccurredrecentlydue to the insecurityand datamanagementcapabilitiesmay range
        from low to non-existent. Impact evaluations usingexperimental or quasi-experimentaldesigns
        require substantialexternaltechnical and specialized assistance.

Key Hypothesesand ResearchQuestionsfor SPADA

77.     Will SPADA interventions lead to its intended outcomes? The only way o f answering this
question is to collect data and evidence on SPADA implementationand its effects in the field. The
appropriateness and effectiveness of project interventions must be tested, notjust asserted. Credible and
objective data will provide sound evidence to influence project decisions and eventually policy
formulation.

78.     SPADA will explore several key researchquestions:

        0       How effective are SPADA interventionsat improvingwelfare and reachingpoor and
                marginalizedgroups?
        0       How can local governments build effectivemechanismsfor interactionbetweendistrict
                levelplanningfor service delivery andcommunitydemand, especially for healthand
                educationservices? What can be learnedfrom the SPADA pilotsregardingnew ways of
                providingand managingservice provisionand involvingbeneficiaries in healthand
                education?
        0       How can government, the businesscommunityandNGOs work together to create a
                stronger enabling environmentfor privatesector development?
                Do SPADA activitiescontribute to buildinggreater trust within the communities and
                betweenthe communitiesand government institutions?
        0       What strategies are the most effectiveto support a transitionto longer term development
                inrecoveringpost-conflictareas?

Key PerformanceIndicators

79. The key outcome performanceindicators for SPADA are:

SPADA M&E Activities

80.     The SPADA system builds upon several effectiveM&E mechanisms developed for KDP1 and 2
including:

    e   Communityparticipatory monitoringand evaluation-Ineach projectsite, communitieswill
        form committees to monitor andevaluate project activities. Communities becomethe "question-
        makers" and end usersofthe information,rather thanjust the respondents and subjects of
        householdsurveys. For the community development grants, communitieswill monitorthe
        process of community planning, decision-making,contracting, procurement, and implementation.
        For the educationandhealthcomponents, village-levelcommittees will be formed specificallyto
        monitorthe education andhealthactivities. These committees could be parents-teachers
        associations,school committees, community boards, healthunit managementcommittees or other
        elected organizations who will monitor project activities,provide feedback on service delivery,
        and act as liaisons with the broader community.
    e   Regular field supervisionand monthly progress reportingconductedby field staff and
        government officials. SPADA staff will report on project progress at monthly coordination
        meetingsat the district level(see separatesectionon SPADA reporting).
    e   Establishmentof a management informationsystemto capture key quantitative informationand
        indicatorsrelatedto the monitoringo f outputs andperformance, as well as personnel,financial
        and program information.
    e   Independentmonitoringby civil society groups such as provincialNGOs andjournalists.
        These civil society groups will report uponproject performanceas well as conduct local budget
        expenditurereviews.
    e   Grievance/complaintsresolution process       - The Projectwill establish complaints/suggestion
        boxes at the village, kecamatan, district andnationallevels. Complaintswill also be collected
        from field reportsandsupervisionmissions.Government staffandconsultants at the district level
        will first discussthe complaints duringthe monthlymeetings andagree upon a course o f action.
        Project staffthen follow up on each individualcase and national and district levelstaffmonitor
        case resolution.
    e   Technicaland sectoral studies-The Project will undertakeseveral studiesto measure
        economic internalrates of return andcost benefit. For infrastructure projects, the Project will hire
        independentauditors andevaluatorsto conduct a facilities quality check. The quality of
        environmental managementandmitigationwill also be monitoredthrough free-standingreviews.
        Study findings will be widely circulatedthrough publications andworkshops, andthey will feed
        into Project decisions regardingpotentialredesigns, procedures, operations, and management.
    e   Financialreview and audits by an internalproject financialteam as well as the World Bank and
        the governmentaudit agency, BPKP. InKDP1, these parties audited 30 percent o f all kecamatan
        accounts. In SPADA, all districtand kecamatan levelfunds will be auditedalongwith a
        representative sample ofvillages.

81.     These M&E activities are ongoing for KDP and they will be extended and adapted for SPADA
sites. In addition, the SPADA M&E system builds upon research work and several methodologies
developedandpilot-testedduringthe projectpreparationphase:

SituationAnalysis

82.     A comprehensivesituation analysis will be completedfor each project district during the SPADA
preparation phase. The first 12 kabupaten are already completed and have been provided to BRR, HIC,
and to IOM. The situation analysis proceeds in two stages: first, SPADA field consultants undertake
consultations and data collection at the province and district levels. The second phase involves interviews
and data collection at the kecamatanand village levels. During both stages the consultants use techniques
such as key informant interviews, focus group discussions, direct observation and document review,
including local media reports of violence.

83.     This information provides a usefulpicture ofthe situation in each district as well as some baseline
aggregate information about the project areas. Some of these variables will be tracked through project
implementation and usedto triangulate information from other data collection efforts.

ProjectImpact Study Quantitative Household Survey and Qualitative Research
                        -
84.     Findings from the situation analysis will feed into more in-depth qualitative research and the
development of a household survey to measure impact across severalvariables. The qualitative aspect of
this impact study work will capitalize upon many of the instruments and methodologies developed
extensively under the KDP and Community Conflict Negotiation Study. The qualitative research will also
feed into the design of the quantitative survey. The survey design will employ a double-difference
methodology (before-after, treatment and control).       At the beginning of the project, the Project will
commission a baseline household survey in treatment and control areas. A separate study will be
undertaken to examine the feasibility of identifying suitable control/comparison areas in the conflict
zones as well as the sample size. The impact study - both qualitative research and quantitative survey -
will be repeatedat mid-tern and project completion to measure project impact.

85.     The householdquestionnaire will examine severalvariables:

    e   Householdwelfare/poverty targeting
    0   Access to, satisfaction with, and utilization of basic services includingeducationand health
    e   Community participation, voice, representation
    e   Social capital issues: group dynamics, trust and solidarity, collective action, social cohesion and
        inclusion, etc.
    0   Private sector development and obstacles faced
    0   Development priorities and common problems at the village level
    e   Village governance and accountability (includes issues oftransparency, relations with
        government and elected authorities, etc.)
    0   Legal assistance, alternative dispute resolution, and conflict management
    e   Attitudes towards peace and violence

The survey topics and questions will be finalized after results from the situation analysis and qualitative
research phases are analyzed.

Case Studies

86.      SPADA provides a richbackdropfor case studies and in-depthqualitative research.The Project's
M&E systemwill capture not only the "tangibles" o fthe project,Le., kilometerso froadbuilt, peace
forums held, etc. but perhapsmore importantlyinpost-conflictenvironments, qualitative methodologies
will be usedto capturemore fully the "intangibles" relatedto process,buildingtrust, prejudice, beliefs
and other less quantifiablecharacteristics.

87.      Usingqualitativeresearchand case study techniques is particularlysuitable for capturing
community perspectives andthe questionsof "how" and "why" of particularevents and processesrelated
to the conflict.Perspectiveson prejudice, violence, trust, security and other potentiallysensitive topics are
bestdiscussedthrough less structured interviewtechniques. Conflictsgenerally have longhistories and
intricatepathways, andthese stories are more fully capturedthrough in-depth, informalinterviewsand
open-endedquestions. This methodology allows peopleto describetheir experiences intheir own words.
Interviewersalso havethe flexibility to pursueunanticipatedlines o f inquiryand probe deeper into
specific issues. Furthermore, incases of incrementalchangeand capacity buildingsuch as SPADA
activitieswith female-headedhouseholds, these gradual, sometimes nuancedchanges in confidence,
attitude and skills are best exploredthroughopen dialogue and observation. Case studies and qualitative
researchwill be able to captureand document these processesmore effectively.

88.      Inaddition, usinga mix of quantitativeandqualitativemethodologiesfrom different sources
allowsfor triangulationand will improvethe robustnesso fM&Efindings. Resultscanthen be compared
amonga variety ofsources.

89.      Exampleso f potentialcase studies andresearchtopics include:

        Assessments and researchfor privatesector development-The Projectplans several studies
        to examineaspects ofprivatesector and economic development.These include: assessments of
        the local regulatory environment, with annual updates; transport costs and roadtaxes; the local
         structure of creditavailability, the size and structureofthe informaleconomy, and various
         infrastructure sector reviews. The formulationof some of these assessmentswill be participatory
        and involvegovernment and privatesector representativesto formulate the themes and discussion
        questions.
     0  Alternative dispute resolutionmechanisms-What mechanismsare effectiveat resolving
         disputes at the communitylevel? How do mechanismswhich involve government officials
         compareto moretraditionalleader type of interventions?How participatoryarethese
         interventions and what are the advantagesand limitationsto such mechanisms?These studies will
        be carried out intandemwith the legalassistance/alternativedispute resolutionpilot program.
     0  Role ofwomen in post-conflict environments-There has been little researchon the role of
        women inconflict and post-conflictsituations in Indonesia. What has beenthe impact o fthe
        conflicton women's roles and responsibilitiesinthe householdand society in general? What
        roles ifany have women played inpeace building? These couldbe preventingas well as
        provokingconflict. Researcherswill also undertakeseparate, butrelatedpanelcase studies
        focusing on female headedhouseholdsinthree provincesand what impact, ifany, have SPADA
        activitiesmade intheir lives.
        Forums for cooperationand reconciliation- SPADA will convene communitymembers and
        local officials to work together through the communitygrants component. What types o f
        activitiesare successful inbuilding linkages and cooperation? What is the role of religiousand
        adapt organizations? How shouldthese forums be organized and who should be representedat
        these forums?

     0   Best practicecase studies-Lessons learnedand successful practiceswill be documented so that
         projectstakeholders in other areas will benefit from the experience. For example, cases where
         utilizationor coverage for healthandeducationhas improvedmarkedly, or where there is
         effectivecommunity involvement inmanagingschools or healthservices, will be documented.
         Innovativechannels for communicatingpeace messages or socializingSPADA will also be
         recorded. The Project providesfertile groundfor several researchactivities.
     0   Implicationsfor HDpolicy analysis-Baseduponthe Project's experiments inhealthand
         educationassistance,one can examinewhat type of local policy options will foster innovation
         and accountability inthe delivery o f essentialservices. What policieswill support equal access to
         services, and improved attentionto results inthe form o fhumandevelopment?

 Private Sector DevelopmentAssessmentTools

90.      The SPADA privatesector team has developeda private sector and investment climate
assessment tool, adaptedfrom the standardsurvey instrumentof World Bank's Investment Climate Unit.
The assessmenttool coverstopics such as investmentconstraints, infrastructure and services, financing,
labor and workforce issues, business-government relations, conflict resolutionand legal environment,
crime, and capacity and innovation.

91.      Assessmentswill be repeatedevery year to measure progress in improvingthe business
environment and increasesin privatesector investmentand development.Key performanceindicators are:
the number and type of businessregulations improved; barriersremoved; and increase in new business
registrations. Usinga participatoryapproach, stakeholderswill help to formulate questions for inclusion
inthe periodic assessments to ensure relevance ofthe topics. The Private Sector Forums involving
government, businessandNGOs, will be heldregularlyto obtain feedback from the different parties.

92.      This componentincludes several studies to assess the local regulatory environment, with annual
updates, as well as specialthematic studies as mentionedearlier. The Forumwill serve as a useful venue
to present study findings and design appropriatefollow up action.

Health and EducationMonitoring and Evaluation

93.      DuringSPADA's preparation, a pilot community-basedhealth survey was conducted in
KotarawaringinDistrict, CentralKalimantan.This pilot survey tested a combinedquantitative and
qualitativemethodology aimed at identifyingthe levelof services peoplereceive, felt needs by the
villagers, and gaps in services. The methodology consistedo f four components: (1) a district-widehealth
facility review to estimatethe levelo fservicesthey provide; (2) applicationof the participatoryhygiene
and sanitationtransformation tools (as usedby the Bank water and sanitation group); (3) a simple
householdsurvey at the village level inthree sub-districts; and(4) village analyses and consultations.
The responsesto the householdquestionnairewere summarizedby the field workers in the villages, and
discussedwith villagersin a focus group format, usingvisualtools. The purposeo fthis third component
was to identifythe underliningcauses o fthe health indicators found through the first two components and
discussvillagers'views andtheir understandingso fthe problems. One of the lessons learnedabout the
methodology duringthe pilot phase was that the instrumentsneedto be kept extremely simple plus
technical assistancewill be neededto analyze the dataand improve skills.DuringSPADA
implementation, the healthsurvey findingswill be presented, alongwith other relevanthealth
information,to the kecamatanand district forums to enablethem to make informeddecisions in deciding
the use of the SPADA funds. These componentactivities will be repeatedas part of the monitoring
exercise.




                                                     31

94.                         Community-based groups such as school management committees, community boards, and health
center management committees will assist with monitoring o fthe health and education activities and their
results during implementation.

95.                         The measurement of health and education outcomes such as increased use o f publidprivate
services, increases in immunization rates and professionally-assisted birthdeliveries, and improvements
in school attendance and competency level rates will be measuredthrough various means, within
treatment and comparison areas. For health, the project will commission facility, user, and household
surveys as well as special studies (similar to the methodology described above). To measure education
outcomes, the project will use school examination and attendance reports, facility and household surveys.
Ofparticular importance will be to track outcome differences resultingfrom experiments in contracting
mechanisms (e.g., supporting government service delivery, contracting NGOs and the private sector).

Mapping Conflict Incidence

96.                          One o fthe most difficult variables to measure will be the incidence and impacts o f violent
conflict. Secondary data sources such as BPS statistics and police reports are generally incomplete and
unreliable. SPADA will use a methodology tested inthe World Bank Indonesia conflict research study
based upon collecting and collating local newspaper articles to map incidence and impact o f conflict over
time and area. Informationregarding conflict types, impact, and groups involved is collected, entered
into a database, and analyzed for trends. With technical assistance, the Project will attempt to develop the
skills o f local governments to collect data and statistics on conflict in order to build a simple type o f early
warning system. Assistance will be needed to help local governments develop the methodology,
categorize the informationin ways that make it useful, and analyze conflict trends within the data.

Measuring SPADA Training and Capacity Building Interventions

97.                          The Project includes training activities to buildthe capacity o fvarious stakeholders. SPADA will
train village councils, community project teams, women's groups, local NGOs, village paralegals and
government and community groups in alternative dispute resolution. The table below illustrates some o f
the major training interventions.

98.      Too often, development projects only measure the inputs and outputs of training, despite
investing considerablehuman and financial resources for capacity building. Typically, projects only track
the number ofworkshops held, number of peopletrained, popularity ofthe training, etc. However there is
little information as to whether or not the training made any medium or long-term difference in job
performance or services provided by the organization. To assess the effectiveness and impact of the
SPADA training interventions, the Project will use special "tracer" methodologies to monitor over time a
sample of the trainee groups from training intervention to future changes in behavior and performance.
The project will use pre- and post-training questionnaires and follow-up surveys to assess changes in
knowledge, attitude and performance at periodic intervals.

                                 Annex 4: Anti-Corruption Action Plan
                Indonesia: Support for Poor and DisadvantagedAreas Project(SPADA)
                                               In Aceh and Nias


Explanationof the Anti Corruption Plan

Overview

102.     The Bank and other donors havecarriedout a great deal of analyticalwork on the subject of
Indonesiancorruption, andthe generaldiagnostic is widely sharedacrossthe development community.
Lackof effective sanctions combinedwith weakly developedproceduresfor public accountability,have
createda cultureof impunitywhere the temptations are great and the risksare few.

103.     Working in disadvantagedareas carries with it higheven higher fiduciary risks.There can be
unique opportunities for rent-seeking,such as the emergence o fblackmarkets, localscarcities, threats of
violence, andvery poor book-keeping. As with disaster relief, waves of poorly designed andbadly
supervised`emergency assistance' can create further opportunities for abuse.

104.     Corruptioncanwaste large amounts o fresources, undermine the credibility o fthe government
and its developmentpartners, and contribute to widespread social unrest-one o fthe key problems that
SPADA trying to solve. Preventingcorruptionin SPADA is therefore a difficult but importantelement.

SPADA and anti-corruption

105.     The tsunami and disadvantagedareas covered by this projectposea particular challenge to anti-
corruptionprogramming.The formalmechanismsfor combatingcorruptionoftendo not operate in many
o f these areas.Audit controlsmay be moribund.Evenmechanismssuch as computerizedbook-keeping
may be difficult to maintain.

106.     A briefreviewofthe SPADA AC Plan follows.

What are the key elementsof the Anti Corruption Plan?

107.     Some ofthe most importantaspectsofthe anti corruptionactionplancan be summarizedinto the
six key elementsthat follow. Underpinningeach ofthese elements is the carefulconsultative processthat
ensuresparticipationand empowerment.

     A) Enhanced Disclosure Provisions and Transparency. The program will adopt a formal
         disclosure policy and set of procedures, simplify disclosed materials and make them readily
         available, particularly at the district level and below. Salient information will be made publicly
         accessible by a range of means, includingpublic meetings and notice boards. Specific disclosure
         measureswill include, but not be limitedto:

             Public disclosure of all grant awards, annual procurementplans and schedules (andtheir
             updates), biddingdocumentsand requests for proposals.
             Disclosureto all bidders ofthe summary ofthe evaluation and comparisono f bids, proposals,
             offers, and quotations, after the successfulbidder is notified.
             Disclosure of all annualaudit reports.
             Stakeholdedend-useroversight, with representativesinvolvedin planningand
             implementation, and frequent accountabilitymeetingsthat are opento the generalpublic.


                                                       39

       Monitoringby NGOs, the press, and university student networks funded through the project.


B) Civil Society Oversight. The program recognizesthat greater oversight by civil society is likely
  to reduce the risk o f corruption and misuse of power. The program involves a high degree of
   formal participationby community groups, the private sector, and traditionalladat and religious
   leaders, through the monitoring of the projectdend results, witnessing the results from tender
   committee, andthe evaluationof the quality o f delivery procuredservices/products.

   Multi-stakeholderforums, andvested interest groups such as business forums and school
   committees will be directly involvedinthe decision makingand monitoringprocesses.At the
   same time, there is also an inherent danger of conflict of interests, since (in effect) these local
   entitieswill oftenbe beneficiariesto contracts awardedto local businessesor contractors.
   Therefore special care will haveto betakento ensure broad, openparticipationof all interested
   parties indecision-making, planningand monitoringof implementation.

   ExistingNGOs and other civil society organizationswill be involvedina variety of ways, inter
   alia: i)through participationin workshops andplanning/accountabilitymeetings; ii)as key
  resource personsfor the developmentof plans where possible; iii)as witnesses o ftender
  committees; iv) as evaluators on an ad-hoc basis; and v) as trainingproviders in particularskill
  areas.

  Routine nationaland district levelaccountabilitymeetings,widely publicizedand opento the
  general public, will be heldto ensurethat salient informationwill be made public.Attendance of
  key civil society groups will be requestedat these meetings. The minutes ofthe meetingswill be
  sent to the nearestNGO forum (usually at the provincelevel) as well as to the heads ofthe        '
  government and Bank supervisionteams.Routineinformationconcerningexpenditures, progress,
  problems and solutions will be providedon a monthlybasisto the local press.

C) Mitigating Collusion, Fraud & Nepotism. Opportunity for collusion and fraud exist in any
  project. However, many of the possible risks can be mitigatedas a result o f the SPADA project
  design. Transparent and well-advertised procurement under the project, combined with
  appropriate oversight, should reduce corruption opportunities in procurement practices.
  Additionalauditingand procurement proceduresare proposed, such as strengthenedoversight and
  capacity building. Technical Assistance in the areas o f procurement (e.g. procurement
   consultants) and financialmanagementwill be providedto each location.

  At the central level, there will be a committee to regularly evaluate the performance o f the
  consultants who are hired under the Project.This committee will make their results available to
  the relevanttechnicalparties, includingthe BRRand IDA.

  Cases of collusion, .fraudand nepotism will be reported directly to the attorney general office, as
  the authorized agency mandated under the Indonesian law. In the case of collusion, fraud and
  nepotism within the community, the cases will first be reported, discussed, and decided at the
  community meeting prior to their submission to the attorney general office. Experience in similar
  projects indicates that many risks can be mitigated by the threat and use o f appropriate,
  community-basedsanctions such as those usedunder KDP Iand 11. SPADA aims to adopt many
  of these approaches to problem solving and dispute resolution. Substantiated allegations
  involvingcorruptionwill be reportedto the appropriate authorities.




                                               40

  Districtlevelprocurementcapacity is often lacking.SPADA's fast launchwill be supportedby a
  procurement consultant providedthrough a grant from DFID whose purpose is to provide short-
  term procurementtrainingand oversight. Though SPADA will provide trainingand other forms
  o f capacity development to strengthenprocurementpractices, - in each case assistedby the
  project's procurementconsultant. Finalreview o fbids remainsthe responsibilityo fthe
  government agencies, though SPADA will insist onthe process beingwitnessed by at least two
   independentmembers of civil society andtwo representatives of the affected communities.The
  procurement consultantsand the PMUwill ensure that the results o f all tenders are published.

   In the past, district level contract management has often been o f very poor quality. Works often
  go uninspected, and failure to deliver the quantities or quality contracted for is widespread.
  Experience from KDP, however, shows that local level implementation and monitoring
   committees can produce significant changes. Involving more entities in the process will make
'  collusion more difficult. In SPADA, members of the related forum will be part of
   districthubdistrict project implementation oversight teams whose job is to record all deliveries
   and make monthly reports to the forums and to the PMU. Performance based contracts will be
   usedwherever possible.

  The project will also provide assistanceto participatingschools andclinics by makingprice lists
   availableand creatingdirect linkages to a wider list o f suppliers of generic supplies andtraining.
  This assistance, combinedwith proceduralhelp from procurementconsultants, should widen the
  purchasingscope andcapacity o f schools. This is particularly important in SPADA areas, where
  there is a distinctshortage o f well-stockedretailoutlets andinformationis often difficult to
   obtain. Clusteringto allow bulk purchasing is an optionthat health and education committees
   may needto consider.

D) Mitigation of fraud and forgery risks.BRR andIDA will be providedwith drafts ofall key
   documentssuch as budget information,the project manual, budget circular letter, and list of
   project managementstaff prior to negotiations.Duringimplementation,transparency of the
   project processeswill make fraud more difficult to hidethan in many previous projects. Groups
  usingfunds at all levels will haveto holdaccountability meetingswhere memberso fthe general
  public will have a rightto pose questions concerning all transactions.The project seeks to
   strengthengovernance, accountability andtransparencythrough support for the national (BPKP)
  andregionalauditor (Bawasda). Audit reportswill be made public.Inspectionsofthe end results
   of activitieswill include physicalaudits andspecial evaluations of trainingoutcomes to ensure
  that funds are beingusedeffectively.Members ofthe district levelforum, includingnon-
   governmentmembers, and memberso fthe local parliament, will havea right to inspect all
   documents.To avoidkey, original documents andreceiptsfrom beinglost, these must not be
   removedfromthe relevantoffices duringthe lifespanofthe project.

E) Complaints Handling Mechanism. Complaint handlingprocedures as currently defined in the
  Keppres 80/2003 will be strictly followed by also assigningauthorized officials to be responsible
   for maintaining a database o f complaints and the follow up actions. While the program is
   designed to encourage local complaint resolution through formal channels as well as public
   pressure, in some cases local elites might misuse power and program activities.For these cases,
   an alternative system will be established through a feedback mechanism at the national level.
  Pilot programs will also be designed to train local paralegals and NGOs who can act on some of
  the complaints made by villagers. A special unit designated for handling o f complaints will be
   made available at each level. The complaint handling unit will investigate and facilitate the
  resolution of complaints and problems. The database of complaints, follow-up actions being
  taken, and sanctions applied will be publicizedto increase participants'involvementand increase


                                               41

         the likelihood of their lodging protests, thereby raising the social costs of misuse of funds.
         Complaints will be acted upon ina professionalandtimely fashion, and without risk o f reprisalto
         'whistleblowers'. The complaint handling mechanism will provide wider access for the
         communities so that they can easily raise and monitor complaints.For example, the project will
         establish nationaland province level addresses for mail complaints, and these and other contact
         details will be postedinthe project informationboards.

     F) Sanctions& Remedies. Clear sanctionsandremediesare importantfinal steps inthe effortto
         fight corruption.Communities are encouragedto impose reasonablesanctions on citizens who
         abuse the powerthat has beenentrustedto them. There is an increasingwealth of anecdotal
         evidence suggestingthat such sanctions canbe more easily appliedand more effectivethan
         protracted legalproceedings, especially in smaller cases of corruption.The projectdoes not
         endorsevigilantism or extreme community sanctions, but inmany cases the communitieswill be
         able to reachamicable resolutions without resortingto the slow and over-burdened legal system.
         That said, formal sanctions may also be applied were allegations involvingcorruptioncan be
         substantiated.For example, any official (government, non-government,etc.), community
         members, or privatesector entity participatinginthe projectcan be prosecuted ifsufficient
         evidence is available, and such cases will be referredto the appropriate authorities. Inall
         procurementcontracts, evidence of corruption, collusionor nepotismwill result interminationof
         the relevantcontract, possibly with additionalpenalties imposed(such as fines, blacklisting,etc.)
         in accordancewith Bank andGovernmentregulations.Transfer o f funds from the projectSpecial
         Account will be suspendedincases where significantmisuse offunds is suspected. At a larger
         scale, entire districtsmay be excludedfrom participationif misuseof funds is suspectedto occur
         widely. Informationregardingsuccessfulcases, where lessonsare learnedand funds are retrieved,
         will be widely disseminated.

The needfor intensive supervisionand appropriate reactionsto reports.

108.     There are many inherent dangersinworking in disadvantagedareas. Supervisionmust be
frequent and intensive, with an action-orientated approachdesignedto reducedangers and improve
projectdesignas muchas possible. Project staffmay be under extreme pressureto abuse their positions
o f power, so it is importantthat missions are seen to be consistently comprehensive,fair and robust.
Whistleblowers may face greater risks in suchareas than elsewhere, and supervisionteams must be
careful to notto compromise informants,Joint Governmentmank supervision missions should be held as
often as possible, but BRRandthe Bank should also field smaller, more ad hoc missions to cover specific
areas of concern.All incomingrepostsof corruptionmust be appropriately investigated.

11. Corruption Mapping Matrix

109.     Limitingthe occurrenceo fcorruptioninthis Projectstarts with identifyingpotentialrisk areas -
this is calledcorruptionmapping. This mappingwill be repeatedat least every six months as the project
progressand lessonsare learned.

110.          Any constructionactivity will have some impact onthe environment althoughthe
significanceis largelyproportionalto the scale ofthe construction activity.Environmentalimpacts from
SPADA are not expectedto be large. Physicalinvestments inthe CDD or investmentclimateforum are
either small-scaleor limitedto rehabilitation.Investments in the healthand educationcomponent are
confinedto "software"(teachertraining, books, midwife support, etc) and do not raise issues such as the
disposal of medicalwaste.

EnvironmentalImpact Analysis in Indonesia
112.     SPADA follows official Indonesiangovernment policy in regardsto environmental impacts. The
government has paidsignificantattentionto the problems o f environmental impact. MinisterialDecree
No. 17/2001(May 22, 2001) establishedthe requiredmethodologiesfor environmentalimpact analyses.
This regulationwas supersededby Government Regulation51 of 1993, which was intendedas
deregulation and simplification. This regulationcan also be seen as an attempt to improvethe quality o f
existingplanning. Planneddevelopment activities were dividedintotwo classes. The first class included
those activitiesthat clearly have a large potentialimpact, which require a formal impact analysis. The
secondclass includedthose activitieswith relativelyminor potentialimpacts, and for these an explicit
impact analysis was not required. Accordingto the later Decreeof the Minister for Settlementsand
RegionalInfrastructureNo. 17/KPTS/2003,datedFebruary 2003, the types and sizes of activities
undertakenby the SPADA are exempted from formal impact analysesdue to the very small scale of
investments and construction activitiessupported.
113.     The Bank is workingwith the Ministry o f Environmentto develop environmental screening
proceduresthat are more appropriate for the smaller projectstypicalof district level investmentprograms.
The exercise includes significantly enhanceddisclosure and popular participation.Trial results are
expected in 2005, after which they would be brought into the SPADA operational manuals.
114.     Eventhough exempt from formal studies, planners of SPADA infrastructureare required to
consider environmental effects. Environmentaleffects are defined as those changesthat arise directly as
a result o f development activities, bothpositiveand negative. The types o f problems encounteredare
determined basedon the experience o f experts, the field experience o fthe planner ,interviews, literature,
simulations andthe like. Analyses of SPADA proposals concernbotheffects occurringduring
constructionandthose occurringduringoperations.
115.     An exampleof environmentaleffects for a rural roadcanbe seen inthe table below, accordingto
types o f impact:

 116.                             From the above table it can be seen that categories 1,2, and 4 require special attention. Category
 One includes problems of short-term impact even though the effects might be widespread. These are
 handledthrough the application of standardizeddesign and operational procedureswhich are
 implementedright across the project. This is also the case with deforestationand increasedsediment
 from Category 2.

 Approach to ControllingEnvironmentalImpacts in SPADA

 117.                             The principle behindcontrollingenvironmental impacts in SPADA is to limit possible negative
 effects and to develop the positive effects of any infrastructure construction activity. Although SPADA
 does not prescribea positive list of possible investments, preparationidentified a relatively limited
 number of priorities that are                                                                                                                    to be chosen. Typical examples are: road and bridge rehabilitation,
 restorationof electricity, rebuilding of ports and shipyards, and reconstruction of warehousing. Financial
 thresholds for subproject types are approximately $30,000 for the subdistrict grants and $50,000 for
 subprojectsbuilt from district hnding during the project's first two years. (Larger district projects can be
 proposedinthe project's outer years when environmental capacitieshave improved, but these will require
 individualverification).
 118.                             As part ofthe planning process, a checklist of potential environmental and social problems is
 completed, which is then followed up during and after implementation by the village and technical
 facilitator. These include all ofthe relevant items coveredby the Bank's safeguardpolicies. The checklists
 have beenreviewed severaltimes during project preparation; they are also the same as those used for
 KDP, which have been reviewed by qualified specialists in the field.



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     47

119.    The determination of negative effects requiresexperience, coupledwith the use of input from the
various existingmanuals. Negativeenvironmental effects for roadsand bridges, for example, arise
especially from the disturbancesof unstablesoils that are sensitive to landslides or from changes in the
flow of water. Excavationand embankmentfrequently result in landslidesor erosion. Landslidesbring
with them four kindsof negative impact:

    0   disturbingtraffic (not an environmental problem, per se)
    0   endangeringagriculturalland or housing
    0   increasingerosionbecausethe soils are not compact
        divertingthe flow of rainwater

120.    Erosionof road sides can have largenegativeimpact ifthe soil is transportedto productiveland
or ifthe soil is carriedin suspensionto a reservoir, as this will reduce its storage capacity. At the same
time, bothlandslides and serious erosionwill result inunsightly scars nearthe road. Changes inwater
coursescandestroy productivelands or irrigationcanals, as well as disturbthe road itself.
There are four steps inthe processof reducingenvironmental damage.

    0   identifyingpotentialdangers
    0   selectingan alignment that reducesenvironmentaldisturbances
        utilizing civil works andvegetative treatmentsto limit negative impacts
    0   undertakingmaintenance and repairs in a timely fashion


121.    The first two are the most efficient, andthey are the responsibilityo fthe surveyor and designer.
A good survey cantruly reduceor eliminatemany environmentalproblems. This is emphasizedin pre-
service training.
122.    Roads are often locatedin critical lands that are sensitive to erosionand landslides, where soil
types and climate combine to multiply risks. The designer must consider a variety oftreatmentsto build
infrastructurethat will not harmthe environmentwhile still bringingsustainable benefits. To analyze the
environmental effects one needs to record informationaboutthree things, as follows:
      Treatmentsnecessary to overcome environmental problems, including:
      0       Changingthe alignment to reducesteep grades
      0       Movinghouses
              Building civil works to stabilize side slopes
      0       Usingvegetativetreatmentsto stabilize side slopes or prevent erosion
              Usingspecial treatmentsto overcomethe problemof ground water, such as drains
      Negative environmental effects that might still exist after construction:
      ........Side slopesthat are unstableandendangerhousingor agriculturalland
              Excavationthat results inthe stockpilingof unstable soil
              Side slopesthat are left bare, withoutany vegetative cover
              The muddyingof rivers as a result of construction
              Changesinthe course of a stream, which couldcause flooding, erosion, or sedimentation
              Changesin water flow that damage productiveland
              An increasein erosion and sediment as the result of uncontrolleddischarge from ditches or
              culverts
              The cuttingdown of the forest
      Socioeconomicproblems that may arise as the result o f constructinga bridgeor road




                                                         48

123.     These problems includethe sacrificeo fproductivelands or other landholdings. Ifother
problems arise, it is necessaryto recordany informationthat needto be consideredabout the type and
extent ofthe problem.
124.     For water supply projects or sanitation projects, there is always the possibility o f increasing
contamination, for example a water source contaminatedby surface water entering from outside, or
groundwater contaminatedby a poorly designedor constructedwaste controlsystem. One also must
consider the formationof an operations and maintenancecommitteefor water or sanitation projects.

EnvironmentImpact ControlStrategy

125.     The methodusedto ensurethat proper attentionis paidto environmental problems is a
combinationof standardchecklists and a special checklistfor the environment.

126.     For each type of subproject, a technicalstandard is includedinprojectmanuals, andthese include
considerations of environmental effects. For example, the magnitude of the grade o f a roadand the
steepnessof the cross-slopeperpendicularto the roadare limited. Drainagefor the roadmust be
installed,together with culverts to dischargewater safely, Leechingfields from latrineshaveto located
at leastten meters from any water supply, and locateddownstreamas groundwater flows. Water supplies
cannot be locatednear any potentialsource of contamination.

127.     The completionof the special checklistfor the environment is an obligatory part o fthe planning
process. Eachtype of projectis checkedfor the various treatmentsthat must be performed on it to avoid
or repair environmentalproblems. At the midpointof construction, the same form is brought out to the
field and inspectedagain, at a time when it is still feasible to easily repair deficiencies. At the end of
construction, the form is checkedone moretime against the originalplan.

128.     The districtengineeringconsultant is responsiblefor reviewingall infrastructuredesigns on
SPADA projects inthe district. He or she will reject any designnot accompaniedby a completed
checklist, and may also requestclarificationfor any feature where a problemis anticipated. Training for
the engineers includes moduleson environmental risk assessment and managementthat have been
reviewedby Bank environmental specialists.

129.     One other element of handlingenvironmental problems is the use oftechnicalinspectionforms,
which exist for manytypes o f subprojects. Amongthe items inspectedare those dealing with aspects of
environmental impact, such as for roads where the forms includeslope protection, drainageditches, and
shoulders. These forms are filled out incidentallyby anyone who inspectsthe infrastructure.

Review of Experiencein the KecamatanDevelopmentProject
130.     BecauseSPADA's subdistrictgrants are the same size as those of KDP and are likely to be used
for the same rangeo f infrastructure,reviewingKDP'senvironmentalperformance will providea good
guide to how well SPADA's proceduresare likely to do. A total o f 14,175 small scale infrastructure
projects were financed duringthe third year of the first KDP project(2002-2003). These were considered
to be representativeo f investments in all years and all of them have beenclassifiedinto one o ften
infrastructuredevelopmenttypes andthe investmentcosts tabulated. The summary data are shown in the
table, from which the following conclusions can be drawn:

         0  o f the ten categories of development, only five are of a type which would raise any potential
            concern from an environmental point of view, namely; roads, irrigation, bridges, water supply
            and wharves.

                                       the average scale of constructionwas extremely small. For example, the average road
                                        investment financed developmentof only 1.2 kilometersof new roadat a cost o f about 36.6
                                        millionrupiah(US$4,100)per kilometer. Most o fthe irrigationdevelopment involved
                                        rehabilitationof smallschemes althoughthere was some new constructionas well. To
                                        providesome perspective, for new construction,the averageinvestmentof around25.3
                                        millionrupiah(US$2,850) wouldfinance only five or six hectares o f new, low-technology
                                        irrigationcommand. The other forms of developmentwere similar: bridges includesmall
                                        scale steel girder bridges with wooden decks, concrete bridges, wooden bridges, and
                                        suspensionbridges; water supplies come from a variety o f sources, but mostly come from
                                        springs and dugwells. Most distributionsystems are gravity fed, but some utilize electrical
                                        or diesel pumps.

131.                      Fieldoversight reviews have not identifiedsignificantor recurrent environmental impacts.
Nevertheless,some environmental issueswere reportedto the KDP complaints unit and some typical
examples are set out inthe following table alongwith comments, where appropriate, on possible control
strategies that could be usedto avoidsimilarproblems inthe future.

132.                      In general,the number of complaints formally recordedinthe systemwas quite small. This may
be due to one or a combinationof three reasons:
                          A lack o f importanceassociatedwith environmental problems. There is notyet a widespread
                          appreciationfor environmental dangers, such as dynamitingreefs to free coralfor use as a road
                          buildingmaterialor buildingaccess roads into protectedforests.
                          An inabilityto identifyenvironmental problems.

ProposedImprovementsfor SPADA


133.                      The reviewillustratedseveral key facts:
                          the basic environmental impact potentialo f investmentssupportedthrough the projectis low so
                          the generalstrategy followedunder KDPremainsrelevant;
                          nevertheless,the desk review suggestedthat a small number of environmentalissueswere
                          encountered. Most ofthe issueshadtheir origin in apparentfailures to follow bestcivil
                          engineeringpractice and it is likely that these canbe addressedthrough continued training and
                          supervisionof engineeringstaffprovidingtechnicaladvice to participatingkabupatens; and


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     50

    0    the smallnumber ofenvironmental complaintsmadeto the KDPcomplaints unitmay be a
         reflectionof the very low adverse impact potentials of investmentssupportedunder the project
         but it also couldbe a reflectionof lack of interestin environmental issueson the part o f
         beneficiariesor a reluctanceto report problemsupwards.

134.     Thesethree items have beenaddressedin the designo f SPADA. It has beenmade clear that the
nationalgovernment, the donor, andthe nationalconsultants place high importanceon attention to the
environment. Causingenvironmental damage is enoughto cancelan activity. Not payingattention to the
environment is enoughto havethe facilitator replaced, This attention to the environment is equally
importantat the district level, where the district consultants and especiallythe district engineering
consultantmust enforce environmental standards. Inaddition,the following items havebeen addedto the
project's negative list:

             0    procurement o f any products containingasbestos
             0    procurement o fpesticides or herbicides
             0    production, processing, handling, storage or sale oftobacco or products containing
                  tobacco
             0    any activitieswithin a nature reserveor any other area designated by the Government of
                  Indonesiafor the managementand/or protectionof biodiversityexcept with the prior
                  explicit andwrittenapproval ofthe government agency responsible for the management
                  and/or protectionofthat area
             0    miningor excavationof live coral
             0    water resourcesdevelopmentson rivers which flow into or out of other countries

             0    new irrigationlarger than 50 ha.
             0    constructionof water retainingor storage structures o fcapacity greater than 10,000 cubic
                  meters

135.     In SPADA, eachkabupatenand eachkecamatanis servedby a graduateconsultantengineer, who
has beenprovidedwith trainingto helpthem identifyand avoidpotentialenvironmental problems. Pre-
servicetrainingwill emphasizethe ability to anticipate problems, includingenvironmental problems.

136.     Reluctanceto report problems is widespread in most projects. Problemswill be reported
faithfully only ifseveral conditionsare met:
             0    There are no negative effects from reportingproblems
             0    There are positiveresults from reportingproblems, i.e. help is given
             0    There are negativeeffects from not reportingproblems

137.     The designof SPADA attempts to addressall three o fthese conditions. Reportingo f problems is
a major point inthe performance evaluation system. Problemsthat are reportedare discussedand
handledat monthlymeetings, and doingthis is a major point inthe performance evaluation of kabupaten
consultants. The first itemis connectedwith the attitude o f senior consultants, government officials, and
donor representativeswhen confronted with reportedproblems. They shouldperceivethese reports as
evidencethat the system is workingand as opportunities to improveperformance inthe field.

138.     Success in the field dependsuponthe discipline o fproject actors meetingthese three conditions,
which is a task for senior management.A review o fthe effectivenessofthese measureswill be included
inthe first-year evaluation and measuresfor correctionwill be agreedwith the Bank prior to the approval
of the secondyear program.

Guidelines and Principlesfor Land Acquisitionin SPADA
139.      SPADA's landacquisitionguidelines are the same as those for the KecamatanDevelopment
Project(KDP). Standardizedguidelines are advisable because (i)      ex post reviews document that they are
sufficientto achievethe policy objectives o fthe WorldBank; (ii)SPADA andKDP sites overlap in
approximately 45% o fthe locations, so standardizingguidelines minimizesconfusionand promotes
mainstreaming.

140.      SPADA has a simple policy framework and set of operational proceduresto guide cases of land
acquisitionin village subprojects. The objectiveof these guidelines is to ensure that no family affected by
landacquisitionexperiencesa materialreductionintheir income, living standards, or livelihoods.
Implementationo fthese guidelines is built intothe projectoversight andfacilitator terms o f reference,
andthe projectprovides both internaland independentmonitoringo ftheir implementation.A special
issue likely to arise in the conflict area concerns internallydisplaced people. Although lacking legal or
traditionalclaims to the landthey occupy, displacingtraumatizedcommunities would detract from the
achievement of SPADA's development objectives. BecauseIndonesiadoes not have standardized
procedures and institutionsfor dealing with the claims of internallydisplaced people, SPADA will not
support involuntary landacquisitioninthe conflict areas. Any landacquisitionmust come through
voluntary negotiation.

Minimizing acquisition

141,      SPADA's guidelines and reportingformats are incorporatedintothe project operating manual
and are tracked through the MIS.The overarching objectiveofthe guidelines is to ensure that the
acquisitionof lands is minimizedand does not resultinpersons losingtheir home or sufferingany decline
in income, livelihood,or living standards as a resultofthe project.All proposalsmust be reviewedand
their location, alignment, or specifications changedas necessary. Proposalsto widen road right-of-ways
must also be reviewedcarefully.

142.      As it will not be possible inmany cases to eliminatethe needfor acquisition,the guidelines allow
for acquiringassets through the following two methods:



     0    Voluntarily. Inaccordancewith local custom, communitymembershavethe right to donate
          their land or other assets or to move their homestemporarily or permanentlywithout seekingor
          beinggiven compensation;
     0    Donatedwith compensation. Personswho donate their landor other assets havethe right to
          seek and receive compensation.

143.      Voluntary contributionof land and other assets is quite common inIndonesianvillages, assuming
that no individualloses too significanta portiono ftheir land. Losinga meter or two of land on the side
of the road is quite attractive to farmers, who will then have an all-weather roaddirectly abuttingtheir
fields. Voluntary contributionfor other purposes besides SPADA is notunusual. Payingcompensation
for landis also beyondthe financialcapacity o fthe village.

Providingappropriatecompensation

144.      Guidelineshavebeenestablishedto managecompensationfor persons inthe second category so
that all these persons improve or at least holdsteady their quality of life, income, and productioncapacity
comparedto pre-projectconditions.

                                                    other acceptable compensationwas given

projectare consultedat a public meeting inthe village. Duringthis meeting, their rightto compensation
must be explained, as well as suchalternatives as found inthe guidelines. Formalminutes of the meeting
are made and must include the mainpoints of discussionas well as any decisionsreached, including:

0   for voluntary contributions, the name ofthe donor and details o fthe donation;
0   for compensatedassets, the names ofthe personsreceivingcompensation, and details of the type and
    amount of compensation, such as seen inthe table below

148.               The kecamatanfacilitator will deliver a copy o fthe above notesto all those people who are
affected by the project, to determinedirectly their wishes inregardsto compensation, their perception of
whatever agreementshadbeenreached,and their complaints (ifany).

Projectapproval
149.               As the processof determining compensation is the responsibilityofthe village, wherein the
facilitator has no decision-making power, the kecamatanfacilitator is boundto do the following:

    0              He or she must delay final approval until all persons affected by the projectare satisfied with the
                   compensationthey are to receive, even ifthis causes utterstalemate, the changing o f designs, and
                   interminablenegotiations. Outsiders must not interveneto impose a solution.
    0              H e or she must delay implementation until compensation is realized. Whenever a projecthas
                   reachedthe implementationstage, the senior consultants, government officials, and donor should
                   assume that compensationhas been successfully delivered.
    0              Inprinciple, ifmorethan 200 personsare affected andrequire compensation, a compensation
                   plan must producedandthen agreedto by the Secretariat of the NationalCoordinationTeam prior




                                                                                                                                                                                                        53

        to projectapproval. (Inthe six years ofthe VIP and sevenyears of KDP
        completedsubprojects      -- this has                                     -- morethan  75,000
                                             never occurred.)

Right to voice complaints and take legalaction

150.    All complaints should be handledand solved at the village or subdistrictlevel. Ifthe problem
cannot be solved in the subdistrictforum, complaints and legalactionagainst these guidelines, the
implementationof agreementsfound inthe minutes, or other grievances can be filed by the person
affected or his or her representativeto the kecamatan. Ifstill notsolved, it can be further submittedfor a
decision by the Bupati. Complaints also can be sent to the Complaints HandlingUnit of SPADA at the
regionalor nationallevel,where they will be analyzedand an investigationorganized.

Verification

151.    At any time, all recordsregardingcompensation, includingminutes of the meeting and proofof
receivingcompensationmust be available for inspection by the kecamatanfacilitator, kabupaten
managementconsultants, auditors, andpersons assignedto monitoraspectsofthe projectby the project
Secretariator NationalManagement Consultants. The Village Minutesand evidence of compensation
havingbeenmade shall be providedto the kecamatanempowerment facilitator assistingthe village, to
supervising engineers, auditors and socioeconomic monitorswhen they undertakereviews under the
project.

Experiencefrom KDP

152.    Supervisionby the World Bankhas never reportedany case o f families beingforcibly displaced
by KDP, but, as notedabove, there are a small number o fcases bothof facilitatorsnot following the
rules and also cases ofthe rules beingfollowedbut families nevertheless dissatisfied with their outcome.
Tighteningup trainingand oversight producedgreater awarenessand better field performance.In general,
the Bank's field reviews suggestthat lack o f government involvementin KDP whether by nationalor
local agencies seems to limit landacquisitionto a bareminimum, and where it does happen, direct
negotiations by villagerswith the community councils produces outcomes that meetthe Bank's policy
objectives of safeguardingagainstadverse impacts.
LandAcquisitionin the Private Sector DevelopmentComponentof SPADA
153.    Becauseno new constructionis envisagedunder this component, landacquisitionshould also be
minimalinthe rehabilitationactivitiesfunded by SPADA. However, there is a possibility that adjusting
alignments or strengthening foundationsmight involvesmall landtakings. No first year investments have
been identifiedyet, so empiricalassessment of whether any land is requiredmust assume that some may
be. Shouldthat prove be the case, the guidingprinciplesdescribedbelow apply:

    0   landacquisitionwill be avoided or minimizedthroughdesignadjustments or alternative site
        selection wherever possible;
    0   all land acquisitionwill be voluntary and agreedthrough public negotiations.
    0   No subproject that displaces morethan 5 familiescanbe submittedfor funding.


154.    Responsibilityfor ensuringthat these principlesare followed and that principles o f
documentationare followedrests with the projectverificationteam. TOR for the independentmonitors
specify that site visits will review any cases o f landacquisition.

IndigenousPeople
155.    As notedinthe generalsocial analysis overview section of this PAD, section6.1, appraisal
reviewedthe situationanalysespreparedfor each participatingprovince, which includeda review of
indigenous people'sissues.None ofthe situationalanalyses showeda needfor an IPDP.Summary
reasons extracted from these 8 studies follow:


    0   For the 2 Kalimantanprovinceswhich are the mainarea of ethnic conflict (betweenDayaks and
        Madurese), there were originally no Madurese left. Some Madurese have returnedto Kalimantan
        undertheir own volition. But the project(or the government) is not proposingany kind o f
        sponsoredreturn.
    0    InNTT andNTB, the indigenous communities occupy full villages and will thus be the main
        beneficiaries o ftheir proposals. While NTT has many localizedlandconflicts, the primary
        concernvis a vis bothvulnerability and susceptibilityto adverseimpacts lies with the East
        Timorese refugee population, not with local indigenous groups.
    0    Central Sulawesi, Maluku, andNorthMalukuconflict is betweentwo religions(Christianand
         Muslim).No ethnic issuesare involvedandthe conflictsdo not involve vulnerable groups (except
        to eachother);
        Aceh does not have indigenous communities.

156.    Ifthe situationalanalysesdo notshowthe needfor IPDPs, the projectdesignprovidesadditional
assurancethat vulnerable groups not identifiedthrough the preparationstudies will not be affected.
Possiblerisks inthis designare (i)elite captureofthe decision-makingprocess; (ii) ethnic prejudicein
resourceallocationthat adversely affects vulnerable ethnic groups; and (iii)violent dispossessionfrom
traditionallandclaims

157.    Risk mitigationmeasuresare explained elsewhereinthe text. All proposalscome from the
bottom-up planningsystem. Eventhe largest proposalsrequire a subdistrictsponsor, where community
assent is essential.Preparationstudies, Bank assessments ofthese identifiedrisks duringpreparationand
pre-appraisal, anda preparationreview of community basedlandmappingoptions did not suggest that the
risksto any indigenous group specifically linkedto projectactivities is significant. Providingcontinual
on-site review of indigenous peoples issueswill be includedin the TOR for the independentNGOs
monitoringthe project.
