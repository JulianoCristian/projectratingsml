                         SPADA Aceh Nias has shown significant progress during 2010 towards reaching its development objectives. A total of 541 sub-projects were completed during the year,
                         complementing local government resources for health, education, and basic infrastructure development and more than 56 percent of total sub projects are in health and education
                         sector. As part of SPADA’s capacity development program, more than 11.600 teachers have been trained on school management and in collaboration with the Community-Based

                         development plans. Specifically related to issues affecting disadvantaged areas, SPADA block grants have opened up access to previously isolated villages, improved opportunities
                         to start small businesses, and improved the access to health and education services in disadvantaged communities. Through EGA (Economic Governance Aceh), SPADA has
                         facilitated the establishment and functioned of six business forum at districts level (Aceh Besar, Aceh Barat Daya, Bireuen, Bener Meriah, Aceh Tenggara, and Aceh Tamiang), which
                         reported new business registrations have been increased 94% during 2008 -2010. SPADA is presently preparing for its final year and will collaborate with local governments to
                         ensure the sustainability of project initiatives and practices, including hand-over of sub-projects and replicating good SPADA practices. During late 2010, the rapid disbursement of
                         funds from the national Treasury to individual community accounts (UPKD) raised concerns about financial risks; however joint KPDT-World Bank implementation support could
                         ensure that funds were being properly utilized.
