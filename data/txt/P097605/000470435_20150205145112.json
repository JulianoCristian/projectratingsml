The World Bank distributed\n            peace posters and copies of the peace agreement, is piloting\n            peace radio training, and is part of Forum Bersama which\n            supports the reintegration of former combatants into their\n            communities. The Kecamatan Development Program (KDP) program\n            is working with the International Organization for Migration\n            to provide reintegration grants. The Support for Poor and\n            Disadvantaged Areas (SPADA) program will bring conflict and\n            neglected areas into the reconstruction process. Bank\n            support for the peace process includes working closely with\n            the Aceh Monitoring Mission, EU, the International\n            Organization for Migration, UNDP, United States and Japan in\n            cooperation with the Provincial Government. The program\n            includes a comprehensive research program to support policy\n            making. This has involved completing a comprehensive GAM\n            reintegration needs assessment based on extensive\n            quantitative evidence (survey of 638 GAM combatants, census\n            of 1,700 prisoners, media monitoring) and qualitative\n            fieldwork (700 people interviews in 38 villages); it will\n            also include analytical work on the upcoming elections, an\n            evaluation of the reintegration program, and a study looking\n            at how to mainstream conflict sensitive principles into\n            tsunami aid. The Bank has helped develop innovative\n            approaches for monitoring corruption across the main Aceh\n            transport routes to track demands for illicit payments,\n            which have contributed to rising construction costs. Early\n            results have shown rising levels of extortion at weigh\n            stations and fees to ensure security. The Bank is also\n            conducting on-going monitoring of conflict trends and\n            reintegration dynamics at the request of the Provincial Government."}, "docdt": "2006-04-06T00:00:00Z"}
