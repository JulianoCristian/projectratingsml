Support for\n            Poor and Disadvantaged Areas Project in Aceh and Nias were\n            as follows: the overall outcome was moderately satisfactory;\n            the risk to development outcome was moderate; both the Bank\n            and grantee performance was moderately satisfactory.  There\n            were three lessons learned.  First, following a major\n            natural disaster, such as the 2004 tsunami in Aceh, it is\n            possible to adapt an approach and implementation\n            arrangements of a previously designed project, facilitating\n            quick project start-up to provide urgently needed\n            assistance; however, it is crucial to carefully draw lessons\n            from the existing project before emulating.  Second, a newly\n            created Ministry, appointed as the implementing agency of a\n            newly designed and complex project in a post-disaster area\n            for which they actually have neither a mandate nor the\n            expertise, will take considerable time to get organized and\n            up to speed with project implementation. When dealing with a\n            new ministry or implementing agency, additional training,\n            special consultants and associated implementation support\n            must be provided in the project and by the Bank's task\n            team.  Third, Implementation of a complex project dealing\n            with low-capacity stakeholders cannot rely solely on Bank\n            budget for effective implementation support. Grants from\n            trust funds allowed frequent and comprehensive\n            implementation support involving specialist resources.\n            However, when using a large number of trust funds,\n            coordination and integration of trust-funded activities is\n            difficult to achieve, especially at the national level."}, "docdt": "2012-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
