                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Health Commodity Security Project (HCSP) was designed to assist in reducing the impact of unpredictable financing as a result of the global financial crisis of 2008 on the
                         availability of select public health commodities. It was prepared in accordance with the Crisis Response Window (CRW) guidelines as an emergency project. It became effective on
                         February 15, 2010, and the closing date was extended from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013 and now to June 30, 2014. The second and final extension for an additional
                         six months was granted in order to give the Borrower adequate time to successfully complete all activities financed under this project.

                         The development objective of the project is to improve the availability of selected drugs and medical supplies in key distribution points. It includes two components; The first is

                         focused on the provision of select essential health commodities which represents 89 percent of the project financing and the second on strengthening the supply chain management
                         representing 12 percent of the project financing.

                         The project has disbursed over 97 percent of its US$39million credit, one of the highest levels of disbursement achieved in the Mozambique Portfolio. The project has surpassed all of

                         its project development outcome (PDO) indicator targets. Order fulfillment rates, a proxy for measuring commodity availability reached between 91 percent and 100 percent, much
                         higher than the planned targets of 75 percent and 85 percent. The fill rate for Depo-Provera, (an injectable contraceptive and popular among women in Mozambique), was 63 percent
                         in 2011. However, once the IDA-financed products arrived into the country in 2012, the fill rate was maintained between 91 to 100 percent for 2012 and 2013. For first-line ARVs, the
                         fill rates for 2011 were 96%, 97% for 2012 and 100% for the first three quarters of 2013. For malaria control, the project supported the procurement of almost 2.5 million long-lasting
                         insecticide-treated bed nets (LLINs) which have been or are planned to be distributed in five endemic provinces. In sites where the nets have been distributed, the project has
                         achieved household coverage rates of 95 percent and above.

                         The achievements have not come easy. The project faced multiple risks. However, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has shown proactive leadership and taken the necessary steps to
                         address risks identified during the implementation phase, including: (i) instituting a coordinating mechanism to mitigate the risks of a fragmented supply chain; (ii) seeking technical
                         assistance through other donors to assist in the data mining for the Results Framework; and (iii) instituting a team of people to provide daily support to the project and directly
                         reporting to senior management. But all these efforts have taken time to address and implement, requiring the project to be extended. The project has also benefited from a sustained
                         effort by the Ministry of Health, its direct partners in implementing the project (UNICEF, UNFPA), and the various organizations active in strengthening the supply chain in
                         Mozambique (USAID, PEPFAR, GF, SCMS and CDC). Together, they have all contributed to a coordinated effort in the management of the supplies, moving shipments backwards
                         and forwards in order not to overstock or under-stock the pipeline.
