                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Health Commodity Security Project, designed to assist in reducing the impact of the financial crisis and unpredictable financing on the availability of select public health
                         commodities, is closing in six months (December 2013). The project was approved in September 2010 and became effective in February 2011. The project was expected to close in
                         December 2012, however it was extended for an additional year to ensure that all the health commodities currently under acquisition are received in-country and available for the
                         2013 – 2014 pipeline. The project has disbursed 85% of the project funds and in the two and half years has contributed to ensuring that the availability of select public health
                         medicines and medical supplies in the supply chain was maintained between 86% - 96% (i.e. orders received from the provinces for select products (ARVs and Depo Provera used
                         as proxy to monitor the system) were at least fulfilled 85% - 96%, of what was requested, in line or exceeding with the original target set for the project.

                         The implementation of component 2 of strengthening the supply chain faced significant delays in the acquisition of materials such as computers and vehicles to support the logistics
                         management system and distribution due to weak procurement capacity. Recently a full team of fiduciary staff has been put in place which has helped with the acceleration of the
                         activities. The project has also supported financing for outsourced distribution that has ensured that the deliveries occurred over the course of the year. The project team also worked

                         very closely with the other donors and financiers to mitigate risks of delays. These included front-loading and exchanging activities that ensured that the supply chain operation
                         continue to function.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Implementation has improved since the last supervision mission, due, in part, to finally having a full project management team in place. While the project faced delays in procurement
                         of the health commodities for various reasons related to process breakdowns between the three institutions (UN, WB and the Ministry of Health), a strong coordinated response
                         among all the stakeholders involved in the supply chain ensured that the system was stocked to enable a fulfillment rate of at least 85%. ( 85% of the order requested by the
                         provinces were fulfilled). On the positive note, the medicines and medical supplies financed by the project has guaranteed availability of stocks of select public health commodities for
                         the 2013-2014 pipeline. This allows Government to focus on the planning for 2015 rather than responding to repeated crises such as delays in donor funding. However, the supply
                         chain remains fragmented and stock imbalances at facilities are likely to continue. The roll-out of the logistics management system (LMIS) financed by the project will eventually help
                         to improve inventory transparency and use. Although the project is closing in six months, the Bank will continue to support reforms to the supply chain as co-chair of the joint
                         Government of Mozambique/Donor Working Group of Pharmaceuticals as well as the proposed Procurement Financial Management for Results Project.
