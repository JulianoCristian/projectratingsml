                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Health Commodity Security Project was designed to assist in reducing the impact of the financial crisis of 2008 and the unpredictable financing on the availability of select public
                         health commodities. It was prepared in accordance with the Crisis Response Window (CRW) guidelines as a 2 year project. It became effective on February 11, 2010, and the closing
                         date was subsequently extended from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013. During the crisis, the country was significantly affected with the level of foreign development
                         assistance (both program and project) below projections at 1.6% of GDP, and project aid substantially lower than the pre-financial-crisis projections of 2.5% of GDP, leading to major
                         financing gap of select medicines and medical supplies especially related to public health.

                         The development objective of the project is to improve the availability of selected drugs and medical supplies in key distribution points. It includes two components; The first is
                         focused on the provision of essential health commodities and the second on strengthening supply chain management.

                         The project has surpassed all of its project development outcome (PDO) indicator targets. Order fulfillment rates , a proxy of commodity availability; reached between 95 percent and

                         98 percent, much higher than the planned targets of 75 percent and 85 percent. For Depo-Provera, an injectable contraceptive and popular among women, the fill rate in 2011, prior
                         to the availability of IDA-financed products, was at 63 percent; once the products arrived into the country in 2012, the fill rate was maintained between 91 to 100 percent. For first-line
                         ARVs, the fill rates for 2011 was 96%, 2012, 97% and 100% for the first three quarters of 2013. For malaria control, the project supported the procurement of almost 2.5 million long-
                         lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLINs) which have been or are planned to be distributed in five endemic provinces. In sites where the nets have been distributed, the project has
                         achieved household coverage rates of 95 percent and above. The project has disbursed over 95 percent of its funds. This is the highest disbursement achieved in the current World
                         Bank financed Mozambique portfolio.

                         The achievements have not come easy. The project faced multiple risks. However the Ministry of Health (MOH) has shown proactive leadership and taken the necessary steps to
                         address risks identified during the implementation phase, including: (i) instituting a coordinating mechanism to mitigate the risks of a fragmented supply chain; (ii) seeking technical
                         assistance through other donors to assist in the data mining for the Results Framework; and (iii) instituting a team of people to daily manage the delays in procurement processes,
                         directly reporting to senior management. The project was also helped by the strong support of partners (United National Children's Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund
                         (UNFPA), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), President's Initiative on HIV/AIDS (PEPFAR), The Global Fund (GF), Partnership of Supply Chain
                         Management (PfSCMS) and Center for Disease Control (CDC)) providing a coordinated effort in the management of the supplies, moving shipments backwards and forwards in order
                         not to overstock or under-stock the pipeline and can be considered best practice and a lesson for many of the public sector supply chains facing similar challenges of fragmented
                         acquisitions. In the case of first-line ARVs, once the commodities financed under the project were successfully procured and delivered to the central medical stores and incorporated
                         in the inventory, CMAM was able to maintain an average 5.0 months of stock (MOS) in its pipeline for 2011 (which is above the minimum requirement of 4 MOS and below the
                         maximum requirement of 9 MOS). In the preceding year in 2010, the system had an average of 3.72 MOS. In 2012, the system maintained an average of 4.2 MOS for year. It is
                         anticipated that the average of 3.4 MOS in 2013 will drop. This is mainly due to the fact that consumption doubled in 2012 compared to 2010 as a result of the Ministry's commitment
                         to accelerate and place more people with HIV on treatment.

                         The second component of strengthening the supply chain, which represents 12 percent of the overall project financing, faced numerous procurement delays. These challenges are
                         due to the broader, systemic public sector procurement issues that is impacting the entire Mozambique portfolio (and that the country office is addressing across the board) and also
                         due to internal procedural delays within the Ministry of Health. These procurement delays for computers and trucks are having a significant impact on the expansion and roll-out of the
                         LMIS to the district level and the strengthening of the distribution function between the provinces and the districts.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project is coming to a close in December 31, 2013. The Government of Mozambique has requested a six month extension to June 30, 2014 in order to provide additional time for
                         the remaining contracts to be awarded and or delivered leading to fully disbursed credit.

                         The Project was designed under the pilot Crisis Response Window (CRW) to provide urgent and predictable stop-gap financing to the Government of Mozambique to mitigate the
                         fallout of the global financial crisis of 2008 on the availability of key public health commodities. The project has served its intended purpose by assuring that the central medical stores
                         was able to fulfill the demand for these commodities.
