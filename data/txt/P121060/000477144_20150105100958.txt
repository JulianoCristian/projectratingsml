        The difference between the original target and the eventual result was due to: (i) the decision to use HCSP to finance
      only first-line treatment and not the full continuum of care (i.e., the potential need for a patient to receive second and/or
      third line treatment) which was estimated at US$ 190 per patient; and (ii) UNICEF’s highly effective sourcing of ARVs
      which enabled the agency to obtain a one-month supply for US$9.70 (or US$ 116 per patient per year), compared with
      the monthly cost of US$28.00 that other bulk purchasers were receiving.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      Country context. Following the end of its devastating civil war in 1992, Mozambique’s
economy improved steadily and grew at an average annual rate of 6-8% between 2006 and 2009,
resulting in a decline of 15% in the poverty headcount index. Despite these gains, poverty had
stagnated at 55% since 2003 and 75% of the population lived on an income of less than US$2 a
day. 6 In addition, Mozambique has been vulnerable to exogenous shocks, including recurrent
natural disasters, fluctuating prices for food and fuel, and varying levels of foreign assistance. After
the onset of the global economic crisis, projected economic growth rates for 2010-14 were
estimated at 4-5%. Such a decline qualified the country for assistance through the Crisis Response
Window (CRW) established to provide access to emergency funds to mitigate the crisis, especially
for countries dependent on foreign assistance such as Mozambique.
2.      Health sector situation. Over the period 2003-2011, Mozambique had made significant
strides in reducing child mortality. Demographic and Health Survey data showed that between 2003
and 2011: (i) neo-natal mortality had decreased from 37 to 30 (per 1,000 live births); (ii) infant
mortality had declined from 101 to 64 (per 1,000 live births); and (iii) under-five mortality had been
reduced from 153 to 97 (per 1,000 live births). Other child health indicators, including
immunization rates and malnutrition had remained relatively stable. Progress in improving maternal
health was more measured: prenatal care and skilled birth attendance increased from 84.5 percent to
90.6 percent, but estimates of maternal mortality rates remained unchanged at 408 per 100,000 live
births. Similarly, contraceptive prevalence remained stable at 11.7 percent (2003) and 11.3 percent
(in 2011).
3.     Over the same period, progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS had been achieved with
support from IDA7 and other development partners: (i) HIV prevalence as a percentage of adults
aged 15–49 years remained stable (at 11.0-11.5 percent); and (ii) while the number of persons living
with HIV increased from 1.1 to 1.5 million, 36 percent of people with advanced HIV infection and
54 percent of pregnant women were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART).
4.      Government funding for health, as a percentage of the total budget, had declined from 15.0
percent (2003) to 12.8 percent (2007) and reached a low of 7.8 percent in 2011. During this period,
the Common Fund (financed by 15 out of 26 development partners in the country and critical for
financing needed public health commodities8) was suffering from the external shock of the global
financial crisis and the internal shock of the misuse of funds.
5.     Country Assistance Strategy / Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Health Commodity
Security Project (HCSP) was consistent with the Ministry of Health’s sector wide approach9 and the
National Integrated Plan (2009-2012) to achieve millennium development goals (MDGs) 4 (reduce


6
  Mozambique ranked 172 of 177 countries on the 2008-09 Human Development Index.
7
  IDA’s intervention in the health sector comprised three investment projects: HIV/AIDS Response project (FY03),
Health Service Delivery Project (FY09), and Health Commodity Security Project (FY11).
8
  Donor support for pharmaceutical supplies decreased 38% between 2008 and 2009; and future projections (particularly
for ARVs) were not optimistic, as The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) had not disbursed for
more than a year while reporting arrangements were being worked out, and the US financ ed President’s Emergency
Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) was expected to reduce its funding for ARVs by 10-15% in 2011/2012.)
9
  Previous Bank projects had participated in the common fund, but the ongoing Health Service Delivery Project did not;
HSDP and HCSP implementation were, however, undertaken in close cooperation with other development partners to
secure financing for key public health commodities.
                                                                                                                    9
child mortality), 5 (reduce maternal mortality), and 6 (combat HIV, malaria and other diseases) 10.
The HCSP’s focus on commodities was expected to promote synergies among existing Bank
projects, including: (i) the Health Service Delivery Project (HSDP) with the objective of improving
access to health services; and (ii) the HIV/AIDS Response project with the objective of reducing the
spread of HIV infection among the general population and mitigating its effects through a
multisectoral approach.
6.      The project was expected to support the Government’s Absolute Poverty Reduction Plan of
Action (PARPA II 2006-2009) and the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS 2008-2011) by: (i)
contributing to the Government’s poverty reduction objectives for the most vulnerable groups
(pregnant women and children under five), those living in rural areas, and the poor; (ii)
complementing the Bank’s health program in Mozambique and leveraging its existing advantages
for procurement and distribution of goods; and (iii) helping Mozambique respond to the fall-out
from the global economic crisis with the injection (over a relatively short period) of spending on
essential commodities (in the areas of HIV/AIDS, malaria, TB, and reproductive and child health)
and on the logistical requirements to ensure the availability of these essential commodities.
7.      Finally, the project was closely aligned with other strategic Bank priorities (including the
Reproductive Health Action Plan 2010-15) and adhered to the selectivity principle by financing
core commodities (including those related to malaria prevention, immunizations, and HIV/AIDS
treatment), as well as improving availability of drugs and commodities. By protecting spending for
select public health sector commodities, the proposed project was consistent with the objectives of
the CRW, which allowed the Bank to be one of the few financiers able to respond quickly to fill the
financing gap for commodities in Mozambique.
8.      Bank involvement was based on the rationale that: (i) public health programs were well-
established internationally as cost-effective interventions; and (ii) the proposed commodities would
respond to the infectious diseases which disproportionately affect the poor and contribute to their
control which has large, positive externalities. Bank support was also seen as an opportunity to raise
the profile of Supply Chain Management (SCM) within the Ministry of Health.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
9.    The project development objective (PDO) is to improve the availability of selected drugs
and medical supplies in Key Distribution Points in the Recipient’s territory.
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
10.     Neither the PDO, nor the key indicators were revised.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries and Benefits
11.    By providing financial resources towards the estimated 2011-12 funding gap for key health
commodities, the project was expected to benefit approximately 6 million people, including the
most vulnerable groups, who are most dependent on the public sector for access to health services
and most likely to suffer from the effects of epidemics. Specifically, the project targeted women
accessing family planning, children aged 6 to 59 months requiring vaccination against measles,
People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), families sleeping under LLINs, and adults and children
seeking TB treatment. Of these beneficiaries, 58% were expected to be female.


10
  Most of these interventions are dependent on essential medicines and medical supplies to be in place to achieve the
results and many of these supplies are financed by external donors.
                                                                                                                        10
12.     Benefits included: (i) the increased likelihood that key services (family planning, malaria,
immunization and HIV/AIDS) would not suffer from the unavailability of commodities; and (ii) the
strengthening of selected distribution and logistics management functions of the supply chain,
which would have a spillover effect on the overall delivery of health services.
1.5 Original Components
13.    Component 1: Provision of Essential Health Commodities (Initial estimate: $34.5
million; Actual cost: $31.9 million or 92.5 percent of original project cost). This component
financed the procurement of much-needed selected essential commodities to prevent and treat
HIV/AIDS (ARVs and diagnostic test kits), malaria (LLINs), TB (drugs and reagents), and promote
reproductive (contraceptives) and child health (vaccines). It also financed the operating costs
associated with the distribution of commodities.
14.     Component 2: Strengthening Supply Chain Management (Initial estimate: $4.5 million;
Actual cost: $6.1 million or 136 percent original project cost). This component financed
strengthening of several activities identified in the Logistics Master Plan, specifically, the
distribution system between the central, provincial, and district warehouses by providing essential
inputs: (i) trucks to deliver commodities from the provincial warehouses to the district warehouses;
(ii) technical assistance to prepare and implement fleet management plans; and (iii) distribution
costs from the port to the district warehouses. The component also financed: (i) computer hardware
for expanding the logistics management system nationwide; and (ii) project management costs,
including operating costs and audit services.
1.6 Revised Components
15.     The project components were not revised.
1.7 Other significant changes
16.    The project was restructured and the Financing Agreement was amended twice: (i) on
October 3, 2012 (Level 2) to extend the project’s closing date by twelve months from December 31,
2012 to December 31, 2013; and (ii) on December 23, 2013 (Level 2) to extend the project’s closing
date by an additional six months from December 31, 2013 to June 30, 2014.
2.    Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
17.    Project preparation. The HCSP was among the first to: (i) be processed under the IDA
CRW as a stand-alone project (as distinct from an additional financing operation); and (ii) adopt the
Risk-based Investment Lending procedures focusing on results and risks. This project qualified for
express-processing under these new procedures and was prepared quickly with the concept review
in May 2010 and appraisal in June 2010. A post-appraisal/pre-negotiations review was organized11
in August 2010, where the team was requested to clarify the wording of the PDO as well as
implementation arrangements from central to district and facility levels. Negotiations were
conducted in August 2010, and the project was approved in September 2010.
18.     Soundness of the background analysis. Project preparation analyzed the reasons for the




11
  Under the procedures for the fast tracked CRW, an appraisal review is organized instead of a Decision Meeting. The
complete arrangements for the Pilot Crisis Response Window were adopted by the Board on December 10, 2009.
                                                                                                                   11
projected commodity gaps12 and estimated the immediate needs and financial gaps for: anti retro-
viral drugs (ARV) and rapid HIV test kits, tuberculosis (TB) drugs and laboratory reagents,
contraceptives, vaccines and vaccination material, and long-lasting insecticide treated bed nets
(LLIN). In addition, the MOH, with other key development partners (USAID, WHO, UNICEF,
UNFPA, and CHAI) carried out a medium-term expenditure plan for TB, estimated the required
quantities of reproductive health supplies, and calculated the need for vaccines and bednets.
19.     In addition, project preparation also assessed MOH’s weaknesses in procuring and
distributing commodities and in financial management.13 In 2008, prior to project preparation, a
review of pharmacy sector management practices had identified systemic weaknesses in warehouse
operations including weak inventory management, poor warehouse infrastructure, and lack of
materials and handling equipment to move and store the commodities. Throughout 2009-10, MOH,
with assistance from the PEPFAR-financed Supply Chain Management Systems Project (SCMS),
UNICEF, UNFPA, and the Global Fund, addressed these shortcomings by: (i) assessing warehouse
operations and security risks; and (ii) developing a Pharmaceutical Logistics Master Plan (PLMP).
20.     The PLMP described the fragmented supply chain management system, with several entities
involved in forecasting, procurement, warehousing and distribution. The distribution system was
identified as the main challenge for improved SCM with the major constraints comprising poor
roads, limited availability of transport, and a lack of funding for fuel at provincial and district levels.
Implementation of the PLMP was expected to reform the procurement and distribution of drugs and
other medical supplies with interventions covering all aspects of SCM, including forecasting and
procurement, warehousing, training, monitoring and evaluation, and distribution.
21.    Finally, implementation arrangements were based on the Health Service Delivery Project
(HSDP), which had conducted a thorough institutional assessment in 2007. An independent and
updated analysis of the proposed institutional arrangements within Government and among the
implementing agencies was not conducted during preparation.
22.    Government commitment. Government commitment for Component 1 was demonstrated by
close cooperation with the development partners through the technical working group on
pharmaceuticals (GTM) comprised of both government and donors. The GTM cooperates in
determining financing gaps in the selected commodities and plays a key role in quantifying
procurement requirements and supporting distribution through the Central Medical Stores
(CMAM). Government commitment for Component 2 was shown by the development of the PLMP,
which proposed the adoption of a single integrated supply chain as well as other reforms for the
procurement and distribution of drugs and other medical supplies by MOH.
23.    Assessment of project design. Based on the linkage between the availability of health
commodities and health outcomes 14 and on the lessons from previous financial crises,15 the project
was intended to secure the supply of key, high-impact public health inputs by: (i) procuring selected
drugs and medical supplies in response to the anticipated reduction in donor financing of
commodities; and (ii) strengthening the supply chain needed to deliver the commodities. Because of
the emergency nature of the project, its design was focused on four related considerations.


12
   HIV/AIDS funding had been delayed; tuberculosis and reproductive health funding had been reduced; malaria
funding was inadequate for scaling up of bed net coverage; and Government funding of vaccines had not been sufficient
to control recent epidemics. See Annex 2, Table 2.1 of the Project Appraisal Document.
13
   Although the Bank had financed several previous projects, fiduciary capacity suffered from constant staff turnover.
14
   Modeling exercises have linked the availability of health commodities with improved outcomes.
15
   See World Bank, “Protecting Pro-Poor Health Services During Financial Crises” (March 2009).
                                                                                                                   12
24.     First, the design was very specific about: (i) which drugs and medical supplies would be
made available; and (ii) where (as indicated in the PDO) they would be made available. Key health
commodities were carefully selected based on projected needs for HIV/AIDS and TB drugs, malaria
prevention, measles vaccination, and injectable contraceptives. ARVs were to be delivered to 250
service delivery points; contraceptives to the ten provincial drug warehouses; bed nets to be
distributed to the four provinces with the highest incidence of malaria; and vaccination materials to
be integrated into the national vaccination campaigns.
25.     Second, the design comprised only two components and a limited number of procurements.
Component 1 (88 percent of the project’s proceeds) financed the purchase and shipment to Maputo.
Component 2 (12 percent) financed the delivery of the commodities from Maputo to the key
distribution points (including warehouse material, transport, and distribution costs) and limited
measures to improve the planning, inventory management, and distribution of future pipeline
supplies (including dedicated computers to expand the logistics information management system
and fleet management methods to improve transportation of the commodities until a more
permanent transport management policy option was adopted). 16
26.     In addition, the number, scope, and responsibility for the planned procurements were
limited: (i) Component 1 comprised three procurement contracts, with the three agencies (UNICEF,
UNFPA, and WHO/GDF); and (ii) Component 2 comprised only two International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) processes (for vehicles and computer hardware and one consultant contract to
develop a transportation plan for the medicines supply chain). Finally, distribution costs from
central to provincial levels were to be financed under the project.
27.     Third, the design attempted to combine stop gap financing for selected drugs and medical
supplies with initial support for strengthening SCM systems. The immediate response relied on
arrangements with UN agencies (UNICEF, UNFPA and WHO/GDF) as suppliers while the longer-
term response involved building the capacity of CMAM to assure effective procurement and
distribution. Discussion during the QER review focused on whether the two-year CRW time frame
was sufficient to achieve the longer-term objectives.
28.     Fourth, project implementation arrangements were to be integrated into existing institutions
and procedures as designed in the HSDP. Rather than create a freestanding project implementation
unit, the Directorate of Finance and Administration (DAF), with support from its procurement unit
(UGEA) and an external procurement consultant (already contracted by MOH under HSDP to
provide assistance in World Bank procurement procedures and general capacity building) would be
responsible for project implementation.
29.      Risks and risk mitigation. The QER panel noted the challenges of an emergency operation
which involved: (i) contracts with UN agencies to supply key health commodities; and (ii)
Government systems to distribute them. With respect to the UN agencies, Annex 2 of the PAD
presented a detailed analysis of the risks and benefits of the different procurement options based on:
(i) the length of the procurement process (lead time); (ii) the quality of the commodities procured,
(iii) cost of the commodities; and (iv) contract leverage. Based on these criteria, the UN agencies
were considered to be the most cost-effective option due to: (i) their recognized expertise of the
commodities being procured as well as long-term contract agreements with the major suppliers
(providing extra leverage for lower costs); (ii) their capacity to deliver within the needed timeframe;


16
  The Bank’s decision to procure transport (trucks) and computers was based especially on discussions with USAID
and the Global Fund concerning the feasibility of each institution to procure these goods.
                                                                                                                   13
and (iii) their established mechanisms for assuring adequate quality. Perhaps most importantly, the
UN agencies could ensure quality, while the GOM had very limited capabilities. Pre-shipment
testing by an independent quality assurance laboratory (a standard for assuring minimizing quality
risks) was rarely applied and post-shipment testing was conducted at a very basic level.17
30.      With respect to the Government systems-related risks, the project design reduced them by:
(i) integrating its support within the policy and program improvements identified by the PLMP; (ii)
financing only very specific inputs; and (iii) strengthening two essential elements of supply chain
performance: transport and inventory management.
31.     Quality at Entry. A QER was conducted in June 2010.
2.2 Implementation
32.     The project was approved by the World Bank's Board of Executive Directors on September
30, 2010 and signed on November 17, 2010. A single condition of effectiveness was included in the
Financing Agreement, that “the Operational Manual has been issued and adopted by the Recipient,
and approved by the Association.” A draft Operational Manual was submitted to the Association
prior to negotiations on August 26, 2010. However, as defined in the Financing Agreement, this
condition comprised a number of detailed provisions which were met at effectiveness.18 The project
became effective on February 15, 2011 and was originally expected to close on December 31, 2012.
33.     Implementation overview. As shown in Section G of the Data Sheet, between February and
December of 2011, more than 60 percent of the project’s proceeds were disbursed, essentially for
the large, initial UN contracts. Subsequently, disbursements became more strategic, based on the
current commodity needs and the remaining funds. By the project’s closing, 97.4 percent of the
funds had been disbursed. Section G also shows that both the PDO and the Implementation Progress
were consistently rated Moderately Satisfactory. The component ratings were also Moderately
Satisfactory through December 2012; over the last 18 months, Component 1 was rated Satisfactory
while Component 2 was rated Moderately Satisfactory.
34.     Project implementation confronted four major challenges: (i) execution of the contracts with
the UN agencies; (ii) the timeframe for project implementation; (iii) the use of country mechanisms
for contract management; and (iv) the arrangements for project implementation. A fourth challenge,
the collection and analysis of information on project performance, is discussed in Section 2.3 below.
35.     Execution of the UN contracts. Project preparation with the UN agencies had included: (i)
detailed planning for the quantities of the specific commodities; (ii) Bank approval for each of the
UN contracts specified at design stage; and (iii) preparation of draft agreements for the delivery of
the goods. Subsequently, procurement was delayed by: (i) the signature of the Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) with each of the institutions involved (Ministry of Health, UNICEF, WHO,
and UNFPA) 19 ; and (ii) the unanticipated requirement to re-submit each of the procurement
packages to the Bank for review.20 Despite these initial delays, the project-financed commodities




17
   The Bank’s reputational risk with regard to sub -standard or counterfeit products was an important concern given the
fact that preliminary studies from WHO showed as high as 45% sub-standard or counterfeit products in some African
countries.
18
   See Financing Agreement, Schedule 2, Section I.4.
19
   For example, approval of the UNICEF arrangements took four months.
20
   Despite the agreement on procurement arrangements prior to effectiveness, Bank procedures at the time required that
all procurements be subsequently justified. This requirement was eventually dropped for CRW projects.
                                                                                                                     14
(including first line ARVs, HIV test kits, long-lasting insecticide nets, and childhood vaccines21)
began entering the pipeline in 2012. Further, though delayed, the assurance of guaranteed and
predictable financing for these commodities by HCSP enabled other partners (such as USAID) to
bring forward some of their projected shipments to 2011.
36.     Timeframe for project implementation. Throughout 2011-2012, Bank management was
informed of the Task Team’s concern that the two-year timeframe was insufficient to achieve the
project’s objectives; in September 2012, the project closing date was extended by one year to
December 31, 2013.22 The extension allowed for the savings realized on the initial purchase of the
commodities to be used flexibly by the HCSP (in collaboration with its partners) for additional
smaller procurements throughout 2012 and 2013 to respond to specific needs and to provide the
necessary time for the delivery in-country of these additional health commodities.
37.     Country mechanisms for contract management. The project’s timeframe was more
problematic for improving supply chain management. The systemic issues related to SCM had been
clearly identified during project preparation: (i) a fragmented supply chain management; (ii)
inadequate financial resources for transport; and (iii) insufficient information on the distribution of
commodities. However, the project’s response within the two-year timeframe was necessarily
limited to selected activities in the PLMP which were important for HCSP’s success but which
other partners, for various reasons, could not finance. These included: (i) procurement of vehicles
for the distribution of commodities; (ii) operational costs associated with distribution; and (iii)
computers to improve the visibility and transparency of inventory. In each case, however, the
interventions involved a combination of lengthy and complicated Bank and Government
(Administrative Tribunal) procurement procedures, which affected the overall Bank portfolio in
Mozambique.23
38.     Arrangements for project implementation. In addition to the issues related to the national
context for procurement, project implementation was also negatively affected by the decision to
integrate responsibilities within MOH. Changes at the most senior levels of the ministry as well as
constant staff turnover in those departments responsible for project implementation contributed to
insufficient familiarity with World Bank procurement and financial management procedures. Once
a project management unit was established in 2013, these problems were reduced.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
39.     M&E design. Given the planned two-year duration of the HCSP, the availability of suitable
indicators in MOH’s (and especially CMAM’s) routine data collection and the undesirability of
establishing parallel M&E systems, the project proposed to rely on the existing M&E systems. In
addition, the M&E annex included two features not seen in many PADs. First, because the
indicators for the project were deemed to be fairly technical and not easily understood by those not
familiar with the terminology, the PAD contained a clear description of the proposed indicators. 24


21
   There were delays for two commodities: (i) contraceptives due to the inability of two manufacturers to deliver
contraceptives on time as a result of high global demand and a backlog of orders; and (ii) anti-TB drugs as a result of
issues related to WHO internal arrangements. Subsequently, anti-TB drugs were procured by the Global Fund, and Bank
funds were reallocated to the other commodities.
22
   The Task Team had requested eighteen months to extend the project’s closing date to June 30, 2014. Neither MOH
nor the Bank seriously considered project restructuring because: (i) project funds had been substantially disbursed; and
(ii) Component 2’s two major procurements were already at the bidding stage and deemed to still be relevant.
23
   A Country Portfolio Performance Review in 2013 determined that the average length of these combined procedures
for a procurement was 574 days.
24
   Both the decision on design and the annex on M&E were endorsed by the QER panel.
                                                                                                                     15
Second, as part of the preparation’s estimate of needs, costs, and required financing, the PAD
analyzed the number of expected beneficiaries and particularly the proportion of female
beneficiaries. The link between these calculations and the annual target values in the results
framework is evident and useful.
40.      The Results Framework (RF) comprised all of the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) as well
as the beneficiary targets, and presented the method for calculating results. Sources of data and
institutional responsibilities for collecting and analyzing the data were clearly defined in the RF.
41.    Implementation. The capacity of CMAM’s staff to analyze the existing data proved to be
weaker than originally assessed during project preparation. In addition, certain indicators (e.g., lead
time and lead-time variability25) were made virtually meaningless by the constant amendments to
the supply plans, the procurement schedules, and the resulting delivery of commodities outside the
contractual terms specified in the MOUs.
42.     Beginning in November 2012, the Bank noted the need for better information to monitor
project performance as defined in the RF and provided additional support to the Ministry to analyze
the data which had been collected. The roll-out of the medical supply management information
system (SIMAM), 26 which benefited from project support, was a critical step in establishing an
operational M&E system. Subsequently, the GTM has endorsed the results of these indicators on a
quarterly basis as a monitoring tool for determining the state of the supply chain performance.
43.     Utilization. Procurement delays and the constant adjustment of orders required: (i) close
communication between the Bank and the other development partners in the country (USAID,
Global Fund, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNITAID and CHAI); and (ii) flexibility in organizing the arrival
of procurement orders to reduce the risk of stock-outs. Such constant adjustment of orders relied on
careful monitoring of the supply pipeline, which was aided by the availability of information
provided by CMAM. Analysis of this information was strengthened by technical assistance
provided by a USAID-funded contractor SCMS and a Logistics Committee, co-chaired by CMAM
and UNICEF. As noted previously, the coordinated response among stakeholders contributed
significantly to achievement of the project’s target of an 85% fill rate.
44.     M&E is rated Substantial, based on the view that there were only minor shortcomings in
the design, implementation, and utilization of the monitoring and evaluation system.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
45.     Environment. The project was initially rated “B” in the Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet
but was re-categorized as “C” at appraisal, as the project did not involve either construction or
service delivery. In addition, a satisfactory healthcare waste management plan had been developed
for HSDP. However, due to previous warehousing issues27 and the project’s emphasis on timely
procurement and distribution of commodities, expiration was an issue. Building on supply chain




25
   The data required (e.g., fill rates and lead-time variability) are industry standards, and the project appraisal confirmed
their availability. However, implementation support missions showed that (CMAM) was not able (without TA from the
USAID project) to extract data from their Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system.
26
   SIMAM is an electronic logistics management information system that is rolled at all the districts and major hospitals,
provincial and central warehouses. It captures three critical data on inventory management and forecasting:
consumption, stock-on-hand and losses and adjustments such as transfers of stocks.
27
   In April 2011, large quantities of drugs in the CMAM central warehouse were found to be expired or very close to
expiration (all of it purchased with USAID and GF funding).
                                                                                                                          16
strengthening measures instituted by MOH in 2011 (prior to the project),28 project implementation:
(i) staggered the delivery of goods to manage the volume entering the supply chain at any given
time; and (ii) improved stock monitoring with the rollout of the LMIS to increase the visibility of
the inventory.
46.     Project supervision missions closely monitored the state of drug stocks and the proportion of
expired drugs to ensure that no medical waste management issues would arise during project
implementation. At the end of 2013, expired products amounted to 1% of the total estimated
pharmaceutical budget for 2012 and 5% for 2013.29 None of the expired products had been financed
by the project and all were subject to strict guidelines for disposal.
47.     Procurement, Disbursement, and Financial Management. Ratings for procurement and
financial management were mixed MS and MU ratings throughout implementation.
48.    Procurement. Packages were split between large-scale procurements included in the Bank-
approved procurement plan and the smaller-scale procurements included in MOH’s Treasury Plan.
49.     Given the limited large-scale procurements, a plan for the 24 month period was prepared and
procurement arrangements were deemed satisfactory at negotiations. It was agreed that the
consultant hired to provide procurement services to HSDP would assist HCSP whenever required.
Nevertheless, delays ensued, due primarily to the Bank’s requirement that each order receive a non-
objection. That is, even after the decision to use the UN agencies, HCSP was required to justify
using them for each of the ten total orders to ensure that the price was reasonable and the quality
assurance processes were still in place. Communications issues followed with the UN agencies and
MOH, who were unclear why each order had to go through a review and non-objection process.30
Despite these difficulties, the major procurements were completed by early 2012.
The Treasury-financed procurement plan also encountered delays, due to insufficient procurement
capacity in UGEA which execution has been historically hampered by lack of ownership, poor and
fragmented coordination/management, too many internal/MoH approvals, weak technical capacity
and the approval requirements demanded by the Administrative Tribunal. However, the Ministry of
Health has addressed some of these issues hiring in 2012 a professional consultant to support the
procurement function and enable the project to accelerate some of the key activities that were
procurement dependent. These sources of delay were a systemic problem for the entire Bank
portfolio. As analyzed in the 2011 and 2012 Country Portfolio Performance Reviews, the average
time for implementing the tender process was 574 days (far surpassing the target of 235 days), and
the Country Director raised the issue on several occasions in letters to the Minister of Planning and
Development. Based on the post procurement review carried out in November 2013, the overall
procurement risk of the project was Moderate and performance Moderately Satisfactory (MS).

50.     An important procurement issue arose during the last year of project implementation. With
approximately US$3million remaining, MOH requested the purchase of 80 vehicles to strengthen
distribution between the District and the health facilities. Though not a core activity of the project, it




28
   Inventories were quantified at all levels, stock management procedures were established, and strict guidelines were
introduced for the disposal of expired goods, including shipment to South Africa for incineration.
29
   The main expired products were pediatric aids drugs and laboratory supplies, for which projections are very difficult
due to the volatility in demand.
30
   Communication was also affected by disruptions in internet service.
                                                                                                                       17
fit well within its mandate. 31 Consequently, the procurement was approved as a National
Competitive Bid (NCB) with post procurement review. Problems ensued: (i) The MOH launched a
tender for procurement of 80 vehicles under NCB, bids were received and opened on due time,
evaluation conducted and potential winning bidder identified (ii) after all this process, the client
requested that the NCB be cancelled and permission granted to procure through UNOPS; (ii) the
case was submitted to the Bank in January 2014; (iii) in May 2014, the Bank rejected the request
taking into account the weak rationale for cancellation of this procurement process which may
trigger a complaint from the lowest evaluated bid; (iv) MOH went ahead with the NCB, signing the
contract on June 12, 2014, but did not receive clearance from the Administrative Tribunal until
October 10, 2014; and (v) the Bank procurement services determined that the vehicles were
received after project closing. Since a number of the vehicles had already been paid for and
delivered, this payment was deemed to be an ineligible expenditure.
51.      Financial Management. A Financial Management (FM) assessment was carried out at
appraisal and found that: (i) financial management arrangements within MOH were acceptable; and
(ii) the implementing entities were compliant with the Bank's financial management requirements.
Overall, risk was rated as “Moderate”. In December 2011, a FM supervision mission recommended
that the project engage a FM advisor to train and coach DAF personnel handling project FM
matters. By June 2012 FM supervision concluded that: (i) FM arrangements were not satisfactory;
(ii) the FM advisor had not been recruited; and (iii) the audit report for the fiscal year ended 31
December 2011 was overdue. The 31 December 2012 audit report identified ineligible expenditures
which were refunded to the project designated account. Additional problems were identified in the
June 2013 implementation support mission, including weaknesses in the system of internal control
and non-compliance with key internal control procedures. Subsequently, MOH recruited adequate
staff and implemented the FM action plan and the 2013 audit report had an unqualified opinion; the
overall FM performance of the project was Moderately Satisfactory.
52.    There was, however, a problem of outstanding ineligible expenditures at project closing as
explained above. This situation is currently being rectified.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
53.     Programmatically, the logistics master plan, initiated in 2010 but never officially adopted,
was superseded by the Pharmaceutical Logistic Strategic Plan (2013-17) and the Supply Chain
Logistics Plan of Action (2013), which aim to (i) improve the quality and timeliness of information
flow between health units, districts, provinces, and the Central Medical Store (CMAM); (ii) move to
routine, scheduled delivery of commodities to the different levels of the supply chain; and (iii)
strengthen supervision and technical audit of the supply chain by CMAM. Under the Logistics Plan
approved by the Ministry, CMAM has been elevated from a unit under the DNAM (Direcção
Nacional de Assistência Médica) to a National Directorate, which receives and executes its budget
directly through the Government’s on-line administrative and financing system.
54.    Financially, the high-dependence on external financing 32 and its unpredictability would
normally be problematic for the next phase. However, as the development partners have identified


31
   The request was justified by: (i) the newly adopted supply chain strategic plan; (ii) a USAID report indicating that the
biggest distribution bottleneck was between the district and the facility; and (iii) the possibility (with HCSP support) of
covering all of the districts in the country.
32
   Domestic funds account for approximately 25% of public health expenditures, 25% are financed through the on-
budget pooled sector fund (PROSAÚDE) comprising fourteen donors, and 50% of public funds are provided outside of
PROSAÚDE, with the majority provided off-budget through vertical disease programs (such as HIV, TB and Malaria).
                                                                                                                        18
commodity availability as a priority, and progress is likely to be made in strengthening
procurement, storage, and distribution of medical supplies and goods in line with the approved
PLMP. In addition, a new Bank financed project on Public Financial Management for Results
Program (P4R) will also support strengthening the efficiency and transparency of supply chain
management.
55.    Institutionally, the results focus and flexibility of the P4R Program responds to MOH’s
recognition that improved supply chain performance will require better incentives at the different
levels of the supply chain and better coordination among the national programs focusing on
individual diseases (HIV, malaria, amongst others.). Although the HCSP is closed, the Bank will
continue to support reforms to the supply chain as a member of the joint Government /Donor
Working Group on Pharmaceuticals and through the new financing.
3.   Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
56.    The overall relevance of the project is rated Substantial. The project’s supply objectives
were highly relevant for the crisis period, and the supply chain management objectives remain
highly relevant for the post-crisis period. The project’s design was, however, only modestly
relevant; the design responded adequately to the urgency for maintaining supplies of key
commodities, but there were shortcomings related to the measures for procuring the inputs to
support the strengthening the supply chain.
57.     Relevance of the project objectives. Based on the development of policies and strategies
orienting HCSP, project relevance is rated High. From the Bank’s perspective, the project
contributed to the objectives of the Crisis Response Window, the Reproductive Health Action Plan
(2010-15), and the Country Partnership Strategy. From the Government’s perspective, the project
supported the PARPA’s overall health objectives and more specifically the PLMP and the Supply
Chain Plan of Action (2013). These documents comprise: (i) a performance indicator framework to
monitor progress and continuity across annual and longer-term strategic plans; and (ii) a coherent
platform to coordinate (through the joint Government of Mozambique/Donor Working Group on
Pharmaceuticals) the contributions of development partners on supply chain strengthening.
58.     Relevance of the project design. The CRW provided an instrument for the Bank to respond
quickly to the global financial crisis33 by: (i) relying on previous sectoral work to quickly identify
the most efficient channels to mitigate the crisis impact on the poor; (ii) using long-standing country
portfolios to intervene quickly in scaling-up satisfactory programs; and (iii) facilitating cooperation
with other partner agencies to ensure consistency between short-term crisis mitigation and long-
term development objectives.
59.    The project design comprised two components and expedited implementation measures, but
there were shortcomings. First, the project design underestimated the difficulties of combining an
emergency response component and a systems strengthening component. While logically related,
the components involved different actors, timeframes, and procedures which were not adequately
reconciled during implementation. Second, due to the lack of an updated institutional assessment,
the project design underestimated the complexity of the implementation arrangements in several
respects: (i) the duration of negotiations with the UN agencies to carry out the major project

procurements; (ii) the requirement by the Bank’s Regional Procurement Management Team to
subsequently justify the agreed-on procurements; (iii) the delays related to the review of Component
2 procurements by the Administrative Tribunal; and (iv) the effects of integrating project
management within MOH, which hampered project implementation over the initial 18 months (until
a Project Implementation Unit was created).
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
60.   The project development objective was to improve the availability of selected drugs and
medical supplies in Key Distribution Points in the Recipient’s territory. Project efficacy is rated as
Substantial on the basis of High results for Component 1 and Modest results for Component 2.
61.     Assessment of outcomes is based on: (i) the Outcome and Intermediate Outcome Indicator
results in Section F of the Data Sheet; and (ii) the annexes summarizing the outputs and results. The
data are presented below by PDO and component.
Outcome Objective 1: Ensure the availability of Essential Health Commodities
62.     Bank financing enabled the project to procure and distribute inputs to reduce anticipated
shortfalls and improve the availability of commodities essential for: (i) preventing and/or treating
HIV/AIDS, malaria, and TB; and (ii) promoting reproductive and child vaccination.
63.     HIV/AIDS. As described in Annex 2, the project financed diagnostic test kits for 3.3 million
tests (in 2011) and ARV packs for 87.5 million treatment doses (over the period 2011-13). Fill
rates34) were not calculated for the diagnostic kits, but data from UNAIDS shows that the annual
number of persons tested, after slowing in 2011, has increased considerably over the last two years.

64.    Fill rates for the treatment of AIDS cases exceeded the project’s targets and are shown in the
following table:

65.     The project’s contribution to the availability of ARVs was essential in meeting the increased
need for drugs and maintaining the maximum number of patients treated. As the following table
shows, HCSP-financed products accounted for almost a third of treatments provided in 2012 and for
129,405 (or 23 percent) patients receiving treatment in 2012-13. Moreover, the table shows that: (i)
the proportion of patients needing and receiving treatment had declined between 2010 and 2012 and
only rebounded in 2013; and (ii) without the project’s support, there could have been a significant
shortfall in the treatment of cases.


34
  Fill rate is the proportion of commodities ordered by the provinces and filled by CMAM. Although it was intended to
measure ARVs at 250 distribution points, changes in the reporting to CMAM precluded this measure, and the fill rate
for the provinces was used.

66.     Reproductive health commodities. As described in Annex 2, the project financed the
procurement of three types of commodities: (i) 4.5 million cycles of contraceptive pills; (ii) 570,000
units of injectable contraception (Depo Provera); and (iii) 82,600 packs of long-term contraceptives
(Jadelle). Fill rates for injectable contraceptives are shown below:

Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Nets (LLINs) over the period 2011-13. As shown below, the
project procured 2,215,300 LLINs and distributed more than 90% of them. The remaining 273,977
                                                                                                                    21

Assuming that two persons sleep under each bed net distributed by the project, the procurement and
distribution of bed nets contributed to the protection of 1,405,846 children and pregnant women
persons in 2012-13 and an additional 1,284,484 children and pregnant women in 2013.
71.    Vaccines. As described in Annex 2, the project financed 2.4 million doses of measles
vaccine (in 2011) and 8.1 million syringes (in 2011-12). As shown in the table below, the project
financing filled significant gaps in the procurement of measles vaccines and syringes in 2011:

Outcome Objective 2: Strengthen Supply Chain Management
75.     Bank financing supported the Ministry’s efforts to procure, store, transport/distribute, and
monitor the commodities acquired by the project. There were no outcome indicators for this
objective, but there were four intermediate outcomes.
76.    Procurement. To ensure timely and cost-effective acquisition of the required commodities,
                                                                                                           23
procurement arrangements were agreed on with UNICEF (testing and treatment of HIV/AIDS,
bednets, TB drugs and reagents, vaccines, and syringes) and UNFPA (contraceptive materials).
Supplier performance varied over the life of the project, as shown in the table below:
                             Table 12: Orders received according to the agreed upon schedule
                                                             2011        2012        2013       Total
                 IOI 1: % of orders received according to   25.0%       61.5%       31.3%       49.2%
                 the agreed upon schedule
                 Source: Pipeline data

Overall, about half of the orders were received within the time limits prescribed by the agreements
with the two UN agencies. The percentage of supplier lead time variability (IOI 2)35 was 107%.
These results were far better than those of the government, as demonstrated by the experience of the
Bank-financed Health Service Development Project.
77.    Storage. The project financed warehouse renovations (Beira), forklifts, installation of fire
extinguishers (CMAM), recruitment of temporary workers (including uniforms, helmets, etc.), and
operational costs (including maintenance, cleaning, etc.).
78.    Transport/Distribution. The project purchased a fleet of assorted vehicles and financed the
operating costs for the distribution of the commodities. Preparation of a fleet management plan (IOI
3) was not achieved, but a workshop on fleet management was conducted.
79.      Monitoring. The project contributed to the expansion of the logistics management
information system (SIMAM) with the purchase of computers, office equipment, registers and
finance operational costs associated with. Over the period 2011-2014, SIMAM was expanded from
5 information points (provinces/hospitals/districts) to 121. Of a total of 150 districts, 44 (29 percent)
were equipped solely as a result of HCSP. CMAM’s capabilities were also strengthened, and as a
result, the project was able to monitor the stock situation, the consumption patterns, and the rate and
disposition of expired commodities in the districts.
80.     Overall achievement result. The results for Component 1 (representing 88.5 percent of
project funds) generally exceeded the initial targets though with some delay and are rated High.
Both the stock status reports, demonstrating the availability of key commodities over the last three
years, and the data on the number of beneficiaries served over the critical 2011-2013 period show
the importance of the project. The results for Component 2 (representing 11.5% of project funds)
were more limited in scope and achievement, but promoted improvements which have subsequently
been strengthened by other partners. The results for Component 2 are rated Modest. Given the
importance of Component 1, the project's overall efficacy is rated Substantial.
3.3 Efficiency
81.      The project’s allocative efficiency was based on: (i) emphasizing control of infectious
diseases with their disproportionate effects on the poor (and large, positive externalities); and (ii)
selecting public health commodities (HIV test kits, first-line ART, contraceptive materials, TB
treatment, bed nets, and vaccines and vaccination supplies) most at a risk of stock-outs in the short-
term and shown to be cost-effective, well-established internationally, and necessary for the
achievement of the three health-related MDGs



35
  Measured by the average of the absolute percentage differences (APD) between the supplier’s forecasted lead time
and the actual lead time.
                                                                                                                     24
82.     The project’s technical efficiency was demonstrated by the decision to use the UN agencies,
which demonstrated the impact of their competitive processes, knowledge of the market, and long
term agreements with suppliers36 on the costs of the commodities. As shown in the following table,
the costs of the commodities procured through the UN agencies were almost uniformly less than
those estimated in the PAD and those paid by USAID.

83.      In addition, careful estimates of required quantities and planned deliveries of commodities
were employed to decrease the likelihood of stock-outs or leakages. As the following table shows,
the number of months of stock (MOS) was kept within the minimum/maximum levels prescribed
for the various commodities. This ensured that the supply pipeline was adequately full to meet the
projected demand.

84.      Technical efficiency was further enhanced by: (i) using existing (strengthened) mechanisms
to distribute the commodities; and (ii) enhancing the logistics management information systems to


36
  The UN agencies were deemed to have: (i) quality assurance mechanisms in place; (ii) proven experience in customs
clearance; and (iii) track records of facilitating the in-country distribution. The procurement agency fees (UNICEF: 3-
4%; UNFPA 5%; and WHO/GDF 10%) were deemed reasonable, given their offsetting advantages.
                                                                                                                     25
measure results. Technical efficiency was diminished by: (i) delays in procuring goods (though
cooperation among the partners enabled the project to ensure supplies); and (ii) slow progress in
strengthening supply chain management.
85.      Managerial efficiency was enhanced by: (i) existing programmatic and coordination
arrangements within MOH and between MOH and its partners 37 ; (ii) simplified procurement
arrangements; and (iii) technical support and expertise, provided by several complementary
projects, to facilitate the timely and effective completion of the Project. There were managerial
shortcomings due to high staff turnover within MOH and the short timeframe for project
implementation; these were particularly evident at project closing.
86.      The project’s overall rating for efficiency is Modest.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
87.     Based on considerations of the previous indicators and ratings criteria, the following table
presents the overall outcome rating for the project as Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
88.      By addressing the issue of key public health commodities, the project impacted the poor in
two ways by responding to: (i) the common infectious diseases which disproportionately affect the
poor; and (ii) the limited assets and risk coping mechanisms of poor households which are
particularly vulnerable to the availability and cost of medicines and supplies at reasonable costs.
Among the various categories of beneficiaries, 55% were estimated to be women.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
89.     The guaranteed availability of stocks for the 2013-2014 pipeline allowed the Government to
focus on: (i) finalizing the Pharmaceutical Logistic Strategic Plan (2013-17) and the Supply Chain
Logistics Plan of Action (2013); and (ii) planning for 2015 rather than responding to repeated crises
such as delays in donor funding. Further, improvements made in the commodities management
system have enabled Mozambique to respond to the Government’s commitment UN General
Assembly in 2012 to accelerate treatment for HIV/AIDS.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
90.     A stakeholder workshop was not conducted, but the ICR mission interviewed the principal
actors: (i) MOH (DPC, DAF/UGEA, DNAM/CMAM, and the PIU); (ii) partners (UNICEF,
UNFPA, and USAID); and TA (SCMS). The feedback received indicated that the project was


37
  The planned drugs and activities were already well-integrated into the existing MOH structure and its programs and
projects.
                                                                                                                   26
relevant. It provided the predictable financing for the supply pipeline. The project pushed for
measuring supply chain performance which has been incorporated as a routine measure of
performance. However, the interviewees also complained that the Bank procedures made it difficult
to be agile during the emergency.
4.    Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low
91.     As a crisis response project, the project was expected to maintain stock levels during a
period of uncertain and unpredictable financing. However, the project was implemented during a
period of significant activity in supply chain management as policies and strategic plans were
developed, investments made in strengthening the different supply chain functions, and technical
assistance contributed to major advances in information use. As a result, the project contributed to
several development outcomes, related especially to planning, transportation and distribution, and
monitoring and evaluation.
92.      In each of these areas, the risk to development outcomes should be rated as low: (i)
politically, the sector’s priorities and its role within the overall national development strategy are
clearly understood; (ii) programmatically, the essential structures, tools, and processes for policy
formulation, strategy development implementation, and monitoring and evaluation have been
agreed on and are being used; and (iii) organizationally, CMAM’s status as a National Directorate,
MOH’s capabilities, and other ministries’ awareness of the importance of SCM have been improved
significantly. Financially, several important partners (e.g., the Global Fund, USAID, UNFPA) and
the World Bank are providing commodities and working on supply chain management issues with a
special focus on results and performance.
5.    Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
93.      The project was prepared in a context of global economic uncertainty with a new financing
instrument (CRW) and in a relatively unfamiliar technical area within the Bank (SCM). Given these
constraints and the need to prepare the project rapidly, the project description in the PAD succeeded
in clearly presenting the justification and arrangements for the operation.
94.     The quality of the PAD results from: (i) the description of the number of potential
beneficiaries; (ii) estimations of needs of quantities and financing for key commodities; (iii) a
succinct set of indicators; and (iv) a comprehensive Operational Risk Assessment Framework
(ORAF). The team also efficiently guided the process in Washington (managing the comments from
the PCN, QER, and DM reviews to clarify certain sections and preparing several good annexes) and
in-country (with MOH and staff from other Ministries and aid agencies) to ensure that project
implementation conditions were in place.
95.    Quality at entry was diminished by: (i) insufficient assessment of the institutional
arrangements for project implementation; and (ii) overly optimistic expectations for short-term
SCM strengthening.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
96.      Bank supervision was characterized by: (i) continuity of the Task Team (with shared
                                                                                                   27
responsibilities between Washington and the field); (ii) a permanent in-country presence; and (iii)
frank communication with the Government in assessing project performance and measures for
improvement. With an extensive HNP portfolio and close links between HSDP and HCSP, the Bank
employed several complementary supervision styles, including: (i) supervision missions; (ii) joint
missions (for the two projects; (iii) periodic audio conferences; and (iii) day-to-day discussions and
problem solving with the ministry. The aides-memoires and the ISRs were thorough and candid.
97.     Bank supervision and support missions played a key role in: (i) resolving procurement-
related issues with RPM; (ii) promoting coordination among the three institutions (UN, Bank, and
the Ministry of Health) and between the various Ministry of Health departments; and (iii)
strengthening the information systems required to monitor project performance.
98.     While team efforts resolved a number of procurement and delivery issues related to
Component 1, progress was more problematic on Component 2 and resulted in serious problems at
and after project closing, when ineligible expenditures were discovered.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
99.     Government performance was Moderately Satisfactory based on its: (i) commitment to
making essential commodities available during the global economic crisis; (ii) willingness and
agreement to use UN agencies to procure these commodities; and (iii) support for the development
of supply chain management improvements (which are often neglected by governments).
100.     Specifically, the Government used the project to: (i) resolve a short-term commodity
shortfall; (ii) advance longer-term policies, strategies, and actions (including the Supply Chain Plan
of Action and the strategic logistics plan); and (iii) further develop a platform to coordinate (through
the joint Mozambique/Donor Working Group of Pharmaceuticals) the contributions of development
partners on supply chain strengthening.
101.     While the project benefited from high-level support within the Ministry of Health (with the
Minister and the Permanent Secretary personally involved in monitoring of the project performance
and assisting with the procurement delays), the project was implemented in the context of continual
high staff turnover and systemic public sector procurement issues that impacted the entire Bank
portfolio in Mozambique.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
102.  Project implementation involved the UN agencies and the joint Mozambique/Donor
Working Group of Pharmaceuticals (for Component 1) and the MOH (for Component 2).
103.     For Component 1, the implementation risks identified in the ORAF resulted in procurement
being contracted to UNICEF and UNFPA. Based on an analysis of orders placed and commodities
received, approximately half of the orders were received within the contracted time frame. The
overall satisfactory project results are due both to project financing and to the strong leadership and
coordinated effort of CMAM and all the partners involved in managing the supply chain. Project
financing provided a buffer, and agency coordination permitted orders to be moved forward or
backward to control stocks in the pipeline. The results of this project can be considered best practice
                                                                                                     28
for other public sector supply chains facing similar challenges of fragmented acquisitions.
104.     For Component 2, the absence of an approved Pharmaceutical Logistics Management
Strategy and Implementation Plan, the institutional arrangements within MOH,38 and the turnover
of staff within the DAF/UGEA contributed to inadequate performance. With the establishment in
early 2013 of a cohesive, well-staffed and proactive implementation team (with specific skills in
procurement and financial management), project coordination improved and implemented
accelerated appreciably.
105.     After earlier difficulties, procurement plans were regularly prepared for approval by the
Bank, and bi-annual FMR and annual audits were submitted in a timely manner. Both qualified
audits were quickly rectified. However, there was an outstanding issue of ineligible expenditures at
project closing,39 and a project completion report was not prepared.
106.   Performance by the UN agencies for Component 1 is rated Moderately Satisfactory;
performance by the MOH for Component 2 is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. Given the weight of
expenditures for Component 1, overall performance for the implementing agencies is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
6.   Lessons Learned
107.    HCSP has shown that an emergency project does not necessarily benefit from the
existence of an ongoing operation. HCSP’s reliance on HSDP’s institutional assessment and
implementation experience accelerated preparation but introduced elements which later affected
implementation. These constraints might have been avoided with a more detailed consideration of
the special characteristics of an emergency project.
108.     Experience with the CRW showed that Bank policies and procedures are not always
aligned with the need to respond rapidly to emergencies. While the pros and cons of using UN
agencies was analyzed and debated during preparation, consideration of the potential difficulties of
the Bank’s own procurement procedures was not sufficient. Subsequently, the arrangements which
had been agreed to by the Bank and the UN agencies prior to effectiveness were subjected to further
review by the Bank’s procurement services during implementation. As a result, the planned
emergency procurements were executed more slowly than anticipated. The Bank has since learned
this lesson and resolved the issue for future emergency projects.
109.    Resolution of two other emergency response project issues has been more difficult. First,
though a two-year time frame was established for the project, the development of the SCM
measures (e.g., logistics management and fleet management) was certain to take more than two
years. While combining an emergency response with a systems development approach can be
reasonably justified, combining the two within a short time frame proved to be problematical.
110.     Second, though Bank policy promotes the integration of project implementation
responsibilities within existing Ministry structures, the project offers a caveat for emergency
projects. When HCSP sought to integrate the project responsibilities within the Ministry, there were


38
   For the first two years, implementation was the responsibility of separate departments within MOH: (i) the DPC for
planning and coordination; (ii) the DAF (and UGEA) for fiduciary responsibilities; and (iii) DNAM for the technical
inputs for procuring and distributing commodities.
39
   This issue is currently being resolved.
                                                                                                                    29
significant delays and a lack of clear responsibility; once an independent PIU was established,
implementation proceeded much more smoothly.
111.    Commercial sector supply chain indicators are not necessarily appropriate for the
public sector. Though the project attempted to introduce the increased rigor of private sector supply
chain management indicators, the effort was not entirely successful because of the way in which the
public sector assesses risk.
7.     Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
112.     Borrower/implementing agencies: The Bank supervision team organized a workshop to
explain the objectives and procedures of the Borrower ICR and helped the PIU prepare terms of
reference for conducting the ICR. Despite this assistance and reminders about the Borrower’s
obligations, an ICR was not prepared.
113.    The Bank’s ICR was submitted to the Government on November 20, 2014. No comments were
received.

Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis
Under the Crisis Response Window, streamlined procedures for preparing the PAD did not require a
detailed annex analyzing the economic and financial implications of the project. However, the
justification for the effectiveness and the benefits of the costs financed by the project are as follows:
        Investments to control infectious diseases (with their disproportionate effects on the poor)
         are positive and have large significant externalities.
        All of the programs supported by the project (HIV/AIDS, malaria, TB, family planning, and
         vaccination) have been well-established internationally to be cost-effective, with positive
         contributions to the achievement of the three health-related MDGs.
        In periods of economic crisis, protecting health outcomes while reducing financial risk
         requires ensuring supplies of essential health commodities in the face of worsening
         exchange rates.40
        The commodities selected by the project were critical for maintaining the priority programs:
         ARVs and test kits for HIV/AIDS; LLINs for malaria; drugs and reagents for TB; pills and

        The quantities of the specific commodities to fill the projected gaps resulting from the
         financial crisis were carefully estimated during preparation.
        The procurement of these commodities through the UN agencies was considered to be the
         most cost-effective option due to: (i) their recognized expertise of the commodities being
         procured as well as long-term contract agreements with the major suppliers (providing extra
         leverage for lower costs); (ii) their capacity to deliver within the needed timeframe; and (iii)
         their established mechanisms for assuring adequate quality.
        The costs of the commodities procured through the UN agencies were almost uniformly less
         than those estimated in the PAD and those paid by USAID.
