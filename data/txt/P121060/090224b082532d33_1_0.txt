                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Health Commodity Security Project (HCSP), is an emergency project, designed under the “crisis response window”, an instrument put together by the Bank to assist the
                         countries to mitigate the fallout from the global financial meltdown of 2008.

                         The project was requested by the government to assist in the procurement of key public health commodities that were at risk of stocking out due to the impact of the financial crisis
                         that reduced government revenues and donor financing. Availability of these public health commodities was critical in curbing the spread of epidemics such as measles, HIV, TB and
                         malaria both within the country and across the region and ensuring that the investments in the reproductive health program past decade were protected (such as access to

                         The project is scheduled to close on June 30, 2014. The development objective of the project is to improve the availability of selected drugs and medical supplies in key distribution
                         points. It includes two components: The first is focused on the provision of select essential health commodities, which represents 89 percent of the project financing; and the second

                         on strengthening the supply chain management, representing 12 percent of the project financing.

                         The project has disbursed over 97 percent of its US$39 million credit; one of the highest levels of disbursement achieved in the Bank's Mozambique Portfolio, and has achieved most
                         of its targets in the results framework. All project development indicators surpassed their targets, and 3 out of 4 intermediate indicators were fulfilled. Order fulfillment rates, a proxy
                         for measuring commodity availability for ARVs for the treatment of HIV was maintained between 95% - 99% during the 3 year implementation, surpassing the 85% target and the fill
                         rate for Depo-Provera, (an injectable contraceptive and popular among women in Mozambique), was maintained between 91% - 100%, surpassing the target of 75 percent.

                         The project also distributed over 2.2 million long-lasting bednets in five malaria endemic provinces achieving an average household coverage of 94%. In these three years of
                         implementation, the project has supported 6.2 million direct beneficiaries. These achievements are the result of a strong coordinated approach between the Ministry of Health and key
                         partners from the United Nations (UN), bi-laterals and their contractors.

                         The second component represents US$4.5 million or 12% of the credit, and designed to strengthen two aspects of the supply chain: distribution function between the central,
                         province and district level and improvement of inventory transparency and visibility through the strengthening of the LMIS. The project is responsible for the inputs of vehicles and
                         computers required to strengthen these two functions, while USAID, Global Fund and the other partners also supporting the strengthening of the supply chain, provide the technical
                         assistance and service contracts for installation of the computers at the district level and the development of a distribution strategy.

                         Due to constant staff turnover in the Ministry of Health and lengthy government clearance procedures, the project had to extended for an additional 18 months to provide the Ministry
                         of Heath the time required for completing these procurements. To date, all activities planned under the project have been completed with the exception of a fleet management plan
                         and the procurement of vehicles for strengthening the distribution to the last mile between the district and the health care facility.
