The findings and implications\n            indicate that Second Poverty Reduction Support Credit\n            (PRSC2) continued the program initiated under PRSC1,\n            expanded the scope of the program as necessary, and improved\n            the monitoring and evaluation framework. Therefore it\n            provided a basis for future PRSCs. This simplified\n            implementation completion report however, is written after\n            the completion of the series of the three PRSCs. For the\n            future, simplified completion reports should be written\n            immediately after the completion of the program in question\n            in order to have an impact on the design of the next\n            operation. As discussed above, an implementation completion\n            report of the full program has been developed and it\n            discussed findings and implications for the design of future\n            PRSCs in Uganda as well as for PRSCs in other countries.\n            Also, a stocktaking report of the first series of PRSCs has\n            been written and discussed extensively in Uganda. Both of\n            these reports have spurred discussions and have had an\n            impact on the further development of the PRSC program."}, "docdt": "2005-03-10T00:00:00Z"}
