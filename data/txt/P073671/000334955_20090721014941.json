           development outcome was significant; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Ratings for the Second Poverty\n            Reduction Support Credit Project for Uganda are as follows:\n            outcome was moderately satisfactory; risk to the development\n            outcome was significant, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory; and Borrower performance was also moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Ratings for the Third Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credit Project for Uganda are as follows: outcome\n            was moderately unsatisfactory; risk to the development\n            outcome was significant; Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory; and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Ratings for the Fourth Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credit Project for Uganda are as follows: outcome\n            was moderately unsatisfactory; risk to the development\n            outcome was significant; Bank performance was satisfactory;\n            and Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory.\n            Lessons learned from the projects included: The PRSCs were\n            effective in providing timely and predictable resources for\n            the Government's budget but less so in producing\n            development results. To produce development results, the\n            Bank needs to pay attention to the design of the credit, the\n            quality of prior actions, and their relation to the expected\n            outcomes. PRSCs are unlikely to be as effective as\n            investment and sector operations for solving specific sector\n            issues. The PRSCs tended to cover macroeconomic and sector\n            issues in a broad manner, making it difficult to cultivate\n            ownership in the agencies responsible for implementing the\n            program. The assistance is more likely to succeed when the\n            Bank targets specific problems and works their solution with\n            the agencies in charge of executing the program. A program\n            of budget support tends to create a higher permanent level\n            of Government expenditure that may not be sustainable in the\n            medium term. Predictable budget support may create\n            inflexibilities in expenditure, forcing donors to continue\n            their support beyond what is needed and desirable. Uganda\n            exemplifies this situation as the PRSC series grew over time."}, "docdt": "2009-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
