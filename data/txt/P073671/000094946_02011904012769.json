Project aims to improve public service\n            delivery, given that poor public service performance is one\n            of the key constraints to economic development and poverty\n            reduction. Overall, activities supported by the PRSC II are\n            not expected to result in major adverse, or irreversible,\n            environmental impacts. Biophysical environmental impacts,\n            although thought to be modest given the nature of the\n            activities, can be foreseen at this time only in a generic\n            manner. The environmental impacts of activities in\n            agriculture, education, health, and water and sanitation are\n            expected to be sufficiently addressed by appropriate Ugandan\n            institutions and implementing agencies. National\n            Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) has the mandate to\n            coordinate, monitor, and supervise all environmental\n            activities. The framework for environmental assessment and\n            regulation is based on the National Environment Statue of\n            1995. The more recent Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)\n            Regulations of 1998 define in detail the (EIA) process. A\n            system of EIA and monitoring that identifies adverse\n            environmental impacts is in place. On physical cultural\n            property, the Ugandan EIA system includes a stipulation to\n            prevent destruction of cultural heritages, historic sites,\n            and archaeological resources."}, "docdt": "2002-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
