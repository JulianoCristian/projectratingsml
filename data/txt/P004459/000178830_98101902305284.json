"The Third Industrial Investment Project\n            provides long-term finance for the establishment and\n            expansion of industrial enterprises of all sizes with the\n            exception of cottage industries. About $50 million of the\n            proposed loan would be earmarked for large-scale enterprises\n            and $29.7 million for small- and medium-scale industry. In\n            addition, about $300,000 would be used by DBP to establish a\n            development banking institute to train the management and\n            personnel of smaller development finance institutions. In\n            addition to providing the resources required for expanding\n            the industrial base of the Philippines, the project would\n            help in further improving the institutional capacity of DBP.\n            There are a number of financial and industrial sector issues\n            which the Government would need to address within the next\n            few years. The degree of success of the Government in\n            addressing these issues would have a significant effect on\n            the development impact of DBP's industrial lending."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
