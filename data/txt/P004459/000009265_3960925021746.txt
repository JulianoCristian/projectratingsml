PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PHILIPPINES
THIRD DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES PROJECT
(Loan 1572-PH)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the third Development
Bank of the Philippines Project, for which Loan 1572-PH in an amount equiva-
lent to US$80.0 m-illion was approved by the Board on May 18, 1978. The PCR
was to have bees, completed in 1990; however, due to staff changes there was a
delay In the completion of the report.  In the meantime, OED has issued the
Project Performance Audit Report of the six DFC and SMI loans in the
Philippines (Report No. 8781 of June 21, 1990) where Loan 1572-PH was exten-
sively discussed.
The PCR was prepared by the Industry and Energy Operations Division,
Country Department II, Asia Region (AS2IE). Inasmuch as the project is a very
old one, the PCR has been prepared in the abbreviated form agreed to by OED.
Furthermore, the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) itself ha's under-
gone major fixAancial and operational restructuring during the 1984-89 period
and, therefore, not all the data were available for writing this PCR. Never-
theless, the findings of the PCR are consistent with those of the Project
Performance Audit Report, which was reviewed and commented on by DBP and the
Government.
This PCR is based on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan and Project
Agreements;  supervision reports;  correspondence between the Bank and DBP;
internal Bank memoranda; DBP's annual reports; the Project Performance Audit
Report mentioned above; and the Staff Appraisal Report of the Industrial
Restructuring Project in the Philippines for which DBP is the implementing
agency.

THIRD DEVELOPMENT BANK OF PHILIPPINES PROJECT
(Loan 1572-PH)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
The Third Development Bank of the Philippines project (DBP III) was
approved in 1978 as a follow up to the two earlier projects, approved in 1974 and
1975.  DBP was set up in 1958 as a Government-owned development bank.   The
experience with DBP III was included in a Project Performance Audit Report of six
DFC and SMI loans in the Philippines (Report No. 8781 of June 21, 1990).
Obiectives
The main objectives of the project were to: (i, continue to build DBP's
appraisal and supervision capacity; (ii) promote and finance small and medium-
sized industries (SMI), especially outside the Metro Manila Region; and (iii)
provide long-term resources for private industry (para. 3).   It had three
components: (i) US$50.0 million fLr financing large-scale industry projects; (ii)
US$29.7 million for financin, SMI; and (iii) US$300,000 for establishing a
Development Banking Institution (Fara. 1).
Implementation Experience
The implementation of thie p-o4ect wan pnnr both in terms of actual
performance of subprojects financed under the loan and the performance of DBP.
DBP's performance under the SMI component was better than that under the large
industry component, but was substantially inferior to that of other financial
intermediaries lending to SMI in the Philippines (para. 5).
Resuj.Lt
DBP ran into severe financial difficulties in the 1970s and early
1980s, with the result that Bank loans to DBP were suspended (para. 8).  It
underwent a comprehensive rehabilitation and financial restructuring in the late
1980s, and now is solvent and again a recipient of Bank loans (paras. 9-12).
Sustainabilitv
Before its rehabilitation, DBP as a Government-owned institution did
not have adequate autonomy. Political intervention was common; most of the large
industry subloans were "behest" loans.   As such, it was not a sustainable
institution (page 6).   Its reorganization and reitructuring presumably have
changed this.



- iv -
Findings and Lessons
The main finding of DBP III is that DBF was unable to insulate its
financing decisions from Government influence. The main lessons of experience
are,  first,  that the Bank needs to assure itself of the autonomy of the
management in choosir.g an institution for its loans and that, where it seeks
corrective action, it should assure itself that the corrective measures have been
taken before a loan is given.   Second, the Bank needs to make appropriate
arrangements for covering the foreign exchange risk, with a premium for such
cover, enabling its funds to flow in local currency to the final borrowers at
appropriate interest rates (PPAR, paras. 3.37-3.38'.

Background
1.        Thr Third Development Bank of the Philippines Project (DBP III) vas
made to the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) in 1978. The loan had
three components:    (i) US$50 million for financing  large-scale  industry
projects; (ii) US$29.7 million for financing small and medium-sized industries
(SMI); and (iii) US$300,000 for establishing a Development Banking Institution.
2.        This loan was essentially a follow up loan to DBP. The first two
loans to DBP, in 1974 and 1975, were intended to build up its appraisal and
supervision  capability.    DBP was  set up  in  1958  as a Government-owned
development bank. DBP's financing operations until 1986 encompassed almost all
segments of the economy, and both large and small-scale enterprises.   In
addition to its industrial, agricultural, real estate and transportation
;eL^Wa D-21i Dr - -d hehatl,  i'- 14r4vo        no t vi-torn such as education and
health care. Starting in the seventies, under the guise of its developmental
mission, DBP financed high risk and low return Government development programs
("directed" or "behest" lending), and the takeover of financially distressed
firms at Government's direction. This lack of financial discipline in its
lending, compounded by serious weaknesses in its internal organization and
procedureb (aotably credit appraical and cupeT4o-o    1oe in  priotus financial
problems due to massive defaults in its   portfolio.           With its resource
mobilization capacity undermined, DBP had to rely mainly on Government deposits
for funding its activities.
Project Objectives and Description
3.        The main objectives of the DBP III proJect were to: (i) continue to
build DBP's appraisal ar.d supervision capacity; (ii) promote and finance SMI
especially outside the Metro Manila Region; and (iii) provide long-term
resources for the private industry.
Proiect Design and Organization
4.        The project was designed to broaderL the reach of Bank funds by
participating in DBP's diversified role in financing industries of all sizes,



and providing training facilities for the private development banks.   The
project was designed as a standard DFC operation.
Project Implementation and Project Results
5.        The implementation of the project was poor both in terms of act.al
performance of subprojects financed under the loan and the performance of DBP.
Out o. 22 subloans approved under the large industry component of the loan, 17
were transferred to the Asset Privatization Trust (APT) under the restructuring
arrangements, and others were disposed of before the rehabilitation. During
a period of heavy peso devaluation, these subprojects were expected to carry
the foreign exchange risk.   DBP's performance under the SMI component was
better than the large industry but was substantially inferior to that of other
financial intermediaries under the Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund (IGIF).
All SMI subprojects were shielded against the exchange risk by the Government.
Most large subloans made by DBP were "behest" loans.
Proiect Sustainabilitv
6.        The experience gained under the DBP III loan clearly showed that DBP
was not a sustainable institution. Being a wholly government owned financial
institution DBP acted essentially as an executing agency of the Government;
political intervention was common.   It did not have adequate autonomy to
perform the rcle of a financial institution. The proportion of non-economic
loans financea by DBP far exceeded its bona fide banking operations during
1976-84 period.  As a result, it suffered severe liquidity problems, became
subsequently insolvent in early 1984, and had to be restructured in 1986.
Bank Performance
7.        Overall, it was clear that the Bank's association with DBP did not
play any material role in enhancing its autonomy.   The Bank was not very
successful in builLing DrP 4nto a sound financial institution as envisaged
during appraisal.   The Bank's supervision missions failed to detect  the
magnitude of the problems faced by DBP during the period prior to its collapse
in 1984.  Only in 1986 did the Bank begin to focus on DBP's major overall
institutional weaknesses and started significant corrective actions (paras. 9-
12t.
Borrower Performance
8.        DBP  ran  into  severe  financial  difficulties.    Several  capital
increases between 1972 and 1980, substantial government deposits to shore up
its liquidity position, and various measures to strengthen its organization and
procedures all failed to stop DBP's deterioration in the early eighties.
Serious portfolio arrears and poor collection rates persisted, as did the more
intractable issue of high-risk and low-rate behest loans. As part of the Bank-
financed Industrial Finance Project (Loan 1984-PH; 1981), the Government and
DBP were asked to implement an "Action Program", which included further
organizational cbanges, measures to reduce DBP's dependence on Government
deposits, and actions to improve the collection performance.  The financial
effects of "behest" lending were to be made transparent, and Government was to
provide financial assistance if DBP's financial viability would be impaired as



- 3 -
a result  of "behest"  lending.   However,  continuation  of DBP's  problems,
wycerhatpd by the economic and political crises of the period, led to DBP
losing its accreditation as a participating financial institution in the
project.   Consequently,  Bank loans to DBP were suspended.   As evident in
Table 1 and Annex 4, DBP's financial situation in 1985 remained poor, with a
net loss of  Peso 6.9 billion (US$370 milll.on equivalent) and a high debt-
equity ratio of 15:1.
9.        DBP's Rehabilitation (1986-1989).  Following the advent of a new
Government in 1986, the severity of DBP's problems and its technical bankruptcy
were addressed by a comprehensive rehabilitatiou and financial restructuring
program developed in conjunctio' with the Bank financed Economic Recovery Loan
(ERL).  Major components incluoed:   (i) a new charter and policy statement;
(ii) installation of a new management team %.nd Board of Directors; (iii)
transfer of Peso 74 billion of non-performing accounts to APT, created by the
Government to sell those assets; (iv) implementation of a drastic cost
reduction program through staff reduction and sale of branches; (v) an internal
reorganization and strengthening program focussing on credit policies, legal
procedures, financial controls, accounting and internal controls, and personnel
management; and (vi) phasing out of subsidized Government deposits.
10.       DBP's financial restructuring and the major elements of its internal
strengtbening program under the ERL have essentially been completed, with DBP
being solvent during the last two years. Its recent performance, summarized
in Table 1, shows that DBP has met and, in most areas, bettered the ERL targets
set jointly by the Bank, the Government and DBP.

11.       DBP's financial condition and performance have improved notably since
1986. Earnings indicators look impressive. However, this performance is not
fully indicative of Vbe' s long term earniing capability on a going concern
basis.  A bulk of income came from interest income on liquid assets, primarily
Government issues. DBP also benefitted from substantial interest frae deposit
from Government (over Peso 2 billion in 1988). As these free deposits are
gradually being repaid (the schedule calls for full repayment by the end of
1989), these funds will have to be replaced with higher cost funds, which would
decrease the spread DBP is realizing. This combination of factors which reduce
revenues and increase expenses will lead to lower, though still positive, net
returns in the future.
12.       DBP's New Role and Stratezic Orientation.  DBP's financial restruc-
turing and the major elements of its internal strengthening program under the
ERL was completed in 1989, with DBP being solvent.  DBP's role was redefined
to become a wholesale bank.  This was one of the conditions of the  Financial
Sector Adjustment Loan  which was approved in 1989. The wholesale DBP would
mobilize and channel term funds to the private sector through retail financial
institutions. Given the availability of domestic long-term funds from the
Social Security System, insurance companies and pension funds, DBP is expected
to play a major role in domestic resource mobilization. However, DBP's
increased reliance on domestic resource mobilization can only be gradual; in
the near future, the lack of a developed capital market and the Government's
continuing needs to tap domestic savings through high-yield Treasury bills
would impede DBP's raising significant long term peso funds.   In such an
environment, DBP will have to fund itself to a significant degree through
foreign sources in the coming years. In this context, DBP has been designated
as a conduit for official foreign borrowing, the proceeds of which are to be
channeled through retail finar-ial institutions for use in financing private
enterprises.    DBP's transformation to a primarily wholesale bank will be
accomplished through a gradual reduction of its retail loan approvals and
outstanding retail loans to enterprises and a corresponding increase in its
wholesale loan approvals and outstanding wholesale loans to tinancial
institutions. The transition will also entail the disinvestment of DBP's retail
operations. A partial disinvestment of 30% is expected to take place in 1991.

\_a In 1984 and 1985, funding responsibility for DBP's non-performing accounts (NPAs) was assumed by the
Government by way of equity contributions equal to the total losses on NPAs over the preceding year.
Consequently, no provisions for losses were made in those years; the item "Government Contribution"
represents the Government's equity contribution and is, in effect, an extraordinary adjustment to
the 1984 and 1985 accounts made after computation of net income. In 1986 and 1987, DBP made
loan loss provisions. DBP did not make additional provisions in 1988 because the very substantial provi-
sions made in 1986 and 1987, combined with the work-out of non-performing loans, has left DBP with a
high level of provisions which is fully adequate: As of December 31, 1988, provisions for doubtful
accounts represented 28.6% of total loans outstanding.
