Project for the Gambia is within the context of the\n            Multi-Country HIV/AIDs Program for the Africa Region and\n            strives to assist the Government of the Gambia to stem a\n            rapid growth of HIV/AIDs through a) maintaining the current\n            low epidemic levels; b) reducing its spread and mitigating\n            its effects; and c) increasing access to prevention services\n            as well as care and support for those infected and affected.\n            The project consists of four components. The first, capacity\n            building and policy development, will support the National\n            HIV/Aids Council as well as addressing a national strategy\n            and action plan; project coordination and administration;\n            and advocacy, training, monitoring, evaluation, and\n            technical support activities. The second, multi-sectoral\n            responses to prevention and care, will improve the capacity\n            of non-health sector line departments to respond to the\n            epidemic. The third component, health sector responses to\n            Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDs\n            management, will provide resources to the sector for\n            management manuals and other activities, including\n            enhancement of the blood supply system and acquiring access\n            to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy as well as general\n            prevention and care. The fourth component, community and\n            civil service initiatives, will provide grant resources to\n            eligible applicants."}, "docdt": "2000-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
