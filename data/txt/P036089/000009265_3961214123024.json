           population by enhancing the quality of basic health\n            services; and 2) support an initial phase of policy reforms\n            to increase cost-effectiveness, fiscal sustainability and\n            patient choice within the health system. These broad\n            objectives will be achieved through activities and reforms\n            under the following three project components: 1) health\n            finance and management; 2) basic health services; and 3)\n            pharmaceutical policy and supply. The specific objectives of\n            these three components are as follows, respectively: 1) to\n            build capacity to analyze and apply information for\n            policy-making and health system management; 2) to strengthen\n            primary health care and support high-priority disease\n            prevention and health promotion programs; and 3) to reduce\n            the cost of essential drugs by creating a more competitive\n            pharmaceutical market."}, "docdt": "1996-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
