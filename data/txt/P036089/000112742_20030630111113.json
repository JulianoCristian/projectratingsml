SECTOR\n            TRANSITION PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Health Sector Transition Project for\n            Macedonia had a satisfactory outcome with likely\n            sustainability, modest institutional development impact, and\n            satisfactory performances by both the Bank and Borrower.\n            Following a slow implementation, and very limited\n            disbursements during the initial project years, the project\n            was simplified and restructured.  Lessons learned include\n            the following: A realistic assessment of the environment for\n            project implementation is crucial. Large investments in\n            equipment and in training worked better when services\n            address major health issues where significant gaps existed\n            in terms of staff skills and technical level of facilities.\n            Complex policy changes or investments in complex technical\n            systems barely worked, with difficulties in implementation\n            and a modest impact.  The implementation of changes has to\n            be facilitated by properly timed and designed public\n            information activities.  Changes of policy and regulatory\n            environment in areas where vested interests are significant\n            does not work due to collusion among players against\n            changes, and a high potential for corruption. More\n            involvement of local experts and end users would better\n            match the characteristics of the goods and services provided\n            to the specific needs and conditions, and would also require\n            an adequate planning of resources for local consulting\n            services.  The procurement of equipment and consumables from\n            UNICEF was not a good experience.  Time and effort were\n            spent in the procurement of goods because there were\n            numerous packages for International Competitive Bidding\n            (ICB), international shopping (IS), and national shopping\n            (NS).  Better procurement planning and packaging at the\n            project preparation phase would improve economy and\n            efficiency in the procurement process.  Both the Bank and\n            the Borrower paid insufficient attention to the setup,\n            maintenance, and systematic use of a monitoring and\n            evaluation framework."}, "docdt": "2003-04-10T00:00:00Z"}
