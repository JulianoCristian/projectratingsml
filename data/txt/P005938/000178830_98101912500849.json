supports the\n            Government's industrial restructuring policy. It would\n            help increase supply of skilled labor, improve labor\n            mobility through retraining, and strengthen CONET's\n            planning and operating capabilities. Curricula development,\n            organizational strengthening, and increased participation of\n            the private sector would improve effectiveness and relevance\n            of vocational training. The project would finance\n            construction and equipment of 30, and equipment of 5,\n            vocational training centers, and purchase of 50 mobile\n            units, thus doubling CONET's vocational training\n            capacity. The project would also support reforms in\n            technical education through introducing new curricula\n            elements. A technical assistance component, including\n            consultant services, training programs for CONET staff, and\n            studies of CONET's operations and the Argentine labor\n            market would ensure effective project implementation. The\n            project faces no special risks although the success of the\n            attempted improvements in curricula and CONET's\n            operating efficiency will depend on the ability of\n            CONET's management to depart from established practice\n            and adapt the changes proposed under the project."}, "docdt": "1980-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
