The\n            lessons learned indicate that the decision to do a single\n            tranche operation was adequate in view of the Government\n            strategy to pursue a two stage approach designed to, first,\n            achieve stabilization of the country's finances and\n            initiate key reforms to encourage a resumption of growth\n            while, second, identifying and implementing a comprehensive\n            medium-term program of reforms to restore growth and\n            competitiveness. The successful implementation of the\n            Government's program followed from its strong ownership\n            and commendable degree of commitment. The very binding\n            capacity constraints, arising in significant part from the\n            inherent diseconomies of scale involved in a small island\n            public sector, have required the judicious selection of\n            measures to those that are likely to make the greatest\n            impact and are critical to the successful achievement of the\n            program objectives. The complexity of the project placed\n            great pressure on economic managers and showed the need for\n            flexibility on the part of lead donors such as the Bank and\n            Fund. Close coordination among donors in the provision of\n            financial and technical assistance greatly contributed to\n            the outcome of the reform program."}, "docdt": "2004-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
