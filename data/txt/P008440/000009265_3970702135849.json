foreign exchange earnings through the expansion\n            of exports of processed animal products.  It would help\n            strengthen the livestock industry by rehabilitating and\n            expanding existing  facilities which would provide inputs or\n            directly produce cattle, pigs and sheep and processed meat\n            and cheese.  It would also provide funds for pasture and\n            livestock research, management training for large farms and\n            slaughterhouses, and export marketing services.  The project\n            would consist of five components: (a) animal feed and\n            livestock input supply; (b) on-farm production; (c)\n            agroindustrial processing; (d) research and training; and\n            (e) export marketing services."}, "docdt": "1985-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
