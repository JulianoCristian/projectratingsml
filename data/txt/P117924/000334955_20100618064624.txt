    Ghana - Economic Governance and Poverty Reduction Credit (Credit Number 4634 ­ GH)
                            Second Tranche Release Document

                                          May 31, 2010

Recommendation

1. This memorandum summarizes progress in the implementation of the policy-based operation
   in support of the Ghana Second Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy. The Memorandum
   focuses on the actions taken by the Government of Ghana (the Government) to meet the
   specific conditions for the release of the second tranche of the Economic Governance and
   Poverty Reduction Credit (EGPRC). The memorandum considers that the Government of
   Ghana has made satisfactory progress overall in implementing the program supported by
   through the Credit as set forth in its Letter of Development Policy dated June 12, 2009, and
   that the Government has fully met five out of the six second tranche release actions. In
   recommending the release of the second tranche the Task Team agrees with the
   Government's request to waive one second tranche release condition related to the
   requirement for Cabinet approval of the legislation concerning the proposed Ghana
   Petroleum Regulatory Authority and oil and gas fiscal regime. The Government decision to
   eventually partition the regulatory framework into various legal building blocks to give
   greater space for consultations among the various stakeholders can be considered legitimate
   and justified given the sensitive political economy of resource management in Ghana.
   Indeed, public consultations held on the legislation raised fundamental issues of ownership,
   participation and control, roles, responsibilities and accountability, legitimacy and capacity
   of institutions that underpin effective performance of such a green field sector in the
   Ghanaian economy, and it became apparent that a more comprehensive multiple legal
   framework would be needed. A first bill has been approved by Cabinet, and the remaining
   two are being processed along the Parliamentary calendar as detailed in Paragraphs 21-24
   below of this Memorandum.

Background

2. The Board approved the two-tranche Economic Governance and Poverty Reduction Credit of
   SDR 193.8 million (US$300 million equivalent) on June 30, 2009 to support the Government
   of Ghana's second Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRSII). Following the Board
   approval, the Financing Agreement for EGPRC was signed on July 15, 2009 by the Borrower
   and the International Development Association (IDA). The Credit was declared effective July
   16, 2009 with the first tranche of SDR 96.9 million (US$150 million equivalent) being
   released upon effectiveness.

3. The EGPRC aims to support the authorities' efforts, in the midst of the current global crisis,
   to bring their fiscal stance to a sound and sustainable track and protect the development
   objectives set in Ghana's Second Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS II) for the
   period 2006-2009. The GPRS II emphasizes the centrality of private-led growth to reduce
   poverty, along with human development and governance efforts to promote equity.



                                                                                                    1 
 
   Specifically, the EGPRC supports actions to: (i) restore budgetary discipline and (ii) tackle
   long-standing public sector and energy issues, while (iii) protecting the poor.
        
4. As a result of the policy actions that were designed for the first tranche release, the
   Government of Ghana has (i) opened a single treasury account in the Bank of Ghana and has
   identified the accounts of Ministries, Departments and Agencies(MDAs) to be connected to
   the said account; (ii) ensured that at least 80 percent of the total number of procurement
   contracts processed in 2008 by MDAs covered in the Public Procurement Authority survey
   sample (which covers 80 percent of total MDAs transactions in value) have followed
   procurement methods and procedures compliant with the Recipient's Public Procurement
   Act, (iii) begun regular publication of comprehensive and detailed quarterly fiscal out-turns
   with no more than one quarter lag, (iv) implemented a net hiring freeze in the public sector
   (excluding the absorption of trainees in education and health) through the completion of an
   employment audit and the elimination of ghost workers from the payroll of the Ghana Health
   Service, and the approval of all MDAs' hiring decisions by the Recipient's Ministry of
   Finance and Economic Planning and the Office of the Head of Civil Service, (v) reconstituted
   the boards of Volta River Authority, Electricity Company of Ghana, Ghana National
   Petroleum Company, Tema Oil Refinery and the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission,
   and (vi) increased the number of households covered by the Government's "Livelihood
   Empowerment Against Poverty Program" since June 30, 2008.

5. Since July 2009, the Government's macroeconomic stabilization program is also supported
   by a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF, which has since been renamed Extended
   Credit Facility, ECF), in the amount of SDR387.4 million (US$600 million equivalent). A
   joint first and second review of the ECF by the IMF Board of Executive Directors is
   scheduled for June 9, 2010. An IMF assessment letter dated March 31, 2010, is annexed to
   this Tranche Release Document.

Recent Macroeconomic Performance

6. Since mid-2009, the economy has shown strong signs of stabilization, while weathering the
   impact of the global financial crisis. Following large expenditure slippages in 2008, both the
   fiscal and current account deficits were significantly reduced in the course of 2009, under the
   impact of positive exogenous shocks (high hydroelectric reserves with good rains, low oil
   prices, high cocoa and gold prices, good cocoa harvest) and significant fiscal stabilization
   efforts and achievements (see Tables 1 and 2).

7. The fiscal deficit (on a cash basis) reached 9.7 percent of GDP in 2009 (against 14.5 percent
   a year earlier) while the balance of payments' current account registered a 5.1 percent of
   GDP deficit (against 18.7 percent a year earlier). Since July, the exchange rate stabilized and
   even slightly appreciated against the US$ (following a 45 percent depreciation in the
   previous twelve months). Consumer prices also broadly stabilized, growing at an annual pace
   of 6.7 percent over the period June 2009-April 2010. As such, the year-on-year inflation
   target set forth by the Bank of Ghana for December 2009 ­ 14.6 percent - was almost




                                                                                                 2 
 
       attained (15.9 percent), and within the range agreed upon with the IMF. By May 2010, 6-
       month T-Bills were subscribed at 13.5 percent, down from 28.4 percent a year earlier.1

8. Estimates2 for 2009 put real GDP growth at 3.5 percent in real terms, down from an
   estimated 7.3 percent in 2008. A number of indirect indicators tend to support this estimate,
   from indirect tax revenue and import demand to energy supply and private sector credit
   growth. And while exports (gold, cocoa) continued to enjoy high world prices, growth in
   domestic demand is likely to have decelerated, under the combined impact of fiscal
   stabilization, tighter credit conditions, and lower private transfers and foreign direct
   investments. Latest data suggest that the economy started to regain strength towards the end
   of 2009, rebounding from the sharp deceleration in the first half of 2009.

9. Not being greatly exposed to international financial markets (on both assets and liabilities
   sides), Ghana's financial sector (mostly banks) was not directly affected by the global
   financial crisis. Banks' balance sheets continued to expand rapidly in 2009 (31 percent
   increase between December 2008 and December 2009), while significantly elevating capital
   adequacy ratios.3 Yet, GDP growth deceleration, exchange rate depreciation, related currency
   mismatches, and large public arrears likely contributed to rising Non Performing Loans
   (NPLs), which attained 20.0 percent of total loans in February 2010 (up from 7.7 percent by
   end-2008).

10. By March 2010, Ghana was considered by the IMF to have met all its quantitative targets
    under the ECF in 2009, but two, the September ceiling on the fiscal deficit (only marginally
    exceeded) and the limit on non concessional borrowing.4 Estimates for end-2009 point to a
    fiscal deficit at 9.7 percent of GDP (on a cash basis), that is, slightly above the fiscal target of
    9.4 percent of GDP set forth in the Budget Law 2009. Higher than anticipated domestic
    interest costs, wage bill and lower than anticipated grants and indirect tax revenue
    contributed to the slippage. In contrast, primary expenditures (goods and services, transfers
    and domestically financed investment expenditures notably) were severely compressed
    (although the share of pro-poor expenditures was largely protected5) with regard to the
    Budget Law.

11. Measured on a commitment basis, the fiscal deficit was about 11.0 percent of GDP in 2009,
    down from an estimated 20.1 percent in 2008 (including Government arrears to private
                                                            
1
  The decrease in interest rates was only partially transmitted to the private sector, given banks' need to provision for
the large stock of NPL and meet new capital requirements.
2
  GDP estimates are based on indirect indicators of supply and a 17-year old base year, 1993, possibly not reflecting
structural economic changes which occurred since. National accounts are currently being re-based by the Ghana
Statistical Services, and this exercise is likely to result in significant upward revisions in GDP levels.
3
  The ratio of risk-weighted capital to risk-weighted assets increased from 13.8 to 18.2 percent between December
2008 and December 2009.
4
  The ECF arrangement had provided for public guarantees of up to US$300 million for non concessional borrowing
for Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) to finance oil and gas investment projects. This borrowing
facility was not used. Instead, a non guaranteed GNPC trade liability (for US$100 million, to purchase crude oil to
be refined by the Tema Oil Refinery) was taken over by the Budget. The Government considered this action as
critically needed to avoid the disruption in the supply of refined petroleum products in Ghana.
5
  The share of pro-poor expenditure in total expenditure stood at 24.2 percent in 2009, against 24.9 percent
budgeted. In comparison, the share of actual pro-poor expenditure in total expenditure stood at 22.3 percent in 2008
(against 24.5 percent targeted).

                                                                                                                       3 
 
       contractors and outstanding commitments to statutory funds)6. The review by Parliament in
       August 2009 of the 2009 budget execution at mid-year revealed an end-year 2008 stock of
       public expenditure arrears and outstanding commitments largely exceeding that budgeted to
       be cleared in 2009 (Ghana Cedi 1.13 billion - against Ghana Cedi 0.54 billion budgeted). By
       end-2009, the stock had gone up to an estimated amount of Ghana Cedi 1.43 billion, the
       result of the accumulation of new arrears and outstanding commitments exceeding
       repayments. However, government liabilities to State- Owned Enterprises (SOEs), in the
       energy sector in particular, were reduced from Ghana Cedi 0.67 billion to Ghana Cedi 0.32
       billion between December 2008 and December 2009. From 2010 onwards, a progressive
       decline in the stock of domestic arrears and outstanding commitments and the non-
       accumulation of external arrears has been retained as quantitative performance criteria under
       the IMF ECF arrangement.7

12. The 2010 Budget Law, which was submitted to Parliament on November 19 2009, foresees a
    fiscal deficit at 7.5 percent of GDP in 2010. While structural reforms in energy (the
    implementation of the electricity financial recovery plan to avoid the recurrence of subsidies
    to utilities), public sector (conduct of payroll audits and elimination of ghost workers,
    restructuring of subvented agencies, civil service reform for effective decentralization and
    improved performance management) and public financial management (treasury single
    account, integrated financial management and information system, effective cash
    management and commitment control systems, inclusion of all MDAs in the payroll
    management system) are expected to prevent the recurrence of expenditure slippages, most
    of the fiscal adjustment is budgeted to stem from additional tax and non tax revenues. The
    latter is expected from the removal of important tax exemptions, the conversion of excise to
    ad-valorem taxes (to avoid inflation erosion), increased royalties from the mining sector,
    higher dividend distribution from State-Owned Enterprises, and better alignment of user fees
    with costs.

13. Nonetheless, discussions with IMF Staff subsequent to the Budget presentation have led to
    the identification of additional measures in anticipation of a possible revenue shortfall, given
    the optimistic revenue assumptions retained in the budget law and potential contingent
    liabilities.8 The Government and the IMF also agreed to revise upwards the 2010 fiscal
    deficit target (from 6.0 to 8.0 percent of GDP under the proviso that no new arrears will be
    accumulated) initially envisaged at the signature of the ECF, so as to accommodate for the
    liquidation over time of the stock of expenditure arrears and outstanding commitments
    uncovered afterwards. Such a revision nonetheless will not affect the targeted fiscal deficit
    for 2011, at 4.5 percent of non-oil GDP.
                                                            
6
  Statutory Funds (National Health Insurance Scheme, Social Security, Ghana Education Trust Fund, Road Fund,
District Assembly Common Fund, HPIC and MDRI related funds) are legally funded through fixed tax revenue
shares.
7
  It is expected that capping the stock of arrears will give time to authorities to address the structural issues behind
their accumulation, that is, (i) the rigidity in budget management imposed by statutory funds and (ii) the absence of
commitment controls for Ministries of Energy and Roads and Highway. Such controls were relaxed in late 2007 to
accelerate investment in the midst of the energy crisis.
8
  In particular, the financial situation of TOR (and ability to operate) was stabilized by a Ghana Cedi 445 million
equity injection from the Government in March 2010, which allowed the refinery to settle its debt with Ghana
Commercial Bank. The financing of the operation was obtained with the issuance of a Ghana Cedi denominated 3-
year Treasury Bill for non residents carrying a 15.0 percent annual interest.

                                                                                                                           4 
 
14. Preliminary updates to the joint Bank-Fund debt sustainability analysis (DSA) using the
    latest debt data and projected financing flows suggest that Ghana remains at moderate risk of
    debt distress, in line with the 2008 and 2009 DSAs. In the baseline projections, external debt
    indicators remain below the threshold levels for debt distress. These results depend on the
    planned sustained reduction of the fiscal deficit to low levels. Debt dynamics based instead
    on the continuation of fiscal deficits at the average levels of recent years would quickly
    exceed the DSA threshold levels. Stress tests also indicate that the DSA outlook is sensitive
    to the economic growth and borrowing costs assumptions. The debt-to-GDP indicator is
    expected to be revised downwards over the course of 2010 as a result of the national accounts
    rebasing exercise which is projected to result in an upward revision to nominal GDP (of
    approximately 50 percent). Importantly, however, this would not affect the debt service to
    export and revenue ratios over the coming decade.

Progress on EGPRC Second Tranche Release Actions

15. The Government has made significant progress in implementing the EGPRC. In particular,
    the six actions to be carried out before the release of the second tranche listed in the
    Financing Agreement have been implemented as summarized below.

16. Second Tranche Release Action #1: The Government has taken contingency fiscal measures,
    once the public wage rate increase for 2009 has been established, to correct any deviations
    with respect to the fiscal deficit and the share of pro-poor expenditures targets set forth in
    the Recipient's 2009 budget, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 45 of the Letter
    of Development Policy. The Government successfully concluded wage negotiations with
    organized labor on July 7, 2009, and with the health sector group on July 24, 2009.
    Agreements reached on wage increases for the whole public sector for the year 2009 were
    within budget appropriations. The Government submitted to Parliament a supplementary
    Budget Bill for the remainder of 2009 on August 25, 2009, in order to account for higher
    arrears and interest costs than anticipated in the Budget Law 20099 approved in March 2009.
    End-year fiscal deficit and pro-poor expenditure targets were kept unchanged in the
    supplementary Budget Law, as taxes (mostly on imported goods, VAT and custom duties)
    were raised to finance additional expenses (arrears and interest costs). In the event, fiscal
    targets were very close to be met, as discussed in paragraph #10. The action is considered
    fully met.

17. Second Tranche Release Action #2: The Government has submitted to Parliament a freedom
    of information bill and, if approved, has adopted a related implementation plan including a
    budget, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 50 of the Letter of Development
    Policy. The Freedom of Information Bill was submitted in January 2010 to Parliament and it
    passed through a first reading on February 5, 2010. Given the necessary time for debate and
    possible amendments requested by Parliamentarians, final reading of the Bill is planned for
    the second half of 2010. As such, the implementation plan cannot be discussed and approved
    before that. The action is considered fully met.


                                                            
9
  The Budget Law 2009 refers to the Budget Statement and Economic Policy, and the Appropriation Act, approved
together by the Parliament in March 2009.

                                                                                                                5 
 
18. Second Tranche Release Action #3: The Government has appointed a Minister of State in
    charge of public sector reform, and eliminated ghost workers from payroll in the Ghana
    Education Service, initiated employment audits in all remaining MDAs, and classified at
    least half of the total number of subvented agencies in preparation for their rationalization,
    divestiture or commercialization in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 56 of the
    Letter of Development Policy. By October 7, 2009, the Minister of State as head of the public
    sector reform secretariat had been appointed. On March 31, 2010, the Ministry of Finance
    and Economic Planning instructed the Controller and Auditor General Department and the
    Ministry of Education to immediately withhold the salary payment of all 2,383 identified
    ghost workers in the Ghana Education Service. On September 8, 2009, the Government
    initiated the headcount of all public sector workers (but in education and health), with a view
    to conclude it in the first quarter of 2010. On April 14, 2010, the public sector reform
    secretariat at the Office of the President acknowledged the receipt of the consultant report
    classifying all subvented agencies (a total of 196, against 98 expected under the trigger) in
    preparation for their rationalization, divestiture or commercialization. The action is
    considered fully met.

19. Second Tranche Release Action #4: The Government has completed, through its Ministry of
    Energy, consultations with stakeholders on an electricity sector financial recovery plan and,
    through its Cabinet, approved the said plan, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph
    61 of the Letter of Development Policy. Stakeholders' consultations on the electricity
    financial recovery plan started on September 17, 2009, following the receipt of the consultant
    report. Participants to consultations included the Volta River Authority, the Electricity
    Company of Ghana, the Ghana Grid Company Limited, the Ministry of Energy, and the
    Ministry of Finance. On March 11, 2010, the Cabinet reviewed the electricity financial
    recovery plan jointly submitted by the Minister of Energy and Minister of Finance and
    Economic Planning, and agreed to accept a 33 percent electricity tariff increase starting no
    later than June 1, 2010. Following the independent Public Utilities Regulatory Commission
    (PURC) ruling on May 31, 2010 to increase electricity tariffs by 42 percent on average10
    starting June 1, 2010, the Ministry of Finance will submit to Cabinet a costed time-bound
    proposal to (i) cover utilities' remaining financing gap in 2010, if any, through treasury
    transfers to utilities and/or the implementation of a temporary surcharge11 on electricity sales;
    and (ii) restructure the utilities' balance sheets during 2010-2011. The action is considered
    fully met.

20. Second Tranche Release Action #6: The Government has revised the classification of pro-
    poor public expenditures based on an assessment of their effective impact on poverty, for use
    in the Recipient's 2010 budget, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 72 of the
    Letter of Development Policy. Two reports prepared by the Ministry of Finance and
    Economic Planning were put before the attention of the Minister of Finance and Economic
                                                            
10
   PURC ruling foresees increases in residential tariffs between 21 and 42 percent depending on quantities
consumed, above 50kw/h per month. There will be no increase in tariffs for households consuming less than
50kw/h per month, and the impact on poverty is believed to be almost insignificant. Combined with commercial (26-
42 percent) and industrial (63-69 percent) tariffs increases, the increase in residential tariffs will significantly raise
electricity utilities' ability to recover their operational costs, in an environment characterized with many
uncertainties (hydroelectric reserves, oil prices, gas supply from Nigeria).
11
   As considered a tax, the surcharge would not require PURC approval.

                                                                                                                        6 
 
    Planning on April 15, 2010. The first report recommends a number of actions to improve the
    targeting efficiency of various social programs. The second report reviews the current
    definition of pro-poor expenditures and recommends the inclusion of several programs in the
    computation of public pro-poor expenditures in 2010. These recommendations were
    endorsed by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, and will be implemented to
    report pro-poor expenditures in 2010 and subsequent years. The action is considered fully
    met.

21. Second Tranche Release Action #5: The Government has completed consultations with
    stakeholders on draft legislation concerning the proposed Ghana Petroleum Regulatory
    Authority and the oil and gas fiscal regime, and Cabinet has approved such draft legislation,
    taking into account the results of the consultations, in accordance with the provisions of
    paragraph 67 of the Letter of Development Policy. Initial stakeholders' consultations held on
    the oil and gas regulatory framework raised fundamental issues of ownership, participation
    and control, roles, responsibilities and accountability, legitimacy and capacity of institutions
    that underpin effective performance of such a green field sector in the Ghanaian economy. It
    became apparent that the consultations will take more time than initially anticipated.
    Ongoing dialogue with authorities, as part of this operation and through the EITI++ scoping
    mission carried out in parallel also helped clarify what is needed to establish a sound and
    effective regulatory framework for oil and gas in Ghana.

22. Initial stakeholders' consultations suggested in particular that more time and attention should
    be devoted to reaching a consensus on (i) the key features of the proposed new Ghana
    Petroleum Regulatory Authority, including the scope of responsibility of the regulator (one
    mega regulator for all utilities, or several small specialized regulators); (ii) the local content
    aspects (how ambitious should the law be); and (iii) the specifics of the oil revenue
    management proposals (in particular, the size of the proposed heritage and stabilization
    funds). Ongoing debates on these matters have shown significant divergences of views which
    will need to be reconciled to establish a nationally owned legal framework to govern the oil
    and gas industry in decades to come.

23. As a result, the initial plans to have one omnibus law as envisaged at the time of signing the
    EGPRC have evolved, and instead, a decision was made to sequence the effort into three
    legal building blocks: (i) amend the existing petroleum exploration and production legislation
    (Provisional National Defence Council, PNDC Law 84); (ii) pass the oil revenue
    management bill; and (iii) pass legislation to establish the new Petroleum Regulatory
    Authority. Cabinet approved on March 11, 2010 the revisions to the PNDC Law 84, and
    submitted them to the Attorney General for final drafting before submission to the
    Parliament. Following public consultations held country-wide in February and March 2010,
    Cabinet adoption of the Ghana Petroleum Revenue Management Bill - the new oil and gas
    fiscal regime - is scheduled for June/July 2010. Cabinet adoption of the Petroleum
    Regulatory Authority Bill is expected to follow in September 2010. The Government
    decision to eventually partition the regulatory framework into various legal building blocks
    to give greater space for consultations among the various stakeholders can be considered
    legitimate and justified given the sensitive political economy of resource management in
    Ghana. The change in the envisaged schedule to fully meet the prior action requires a
    waiver.

24. The social dialogue and recent EITI++ scoping mission have also revealed the need for
    improved capacity in several state institutions. A capacity building project for the oil and gas
    sector has been prepared to improve the ability of the institutions involved in regulating,
    taxing, ensuring the enforcement of environmental and social safeguards, and developing
    skills in this sector. In addition, the Bank will be supporting reforms to improve transparency
    and accountability through strengthening vertical and horizontal mechanisms of
    accountability. As part of the Multi Donor Budget Support (MDBS) Progress Assessment
    Framework (PAF) 2009-11, the forthcoming programmatic DPO scheduled in FY11 will
    support the revision of the EITI institutional framework to include oil and gas sectors (prior
    action), the adoption of the oil revenue management bill (prior action), and the adoption of
    the legislation establishing the new Petroleum Regulatory Authority (trigger). Following the
    completion of the Natural Resource and Environment Governance (NREG) DPO series in
    FY10, a new programmatic DPO series will be developed including the oil and gas sectors.
    On transparency, the work supported under the Governance Partnership Facility, which
    approved a Ghana proposal in January 2010, will deepen the mainstreaming of the
    transparency and accountability agenda.

25. More generally, the World Bank will continue to provide support in the domains above
    mentioned. On transparency, additional financing to the e-Ghana project will support the
    development of the Ghana Integrated Financial Management Information System. On public
    sector reform, the Economic Management and Capacity Building Project (EMCBP) will
    support the rationalisation of Subvented Agencies. On social protection, the social
    opportunities project will support the development of solid social safety nets. And the next
    general DPO scheduled in FY11 will continue to support cross-cutting policy reforms on
    public financial management, electricity, public sector reform, and social protection.
