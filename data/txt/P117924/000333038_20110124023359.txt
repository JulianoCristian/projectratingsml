                            SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION*

                           Meeting of the Executive Directors
                                   January 20, 2011


Executive Directors approved a credit to the Republic of Ghana for the Seventh Poverty
Reduction Support Credit (IDA/R2010-0385/1) in the amount of SDR 141 million (US$
215 million equivalent) on the payment terms and conditions set out in the President's
Memorandum.

Directors expressed support for the overall objectives of the project, noting the
appropriateness of the selected thematic areas for policy reform and its alignment with
the Country Assistance Strategy (2008-12) and underscored the importance of inclusion,
in view of the regional divergences. Directors emphasized the need to address issues of
fiscal risks, and debt management. While acknowledging the progress made in some
areas, Executive Directors agreed that the development of a sound institutional
framework for managing oil and gas resource is critical. In this regard, Directors urged
the management to provide continued support to the authorities to strengthen
transparency and executive accountability mechanisms. Speakers also emphasized the
need for greater private sector participation, both to diversify the economy, but especially
to make electricity provision more efficient.
