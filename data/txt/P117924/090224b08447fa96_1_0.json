Ratings for the Seventh and Eighth Poverty\n            Reduction Support Credits Project for Ghana of were as\n            follows : outcome was moderately unsatisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was high, Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            unsatisfactory.  Some of the lessons learned include: Ghana\n            again became a substantially indebted country that must\n            direct a substantial share of its revenues to debt\n            servicing, and it did so within a decade after a major debt\n            relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt\n            Initiative. This highlights the importance of prudent macro\n            fiscal management in post-HIPC countries, and emphasizes\n            that the World Bank has to place in its policy lending for\n            helping its clients to preserve borrowing space. Adequate\n            macroeconomic management is a critical precondition of\n            budget support. The World Bank made the right choice to\n            focus on restoring fiscal discipline as part of risk\n            mitigation for EGPRC in 2009. Similarly, its choice not to\n            deploy Development Policy Operations DPOs in 2013\u201314 because\n            of the lack of an adequate macro framework was also correct.\n            Furthermore, Ghana\u2019s case shows that the World Bank is not a\n            substitute for the International Monterey Fund (IMF) in a\n            challenging context that requires a comprehensive\n            macroeconomic program. In this respect, Ghana is a good\n            example of World Bank\u2013IMF cooperation. Ghana\u2019s case shows\n            that DPOs deployed in an extremely weak public financial\n            management environment are unlikely to be successful. Ghana\n            experienced deterioration in resource allocation during\n            2008\u201312 because of debt-financed expenditure hikes that led\n            to interest payments of about 7 percent of Gross Domestic\n            Product (GDP) per year by 2016, taking precious resources\n            away from pro-poor spending, thus undermining Ghana\u2019s\n            overall growth and poverty reduction agenda and the\n            effectiveness of the World Bank\u2019s budget support. This shows\n            that the quality of public resource use in both public\n            financial management and allocations is an important\n            precondition of budget support success. Donor coordination\n            on budget support can be difficult in a challenging\n            environment like that in Ghana in 2008\u201313. Assessment of\n            eligibility for budget support is still a controversial area\n            in relationships between various donors. Despite a move\n            toward performance criteria based on agreed-to actions,\n            various donors may interpret different shocks differently,\n            which will affect donor coordination. Dealing with macro and\n            fiscal mismanagement when the macro framework is not\n            formally a part of the performance assessment can be an\n            especially contentious issue. Fiscal pressure can crowd out\n            discretionary expenditures, and service delivery sectors are\n            especially vulnerable. The World Bank can use DPF operations\n            to take a crucial role in protecting pro-poor expenditures\n            in such an environment the World Bank has a crucial role in\n            providing advisory services that are complementary to budget\n            support. A more proactive engagement in estimating the\n            fiscal impact of the salary reform introduction could have\n            helped in designing a phased approach consistent with the\n            long-term budgetary envelope."}, "docdt": "2016-06-27T08:09:01Z"}
