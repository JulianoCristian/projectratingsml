Program Development      This program document proposes a one-tranche Seventh Poverty Reduction
Objective(s) and         Support Credit (PRSC7) for SDR141 million (US$215 million equivalent) to
Contribution to CAS      the Republic of Ghana. This first Development Policy Operation of a series
                         of two (PRSC7 and PRSC8) supports the authorities efforts to consolidate
                         ongoing fiscal stabilization efforts and protect the development objectives
                         set in the Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda (GSGDA) for
                         2010-2013. The GSGDA emphasizes the need for macroeconomic
                         stabilization and greater executive efficiency, transparency and
                         accountability to provide the adequate setting for the reduction of poverty
                         and socio-economic inequalities through agricultural, private sector,
                         infrastructure and human resource development. Specifically, the PRSC7
                         supports continuing and deepening policy reforms initiated in 2009 to: (i)
                         restore budgetary discipline and (ii) tackle long-standing public sector and
                         energy issues, while (iii) protecting the poor and (iv) preparing for the oil
                         era. The proposed operation is aligned with the World Bank Groups
                         Country Assistance Strategy objectives for FY08-12 and with the World
                         Banks Africa Action Plan.

Risks and Risk           The proposed operation comprises the following risks:
Mitigation               (i) Downside risks from a slow (or absence of) recovery in the global macro-
                         economic situation, with implications for export receipt growth and
                         financing prospects (from public and private foreign creditors) for Ghana.
                         Combined with the IMF ECF, the proposed operation would help mitigate
                         these risks by supporting the fiscal consolidation measures, providing
                         needed financing to support the budget and BOP, and sending a strong signal
                         to markets and Development Partners of Ghanas continued commitment to
                         bring its fiscal stance to a sound and sustainable track;
                         (ii) Political feasibility risks related to the fiscal adjustment (opposition to
                         increased utilities tariffs and taxes, to delayed single spine implementation,

                                                vi
               and demand for new investment programs financed with current and future
               oil revenues) with new elections looming, which would weaken macro-
               economic stability and further increase banks vulnerabilities. The proposed
               operation would help mitigate some of these risks by supporting actions to
               (a) protect the poor through improved social protection mechanisms, (b)
               encourage better service delivery through effective decentralization, and (c)
               implement the second financial sector strategic plan for greater financial
               stability. In addition, the operation supports broader sharing of information
               (including in oil and gas through EITI), and consulting with stakeholders,
               including CSOs and unions, to build consensus on the design of a fiscally
               sustainable program of reforms;
               (iii) Implementation risks, as actions supported by the series mostly
               comprise policy design and approvals. Ghanas recent track record of
               reforms indeed suggests that, while necessary, policy approvals do not
               necessarily constitute sufficient conditions for implementation. The
               complementarity of the proposed operation with ongoing and forthcoming
               World Bank projects in PFM, energy (including oil), public sector reform
               and social protection would mitigate such risks;
               (iv) Technical and regulatory problems faced with oil production, which
               would affect the environment and diminish expected oil revenues. The
               proposed operation would mitigate some of these risks by supporting efforts
               to strengthen the petroleum regulatory and framework and introduce
               stabilization mechanisms through the oil revenue management framework;
               (v) Energy-related risks of various natures, including higher oil prices than
               budgeted, lower rains than expected, lower flows of gas from Nigeria than
               planned, which would all have negative implications for budget execution
               (through the accrual of larger contingent liabilities in electricity utilities).
               The implementation of the financial recovery plans in the energy sector as
               supported by the proposed operation would reduce such risks;
               (vi) Natural disasters, given the relatively high exposure of Ghanas
               population to multiple natural hazards, in particular in the North were
               poverty is concentrated.

                      SEVENTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT


                                         1. INTRODUCTION

1.       This program document proposes a one-tranche Seventh Poverty Reduction Support
Credit (PRSC7) for SDR141 million (US$215 million equivalent) to the Republic of Ghana.
This first Development Policy Operation of a programmatic series of two (PRSC7 and PRSC8)
supports the authorities efforts to consolidate ongoing fiscal stabilization efforts and protect the
development objectives set in the Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda (GSGDA) for
2010-2013. The GSGDA emphasizes the need for macroeconomic stabilization and greater
executive efficiency, transparency and accountability to provide the adequate setting for the
reduction of poverty and socio-economic inequalities through agricultural, private sector,
infrastructure and human resource development. Specifically, the PRSC7 supports continuing and
deepening policy reforms initiated in 2009 to: (i) restore budgetary discipline and (ii) tackle long-
standing public sector and energy issues, while (iii) protecting the poor and (iv) preparing for the
oil era. The proposed operation is aligned with the recently updated World Bank Groups Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) objectives for FY08-121 and with the World Banks Africa Action
Plan.
2.      The proposed operation takes place at a challenging juncture, as Ghana continues to
grapple with large macro-economic imbalances, which sharply contrast with positive medium-
term development prospects building on relatively strong institutions, recent oil discoveries and
democratic dividends, as well as a strong record of poverty alleviation in the last two decades.
The Ghanaian economy has been hard hit since late 2007 by a cumulative series of shocks
(droughts, floods, fuel, food, and financial crises), which exacerbated a structural trend of
widening fiscal imbalances, and exposed the economy to the need for sharp correction. Indeed, by
end-2008, fiscal (on a cash basis) and current account (including official transfers) deficits,
including grants, respectively culminated at 8.5 and 10.9 percent of GDP. In response, the
Government elected in January 2009 immediately adopted a multi-year stabilization program
aimed to put the debt to GDP ratio on a downward path from 2011 onwards, which received the
financial and technical support from the World Bank (Economic Governance and Poverty
Reduction Credit, EGPRC, June 2009, SDR194 million) and the International Monetary Fund
(Extended Credit Facility, ECF, July 2009, SDR387 million).
3.      While there are early signs of stabilization, achievements from 2009 and 2010 need to
be consolidated in 2011 to pave the way for a developmental use of oil revenue expected to
start flowing in December 2010. Since 2009, the economy has shown strong signs of
stabilization, while weathering the impact of the global financial crisis. Both fiscal and current
account deficits were significantly reduced, the exchange rate was stabilized and consumer price
inflation decelerated to single digit levels. The methodology to compute national accounts was
also updated, portraying a much richer economy than previously measured (see Box 1). But the
large stock of public expenditure arrears and outstanding commitments uncovered in the second
half of 2009 makes the ambitious fiscal stabilization objectives set forth in the 2011 Budget2

the Appropriation Act, approved together by the Parliament in December 2010.

much more difficult to meet, while weakening private and financial sectors, as well as utilities
operational capacities. In the face of it, an important external support is justified to crowd in
domestic private investors, foster the liquidation of public arrears and address related banks
vulnerabilities, against demonstrated progress on key structural reforms and a credible adjustment
plan.
4.      The PRSC7 is fully aligned with the harmonized Multi-Donor Budget Support
(MDBS) process. The World Bank was a founding member of the MDBS initiative and has been
the permanent co-chair of the group, providing US$100 million of annual support through a series
of poverty reduction support credits (PRSCs) between 2003 and 2008. The MDBS process is a
central instrument of aid harmonization in Ghana. It includes the identification with the
Government of a selective joint matrix of policy actions to be supported by Development Partners
(DPs), aligning their monitoring and evaluation frameworks through a common rolling 3-year
Progress Assessment Framework (PAF). In April 2009, Ghanas changing reality prompted the
Bank to respond to Governments request for extraordinary (front-loaded) assistance through the
EGPRC, given the need to support efforts not anticipated when the PAF was designed in April
2008. Efforts were since conducted among DPs and the Government to fully align the proposed
operation with the MDBS. With greater macro-economic stability and the finalization of the
GSGDA, the return to programmatic support is also deemed warranted within the current CAS
period.
5.      The proposed operation is part of a larger program of support to Ghana that notably
focuses on public financial management, public sector reform, energy and safety nets.
Following the board approval in FY10 of investment lending projects for public financial
management (US$28 million), electricity distribution (US$70 million), and social protection
(US$89 million ­ including US$49 million from the Crisis Response Window), the updated CAS
FY08-12 foresees in FY11 the submission to the Board of a public sector reform investment
lending project in support of Ghanas decentralization initiatives, an oil and gas capacity building
project, as well as an IBRD enclave to support the development of the gas infrastructure.3

        2. GHANA'S RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS

                              A.      RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

6.      The Government elected in January 2009 inherited a difficult macro-economic
situation, brought on by a series of shocks which exacerbated a structural trend of widening fiscal
imbalances. Rapid fiscal expansion in 2008 and the sudden closure of access to international
capital markets in September 2008 resulted in a widening current account deficit and a contracting
capital account surplus, reducing the stock of gross foreign currency reserves at the Bank of
Ghana to less than 2.3 months of imports. By end-2008, fiscal (on a cash basis) and current
account deficits, including grants, respectively culminated at 8.5 and 10.9 percent of GDP. While
fiscal expansion was prolonging trends observed since 2005 ­ with a public sector wage bill to
revenue ratio growing from 34 to 57 percent between 2004 and 2008 ­ it was also the result of a
combination of severe exogenous shocks, including floods and droughts in late 2007, a rise in
world food prices, which prompted the Government to introduce food tax exemptions, and a rise

  Other projects approved in FY10 include two sectoral Development Policy Operations (Agriculture, US$25 million,
and Natural Resource and Environmental Governance, US$10 million), and the Sustainable Rural Water Services
Investment project (US$75 million). Other projects contemplated for FY11 comprise a sectoral Development Policy
Operation in agriculture and investment projects in commercial agriculture and statistical capacity building.

in oil prices, which led the Government to purchase oil on behalf of utilities, in the absence of
effective tariff adjustment mechanisms. The electoral cycle also contributed to the fiscal
expansion, as observed during previous elections. Deficits and demand pressures strongly
contributed to the depreciation of the Ghana Cedi, which lost approximately 45 percent of its
value against the US dollar over June 2008 to June 2009, and to accelerated consumer price
inflation, which culminated at 20.7 percent (year-on-year) in June 2009.
7.     In response, the Government immediately adopted a multi-year fiscal stabilization
plan, to bring back the fiscal deficit and debt to GDP ratios to sustainable levels by 2011.
These intentions were reflected in the successive Budget Laws 2009, 2010 and 2011 approved by
Parliament, targeting end-year fiscal deficits (on a cash basis) at 5.5, 4.3 and 4.1 percent of GDP
in CY09, CY10 and CY11 (or equivalently 9.4, 7.5 and 7.5 percent of non oil GDP before
national accounts revision, see Box 1).

8.      The Government, civil society and DPs also realized the need to improve
transparency, executive accountability and oversight of public financial management
systems, to avoid fiscal overshooting going unnoticed in the future, as had been largely the case
in 2008. Indeed, the new Government and DPs (as well as most observers) were caught by
surprise by the severity of the macroeconomic situation in early 2009, and had to re-adjust their
ambitions to a changing reality. By August 2009, the discovery of a larger than anticipated
amount of expenditure arrears and outstanding commitments, accumulated in 2008, further
underlined the shortcomings of monitoring and information systems. With oil forthcoming
imminently, the exigency of transparency becomes even more paramount.

9.      The International Monetary Fund (IMF) supports the Government's fiscal
stabilization plan. On July 15, 2009, the IMF Board approved a 3-year arrangement under the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF, subsequently re-named Extended Credit Facility,
ECF) for Ghana in an amount of US$600 million to support the Government's economic program
to tackle macroeconomic imbalances. The first and second reviews were successfully concluded
in June 2010.
10.     Through the Economic Governance and Poverty Reduction Credit, IDA has also
been supporting structural reforms to restore budget discipline and tackle long-standing
public sector and energy issues, while protecting the poor. The DPO was approved on June 30,
2009 by the World Bank Board of Executive Directors, for a total amount of SDR193.8 million
(US$300 million equivalent) to be disbursed in two successive tranches of SDR96.9 million
each.4 Efforts supported by the EGPRC concentrated on measures to: (i) establish a treasury
single account, improve compliance with the public procurement law, correct any budget
deviations (fiscal deficit, pro-poor expenditures) through new fiscal measures, publish fiscal
accounts, and submit to Parliament the Freedom of Information Bill; (ii) reconstitute the boards of
energy-related utilities and regulatory authority, adopt an electricity sector financial recovery
plan, adopt draft legislation on the Ghana Petroleum Regulatory Authority and oil and gas fiscal
regime, implement a net hiring freeze in the public sector, eliminate ghost workers in health and

  The first tranche was disbursed upon effectiveness in July 2009 and the second tranche in June 2010 after Board
approval. A request was made by the Government of Ghana to waive one second tranche release condition related to
the Cabinet approval of the legislation concerning the proposed Ghana Petroleum Regulatory Authority and oil and
gas fiscal regime, given the perceived political need to proceed in sequence to establish the oil and gas fiscal and
regulatory frameworks through successive legislative instruments. Since June 2010, the oil revenue management bill
and the oil exploration and production bill were approved by Cabinet and submitted to Parliament. All five other
conditions for the disbursement of the second tranche were met.

11.     Since mid-2009, the economy has shown strong signs of stabilization. Following large
expenditure slippages in 2008, both the fiscal and current account deficits were significantly
reduced in the course of 2009, under the impact of positive exogenous shocks (high hydroelectric
reserves with good rains, low oil prices, high cocoa and gold prices, good cocoa harvest) and
significant fiscal stabilization efforts and achievements (see Tables 1 and 2). In particular,
domestically financed capital expenditures were strongly compressed. The fiscal deficit (on a cash
basis) reached 5.8 percent of GDP in 2009 (against 8.5 percent a year earlier) while the balance of
payments current account registered a 3.0 percent of GDP deficit (against 10.9 percent a year
earlier). Since July 2009, the exchange rate stabilized and even slightly appreciated against the
US$ (following a 45 percent depreciation in the previous twelve months). Consumer prices also
broadly stabilized, growing at an annual pace of 9.4 percent over the period October 2009-
September 2010, down from the peak of 20.7 percent recorded for the period July 2008-June
2009. By October 2010, 6-month T-Bills were subscribed at 12.8 percent, down from 28.8 percent
a year earlier. Meanwhile sovereign bonds average maturities increased, suggesting greater
investors confidence in Ghanas medium term prospects.
12.    Measured on a commitment basis, the fiscal deficit was reduced from 11.8 percent of
GDP in 2008 to 6.4 percent in 2009 (including Government arrears to private contractors and
outstanding commitments to statutory funds)5. The review by Parliament in August 2009 of the
2009 budget execution at mid-year revealed an end-year 2008 stock of public expenditure arrears

and outstanding commitments largely exceeding that budgeted to be cleared in 2009 (GH¢1.13
billion - against GH¢0.54 billion budgeted). By end-2009, the stock had gone up to an estimated
amount of GH¢1.43 billion, the result of the accumulation of new arrears and outstanding
commitments exceeding repayments. However, government liabilities to State-Owned Enterprises
(SOEs), in the energy sector in particular, were reduced from GH¢0.67 billion to GH¢0.32 billion
between December 2008 and December 2009. From 2010 onwards, a progressive decline in the
stock of domestic arrears and outstanding commitments and the non-accumulation of external
arrears has been retained as quantitative performance criteria under the IMF ECF arrangement. 6
13.     IDA and IMF exceptional financing strongly contributed to foreign currency
reserves replenishment and exchange rate stabilization. The IDA EGPRC, the IMF ECF and
the decision from the G20 in March 2009 to raise special drawing rights (SDR) for developing
countries in response to the financial crisis allowed Ghana to benefit from a cumulated net inflow
of US$700 million in 2009, which came in addition to earlier commitments. These official
transfers strongly contributed to the stabilization of the exchange rate since July 2009, as well as
to the replenishment of foreign currency reserves, at 2.9 months of imports. Increased donor
assistance in 2009 also cushioned the impact of fiscal stabilization on public programs and
investments.
14.     Indirect indicators suggest a significant deceleration in GDP growth in 2009. Real
GDP growth decelerated from 8.4 percent in 2008 to 4.7 percent in 2009, largely as a result of the
fiscal consolidation effort which strongly contracted aggregate demand. Not accounting for
possible (negative) multiplier effects, the negative growth in public primary expenditures
(excluding transfers, and in spite of a significant increase in foreign financed capital expenditure)
between 2008 and 2009 (-24 percent in real terms), cost about 2.7 percentage points of real GDP
growth in 2009. In contrast, fiscal expansion in 2008 (+20 percent in real terms) ­ not accounting
for arrears accumulation or multiplier effects, added about 2.4 percentage points of growth in
2008 through stimulated aggregate demand. Thus fiscal consolidation significantly contributed to
the growth deceleration observed between 2008 and 2009, underlining the great influence of fiscal
cycles in Ghana on growth fluctuations.

15.     Fortunately, economic activity was supported since 2009 by positive terms of trade,
good climatic conditions, favoring agricultural and hydro-electric production, and relative
isolation from financial turmoil. Not being greatly exposed to international financial markets
(on both assets and liabilities sides), Ghanas financial sector (mostly banks) was able to
withstand the global financial crisis, as benefiting from booming net export receipts (exports
minus imports, +US$2,516 million in 2009 compared with 2008) largely offsetting reduced
capital inflows and remittances, which respectively decreased by US$439 million and US$182
million compared with 2008. Banks balance sheets continued to expand rapidly in 2009 and
2010, while remaining highly liquid and significantly elevating capital adequacy ratios, notably in
light of raised capital to meet the new statutory minimum capital requirements.
16.    But reduced financing needs from the Government did not crowd in private
investment. Although the negative short-run impact of public expenditures containment on
economic growth was expected, one could have also anticipated this effect to be at least partially


6
  It is expected that capping the stock of arrears will give time to authorities to address the structural issues behind
their accumulation, that is, (i) the rigidity in budget management imposed by statutory funds and (ii) the absence of
commitment controls for Ministries of Energy and Roads and Highway. Such controls were relaxed in late 2007 to
grant these ministries greater flexibility to accelerate investment in the midst of the energy and flood crises.

                                                       -5-
offset by increased private consumption and investments with declining costs of fund. 7 This
effect however did not materialize, as banking credit to the private sector at best stagnated since
December 2008 (growing at an annual growth rate of -1.6 percent in real terms over the period
January 2009-September 2010). One major reason for this lack of transmission of monetary
policy to banks lending lies in the explosion of banks non performing loans, which grew from
7.7 percent of gross loans in December 2008 to 20.0 percent in February 2010. In turn, high NPLs
have increased banks vulnerabilities and constrained their capacity to extend credit to the private
sector and SOEs, as significantly raising their loans loss provisions. In retrospect, the rapid
expansion of credit in 2007 and 2008 in a high inflation and high interest rate environment
created conditions for the subsequent asset deterioration, as risk management regulations and
practices did not improve commensurately.
17.     Furthermore, a large portion of banks' NPLs ­ almost half, according to the recent
Financial Sector Assessment Programme ­ can directly be attributed to the accumulation of
public expenditure arrears in 2008. These include impaired assets due directly to built-up
public arrears to contractors and SOEs, and indirectly to arrears to vendors not paid by the
affected contractors and SOEs. Arrears to contractors and outstanding commitments to SOEs
accumulated in 2008 and forwarded to 2009 amounted to respectively GH¢ 830 million and GH¢
670 million, or a total stock of GH¢ 1,500 million (5.0 percent of GDP in 2008), excluding
outstanding commitments to statutory funds (GH¢ 300 million). By end-2009, such stock had
gone down to GH¢1,175 million (and to GH¢910 million by end-2010), although commitments to
Statutory funds had gone up to GH¢515 million in the meantime (and were projected to stay at
this level until end-2010).
18.     As for 2010, the Ghana Statistical Services project a 6.6 percent growth in real GDP.
Oil-related investment expenditures (e.g. construction, information and communication
technologies, hotels, financial intermediation) and continuously favorable climatic and terms of
trade conditions triggered a slight uptake in economic growth in the first half of 2010, reinforced
with a moderate rebound in private sector credit growth since June 2009, as banks pursue their
financial consolidation and NPL progressively decline (to 18.1 percent of gross loans in
September 2010, down from a peak of 20.0 percent in February 2010).

 From 17 percent in December 2008, the Bank of Ghana prime policy rate went down to 13.5 percent in July 2010,
with inter-bank and repo rates following the same trend.

                                 Box 1: Ghana's New National Accounts
New national accounts were published in November 2010 by the Ghana Statistical Services (GSS). The new accounts
cover the period 2006-2009, with provisional data for 2010. These new national accounts present a major departure
from previous national accounts from GSS, as entailing an upward revision in current GDP of 60 percent in 2006.

While the use of a new base year (2006 instead of 1993) has implications for real GDP growth computations going
forward and backward from 2006, the difference in 2006 between old and new accounts is entirely attributable to (i)
the inclusion of additional data sources (population census, households surveys, tax data, industrial and transport
surveys, etc.) which allow more accurate coverage of economic activity, and (ii) the adoption of an improved
methodology to compute national accounts (SNA93, in lieu of SNA68 used so far). The new methodology includes
using supply and use tables, as well as new ways to compute wholesale and retail trade, fisheries, livestock, and
forestry value addition. The computation of the new national accounts benefited from the technical assistance from
GTZ, DANIDA and IMF.

From an economic perspective, the new accounts portray a wealthier and more service-oriented Ghanaian economy.
While agriculture and industry GDP were revised upward by about 30 and 22 percent respectively, service GDP was
revised upward by about 147 percent in 2006. As imports, exports, government final consumption and gross capital
formation were almost unaffected by the revision, most the upward adjustment took place in household final
consumption (+72 percent in 2006). In turn, the latter found its financing in higher income from domestic production
for domestic markets, services in particular. While emerging services were better captured with the new methodology
(e.g., information and communication technologies), the large revision of the service sector also mirrors a better
coverage of the informal sector, through household or transport surveys, or the revision in the methodology used for
computing retail trade.

                  B.       MACRO-ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

19.     By October 2010, IMF was considering Ghana on track to meet its immediate
macroeconomic targets. Following a mission in September 2010 for the third review under the
ECF, the IMF staff was able to conclude that ECF quantitative program targets for the first half of
2010 were all met (except for the fiscal deficit, which was narrowly missed by 0.3 percent of
GDP), thanks notably to the removal of important tax exemptions8, the conversion of excise to ad-
valorem taxes (to avoid inflation erosion), increased royalties from the mining sector, higher
dividend distribution from State-Owned Enterprises, and better alignment of user fees with costs
(in the transport sector notably). However, higher foreign financed capital expenditures, and
lower grants and non-tax revenue than initially anticipated, were all worsening the fiscal outlook,
making the initial 4.3 percent of GDP cash fiscal deficit target for 2010 unattainable, as projected
at 5.6 percent by November 2010. In the event, the Government was only able to repay the
equivalent of 0.6 percent of GDP worth of public arrears, against 1.7 percent of GDP initially
budgeted. But the fact that no new arrears had been accumulated in 2010 was bringing down the
projected fiscal deficit (on a commitment basis) and stock of arrears in 2010 to 5.5 and 3.7
percent of GDP respectively, down from 6.4 and 4.6 percent in 2009.
20.     In 2011, the pursuit of fiscal stabilization will require additional efforts. While
structural reforms in energy (cost recovery tariffs), public sector (conduction of payroll audits and
elimination of ghost workers, restructuring of Subvented Agencies, civil service reform for
effective decentralization and improved performance management) and public financial
management (treasury single account, integrated financial management and information system,
effective cash management and commitment control systems, migration of all MDAs, but security
agencies, to the payroll management system) should help prevent the re-occurrence of
expenditure slippages, new bold fiscal measures will be needed in 2011 to consolidate
macroeconomic stabilization achievements recorded since 2009. Indeed, the net revenue from oil9
channeled to the budget (per the Petroleum Revenue Management Bill, see Section 4B), at 0.9
percent of GDP, will be insufficient to further reduce the deficit and public debt as largely offset
by higher interest costs, declining grants and non-oil non tax revenue and a public sector wage bill
which would be significantly inflated by a rapid implementation of the Single Spine Salary
Structure (SSSS, see Section 4B).10 Against this background, the Government, per the Budget
Law 2011 submitted to Parliament, intends to increase direct taxation, see below, further reduce




8
   While extending and improving social protection through direct cash transfers (see Section 4B), the Government
removed in 2010 customs tariff exemption on several products (rice, cooking oil, and poultry) introduced in 2008 to
protect vulnerable households, given its large fiscal cost and poor targeting efficiency.
9
   The production of oil from 2011 onwards will have a significant impact on GDP, from a national accounting
perspective, as reflected in Table 1. But it will initially have a modest impact on households incomes, or non oil
economic activity. Indeed, job creation in the oil sector, and forward and backward linkages to non oil sectors are
expected to be modest. And oil revenues not going to the budget or funds (to be invested abroad, per the Petroleum
Revenue Management Law, see Section 4B), that is, going to the consortium, will mostly be expatriated to repay
capital expenditures undertaken to build the extractive capacity.
10
   The single spine pay reform aims at unifying salary scales across the various public sector entities, see Section 4B.
Since it is not intended to negatively affect anyones salary, the implementation of the reform could be fiscally
expensive. World Bank staff calculations suggest in particular that the initially planned increase in relativities
(relative difference between steps in grades) from 1.7 percent in 2010 to 1.8 percent in 2011 and 2.0 percent in 2012
would alone inflate the wage bill by 6 and 18 percent respectively. Other factors to be considered in the determination
of the wage bill include the minimum wage in the public sector as well as net recruitments.

                                                      - 10 -
domestically financed capital expenditure11, and spread out the full implementation of the SSSS
over the next 4 years. Combined with higher GDP with oil, these measures would bring the gross
public debt to GDP ratio to 37 percent in 2011- down from 41 percent in 2010, see Table 2. The
net debt would look more favorable once included savings to the heritage and stabilization oil
funds proposed under the Petroleum revenue management bill under discussion at Parliament.
21.     Although portraying a more favorable fiscal situation, new national accounts have
little influence on the macroeconomic framework, as not affecting the internal budget
dynamics. The new national accounts published in November 2010 entail a 60 percent upward
revision in GDP in 2006, and higher relative differences in 2007-2009, see Box 1. As such, fiscal
deficit and public debt to GDP ratios over the same period were mechanically reduced and look
now less worrisome. But the budget financing constraint will obviously not be affected, as
domestic savings will similarly decline in proportion of GDP. Indeed, the financing envelope
available to the Government will remain determined domestically by inflation targets followed by
BoG, net domestic financing constraints and domestic resource mobilization opportunities, and
externally by official assistance and non concessional borrowing limits set forth in the IMF
program. This constraint is internalized in the Budget Law 2011 as net domestic financing is
projected to drop from 4.3 to 1.8 percent of GDP between 2010 and 2011. Besides, as tax
collection performance (in proportion of GDP) is negatively affected by higher GDP (at 13.1
percent of GDP in 2010, that is below non oil African low income countries average, 15 percent,
and non oil African middle income countries average, 26 percent), the Government acknowledges
the need and opportunity to raise taxes, direct taxes in particular. This intention is reflected in the
Budget 2011, which foresees direct taxes to grow by 0.6 percentage point of GDP in 2011 and
another 1.0 percentage point of GDP in 2012.
22.     The Government strategy is not immune from risks. Slower non-oil GDP growth than
expected and mounting political pressures for fiscal expansion and public sector wage increases
could strongly undermine Government plans to restore debt sustainability.

23.      The proper and swift liquidation of public arrears will be critical to sustain non-oil
GDP growth through the resumption of banking credit to the private sector. Fiscal
projections for 2011 rely on a non­oil GDP growth outlook of 7.5 percent in real terms, which is
dependent on a number of optimistic assumptions on exogenous factors such as continued high
export demand and prices12 and good rains (for agriculture and hydroelectric production). Under
a low case scenario characterized by a less favorable environment, non oil GDP growth could fall
to the 4-5 percent range and jeopardize the fiscal stabilization strategy, through lower revenue13
and political support to it (see below also). In the face of it, the proper and swift liquidation of
public arrears (possibly through their conversion to formal debt instruments), although not
budgeted - would play an important role to sustain growth, through its impact on NPLs and
related banks ability to extend credit to the private sector. To meet this objective, arrears
liquidation will need to be part of a broader credible fiscal stabilization package, accompanied


11
    In order to do so while complying with legal obligations to transfer earmarked revenue to Statutory funds, the
Government decided to re-classify MDRI and HPIC-related social expenditures as part of Statutory funds (GET and
DACF in particular) planned expenditures.
12
   Terms of trade are forecast to start declining in 2011 and 2012, under the influence of rising oil prices and
declining export prices (gold, cocoa). Between 2004 and 2010, export prices grew by 96 percent, and were at their
historically highest levels in 2010.
13
   Staff calculations suggest that the materialization of the low case scenario could entail a 0.8 percentage point of
GDP deviation with respect to fiscal deficit targets retained in 2011.

with independent audits to limit fraud or moral hazard, and appropriate liquidity management to
contain inflation pressures.

24.     The pursuit of the fiscal adjustment is also endangered by a delicate political
economy. Risks lie in particular in Governments ability to negotiate with unions a within-budget
public wage increase and a gradual implementation of the "single spine" reform, succeed in
significantly raising taxes, contain domestically financed capital expenditures, and initially use oil
wealth to reduce the deficit rather than to finance new public programs. The onset of oil, the
announcement of higher financial resources through greater South-South cooperation, and the
higher statistical GDP have indeed, without doubt, led to high expectations among population
that Ghana will soon join a group of oil rich countries and that this will provide a large part of
what is needed. And public sector unions have strongly pushed for the introduction of the "single
spine" salary structure which will eventually entail substantial increases in individual
remunerations once fully rolled out across the entire public sector. This in a broader context of
very competitive politics and a repeated history of macroeconomic slippages ahead of general
elections, the next one being scheduled for end-2012. In the face of it, greater communication
with CSOs and labor unions on macroeconomic issues and is critically needed to manage
expectations. Productivity gains for better service delivery, through public sector reform (job
identification, performance and human resource management, salary administration), will be
needed to accompany the implementation of the new salary structure. Reaching agreements
among political parties to isolate fiscal matters from bipartisan politics, through fiscal
responsibility rules and laws (e.g. the oil revenue management bill) are also critical to ensure the
sustainability of reforms over successive administrations.
25.     In the medium term, the consolidation of macroeconomic stability gains will
critically depend on the implementation of a set of key structural measures. The recent
widening of public deficits originated principally from the rapid increase in remunerations in the
public sector14, large subsidies to the energy sector in the absence of cost recovery mechanisms,
the relaxation of some important public financial management systems, and a general lack of
fiscal transparency allowing fiscal imbalances to widen as unnoticed. As a result, the fiscal
correction, to be credible and sustained, needs to be structural in nature ­ with a strong focus on
public financial management and transparency, public sector and energy reforms to meet the
objectives of reinforcing expenditure control systems, and improving service delivery at
sustainable cost, while protecting the poor from bearing the cost of the adjustment.
26.     Besides, the arrival of oil brings additional challenges to the quality of growth and its
pro-poor nature. Oil, through its impact on Government revenue, will almost inevitably boost
growth in the next years through demand effects. But it will also exacerbate a number of already
existing challenges related to governance (in oil and gas sectors, and more broadly in the
management of public resources), volatility (prices, oil reserves uncertainty), agricultural
competitiveness and geographical disparities. Ghanas ability to address these challenges will
have a major influence on longer term growth and poverty alleviation. The World Bank report on
the economy-wide impact of oil discovery prepared in 2009 suggests that, in absence of fiscal
consolidation, increased transparency, removed bottlenecks in non tradable sectors, stabilization
mechanisms and increased provision of agricultural public goods, economic growth could, after
14
   Preliminary data collected as part of the ongoing Public Expenditure Review suggest that about 2/5 of the increase
in the Government wage bill (including allowances) between 2004 and 2008 stemmed from increase in the wage bill
of subvented agencies. While the number of employees grew respectively by 4 and 5 percent annually in Ministries &
Departments and Subvented Agencies, individual remunerations (in nominal terms) grew annually by 17 percent in
Ministries & Departments and 37 percent in Subvented Agencies between 2004 and 2008.

the initial boom, be lower over the long run that without oil. In the event, poverty would suffer
from lower economic growth and increased regional disparities, in disfavor of the North.
27.     The implementation of the Government's economic stabilization and reform
program should minimize risks of external debt distress. An update to the Joint Bank-Fund
DSA conducted in June 200915 was performed by the IMF staff in June 201016. In line with the
2009 DSA, the updated DSA continues to assess Ghanas risk of debt distress as moderate.
Nonetheless, the inclusion of higher and more front-loaded non-concessional borrowing17 in the
baseline scenario tend to increase external and public debt vulnerabilities compared with the
previous DSA. The need to liquidate a larger stock of public expenditure arrears than considered
(as not uncovered) in the previous DSA also suggests that a stronger fiscal stabilization effort will
be required to maintain debt sustainability, despite the appreciation of the Ghana Cedi since July
2009, and lower external concessional and non- concessional borrowing than anticipated in 2009
(consistent with a smaller current account deficit than projected). Given its implications on debt to
GDP ratios, as well as on GNI per capita (and related prospects to access middle income status
and a wider range of external financing options18), a new joint Bank-Fund DSA will be conducted
in FY11 using new national accounts.

28.     Debt sustainability is also predicated on prudent non concessional borrowing.
Following the issuance of US$750 million worth of Eurobonds in 2007 (to finance additional
electricity capacity and road networks), Ghana borrowed US$458 million equivalent in 2008 and
US$448 million equivalent in 2009 to finance projects for rural electrification, electricity
transmission and generation capacity, housing, health, and security, as well as to cover an
unfunded external SOE liability19. However, MOFEP continues to suffer from insufficient
capacity to assess the social returns on these projects. As such, the non concessional borrowing
policy note distributed to the Board of Executive Directors in January 2010 (covering loans
contracted in 2008) recommended that (i) IDA continue to provide Ghana its full IDA allocation
on blend terms in FY10. A new note covering loans contracted in 2009, to be distributed to the
Board in FY11, maintains the same position, in light of steps initiated by the Government to
improve its capacity to manage non-concessional debt, by (i) restoring SOEs operational and
financial sustainability to limit default risks on their non-concessional debt20; (ii) developing a

17
   Following the conclusion of the two first ECF reviews, the continued limit for non-concessional borrowing was
raised to US$649.1 million for the period July 15, 2009 - June 30, 2011, up from US$300 million previously. The
new continued limit includes all new non-concessional borrowing loans - publically guaranteed or not, contracted by
the five energy-related State-Owned Enterprises (TOR, VRA, ECG, BOST and GNPC). By doing so, the IMF
acknowledges the imperfect distinction between de jure public and publically guaranteed and de facto non guaranteed
external non-concessional debt contracted by these SOEs, which resulted in the past in higher external non-
concessional public debt. The ECF arrangement going forward also clarifies what constitutes "debt", to avoid the
recurrence of misunderstanding in reporting obligations.
18
    Preliminary calculations using new national accounts suggest that Ghanas GNI per capita, using Atlas method,
stood at US$1,190 in 2009, that is slightly above the middle income country threshold, US$1,165.
19
    The IMF judged that the takeover by the budget of the US$100 million SOE liability in July 2009 was not part of
the ECF arrangement. Indeed, the ECF only allowed non-concessional borrowing for the Ghana National Petroleum
Corporation to finance oil and gas projects. The Government did not report this loan arrangement as it rather
considered it as a trade credit, which did not need to go through the regular loan approval process via Parliament.

    This comprises the implementation of electricity tariff increases from June 1, 2010 as part of the electricity
financial recovery plan adopted by Cabinet in March 2010, see Section 4B. This also includes the GH¢445 million

and appraise public investment projects, through the adoption and implementation of the Public
Private Partnership policy (see Section 4B).

29.    Based on preliminary information received from MOFEP as of October 20, 2010, the
continued limit on non-concessional borrowing had not been breached in 2010.22 And public
announcements of large loans signed with new partners will not have any significant bearing on
Ghanas external debt in the near future.23

30.      Ghana's macro-economic framework is assessed as adequate for the purpose of the
proposed operation. The fiscal stabilization objectives set forth in the 2011 Budget, the nature
and pace of actions taken by the Government in 2009 and 2010 to regain control of the fiscal
situation on a sustainable basis and the complementary financial assistance from Development
Partners and the IMF provide the conditions for the proposed operation to meet its objectives, and
justifies the use of IDA resources.

21
   A debt management strategy is being developed drawing on joint Bank-Fund technical assistance, and was retained
as a structural benchmark under the ECF arrangement. The strategy will be adopted and published by end­2010,
establishing clear objectives for debt management in terms of the cost and risk of the debt portfolio (including
contingent liabilities), and identifying potential funding sources. The government envisions that the adoption of new
financial instruments may require changes in the relevant legislation. Annual reporting to parliament will continue.

   In 2010, Loans for the purchase of fire-fighting equipments and coastal protection were both contracted, within the
ECF limits. Another project for housing equipments and services, for a total of US$1.5 billion to be disbursed over 5
years, was ratified by Parliament, but was not made effective as not signed by MOFEP.
23
    In September 2010, the President of Ghana signed a general Framework Agreement with China opening the
possibility for large project financing in the future. But converting this agreement to signed loans will require project
preparation, Parliamentary ratification, and MOFEP final signature, and none of these steps is foreseen in the near
future. As for any non concessional loan signed by MOFEP, the World Bank will continue to consult MOFEP to
assess on what basis projects have been selected and appraised. On its side, Japan announced its intention to resume
concessional lending to Ghana, which had been stopped when Ghana entered the HPIC process. Discussions between
Japan officials and World Bank staff indicated that Japans potential envelope for lending to Ghana will remain very
modest with respect to Ghanas current external debt.

        C.       POVERTY TRENDS AND PROGRESS IN SOCIAL AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT

31.     Ghana recorded very significant poverty reduction between 1992 and 2006, though
almost entirely concentrated in the South. The estimated proportion of the poor in the total
population went down from 51.7 percent in 1992 to 28.5 percent in 2006.24 And this trend was
accompanied with a strong decline in the prevalence of malnutrition, which was halved between
1993 and 2008. But most of the poverty reduction occurred in the South, where large productivity
gains in the agricultural sector (cocoa in particular) and demographic changes freed human and
financial resources to be redeployed and invested in higher value-added sectors, the urban
informal sector in particular. The bulk of poverty has become concentrated in the three northern
regions which now comprise more than half of the poor (against a fourth of Ghanas population)
and where no significant poverty reduction has been observed in the past, either through local
development or out-migration.25

32.     Participatory and quantitative assessments describe a situation where the poor in
Northern Ghana are predominantly rainfall-dependent farmers. These farmers are highly
vulnerable to shocks given the limited diversification of their income sources. While the poor
have little education, increases in education in Northern Ghana do not seem to have provided
greater livelihood opportunities. This is reflective of the absence of better off-farm opportunities
in these regions. To cope with the various shocks to which they are exposed (floods, droughts,
insects, diseases, conflicts ­ all of which are preventable with relevant infrastructure, public
services, insurance and conflict resolution mechanisms) the poor tend to mortgage their prospects
to eventually escape poverty by depleting their human and physical capital and adopting risky
behaviors, including child migration or illegal artisanal mining.

33.     Efforts to address the special needs of these lagging regions had been initiated in the
recent past, and there are ongoing efforts to amplify them in the context of an ambitious Savanna
Accelerated Development initiative which is supported by several Development Partners (DPs)
including the Bank. The initiative aims to increase agricultural productivity, promote a more
sustainable management of its natural resources and reduce the exposure of the population to
collective risks, such as natural disasters. The initiative will ensure tight coordination and better
targeting of public and private (e.g. NGOs) activities, in order to achieve durable poverty
alleviation. In this respect, effective decentralization of resource and decision making is foreseen
as an important means to address regional imbalances in service delivery, via the strengthening of
local capacity and vertical accountability mechanisms, see Section 4B. Greater targeting
efficiency (through geographical targeting and the adoption of a common targeting mechanism in
particular) and the reduction of unit costs of social programs is also foreseen to be critical to scale
up social protection in the North, see Section 4B.

34.      Since 2006, various factors could have impacted poverty positively or negatively.
Between 2006 and 2009, per capita real private consumption grew by approximately 4 percent,
which, if equally shared across households, should have generated modest poverty reduction
gains (assuming unchanged distribution, the headcount index would have approached 27.4
percent by end-2009). However, important uncertainties regarding the measurement of private
consumption and its distribution among households and regions, and the fact that some recent
shocks might have disproportionally affected the poor could mean lower actual poverty reduction
gains. Although tentative in the absence of a recent household survey, 26 various analyses indeed
suggest that recent macroeconomic turbulences could have had a significant impact on poverty.
A participatory analysis, voicing the perspective of the poor from the poorest Northern regions,
emphasizes the negative consequences of climatic events and price variations (upwards and
downwards) on vulnerable households livelihoods, and the fact that short term coping strategies
(e.g. bush burning, child labor and migration) chosen by the same households often aggravate
their situation. An ex-ante simulation analysis, linking recent macroeconomic developments and
outlook (lower FDI and remittances, export demand) to microeconomic outcomes (monetary
consumption, caloric intake, education and health demand), also suggests the likely negative
impact of the global crisis on poverty.

35.    Ghana's poor high vulnerability to frequent shocks underline the importance of
protecting them through targeted measures, such as a further extension of the cash transfer
program (Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty, LEAP) to new beneficiaries. The recent
review of existing social protection mechanisms indeed suggests that LEAP offers the greatest
guarantee of reaching the poor as relatively well targeted,27 even if implementation costs remain
high and could be reduced as the program expands (and other programs adopt similar targeting
mechanisms, See Section 4B).

36.     The ongoing fiscal stabilization efforts also call for protection and improved
effectiveness and efficiency of pro-poor expenditures. In spite of large cuts in public spending,
pro-poor were protected in 2009, see Section 4B, and it will be important to continue protecting
them in the future. But effectiveness and efficiency gains can be made in numerous sectors as
well. The forthcoming Public Expenditure Review underline in this respect the criticality of

  A new Ghana Living Standard Survey (GLSS6) is scheduled to be conducted in 2011.
27
   See Republic of Ghana: Improving the Targeting of Social Programs, World Bank, June 2010, Washington D.C.
The report suggests that with 57 percent of its beneficiaries below the poverty line, LEAP has the highest targeting
efficiency among Ghanas social programs and subsidies.

                                                    - 16 -
containing general increases in personal emoluments to lower unit costs of service delivery (in
Health, Education and Agriculture networks in particular) while providing the space for financing
non-wage expenditure, and encourage effective deployment of staff and supervisors to poor areas.
It also underlines the criticality of PFM reforms, cash management in particular, to accelerate
releases to beneficiaries.

37.     The new national accounts (see Box 1) could shed new light on the relationship
between growth and poverty. Ghanas recent statistical efforts to refine and update its
assessment of economic activity patterns should not strongly affect the measurement of poverty
based on household budget surveys. Indeed, although private consumption was significantly
revised upwards (by about 72 percent in 2006) in national accounts, poverty numbers are unlikely
to be significantly affected, because food consumption data from household expenditure surveys,
which forms the basis for the computation of poverty, are now also being used to compute private
food consumption in national accounts. However, it is very possible that the upward revision in
non food private consumption could entail revision in income distribution figures. Indeed, as poor
mostly consume food28, it is thus likely that most of the additional non-food consumption is
consumed by richer households.29 Besides, the forthcoming revision in GDP growth numbers
from 1993 to 2006 (using 2006 as base year) could also modify our understanding of the role
played by economic growth, and its various sectors, in poverty reduction in the last two decades.
So far, the assessment was that Ghanas economic growth had been very much "pro-poor"
between 1992 and 2006, at least from a cross-country perspective. Indeed, Ghana stands as one of
the countries that have experienced the largest growth contribution and the lowest inequality
contribution to poverty reduction. Out of a sample of 61 countries for which data exist, only one
country ­ Lithuania -­ managed to achieve higher growth than Ghana with smaller inequality
increase.

38.     The review of progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) depicts
a picture of quick progress, but on sanitation and health. The income poverty, hunger,
primary completion, gender parity at school and access to water goals (MDG1a, MDG1b, MDG2,
MDG3 and MDG7a respectively) are on track to be met by 2015, if not already met (MDG7a).30
These services have been extended to millions of poor in the past decade, and protecting the gains
of the past must be a key priority for the coming years. At the same time, other important MDGs,
such as sanitation (MDG7b), child (MDG4) and maternal mortality (MDG5) are still off-track and
require more effort, for their own sake and likely large impact on other MDGs.31


28
    The poverty line defines the minimum food and non-food consumption required not to be poor (the sum of food
and non-food poverty lines). The calculation of adult equivalents food requirements (the food poverty line) involves
measuring the local cost of consuming 2900 calories per day under a typical diet. Non-food requirements (the non-
food poverty line) are measured by the amount of non-food items consumed by those whose total consumption is
close to the food poverty line. This is based on the principle that these non-food items are so essential to households
that they forgo meeting their food requirements to purchase these non-food items. In 2005/6, these non-food items
represented 22 percent of the total consumption of households close to the poverty line.
29
   It is known for a fact that expenditure surveys typically underestimate consumption levels of the rich households
more than they do with poor households, as the latter have simpler consumption patterns to measure.
30
   When at least two observations are available after 1990, with a sufficient number of years separating them, the
World Bank determines whether a country is on or off track to meet a given MDG by 2015. To do so, it compares the
progress recorded so far with that needed to reach the MDG, under the assumption that progress becomes
increasingly difficult the closer countries get to the goal. Technically, this is equivalent to comparing the annual
growth rate between 1990 and today with the constant growth rate required to reach the MDG in 2015 from the
situation in 1990.

39.     Health. In 2009, the holistic assessment of the health sector showed overall
satisfactory performance. Such a performance is also measured by the comparison of the last
two demographic and health surveys in 2003 and 2008. The progress achieved over this period is
impressive: under-5 mortality was reduced from 111 deaths per 1,000 births to 80, the proportion
of malnourished under-5 children was reduced from 18 to 14 percent, and the proportion of
medically assisted deliveries went up from 47 to 59 percent. Thus, progress on maternal mortality

births in the pregnancy-related mortality rate. Yet, slow progress in the previous decade has made
these two MDG off track. Meanwhile, HIV prevalence also declined (from 2.7 to 2.2 percent of
the population between 2005 and 2008), as well as Under-5 malaria case fatality (from 2.9 to 2.2
percent of the relevant population between 2002 and 2006) as the use of insecticide treated nets
grew rapidly over the same period. Health progress results to a large extent from the creation and
continued increase in coverage under the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), reaching
13.8 million people by June 2009 (60 percent of the population). Pro-poor progress during the
2007-08 food and fuel crisis was supported by public subsidies that paid some of the insurance
premium due by the poor.

40.      Education. In line with the Education Sector Development Strategy adopted in 2003,
progress in terms of access to primary education has been significant. Gross primary
enrollment rates went up from 86 to 95 percent between 2003/4 and 2008/9, while net primary
enrollment rates went up from 56 to 88 percent over the same period.32 Over the years, increased
efforts at building new schools in deprived districts, and increased attention to gender parity, have
allowed for an extension of progress in access in primary education by vulnerable populations.33
The demand side was supported with the initiation of a school feeding program in poor regions,
and by the development of conditional transfers in the context of the LEAP program (which also
involves incentives to improve nutrition).

41.    Water and Sanitation. Demographic and Health surveys (DHS) regularly conducted
since 1990 report steady progress in access to safer water, in both rural and urban areas,
which sharply contrast with the slow progress registered in access to sanitation facilities

32
   Recent problems incurred with the Education Monitoring and Information System (EMIS) have raised concerns
that continued progress in access, gender parity and completion rates could not be observed during the 2009/10
school year.
33
   Policy attention is now increasingly shifting to quality. Ghanaians students rank poorly in international
mathematical and science tests (TIMSS), and national tests conducted in 2007/8 suggest that only 26 and 11 percent
of primary graduates are respectively proficient in English and in mathematics.

throughout Ghana. Using different definitions of access than that retained internationally, the
Ghana Community Water and Sanitation Agency presents a more balanced picture of progress
between water and sanitation. It nonetheless remains that Ghana continue to face great challenges
in the sector overall, from insufficient domestic funding to inadequate institutional capacity for
effective sector coordination and management.

                        D.           GHANA GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY

42.      In 2010, the Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda (GSGDA, 2010-13)
followed on from Ghana's second Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS II, 2006-
9). The GSGDA was presented and discussed at the Consultative Group meeting with
Development Partners in September 2010, even though instructions for the preparation of the
Budget 2010 already included some of its main features. Next steps will include a presentation at
Parliament in 2011, per constitutional requirements. While the GSGDA and its predecessor the
GPRSII share many objectives (including MDGs and access to Middle Income Status) and means
to achieve them (e.g. education and skill development, access to health, malaria control and
HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, social protection, access to water and sanitation, housing
and slum upgrading and population management, integration of traditional authorities in formal
institutional structures), they also differ in several respects, reflecting political differences and
changing realities. While the GPRS II emphasized the centrality of private-led growth to reduce
poverty, the GSGDA stresses the need for the Government to focus on agriculture, fisheries,
SMEs, sanitation and the Savannah region for poverty reduction. The GSGDA also acknowledges
the centrality of macroeconomic stabilization ("seeking to address the macroeconomic challenges

                                                                - 19 -
that had emerged at the end of 2008")34 to generate the fiscal space for investing in policies,
programs and projects related to the enhancement of Ghanas private sector competitiveness,
accelerated agricultural development and natural resource management, improved infrastructure
development, human resource development and job creation, and the consolidation of a
transparent, accountable and efficient Government. New compared with the GPRSII is also the
consideration in the GSGDA of challenges and opportunities related to the exploitation of oil and
gas reserves starting in 2011 as far as growth, job creation, the environment and the non-oil sector
are concerned. A Joint Bank-Fund Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) on this new Poverty Reduction
Strategy will be shared with the World Bank Board of Executive Directors in FY11, once the
GSGDA monitoring and evaluation framework, as well as its costing have been completed.

43.     The GSGDA and the new Aid Policy Paper for the period 2011-1535 reiterate the
need for continued official development assistance ­ and budget support in particular.
Indeed, financing needs to meet Ghanas development aspirations cannot be entirely funded from
domestic resources combined with prudent external non concessional borrowing, even though the
limit for the later was recently raised in agreement with the IMF, see Section 2B. And while
forthcoming oil revenue could eventually prompt DPs to reduce their ODA to Ghana, it is the
Governments view that continued support would be needed in the first years of oil production to
limit the potential of the "oil curse" developing in Ghana, as well as providing additionality to oil
revenues. Indeed, risks of political capture, macroeconomic instability, lost external
competitiveness and increased regional inequalities stemming from oil are significant 36, and call
for particular attention to public sector reform (single spine pay reform, decentralization, capacity
building, transparency and external accountability), the enforcement of multi-year
macroeconomic frameworks (public financial management, debt management strategy, medium
term expenditure frameworks, tax collection), macro-economic stabilization (utilities financial
recovery, oil stabilization funds, arrears liquidation, financial sector regulation), the investment
climate (urban development, land regulation, informal labor markets), and rural development
(commercial agriculture, connective infrastructure and social protection in the north, climate
change adaptation and mitigation). Against this background, continued ODA could be particularly
instrumental to secure stable funding, encourage the development of macroeconomic stabilization
mechanisms, continued progress in public financial management, transparency, executive
accountability, capacity building, investment effectiveness, and overall reform implementation. In
this context, general budget support would continue to be the preferred aid modality, within the
aligned and harmonized MDBS framework.

        3. WORLD BANK GROUP'S SUPPORT TO THE GROWTH AND POVERTY
                           REDUCTION STRATEGY

                   A.      LINKS TO THE COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY (CAS)

44.     The updated FY8-12 CAS progress report underlines the need and opportunity for
adjustments in the strategy to flexibly address challenges unforeseen three years ago. While
the overall objectives of reducing poverty and inequality set out under the CAS remain relevant,
the difficult macroeconomic situation, the discovery of oil and gas and the arrival of a new
administration warrant adjustments to the strategy, as reflected in the CAS progress report
presented to the Board in Q3 FY10. Such adjustments are made possible by the larger than
foreseen annual allocation of IDA15 resources for Ghana, which has risen to US$450 million.
Major adjustments include:

         Front loaded Development Policy Operations, to respond to macro-economic stabilization
         needs (EGPRC and PRSC7 at US$300 and US$21537 million respectively), after which
         annual contributions will come back to US$100 million, from PRSC8 in FY12;

         Technical Assistance, IDA and IBRD funding to support the emerging oil and gas sector.
         The next Natural Resource and Environmental Governance (NREG) DPO series will
         incorporate oil and gas. An IDA credit that seeks to develop capacity to manage and
         oversee the new oil and gas industry, strengthen oversight institutions such as the EPA and
         Ministry of Energy and train Ghanaians for employment opportunities in the sector is
         planned for FY11 and an IBRD enclave loan to finance gas infrastructure is foreseen for
         FY12;

         Scaling up investment lending and new or re-designing operations in the following
         domains, to reflect Ghanas new priorities: electricity (expanded capacity and regional
         trade in power), public sector reform (decentralization), public financial management
         (including integrated information systems), social protection (LEAP, public works)
         commercial agriculture, urban water and sanitation, and statistical development for results
         based policy formulation.38

         Extension of the current CAS to FY12 (that is, until June 2012), in order to ensure smooth
         transition from IDA15 to IDA16 and deliver the large portfolio now under preparation
         during the remaining period of the current administration.39

45.     The proposed PRSC7 is a central instrument of the adjusted CAS, given its size and
focus. The CAS progress report acknowledges the need for front-loaded assistance. Against
demonstrated progress on critical actions and a credible adjustment and reform plan, the proposed
front-loaded assistance would help maintain the development momentum by making the needed
fiscal adjustment less abrupt and more credible, before the arrival of oil in 2011. The PRSC7 also
encourages policy reform in the domains above mentioned: public financial management and
transparency, energy (electricity, oil and gas), public sector reform, and social protection.



37
   The amount of US$215 million for PRSC7 includes US$10 million re-committed from the MSME project and
US$5 million re-committed from the HIV project.
38
   In this respect, the Government of Ghana is preparing for the adoption of performance-based budgeting in 2013.
39
   New presidential and legislative elections are scheduled to be held by end 2012.

      B.      RESULTS ACHIEVED UNDER PREVIOUS DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATIONS

46.     PRSC1-6 (2003-2008) accompanied significant achievements in terms of governance,
growth, public service delivery and poverty reduction. While the issue of attribution of
specific outcome to these operations is complicated, the implementation of the latter nevertheless
coincides with a period of rapid developmental progress. The Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA) ranked Ghana 5th among all low-income countries (75), second in Sub-
Saharan Africa and above several middle-income countries in 2007. Between 2001 and 2007, this
index went from 3.4 to 4.0. Poverty reduction was also very rapid during the same period. Annual
GDP growth was 1.6 percentage point (5.7 against 4.1, using national accounts before revision),
higher on average over the PRSC period than during the previous six years (1996-2001). The
proportion of people living with less than PPPUS$1.25 a day declined from 39 percent in 1999 to
29 percent in 2006, and to likely less afterwards given the rapid growth in per capita consumption
recorded over the period 2006-8.

47.     Growth was supported by macro-economic stability and an improved investment
climate. Restored macroeconomic stability and the successful completion of HIPC and MDRI
processes brought down inflation and yielded increased availability of credit to the private sector,
with the share of private sector in total domestic credit reaching 83 percent in 2009, up from
around 47 percent in 2002. There was also a decline in the time required for business registration,
falling to 33 days in 2009, down from 129 days reported in 2002. This positive business climate
has translated, in turn, into the strong performance of exports and in the countrys ability to draw
on foreign savings, by tapping the international capital market (through the issuance of Eurobonds
in 2007), attracting foreign direct investors, and continuing to receive large remittance inflows
from Ghanaians living abroad.

48.     Overall, PRSCs 1-3 were internally rated satisfactory, while PRSCs 4-6 were rated
moderately satisfactory.40 The progressive drop in rating resulted mostly from widening budget
deviations and growing fiscal deficits, declining external accountability, and mounting structural
problems in energy and public sector. Besides, increasing coordination costs of operating the
Multi Donor Budget Support Group within which PRSCs were successively developed made the
structure slow in responding to unfolding developments and emerging strategic priorities, at a
time where electoral considerations and greater access to financial markets were also weakening
mutual accountability mechanisms.

49.     The sudden deterioration of the macro-economic performance in 2008 prompted the
Bank to support Government's focused efforts to bring their fiscal stance on a sound and
sustainable track through the stand-alone EGPRC in 2009. Efforts supported by the EGPRC
concentrated on measures to improve public financial management, raise fiscal transparency,
restore financial viability in the electricity sector, prepare for oil through the adoption of
regulatory and fiscal frameworks, regain control on public sector labor force and rationalize
Subvented Agencies, and expand and improve social protection. As such, it contributed to the
significant stabilization gains recorded in 2009, paving the way for further achievements in 2010
and beyond (see Section 2A).

        C.       COMPLEMENTARITY WITH OTHER DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS' PROGRAMS

50.      The proposed operation is fully aligned to the Multi-Donor Budget Support (MDBS)
process. The World Bank was a founding member of the MDBS initiative and has been the
permanent co-chair of the group, providing US$100 million of annual support through a series of
poverty reduction credits (PRSCs) between 2003 and 2008. The MDBS process is a central
instrument of aid harmonization in Ghana. It includes the identification with the Government of a
selective joint matrix of policy actions to be supported by Development Partners (DPs), aligning
their monitoring and evaluation frameworks through a common rolling 3-year Progress
Assessment Framework (PAF). In April 2009, Ghanas changing reality prompted the Bank to
respond to Governments request for extraordinary assistance through the EGPRC rather than
through the MDBS PAF, given the need to support efforts not anticipated when the PAF was
designed in April 2008. Efforts were subsequently conducted among DPs and the Government to
fully align the proposed operation with the MDBS. This included the re-opening of the PAF in the
Fall 2009 to include prior actions aimed at prolonging efforts undertaken by the Government with
the support of the EGPRC. It also included a retreat in October 2009 with DPs and the
Government to identify ways to improve the MDBS process on a structural basis.41 It finally
included a joint review of performance on prior actions in May 2010 and the identification of
triggers in the proposed Development Policy Operation.
51.      The PRSC7 is being prepared in close coordination with the IMF. The IMF and World
Bank teams collaborated closely since the design and launch of the PRGF (now ECF) and
EGPRC in early 2009, now followed by the proposed operation. Following the agreed
institutional division of labor between the Bank and the IMF (as reflected in the Ghana-Joint
World Bank-IMF Work Program agreed upon in April 2009), there is a common understanding of
the macro and debt sustainability situation and the World Bank is taking the lead in the areas of
energy, public sector reform and safety nets. The IMF and World Bank teams are also closely
collaborating on issues of public financial management with a clear division of labor on the policy
actions identified. The new Ghana-Joint World Bank-IMF Work Program agreed upon in
September 2010 confirmed this division of labor, which is for instance reflected in the
complementarity between prior actions and triggers in the proposed operation with performance
criteria and structural benchmarks in the ECF.42




41
   For the first time since 2006, a Multi Donor Budget Support (MDBS) retreat was organized to reflect on the
effectiveness of the process. The MDBS retreat involved a series of meetings: meetings with sector working groups, a
2-day workshop between Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, National Development Planning Commission
and MDBS Development Partners (the retreat proper), and a high-level forum to present and validate retreat
conclusions to policy makers, the press and CSOs. Recommendations included among others (i) the need to introduce
greater flexibility in the PAF to allow for the inclusion of triggers addressing unforeseen shocks to preserve PAF
longer term objectives, (ii) the need to revamp sector working groups through greater participation of Ministries'
Chief Directors, and (iii) the need for more frequent high level dialogue over the year (parallel to the establishment of
an early warning system to monitor progress on the PAF), beyond the formal Consultative Group meeting.
42
   Besides quantitative performance criteria related to the phased reduction of the fiscal deficit and the stock of
domestic arrears, the ECF include structural benchmarks related to (i) the migration of non security SA payroll to the
IPPD-2, (ii) the submission to cabinet of a list of SA to be commercialized or liquidated, (iii) the submission to
Parliament of the oil revenue management bill, and (iv) the development of a strategy for restoring TOR financial and
commercial viability, which all complement and strengthen efforts supported by PRSC7 and PRSC8.

                                                      - 23 -
                    D.       COMPLEMENTARITY WITH OTHER BANK ACTIVITIES

52.      The proposed Development Policy Operation is part of a program of support to
Ghana that focuses on public financial management, energy, safety nets, agriculture, water
and natural resource management. Following the board approval in FY10 of investment
lending projects for public financial management (US$28 million, as part of the eGhana project,
US$45 million), oil and gas capacity building (US$35 million), electricity distribution (US$70
million), and social protection (US$89 million), and sectoral Development Policy Operations for
agriculture (US$25 million) and Natural Resource and Environmental Governance (US$10
million), the updated CAS FY08-12 foresees in FY11 the submission to the Board of a public
sector reform investment lending (US$100 million) project in support of Ghanas decentralization
initiatives, an IBRD enclave to support the development of the gas infrastructure, as well as a new
sectoral Development Policy Operation for Agriculture (US$50 million). The PRSC7 supports the
agenda of sector development policy operations by focusing on ensuring an adequate fiscal stance
and the strengthening of cross-cutting public financial management issues. It complements the
public financial management and transparency43, oil and gas, electricity, social protection and
public sector reform44 investment operations and technical assistance by encouraging the
preparation and implementation of key policy actions in the domains above mentioned, as
detailed in the Section 4 below.
                                        E.       LESSONS LEARNED

53.     The criticality of Ghana's ownership through the empowerment of Sector Working
Groups is a lesson to retain when designing general development policy operations, as well
as the need to focus on cross-cutting issues. Discussions held between the Government and DPs
in October 2009 underlined (i) the critical role of Sector Working Groups in the identification of
policy reforms and regular monitoring of their implementation and (ii) the need for the
Government to be represented at the policy making level in these Sector Working Groups for
effective ownership. Discussions also underlined the need for the MDBS and general
Development Policy Operations to concentrate their attention and efforts to cross-cutting issues
and complementarity across sector policies, leaving sector-specific policy dialogue to Sector
Working Groups and sectoral Development Policy Operations. These recommendations were
reflected in (i) the choice of prior actions in the proposed operation, mostly focused on policy
domains directly affecting overall budget execution, (ii) the content of discussions held at the
MDBS annual review in May 2010, which focused on cross-cutting issues and the review of
underlying principles for budget support, and (iii) the reliance on SWG to assess progress and
propose policy reforms in their respective sectors.

54.      Harmonization of aid requires balancing with flexibility the aid architecture during
times of crisis. The current difficult macroeconomic situation underlines the tension between
instruments designed to ensure predictability of funds to support medium term growth and
poverty reduction strategies, and the need to respond swiftly and flexibly to emerging policy
priorities. The operation is designed to address this tension by: (i) ensuring the availability of
funds needed to support medium term objectives through frontloading resources initially planned
to be mobilized in outer years, and (ii) supporting actions considered as priorities to address

43
   On transparency, the work supported under the Governance Partnership Facility, which approved a Ghana proposal
in January 2010, will also deepen the mainstreaming of the transparency and accountability agenda.
44
   On public sector reform, the ongoing Economic Management and Capacity Building Project (EMCBP) will also
support the rationalisation of Subvented Agencies.

                                                   - 24 -
crisis-induced imbalances through the alteration of the PAF 2009-11 initially adopted in April
2009 and focusing on a selected number of key prior actions.

55.     Flexibility should be given in the design of the green field oil and gas institutional
framework. Against initial expectations, the release of the EGPRC second tranche was delayed
due to Governments decision to revise its initial plans regarding the establishment of a
comprehensive oil and gas institutional framework. Indeed, public consultations held on the
legislation raised fundamental issues of ownership, participation and control, roles,
responsibilities and accountability, legitimacy and capacity of institutions that underpin effective
performance of such a green field sector in the Ghanaian economy, and it became apparent that a
more comprehensive multiple legal framework would be needed. The better understanding of the
emerging oil and gas political economy eventually justified waiving a release condition in the
EGPRC, and the lesson to be learned from it is that, moving forward, some flexibility should be
given to Government in the means it chooses to achieve the objective of establishing a sound,
solid and transparent oil and gas institutional framework.

56.     Another lesson to be learned from the EGPRC and other DPO is the need to address
implementation risks which are high when intergovernmental coordination is required.
Increasingly, the nature of reforms Ghana is embarking on requires coordination across various
parts of the Government (e.g. oil and gas, public sector reform, social protection). MDBS
Development Partners have come to the view that, while MOFEP should keep its coordinating
and counterpart role, the MDBS Progress Assessment Framework (from which PRSC7 prior
action and PRSC8 proposed triggers are extracted) should be formally endorsed by the Cabinet of
Ministers to encourage better intergovernmental coordination.

                              F.     ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

57.    The design of the proposed operation draws on a series of economic and social
analyses. It draws in particular on:

       The World Bank Country Economic Memorandum completed in 2007, and the Africa
       Infrastructure Country Diagnosis completed in 2010 which both underline the importance
       of closing infrastructure gaps (in electricity notably) for growth and poverty reduction
       through reduced inefficiencies (utilities pricing in particular);

       External Reviews of Public Financial Management (ERPFM) of 2007 and 2010, the
       Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) report of 2010, and the IMF
       FAD report on the PFM framework of 2010, which identify key reform areas (integrated
       financial information systems, cash management, commitment controls, and payroll
       management notably) to sustain progress in this domain;

       The World Bank Poverty Report (2010), the World Bank review of Targeting Mechanisms
       in Social Programs (2010), and the World Bank Poverty and Social Impact Analysis
       (2010) on electricity tariff increases which offer recommendations to improve the social
       protection architecture while removing inefficient subsidies;

       Several World Bank Global Expert Teams missions reports in 2009 and 2010 on public
       sector reform which lay out options to improve over the medium term service delivery at a
       sustainable cost through civil service reform and decentralization;



                                             - 25 -
       The World Bank report on the economy-wide impact of oil discovery prepared in 2009
       which emphasizes the attention to be given to fiscal stabilization, transparency and
       external accountability for a developmental use of oil revenue;

       The MDBS annual review of the Performance Assessment Framework 2009-11 of 2010,
       which discusses challenges and progress in upholding underlying principles for continued
       budget support (see Annex 6) and in meeting targets at the sectoral level;

       Implementation, Completion and Results Reports of PRSC1-3 (2007) and PRSC4-6
       (2010), which identify challenges associated with the conduction of Development Policy
       Operations in Ghana;

       And IMF and World Bank continued economic monitoring and analysis (Article IV
       reports, ECF reviews, DSA, Non Concessional Borrowing Policy papers, FSAP) which
       assess the sustainability of the fiscal stance and the broader macro-economic framework.

58.      The Government also conducted a series of analyses to inform its policy decisions in
2010. It included notably: (i) a report examining options to settle electricity utilities debts while
ensuring cost recovery, which was an input to the electricity financial recovery plan; (ii) a report
outlining the main technical issues for an assessment of the coverage, targeting efficiency, cost
effectiveness, impact and fiscal affordability of Ghanas social programs and subsidy schemes;
(iii) a report on the classification and monitoring of pro-poor public expenditures; (iv) a report
classifying Subvented Agencies in preparation for their rationalization, divestiture or
commercialization, and (v) an ongoing public expenditure review focused on the evolution of the
wage bill, the distribution of MDAs and Statutory Funds actual expenditures at the district level,
and the effectiveness and efficiency of pro-poor expenditures. Also, the Government, through the
Economic Advisory Council appointed in 2009, initiated several consultations on economic and
social policy issues, involving think tanks and DPs. The World Bank provided technical
assistance to most of these activities.

      4. THE PROPOSED SEVENTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT

                              A.      RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES

59.    The proposed Seventh Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC7) aims to support
the authorities' four-pronged efforts to restore budgetary discipline and tackle long-
standing public sector and energy issues, while protecting the poor and preparing for the oil
era. Governments efforts supported by the PRSC7 concentrate on measures to:

       Establish basic processes for (i) effective cash management of the Government
       Consolidated Fund and (ii) compiling claims & outstanding payments, and prepare the
       chart of accounts for budgeting, accounting and reporting for all MDAs;

       Begin implementing recommendations of the electricity financial recovery plan, and
       complete a definitive roll-out of Subvented Agencies in preparation for their continued
       subvention, rationalization, divestiture or commercialization;

       Reach an agreement between relevant Ministries (Ministries of Employment & Social
       Welfare, Education, Health and Local Government & Rural Development) on institutional



                                             - 26 -
       responsibilities, budget, detailed objectives, action plan & timeline for the adoption & use
       of a common targeting mechanism for the LEAP, NHIS & School Uniform programs;

       Submit to Cabinet for decision (i) the oil and gas revenue management bill after
       consultations with stakeholders, and (ii) the revised EITI institutional framework to
       include the oil and gas sectors.

60.      There is a strong macro-economic rationale for providing swift external financing
against demonstrated progress on key actions and reforms and a credible adjustment plan.
Ghanas medium term development prospects remain bright, building on past records, strong
institutions and the promises of oil and democratic dividends. But a pre-requisite is
macroeconomic stability and sound budget execution. Against demonstrated progress on critical
actions and a credible adjustment and reform plan, the proposed front-loaded assistance would
help foster the liquidation of public arrears, address related banks vulnerabilities, and crowd in
domestic private investors.
                   B.      DESIGN AND FOCUS OF THE PROPOSED OPERATION

61.     Policy actions supported by the proposed operation are part of a larger Government
program to stabilize the macroeconomic situation through structural reforms, create jobs
and reduce poverty, while preparing for the oil era. The Government program is described in
the following paragraphs and reflected in the Letter of Development Policy (Annex 2), and the
MDBS rolling three-year PAF (Annexes 4 and 5). Table 5 details the PRSC7 prior actions and
status (by July 2010, all prior actions had been fully met), while Table 6 lists proposed triggers for
the PRSC8. The rationale for their selection is discussed below, namely their importance to the
program and expressed Government commitment and feasibility. All prior actions for PRSC7 and
proposed triggers for PRSC8 are fully aligned with the MDBS PAF.

Restoring Budgetary Discipline
62.     The Government is committed to restore budgetary discipline by improving public
financial management and promoting social accountability and transparency. Restoring
budgetary discipline by re-establishing control over expenditures, generating more revenue and
efficiency gains, better budget planning, and providing an enabling environment for transparency
and accountability are key priorities for the Government in the present context, as emphasized in
the 2009, 2010 and 2011 Budget Laws. In so doing, the Government will be also paving the way
for a more transparent and developmental use of oil and gas revenue.

63.     Public Financial Management. Progress was made in PFM reforms in the recent
years. As reported in the ERPFM and PEFA reports of 2010, Ghana continues to gear itself to
building a strong foundation towards achieving aggregate fiscal discipline, based on positive
developments in the following areas: (a) prevalent low levels of unreported extra-budgetary
expenditures; (b) good and timely public access to key fiscal information; (c) adherence to a fixed
and coherent budget calendar; (d) high average debt collection ratios for tax arrears and regular
and timely revenue transfers to the Consolidated Fund; (e) comprehensive recording and
reconciliation of debt service and on the debt portfolio; (f) predictable budget support
disbursements; (g) timely in-year budget implementation reports and annual financial reports on
the Consolidated Fund; and (h) improved effectiveness and timely external audit scrutiny. Other
salient improvements registered include broadened budget coverage and widened information on
internally generated funds and external grants, including HIPC and MDRI grants, and submission


                                              - 27 -
by the Auditor General, of external audit reports to Parliament within 3 months of receipt of the
draft accounts from the Controller & Accountant Generals Department (CAGD), leading to more
proactive and transparent oversight of public finances by the Parliamentary Public Accounts
Committee. There was also progress in implementing the public procurement law, with increased
coverage provided by the entity tender committees and the tender review boards and, under the
auspices of the new internal audit agency law, the number of government ministries, departments
and agencies that submitted internal audit reports rose.
64.     But the scale of improvement in budget execution and control was not commensurate
with the amount invested in improving processes and systems. Slippages in expenditures
accumulated in 2008 revealed important weaknesses in expenditure control that need to be swiftly
corrected but for which corrective action has commenced since 2009 through some improvements
in commitment control. The fiduciary control environment, according to the latest assessments,
nevertheless continues to suffer from failures to (a) comprehensively apply the guiding principles
of a well structured consolidated cash management system, in a Treasury Single Account mode,
for all public expenditures supported under the budget, (b) fully implement commitment
accounting and controls and hence document, report on, and minimize the potentials for,
expenditure arrears, (c) provide a consolidated fiscal picture in respect of revenues and
expenditures against the five separate and distinct funds of the Government; (d) manage the
inherent weaknesses in the management and control of payroll; (e) achieve meaningful results in
the policy towards rationalizing the proliferation of bank deposits held by MDAs outside the
control of the Ministry of Finance & Economic Planning, and the Bank of Ghana; and (f) adopt
and implement a Government Finance Statistics (GFS) functional chart of classification for
budgeting, accounting and fiscal reporting, that is uniform across all government formations.
Finally, progress in building internal audit capacity in MDAs has been mixed, with challenges
remaining in terms of focus on systemic issues rather than transactional.
65.     Weaknesses in fiscal revenue policy and administration remain, even though the
Government has started to address them. The Governments drive to implement the strategic
plan aimed at strengthening revenue collection and transparency in revenue administration will,
when judiciously pursued, enhance the efficiency, comprehensiveness, and transparency of
revenue administration in the near term. The challenge does remain, however, to implement an
effective and efficient tax administration under existing and explicit government policies as
measured by the frequency of complete accounts reconciliation between tax assessments,
collections, arrears records and receipts by the Treasury. The integration of the revenue agencies
under an umbrella entity ­ the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) ­ coupled with the Government
strategy to strengthen the LTU and bifurcate the allocation of taxpayers amongst large, medium,
and small tax offices, is one key step within the policy framework aimed at improving revenue
administration. In this respect, the Government intends to (a) adopt the GRA institutional and
organizational structure evaluation report and (b) develop and adopt selection criteria for
segmentation and allocation of taxpayers to large, medium and small taxpayers offices. Other
steps include the setting up of the Transit Monitoring Unit by the Custom Excise and Preventive
Service (CEPS) to prevent the diversion of transit goods back into the country; the improved
revenue administration within IRS including the introduction of computerized systems and
expanding the special tax audit of companies to cover some medium and small scale businesses in
the informal sector; and the continuing registration of retailers and intensified public education on
the VAT Flat Rate Scheme in VATS.
66.    To improve its capacity for budget monitoring and control, the Government has
taken concrete steps to develop the Ghana Integrated Financial Management Information


                                             - 28 -
System (GIFMIS) over the period 2010-14. To this end, the Government had, in 2009,
approved a PFM Improvement Charter ­ called the GIFMIS Charter ­ that calls for the
reinvigoration of a country-wide budget management system that is premised on (a) the need to
capture all public finances at the center and across all local governments; (b) a single, unified
chart of accounts and budget classification (for budgeting, accounting, and reporting) that is
compliant with IMF GFSM2001, see below; (c) developing and implementing re-engineered
business processes that are best practice; (d) integration of applications, including personnel
management and payroll database, on a single IT-based platform; (e) accommodating the
applicable principles and practices of robust commitment accounting; and (f) the need to
consolidate the reporting of all government finances. The Government intends to achieve these
set of goals and thus create the environment most conducive to improved accountability and
transparency, and also set the base for use of country PFM systems for all donor-funded
operations. This program of reform is supported by development partners (IDA, DFID, EU, and
Denmark) in the overall sum of US$60.3 million. It is conceived that this GIFMIS project will
become the platform and key thrust for more holistic PFM reforms across government.
67.     The Treasury Single Account (TSA) has been established at the Bank of Ghana. The
goals of the reform are to enhance control by ensuring that all MDAs cash balances are known at
all times, as well as to save on short term financial charges by managing liquidity better. By doing
so, budget deviations are expected to be reduced, through improved in-time monitoring of the
Governments cash balance. This will allow for improved predictability of resource flows to
service delivery agencies and support better commitment management and control. The effective
linkage of MDAs bank accounts to the TSA and the facilitation training of public servants has
commenced in 2010. There is already a letter of agreement signed between the Governor of the
Bank of Ghana and the Minister of Finance on the strategy to be adopted and the implementation
plan to enable total coverage of all public finances under a TSA framework by 2011, although
implementation progress is slow and behind schedule.
68.     The Government has, through MOFEP, established a basic process of an efficient
cash management system for the Government of Ghana consolidated fund (PRSC7 prior
action), a process so far missing. Upon eventual transitioning to the GIFMIS in 2011, the full
implementation of the monthly cash management system - all anchored on Treasury Single
Account mechanism - will (a) enhance the predictability of expenditure commitments across
MDAs; (b) assist to more reliably account for, and reduce the potential for building up a, stock of
expenditure arrears; (c) reduce Government financial charges and short term borrowing costs
(Government overdraft at BOG notably, see the results framework in Annex 3) through improved
cash management practices; and (d) instill enhanced fiscal discipline through maintenance of hard
budget constraints within approved appropriations. Moving forward, the Government intends to
ensure that the stabilized cash management system provides weekly cash statements aligned with
the TSA account.
69.     The Government has, through MOFEP, prepared a harmonized chart of accounts
for budgeting, accounting and reporting for all its ministries, departments and agencies
(PRSC7 prior action). The adoption of the single, harmonized chart of accounts for budgeting,
accounting and reporting will (i) ensure that the reporting of the budget implementation is
consistent with the budget itself; (ii) ensure the comprehensiveness of reporting on the
Government fiscal position; (iii) allow for aggregation and disaggregation of expenditures in the
budget across the whole of government; and (iv) adopt the functional and economic
classifications needed for proper expenditure review. As such, it represents a critical building
block to the development of GIFMIS, as well as an indispensible input for information-based


                                             - 29 -
policy making, and the Government intends to start producing and publishing Budget and
monthly statements of the public accounts based on the harmonized Chart of Account. The
adoption of the harmonized charts of account is also important to prepare for the introduction of
programme-based budgeting planned for piloting in 2011. A Concept note on transition to
programme-based budgeting for submission to Cabinet based on costed implementation plan will
be prepared in this regard by MOFEP in coordination with relevant MDAs.
70.     The Government has, through MOFEP, established a basic process of compiling
claims and outstanding payment system (PRSC7 prior action), a process so far missing. By
doing so, MOFEP is now able to check the consistency of MDAs commitments with their cash
plans, and thus contain the potential for arrears accumulation. Towards this objective, the
Government is also implementing a ,,contract database to allow for a ready flow of information
relating to expenditure commitment and arising obligations in order to reduce the potentials for
accumulation of arrears. Last but not least, the Government, through the Ministry of Finance &
Economic Planning, and the Controller & Accountant Generals Department, will reinstate and
enforce commitment controls for all MDAs, such that, no new arrears over their budget accrue
through uncontrolled spending on Item 3 and 4 (PRSC8 proposed trigger). Such commitment
controls had been relaxed in the wake of the energy and flood crises of 2007 to accelerate MDAs
(energy, and roads and highways in particular) investment response to urgent needs. Combined
with improved cash management and the conversion of existing arrears into formal debt
instruments, the monitoring and enforcement of controls on commitments is expected to reduce
the stock of public arrears (excluding wage arrears) over time, see the results framework in Annex
3.
71.     The Government also intends to address the consequences of public arrears on the
financial sector and institute an improved regulatory and supervision regime in view of the
structural changes the sector has undergone in the recent years. Acknowledging their
negative impact on banks vulnerabilities, the Government, through the Ministry of Finance &
Economic Planning, will develop and submit to Cabinet for decision the second Financial Sector
Strategic Plan, FINSEP II (PRSC8 proposed trigger). Building on the lessons learned in
implementing the first Financial Sector Strategic Plan since 2003, as well as the conclusions of
the recent Financial Sector Assessment Program, the second plan will define actions required in
structuring the sector to accompany and strengthen Ghanas ongoing macroeconomic and
financial stabilization efforts. Along with measures envisage to reduce arrears stock and flows,
the implementation of the FINSEP II is expected to reduce the proportion of NPL (through
improved risk management) as well as to maintain satisfactory capital adequacy ratios in the
banking sector, see the results framework in Annex 3.
72.     Efforts are ongoing to strengthen public investment project selection and appraisal.
By November 2010, the Government was planning to adopt the Public Private Partnership (PPP)
policy in December 2010 before converting it into Bill for submission to Parliament. The policy
will define guidelines, procedure and institutional responsibilities for the appraisal and selection
of public investment projects, be it financed directly through the budget, through concessional or
non concessional borrowing, or through PPP arrangements. The Cabinet adoption in 2010 of
procedures for appraisal and selection of public investment projects was also retained as a
structural benchmark under the IMF ECF arrangement.
73.    Transparency and Accountability. The new Government elected in 2009 entered office
with an emphasis on the need for "complete transparency," and has reiterated time and time again
its commitment to this principle, particularly since Ghana will become an oil and gas producing


                                             - 30 -
country under its watch. Until recently, the lack of transparency and the associated weaknesses in
accountability provided an enabling environment for the deterioration of fiscal management and
the overshooting of the budget deficit in 2008 had gone largely unnoticed till late in the year (and
even later, as the extent of expenditure arrears and outstanding commitments accumulated in 2008
was assessed only by mid-2009). Indeed, poor access to information critical for decision making
is a key factor in preventing formal accountability mechanisms, such as Parliament, as well as the
general public from flagging large deviations and sounding the alarm bell. Over the past year or
so, the Ministry of Finance & Economic Planning has addressed the need to provide quality
information on a timely basis by publishing, on a regular basis and in a user-friendly manner
(through the MOFEP website), quarterly fiscal outturn reports.
74.      The Government submitted the Freedom of Information Bill to Parliament in
January 2010. This Bill, which has been long awaited in Ghana, could become the basis for an
evolving environment based on transparency and accountability in Ghana. The World Bank
provided technical assistance to the Government and CSOs during the drafting process, by
facilitating best practices from peer groups in other countries and supporting a broad coalition
which provided feedback on draft bills and is now working with Parliamentarians to further
improve the Bill, prior to its approval. The implementation of the Freedom of Information Act
will require careful support of both the infrastructure of, for example, the archiving function of
the public services, as well as the capacity of individual MDAs to provide and respond to requests
for information on a regular basis. The World Banks Governance Partnership Facility will
continue to provide support in this area and larger investments could be supported through the
forthcoming operations in decentralization and the public sector.
75.     As the country gets ready to produce oil, in 2010 the Government followed through
on its commitment to extend the principles of EITI45 to the oil and gas sectors, as well as
incorporate relevant inputs from stakeholders' into the Petroleum Revenue Management
Bill. The Ministry of Finance carried out a national road show to disseminate its plans in revenue
management of this new sector and to hear opinions from citizens up and down the country. In
addition, a broad based civil society coalition carried out a parallel consultation process which
culminated in a Citizen Summit on Oil and Gas and which was funded, in part, by the World
Bank through the Governance Partnership Facility. The Citizen Summit comprised a detailed
presentation of the Revenue Management Bill by the Deputy Minister of Finance and, at its
closure, provided detailed feedback to the Ministry. The bulk of this feedback was incorporated
by the Ministry, prior to submitting it to Parliament and an independent review of the bill46
commended the Government for the strong transparency provisions in the bill as well as for the
consultative process which led to strengthening such provisions. Detailed discussion on what
these policy decisions entail for oil revenue management is provided in the sub-section on
preparing for the oil era below.

76.     The Extension of EITI principles to the Oil and Gas sector also provides an example
of the Government's follow through on its commitment to transparency and accountability
in this new extractive sector. After a number of consultations with stakeholders, including the
Ghana Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (GHEITI) Steering Committee,
Parliamentarians, the Ministry of Finance & Economic Planning and the Ministry of Energy, an
amplified proposal of the GHEITI structure in country was submitted to and approved by Cabinet.
45
   Based on the undergone validation activities (for the mining sector) and the report submitted by the Government,
the EITI board declared EITI compliant on October 19, 2010.
46
   See Comments on Ghanas Petroleum Revenue Management Bill, Revenue Watch Institute, August 2010, New
York.

                                                    - 31 -
This process was supported by GTZ and the World Bank with resources from the GHEITI
Steering Committee, and resulted in the inclusion of new members from the Ministry of Energy,
GNPC, oil companies, CSO and districts assemblies representatives from the oil finds areas.

77.      In the area of executive accountability mechanisms, the Government is initiating far-
reaching reforms. The reinvigoration in 2010 of the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee
in its capacity to publically discuss, review and follow up on Auditor Generals reports is a
critical step to support the entrenchment of accountability and transparency within the public
financial management realm. A first step in ensuring follow up to regular audits recommendation
has been taken by prosecuting two cases arising from the Public Accounts Committee. Cabinet
Ministers have also all declared their assets to the Auditor General and the Government is moving
to set up internal audit departments in all MDAs and MMDAs by 2010. 47 Moving forward, the
Government also acknowledges in the GSGDA the need to enhance Civil Society Participation in
Governance, through the review of legal and institutional framework for the management and
operations of CSOs.

Tackling Long-Standing Public Sector and Energy Issues
78.     The main structural weaknesses in the budget, namely public sector and energy,
have been areas where reforms have been largely unsuccessful in the past. The very fast
increase in the payroll bill is the result of a steady increase in services offered to the population,
coupled with a large rise of public sector wages. The very large subsidies paid to the energy
sector during the past three years are the result of a combination of large investments in the
sector, the sharp rise of oil prices in 2007-08, delayed delivery of gas from Nigeria, commercial
losses by the utility companies and inadequate cost recovery due to infrequent tariff adjustments
at a time of high inflation and currency depreciation. In both cases, reforms have become crucial
to restore macroeconomic balances and improve value for money and efficiency. Sustainable
reforms in both sectors require deliberate action over a period of several years, based on solid
analysis and broad consultation with stakeholders.

79.     Public Sector Reform. The Government, through its Public Sector Reform Secretariat
(PSRS) located in the Office of the President, is adopting a new results based approach to public
sector reform in Ghana and has set up a team at the Presidency to provide technical assistance and
accountability with line ministries. A draft of the strategy has been reviewed at a Cabinet retreat
in May 2010. Further consultations on the draft have been held with chief directors of all
ministries to solicit inputs.

80.     Pay policy development and management remains weak in Government. The
management and implementation of public sector pay policy in Ghana has resulted in significant
inequities and an unsustainable wage bill. The main challenges are: lack of clarity in the division
of responsibilities between the multiplicity of policy and financial control agencies; limited
capacity for the Fair Wages and Salaries Commission (FWSC) to undertake its mandates; and
weaknesses in the macro-planning and budget system which fail to ensure that changes to the
remuneration regime are affordable and sustainable, whether incremental or through major pay
reforms.



47
  By end-2009, internal audit units had been established in 272 MDAs and MMDAs, out of a total of 342 (80
percent).

                                               - 32 -
81.     A new Single Spine Salary Structure (SSSS) was developed to address inequities in
the public sector. In 2008, a comprehensive report on the SSSS was developed and presented to
Government. Thereafter, the report went through a broad, tripartite consultative process. The
objective of the proposed Single Spine Salary Structure is to address disparities, distortions and
restore equity in the pay structure by placing all public sector employees on a vertical structure
and ensuring that jobs within the same job value range are paid within the same pay range. The
Government hopes that it will be able to manage its wage bill more efficiently and with more
certainty and minimize industrial relations tensions with the introduction of this new pay
structure.

82.      The Government has started implementation of the Single Spine Salary Structure. A
road map for the implementation of the SSSS was developed in a tripartite workshop in May
2009. Implementation of activities of the road map is on course. Cabinet approved the SSSS in
November 2009 and a White Paper was produced. It underlines the importance of ensuring that
the cost of the SSSS does not disrupt macroeconomic stability.48 Thus, the fiscal cost will be
phased out in a "pyramid manner, such that as the outer years of implementation are approached,
more resources will be made available to public workers until the pay policy is fully implemented
in the fifth year". Implementation of the SSSS has started in July 2010 through an incremental
approach.49 Personnel of the Ghana Police Service are the first batch of public sector employees
to be placed on the SSSS. The next batch of employees from the Ghana Immigration Service, the
Ghana Fire Service, Customs and Excise and Preventive Service, the Value Added Tax Service
and the Internal Revenue Service. In 2010, 70,000 public sector employees (out of a projected
total of 510,000) will have been migrated on to the SSSS in 2010.

83.     Oversight and management of Subvented Agencies (SAs) in Ghana remains a
challenge and there is a need for clarifying their mandates and ensuring better control over
their payroll. In 2008, the 132 Subvented Agencies were representing 19 percent of the overall
public sector labor force and 35 percent of the Government total wage bill (salaries and
allowances). SAs were also receiving 82 percent of total allowances paid to public sector
employees. The SAs are financed through block grants from the Ministry of Finance & Economic
Planning. This grant is meant to cover their salaries, allowances and expenditures. However, since
few SAs are integrated into the integrated payroll system, there is no way to control headcount or
expenditures, and this resulted in the past in the very rapid increase in SA wage bill, through
increases in allowances in particular. The Government initiated a process to integrate the payroll
of SAs into the integrated payroll system that is managed by the Controller & Accountant
Generals Department (IPPD-2).50 This will strengthen the control that the Controller &
Accountant General has over the payroll and reduce the uncertainty in the management of the
payroll.

84.   On the way to improve the performance of public assets and institutions, the
Government has, through its Office of the President (Public Sector Reform Secretariat)
completed a definitive roll of Subvented Agencies, and a categorization of said agencies as

48
   The capacity of the FWSC to manage the implementation of the SSPS is also a challenge. Government is however
beginning to resource the FWSC to perform its role.
49
   Although public sector employees will be progressively migrated to the SSPS progressively in the next years, it is
the understanding of the FWSC that the SSPS is effective for all public sector employees since January 1, 2010.
Hence, retroactive payments shall be honored for those transferred to the SPSS after this date.
50
   Out of the 196 SA, 117 had been migrated to the IPPD-2 by March 2010. However, the major ones in terms of
number of employees, such as Ghana Armed Forces, Ghana Police Service and tertiary institutions (universities,
polytechnics) were yet to be migrated to IPPD-2.

                                                     - 33 -
follows: (a) the Subvented Agencies that would stay on government subvention for the
foreseeable future; and (b) the Subvented Agencies that would be analyzed for a decision
regarding their closure, withdrawal from government subvention, partial
commercialization, or full commercialization (PRSC7 prior action). The review and
classification of Subvented Agencies according to their relevance with respect to the Government
Shared Growth Development Agenda will form the basis for the Government, through the
Ministry of Finance & Economic Planning and the Public Sector Reform Secretariat, to develop
and submit to Cabinet for decision and announcement the action plan on Subvented Agency
reform (i.e. decisions on those for closure, withdrawal of subvention, those on reduced subvention
and timelines for implementation) (PRSC8 proposed trigger). The Government completed 3 pilot
processes of voluntary redundancy in the Ghana Standards Board, the Ghana National
Procurement Agency and the Ghana International Trade Fair, and has begun the process for two
additional agencies (the Ghana Regional Appropriate Technology Industrial Service and
Management Development and Productivity Institute). The management of these pilots is
providing useful lessons to guide future voluntary severance packages. The progressive
implementation of the approved plan is expected to begin in 2011, with the objective to reduce the
overall number of Subvented Agencies, down from 132 in 2009, see the results framework in
Annex 3.

85.     The Government has reviewed its approach to decentralization, through an extensive
consultation process. Decentralization, in Ghana is a constitutional entrenched provision and is
defined as devolution of considerable responsibilities to local government for ensuring a fair
distribution of resources, as well as to enhance the quality of public service delivery. This is
believed to be a key policy instrument to reduce regional inequalities and poverty overall in
Ghana. The Government is committed to the decentralization agenda. It has concluded a nation-
wide consultation process under the direction of the Minister of Local Government & Rural
Development to collate views from stakeholders in all regional capitals. In addition, consultations
have been held with parliamentary committees on Local Government and Subsidiary Legislation,
civil society groups and traditional authorities. The consultations were concluded with a national
level forum in February 2010.

86.     The Government, through the Ministries of Local Governments & Rural
Development, and Finance & Economic Planning, finalized the Comprehensive
Decentralization Policy following all consultations, and has submitted the Policy and
Implementation Plan to Cabinet for approval (PRSC8 proposed trigger). The plan details a
series of activities to be undertaken over four years to implement the policy framework. High on
the agenda is the devolution of basic service functions to local governments and the
operationalization of the Local Government Service. It is anticipated that about 30,000 civil
servants would be moved from the civil service to the local government service. A robust human
resource management system and database are therefore needed in order to establish this local
government service. The progressive implementation of the approved plan is expected to begin in
2011, with a proportion of functions and personnel effectively transferred to district assemblies,
see the results framework in Annex 3.

87.    The Government intends to adopt a new Bill on the Civil Service to replace the
existing Civil Service Act that was enacted by Parliament in 1993. A new Bill on the Civil
Service seeks to take into consideration the decentralization policy of Government and delink
implementation of polices to the decentralized system. The new Bill would restructure the center
of government, changing its role by introducing a policy/service delivery split between national


                                            - 34 -
and sub-national governments; reduce the size of central government to around 10,000 staff;
devolve service delivery functions, staff, and resources to local government from line ministries
by merging de-concentrated ministry staff and functions with sub-national government staff and
functions; require full introduction of the new intergovernmental fiscal architecture; and change
the functions of the center of government to policy formulation, standard setting, monitoring and
evaluation functions. A draft of the Bill has been reviewed and presented to the Civil Service
Council for consideration. It is anticipated that the Bill would be presented to Cabinet as soon as
it is cleared by the Civil Service Council.

88.     Energy. Structural progress in the energy sector would also contribute significantly
to macro-economic stabilization and long term growth. Subsidies to the energy sector for
below-cost recovery tariffs and commercial losses absorbed almost 3 percent of GDP in 2008.51
Poor management52 and weak governance in the recent past have resulted in the sector being a
burden rather than a resource to the country, and were major factors behind the 2006-07
electricity shortages. These shortages obliged the Government of Ghana to purchase both new
generation plants on a cash basis (and in some cases, off-budget, contributing to the accumulation
of outstanding commitments to contractors in 2008), as well as pay for fuel, at a time when world
price spiked. Meanwhile, power tariffs remained frozen between November 2007 and June 2010,
while prices in Ghana rose by 50 percent over the same period.

89.     There was some relief to the financial crisis of the power sector in 2009, as a result of
good rainfall that enabled a big rise in hydroelectric production, and the decline in world oil
prices which lowered costs of thermal generation. Thus, utilities broadly managed to cover their
operational costs, while the Government repaid part of its accumulated liabilities to the sector
(GH¢350 million, or 0.9 percent of GDP). Nonetheless, the Government still had to pay for
electricity utilities investment expenditure and long-term debt servicing. Rapid inflation and the
depreciation of the Ghana Cedi in 2009 (through their impact on generation costs) led to a build-
up in short-term debt by the utilities and obliged the Government to resume its contribution to
covering utilities operational expenses in 2010.

90.    It is in this context that the Government has, through its Ministry of Energy,
commenced implementing recommendations of the electricity financial recovery plan for
the Volta River Authority (VRA), the Northern Electricity Department of the VRA,
Electricity Company of Ghana and Ghana Grid Company (power utility companies)
(PRSC7 prior action). The objective of this plan, which benefited from stakeholders
consultation, is to restore financial viability to the three power utilities, improve their commercial
and operational performance and put an end to their dependence on the state budget. The plan, put
before Cabinet in March 2010, foresaw various options to consider, depending on the ruling of the
independent Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC) on tariff adjustments, as well as
prospects to receive gas from Nigeria through the West African Gas Pipeline (WAGP). In June
2010, the PURC announced significant increases in electricity tariffs. In the face of extensive

51
   On top of the GH¢212 million paid in 2008 by the Government to compensate utilities and TOR for under-
recovery, an additional GH¢670 million worth of outstanding commitments to utilities and TOR was accumulated in
2008 (source: MOFEP).
52
   At a time when there was a sustained increase in demand for electricity due to rising economic growth, there was
no investment in new generation by public sector since 2000, nor private investment, due to the lack of a proper
incentive structure and risk mitigation. The Government decision to restart production of aluminum by VALCO in
2005 (subsequently closed in 2009) also exacerbated the problem as it obliged the main public power producer
(VRA) to overdraw water from the Volta Lake at a time when it did not have an adequate thermal reserve margin to
fall back on in the event of poor rains.

                                                    - 35 -
public criticism of the magnitude of the PURC approved tariff increases, the Government agreed
with both the labor movement and manufacturers to revisit the increases and has instructed the
utilities to partially scale back on the approved hikes through rebates. 53 Part of the revenue
shortfall will be covered by increased subsidies to cushion the impact of PURC ruling on the
poorest consumers, and the rest will have to be absorbed by the utilities themselves. Nonetheless,
World Bank staff analysis suggest that post-rebate tariffs, combined with the ongoing delivery of
Nigerian gas through the WAGP since July 2010 and current high hydroelectric reserves, are
sufficient to cover utilities operational and financial costs in 2010 and 2011. As such, financial
injections to power utilities foreseen in the electricity financial recovery plan are not anymore
needed. With a view to sustainably consolidate such progress, the Public Utilities Regulatory
Authority will establish and implement an electricity automatic tariff adjustment mechanism
(PRSC8 proposed trigger), with a view to avoid large (because infrequent) and politically difficult
tariff adjustments, while providing greater financial predictability to utilities. As a result, it is
expected that utilities will not need any more to occasionally rely on public subsidies to run their
operations (see the results framework in Annex 3), but for the social subsidies embedded in the
life line program. Such a move will also reduce the oil-related budget volatility through utilities
subsidies, and will thus strengthen stabilization objectives set forth in the Oil Revenue
Management bill, see below.

91.     There are major contingent liabilities in the petroleum products distribution sector,
because the state-owned Tema Oil Refinery (TOR) and Bulk Oil Storage and Transport Co. Ltd
(BOST) built up substantial short-term debts in both local and foreign currency to banks and
crude oil suppliers in 2008. These debts, arising from past under-recovery of rising oil costs from
motorists, cannot be paid off in the short-term and need to be refinanced. In 2010, the
Government settled part of the TOR debt through a GH¢445 million (1.0 percent of GDP) equity
injection, 54 which allowed the refinery to settle part of its debt with Ghana Commercial Bank,
and obtain the credit lines needed to resume partial operations. The Government, through the
Ministries of Energy, and Finance & Economic Planning, will submit to Cabinet for decision an
action plan regarding the restoration of Tema Oil Refinery financial sustainability (PRSC8
proposed trigger), based on technical and financial review of refining and distribution of
petroleum products. The Government has also given the IMF assurances in this regard, under the
ECF arrangement. The implementation of the approved plan is expected to improve TORs
operations accounts, see the results framework in Annex 3.

92.     Although the extreme fluctuations of international crude oil prices in 2008 are a
major factor in explaining this debt buildup, the inability of the Government to allow the
automatic adjustment mechanism to set retail prices for petroleum products without
interference exacerbated the scale of debt accumulation. As part of the program to restore
TORs creditworthiness and to prevent a recurrence of yet another debt crisis in the sector,
assurances are being sought from Government to permit full automaticity in setting pump prices.
The Government recognizes that should such severe price instability recur, it will need to ensure
that fuel subsidies are not generalized as in the past, but instead targeted only on those fuels that
are predominantly used by the poor, such as kerosene. In parallel, the Government is also
exploring the potential for scaling up more effective safety nets that would not rely on the use of

   PURC ruling, after rebates, entails effective increases (starting June 1, 2010) in residential tariffs between 21 and
34 percent depending on quantities consumed, above 50kw/h per month. Meanwhile, commercial and industrial
effective tariffs were respectively raised by 59-112 and 63-116 percent depending on quantities consumed.

   The financing of the operation was obtained with the issuance of a Ghana Cedi denominated 3-year Treasury bill
for non residents carrying a 15.0 percent annual interest.

subsidies, but instead on direct transfers to poor households, as discussed below. Although
politically sensitive, the option of increasing taxes on petroleum products55 is also considered by
the Government should there be a shortfall in revenue with respect to the Budget Law 2011.

Protecting the Poor
93.      The impact of the current macroeconomic difficulties in Ghana comes at a time when
many of the poor have not yet recovered from the impact of a series of shocks, starting with
floods and drought in the North during 2007, and to the food and fuel crisis during 2008, see
Section 2B. With limited fiscal resource, improving social protection mechanisms and resource
allocation to pro-poor sectors, becomes even more critical to protect vulnerable households from
falling into poverty traps.

94.     The PRSC7 supports Government's measures aimed at undertaking policy and
institutional reforms to strengthen existing social protection mechanisms. These measures
are being carried out under the coordination of the National Social Protection Strategy (NSPS)
which was published in March 2007 with the goal of "providing policy direction in the protection
of persons living in situations of extreme poverty, vulnerability and exclusion from both expected
and unexpected threats to their livelihoods, with a view to making them effective participants in
the socio-economic development of the country." In 2010, the Government established the multi-
sectoral National Social Protection Steering Committee, with a view to develop effective
coordination across relevant MDAs and promote a common approach to targeting, see below.

95.     In 2009, pro-poor public expenditures were protected, in spite of the strong public
expenditure contraction. Although declining in proportion of GDP compared with 2008, from
5.3 to 5.0 percent, pro-poor expenditures56 were protected in 2009 in relation to total public
expenditures (excluding donor-financed capital expenditures), at 28.2 percent, exceeding both the
end-year target (26.0 percent) and the achievement of 2008 (24.6 percent). In 2009, the
Government also reviewed its classification of pro-poor expenditures, and concluded to the need
to maintain it, for the sake of time consistency. The review allowed the identification of gaps and
shortcoming in the reporting and computation of pro-poor expenditures, which were both
corrected. As for 2010, the Government budgeted 24 percent of its total expenditure to poverty
reduction. In the first nine months of 2010, 29 percent of actual expenditure had been spent for
poverty reduction, equivalent to 5.7 percent of GDP on an annual basis. The Budget 2011
foresees that 24.3 percent of public expenditure will be spent for poverty reduction.

96.   The Livelihood and Empowerment against Poverty (LEAP) program was also
extended. By September 2010, there were about 45,000 households registered as LEAP regular

55
   Ghanas fuel taxes on gasoline, diesel, and kerosene were in 2009 respectively US$0.35, US$0.31 and US$0.14
lower per liters than the average for Sub-Saharan Africa, generating significant smuggling to neighboring countries.
56
   Poverty related expenditures include the following expenditures from the Appropriation Act: (i) Education ­ non-
formal education, pre-school, basic education, technical & vocational education, teacher training, and education
management and supervision, plus a fraction of the expenditures on special education (90 percent), general
administration (50 percent), etc ; (ii) Health ­ district health services, regional public health expenditures, oncology
expenditures, funding for the International Red Cross, and health learning materials, plus a fraction of the
expenditures on regional health support services (50 percent), psychiatric hospital (50 percent), regional clinical care
(50 percent), health training institutions (70 percent), institutional care (60 percent), etc ; (iii) Agriculture ­ crop
services provided through the regional agriculture development units and projects funded by IDA; (iv) Works and
Housing ­ the community water and sanitation, rural housing and rural hydrological drainage; (v) Feeder Roads and
Transport ­ feeder roads and road safety; (vi) Energy ­ rural electrification programs; and (vii) Other ­ national
vocational training, social welfare programs, etc.

beneficiaries and receiving cash subsidies accordingly, against 8,000 by end-2008. By end-2010,
the Government intends to ensure that Fifty Five thousand (55,000) regular LEAP eligible
households receiving the cash subsidies. The LEAP is a cash transfer program that targets orphans
and vulnerable children through their caregivers, the aged (above 65 years and without
subsistence or support) and persons with severe disabilities without productive capacities. LEAP
provides conditional and unconditional subsistence grants on a graduated payment scale of GH¢
8-15 per month to beneficiaries (depending on the number of dependents). The LEAP program is
vertically well targeted (reaches poor households in areas it works), with an estimated 57 percent
share of outlays reaching the poor. But this relatively better targeting may be due primarily to the
fact that with few recipients in each area easy targets such as orphans and vulnerable child, old
age and disabled dominate the beneficiary group. Efforts are underway now to improve LEAP
targeting beyond these easily identified categories.

97.     The National Health Insurance has become an important instrument of social
protection but its financial sustainability is now in question. In 2004, a National Health
Insurance Scheme (NHIS) was launched to replace the system of user fees, which were creating
financial barriers to accessing health care. Funding for the NHIS is generated from multiple
sources, including a 2.5 percent VAT, 2.5 percent transfer from the social security fund, and
income-based premiums. The NHIS is playing an increasingly important part in financing
curative care in Ghana, providing 41 percent of the total resource envelope for 2009. While
coverage, utilization and financial data show positive progress in the implementation of the NHIS,
many challenges remain including: the NHIS is not adequately reaching the poor and informal
sector (in spite of free access for indigents); the current claims reimbursement mechanism and
increased utilization are escalating health care costs and constraining supply; the administration
and organizational structure of the insurance program has led to delays in reimbursing claims by
health care providers; and political pressure to expand the scope of the NHIS without adequate
preparation could potentially threaten its financial sustainability. With World Bank Technical
Assistance, the Government is currently undertaking a review of the NHIS from an accessibility
and financial sustainability perspective.

98.     The recent past has seen a quick, but somewhat uncoordinated expansion of social
protection in Ghana. The system now entails a number of small scale efforts that need to be
evaluated before further scaling up, and that also need to be better coordinated. The emerging
system will rely essentially on targeted transfers to households (a combination of means tested
and geographically targeted). Targeting has also been a challenge and it is now recognized that, to
reduce inefficiencies, an integrated approach to targeting is needed for all poverty alleviation
programs. In addition, there are a number of interventions which are presented as social
protection programs but whose impact and effectiveness are not known. In the present fiscal
environment, it is important to evaluate the impact of large programs (from a fiscal and
recipients perspective) such as the school feeding and youth employment programs, in order to
assess whether these programs are indeed having the desired effect (which might not necessarily
be solely poverty alleviation). This is important for Governments planning as it thinks ex ante
about the crisis future impacts and possible policy responses.

99.    In 2010, the Government has, through its Ministries of Employment & Social
Welfare, Education, Health and Local Government & Rural Development, agreed on
assignment of institutional responsibilities, budget, detail objectives, action plan and
timeline for the adoption and use of a common targeting mechanism for the Livelihood
Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP), National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) &


                                             - 38 -
School Uniform Programme (PRSC7 prior action). The mechanism will be based on proxy
means test (PMT), and is foreseen as a decisive step towards a common approach including a
national single register. Moving forward, the Government, through the Ministry of Employment
and Social Welfare, will pre-test and validate the Common Targeting mechanism, in collaboration
with Ministries of Agriculture, Health, Education, Local Government & Rural Development
(PRSC8 proposed trigger), for application to LEAP, NHIS indigent and School uniforms
programs in pilot areas. Once validated the mechanism will be expanded nationwide. The PMT
scores will need to be higher for cash transfer such as LEAP and lower for more broadly targeted
programs such as school uniforms. Once the PMT is fully functional it can be used as a basis for
the eventual common register. Thus, the Government intends to establish a Single Register to
ensure better targeting of social protection programs. In 2010, the single register will be expanded
beyond LEAP to include beneficiaries of other pro-poor social programs, possibly including the
NHIS indigent exemption, free school uniforms, conditional cash transfers for Junior High School
and the public works programs for poor districts currently in preparation, with World Bank
support. Over time, it is expected that a growing proportion of new LEAP regular beneficiaries
will be identified using the common targeting mechanism, see the results framework in Annex 3.

100. Ghana is well placed to take advantage of the technological revolution that is
changing the delivery of social protection and basic services to the poor. The ICT platform
can improve targeting and delivery of cash benefits and social services to the poor with little
leakage and low administrative costs. This platform combined with the other steps taken by the
Government can transform the effectiveness and efficiency of social protection and services for
the poor in Ghana.

Preparing for the Oil Era
101. First oil is planned for late 2010. Following the confirmation of substantial oil and gas
reserves in the Jubilee offshore field, the Government has been moving forward on several fronts
to enable these resources to be exploited in an economically rational manner, while ensuring that
the impacts of the new oil and gas industry will be handled in an environmentally and socially
sensitive manner. The Government is cognizant of the poor track record of other low-income oil
producing countries and also of the high expectations of the electorate that these national
resources be exploited in a transparent manner for the general good of the nation. The technical
aspects of the Jubilee field development have been spelt out in detail in the ,,Plan of
Development prepared by the Jubilee partners that was approved in the summer of 2009. In
parallel, the EPA is reviewing the impact studies and mitigation measures envisaged by the
Jubilee partners, prior to issuing the necessary clearances. World Bank / IMF estimates based on
proven reserves57 and projections of world crude prices of US$75/bbl (constant prices 2008)
indicate that Ghanas net annual receipts from oil production would be about US$1 billion
annually on average over the period 2011-29. In 2011 though, oil revenue transferred to the
Budget will be much less ­ between US$300 and US$420 million, given the need to amortize
capital expenditures, build stabilization and heritage funds as planned in the revenue management
bill (see below), and reach full capacity for royalty and tax collection.

102. Gas will be produced in association with oil, but is unlikely to have an immediate
impact on Ghana's development prospects, because of the long lead times in developing gas-

57
   Since the Jubilee field development plan was approved exploration has led to further discoveries, so that the oil
resources that could eventually be developed would support production over a longer period than the current phase of
Jubilee alone.

based energy and industrial projects. The Government sees gas as a major input to power
generation and industrial development,58 and is seeking private sector partners to develop major
gas transportation and treatment facilities downstream from the Jubilee field. Difficulties in
reaching agreement with potential partners have delayed investments in gas infrastructure, and it
is Government intention to ensure that a gas commercialization and pricing policy is adopted, to
provide the predictability, transparency and correct incentives framework required for private
sector participation. In the meantime, it is expected that gas will initially be re-injected back into
the Jubilee field to avoid gas flaring, while the gas infrastructure is being built.

103. World Bank analysis identifies a number of actions to be taken to maximize the
developmental impact of oil and gas revenues through their conversion into high social
returns investment projects. In addition to restoring fiscal sustainability to enable Ghana to
allocate most of its oil revenue to investment projects (rather than to cover recurrent deficits and
debt service expenditures), maximizing the developmental impact of oil and gas revenues
includes in particular actions in this sector to (i) introduce stabilization mechanisms to reduce oil-
induced budget volatility and unpredictability, which in most cases comes at the expense of
investment and sound medium term budget planning59, and (ii) promote transparency in oil and
gas sectors to reduce risks of political capture and misappropriation.

104. In June 2010, The Government submitted, through MOFEP, a Petroleum Revenue
Management Bill to the Cabinet based on broad consultations with stakeholders (PRSC7
prior action). The Bill was subsequently adopted by Cabinet and submitted to Parliament in July
2010 for an expected rapid enactment. Benefiting from extensive public consultations based on a
first proposal for a bill, World Bank staff concur with Revenue Watch Institutes View that the
bill finally submitted to Parliament provides a strong framework for the collection and
management of oil and gas revenue, establishing a clear system of controls for the collection of
oil revenues and their allocation to the budget and the proposed stabilization and heritage funds, a
clear division of responsibilities among authorities, reasonable rules for managing the investments
of the funds, and strong oversight and transparency provisions. The bill retains inter alia the
principles that all petroleum revenue from upstream and midstream activities will be collected in
a single account at the BoG and will be accounted for in the budget; that the maximum annual
budget funding amount will be determined by law based on a pre-identified benchmark revenue;
that once in the budget, petroleum income will be treated just as the same as any other
government income; and that oil wealth cannot be used as collateral for the provision of credit.
The bill also foresees the establishment of a stabilization fund and a heritage fund (whose
resource are to be invested in qualifying instruments abroad), both to be governed by law, and
overseen by the Parliament. As such, the Bill, if enacted, would reduce risks of mismanagement
of various kinds. The absence of provisions for earmarking oil revenues to be transferred to the

58
   Unlike oil and natural gas liquids, dry gas cannot be easily stored and exported. But with the availability of a gas
pipeline, several downstream activities could be undertaken, the most immediate being electricity generation through
the conversion of existing and planned power stations from oil to gas, which would generate significant cost
reduction. Further value added could be generated by supplying gas to industries needing a direct heating source,
such as cement, food processing, smelting, etc. LNG, methanol or other large-scale gas conversion and export
projects would require much larger gas reserves than currently assessed ­ at least double, given the large fixed capital
costs needed to develop these activities over a long period of time in highly competitive global markets. In all events,
the intended use of the gas rent would require transparent decision making, notably through the adoption of a
commercial and pricing policy, as for any other public resource.
59
   Other important actions outside the oil and gas sector include the need to invest in agriculture and rural
development to offset the oil-induced lost agricultural competitiveness and widening regional imbalances and remove
identified bottlenecks in non-tradable sectors to prevent rent-seeking and the development of assets bubbles.

                                                      - 40 -
budget will also provide greater flexibility to address shocks and reduce risks of potential political
capture of the resource. By November 2010, discussions were still ongoing at the Parliament,
concentrating in particular on external accountability mechanisms and the possibility to use oil
revenue transferred to the budget (by opposition to oil reserves) as collateral for credit provision.

105. Transparency and accountability provisions in the Petroleum Revenue Management
Bill will be complemented with the extension of EITI principles to the oil and gas sectors. In
June 2010, The Government, through MOFEP, prepared and submitted to Cabinet for decision a
revised Ghana Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (GHEITI) institutional framework to
include the oil and gas sectors. (PRSC7 prior action). The Cabinet subsequently adopted the
revised framework, which should improve transparency and accountability on payments made by
oil companies to Government and revenues the Government receives from oil companies through
independent auditing. The extension to new sectors also required extending the GHEITI steering
committee60 to the Ministry of Energy, GNPC, oil companies, CSO and districts assemblies
representatives from the oil finds areas, learning from the performance of the mining sector in
terms of addressing potential governance vulnerabilities along the chain of actions entailed from
deciding to extract the resource to using it for the sustainable development of the country. Ghana
has strongly committed itself to learn from the lessons of other countries where oil has proved a
curse, rather than a blessing, and ensure that it receives the maximum benefits from these sectors,
and does so in a transparent as well as an environmentally and socially sustainable manner.
Moving forward, the Government intends to ensure the EITI framework becomes legally binding.

106. Government efforts in the sector now focus on developing a regulatory framework to
encourage the sound and sustainable development of the oil and gas industry. Initial
stakeholders consultations held in 2010 on the oil and gas regulatory framework raised
fundamental issues of ownership, participation and control, roles, responsibilities and
accountability, legitimacy and capacity of institutions that underpin effective performance of such
a green field sector in the Ghanaian economy. Consultations suggested in particular that more
time and attention should be devoted to reaching a consensus on (i) the key features of the
proposed new Ghana Petroleum Regulatory Authority, including the scope of responsibility of the
regulator (one mega regulator for all utilities, or several small specialized regulators); and (ii) the
local content aspects. The resonance of these issues was amplified by the difficulties faced by a
major international oil company to acquire shares in the Jubilee field consortium. Ongoing
dialogue with authorities, as part of this proposed operation and through the EITI++ scoping
mission carried out in parallel also helped clarify what is needed to establish a sound and effective
regulatory framework for oil and gas in Ghana. Discussions also underlined the urgent need for a
major capacity building program to endow the Government with the skills needed to oversee ad
regulate the nascent oil and gas industry, to which the World Bank responded positively along
with US, and Norway.

107. As a result of these consultations, a decision was made to sequence the effort to build
a regulatory framework in two stages: (i) amend the existing petroleum exploration and
production legislation; and (ii) build new regulatory authority for the upstream oil and gas
industry. Thus, the Government, through the Petroleum Exploration and Production bill
submitted to Parliament in July 201061, proposed to revise the existing legislation providing for

transparency mechanisms and the regulatory role of the Ministry of Energy.

creation of a petroleum regulatory authority with statutory powers covering certain technical
aspects of regulation, and intends accordingly, through the Ministry of Energy, to submit to
Cabinet for decision a policy proposal establishing a petroleum regulatory authority (PRSC8
proposed trigger). Following internal stakeholders consultations before submission, the policy
proposal once approved by Cabinet will be subject to broad and meaningful public consultations
with interested parties (including CSOs), with a view to build a solid consensus on regulatory
aspects. The proposal would specify financial and human resources needed to build such
authority. The Petroleum Exploration and Production bill proposes to leave all regulatory powers
to the Ministry of Energy before a petroleum regulatory authority is established.

108. While difficult to measure quantitatively, it is expected that actions supported by
PRSC7 and PRSC7 will improve the way the oil industry is regulated and managed through
greater transparency and executive accountability. As such, the results framework developed
in Annex 3 will monitor the publication of EITI reconciliation reports on oil and petroleum
receipts reports.

                                Box 2: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership

The Government of Ghana developed the GSGDA, on the basis of which the PRSC7 was prepared, through broad consultations on
issues and challenges in promoting growth and reducing poverty. Several workshops were carried out during the preparation of the
GSGDA with a view to: (i) reviewing the draft document for each thematic area, and examining the policy actions needed to
achieve the GSGDA goals; (ii) ranking and prioritizing the proposed set of policy actions according to agreed criteria; and (iii)
strengthening policy synergies between and across sectors by identifying complementarities and overlaps.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability framework

The PRSC7 is part of a concerted effort with development partners grouped around the Multi-Donor Budgetary Support (MDBS).
The MDBS aims at reducing the Governments transaction costs in dealing with development assistance by ensuring greater
complementarity between this assistance and the Governments own poverty reduction strategy. Over the last seven years,
development partners have followed through with this commitment by carrying out joint missions, advancing agreements on
policy actions and the timing of assessment reviews. DPs also agreed with the Government on a joint matrix of policy actions to be
supported, aligning almost all aspects of their monitoring and evaluation frameworks, except those regarding the use of outcome
indicators as a basis for disbursement. The MDBS endeavors to increasingly focus on the cross-cutting issues, as well as policy
actions that either have economy-wide implications or require collaboration between agencies. As its predecessors, the proposed
operation is peer reviewed by the MDBS rotating co-chair, in consultation with MDBS members.

Principle 3: Balancing Predictability and Flexibility

In response to the Governments request, the proposed operation was designed with a focus on stabilization efforts. The timing,
design and scope of the operation is thus customized to Ghanas country circumstances and acknowledges the need to act quickly
and flexibly while helping the Government signal its continued commitment to reform. At the same time, the PRSC7 seeks to
remain fully consistent with the principles of donor harmonization. PRSC7 prior actions are all extracted from the MDBS PAF
2009-11, which was revisited in November 2009 to incorporate Governments emerging priorities, following a retreat between the
Government and DPs in October 2009 which acknowledged the need to introduce greater flexibility in the PAF to allow for the
inclusion of triggers addressing unforeseen shocks to preserve PAF longer term objectives.

Principle 4: Streamlining critical actions for achieving results

In the proposed operation, prior actions for disbursement are limited to eight critical actions in the implementation of the
Governments program. The Government matrix contains forty two actions, reflecting its policy program in 2009-10 to cope with
current macro-economic challenges while protecting longer term developmental objectives.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial support

The review of Government performance in meeting PRSC7 prior actions62 was mainly conducted at the MDBS annual review
(May 10-14, 2010), which was timed to coincide with the completion of the Governments own Annual Progress Report, helping
reinforce harmonization with domestic processes and contribute to greater predictability of financial support. The MDBS is
making a concerted effort to better align the budget support provided with the budget cycle and with the Government M&E , and
is currently exploring various options of reform in this domain, as a follow up to the MDBS retreat of October 2009.




62
  At that time, six out of the eight prior actions (MDBS triggers) were assessed met. Since, the last two prior actions
under consideration (begin implementation of the electricity financial recovery plan, and A Petroleum Revenue
Management Bill submitted to Cabinet based on broad consultations with stakeholders) were assessed as met,
respectively in June and July 2010.

                             5. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                                  A.      PARTICIPATION PROCESS

109. The specific reforms supported by the proposed PRSC7 comprise critical elements of
the GSGDA, whose preparation benefited from some information sharing and consultations
within the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC). With the appointment of
new Chairman and Commissioners in the first half of 2010, the new National Development
Planning Commission only had limited time for extensive formal consultations around the content
of the GSGDA which had been drafted earlier in 2009 by NDPC services (and served as input to
the preparation of the Budget 2010, see below). Under the leadership of the new Chair of the
Commission, however, sector groups comprising a good cross section of technical experts were
established and have provided input and guidance to the development of the GSGDA. Going
forward, the GSGDA outlines plans for more systematic and extensive consultations as part of the
regular planning process. The GSGDA notes that public consultation constitutes an integral part
of the development planning process and notes that by having all political parties represented in
the NDPC, Ghana's development plans would benefit from more continuity and sustainability.

110. The Budget 2010, which was presented to the Parliament after hearings from MDAs
and CSOs, is the first step of implementing the GSGDA. It reflects its major features,
including macroeconomic stabilization, agricultural modernization, productive infrastructure and
social protection, within a medium term framework (2010-12). Some prior actions supported by
the proposed operation also directly benefited from strong consultations process with relevant
stakeholders, in particular for the adoption of the Petroleum Revenue Management Bill, the
extension of EITI principles to oil and gas sectors, and the implementation of the electricity
financial recovery plan. The adoption of the Government Budget, as well as that of any foreign
loan (including the PRSC7), requires Parliamentary approval.

111. Given the on-going and politically difficult decisions that the Government faces to
pursue its stabilization objectives, the preparation of the PRSC7 also foresees additional
efforts to provide objective information, promote debate and support coalitions for pro poor
reforms in areas addressed by this operation. Specifically, the operation will seek to foster a
dialogue among a range of civil society organizations, academics, direct stakeholders and the
Government on the design of policy reform and its implementation. Efforts undertaken under the
MDBS to foster direct dialogue between the Government and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)
­ the Aid Effectiveness Platform notably ­ in Sector Working Groups and at the annual review
will be pursued and expanded, as well as between Parliament and DPs (through the
institutionalization in 2010 of a Development Platform at Parliament, where DPs gather twice a
year with the Speaker, Majority and Minority Leaders and Members of Parliament). Efforts will
also be expanded to foster direct dialogue between Ghanaian think tanks and the Government,
possibly through MDBS. In December 2010, a two-day round table involving all major think
tanks was organized to discuss immediate development policy trade-offs (fiscal framework,
resource mobilization, public sector reform, debt restructuring, and institutions for sound
economic governance), engaging the Government for further direct dialogue. The World Banks
role in these dialogues will continue to be as a facilitator rather than a direct participant, since the
objective of the dialogues is for national counterparts to discuss facts and come up with home
grown solutions.

                                     B.      ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

112. Measures supported by the proposed operation are not expected to have any
significant impact on the environment. The implementation of measures to improve public
financial management, the classification of SAs, the agreement on responsibilities for a common
targeting mechanism, and the adoption of the oil revenue management bill are all environmentally
neutral. The extension of EITI to oil and gas sectors has no bearing either on the environment, as
only concerned with revenue measurement. Finally, the increase in electricity tariffs could
improve energy conservation, and is not expected to induce any significant switching to dirty
energy in net terms. In Ghana, electricity is used for lighting and running appliances, but not for
cooking, as reported in the various GLSSs. As such, electricity tariff increases could only induce
switching to kerosene for lighting, but such a substitution effect is expected to be negligible given
that poor households (typically the most sensitive to changes in relative prices of energy given its
importance in overall budget)63 will not be affected, see below. Besides, a greater use of kerosene
would be offset by a lower use of crude oil to generate electricity, as Ghana utilities would use
this theoretical opportunity to reduce its average cost through higher resort to hydroelectric
generation in relative terms.

113. More generally, the Government's reform agenda builds on Ghana's robust
environmental institutional framework and considerable capacities to set environmental
management standards. The institutional framework is defined by the 1991 National
Environmental Policy, the 1992 National Environmental Action Plan, and the 1994
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Act. The Governments agreements under the 2008
Natural Resource and Environmental Governance (NREG) program build on this framework, and
are supported by a World Bank programmatic Development Policy Operation (see Section 3D).
The NREG Program supports institutional reform, including strengthening the budgetary and
financing arrangements for environmental protection by the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), further decentralization of services and greater engagement of civil society and local
communities in natural resource and environmental governance. The EPA has since the late 1980s
adopted Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) as a management tool to screen undertakings
likely to pose adverse impact on the environment. EIAs became legal in 1999 and are applied to
all development projects and programs that have the potential to give rise to significant social and
environmental impacts. EIAs are mandatory for seventeen types of activities classified as critical,
including mining, petroleum and gas field development and exploration, construction of dams,
harbors and roads, and logging and disposal of timber. In addition, the EPA has been one of the
leading users in Africa of Strategic Environment Assessment (SEA) as a tool for the assessment
of major policies, programs and investments.

114. The assessment of environmental and social risks (including from oil and gas) builds
on Ghana's earlier efforts to comprehend the impact of development policy, so as to develop
corresponding preventive and mitigation/remediation plans. The Strategic Environmental
Assessment (SEA) was designed in 2004, and introduced as a process tool to evaluate the
potential environmental (natural resources management linkage), social (poverty indicators,
livelihoods and health impacts and vulnerability impacts on the poor) and institutional
(institutional targeted impacts) effects of the GPRS (and successors) and any plans or programs
that may be derived. Consultations were carried out with MDAs, CSOs, NGOs and DPs, leading
to recommendations aimed at refining policies, and giving greater focus to environmental issues
in articulating strategies for sustainable development. Specific recommendations included

                                                   - 47 -
proposed actions on the rural environment, natural resource management, disaster prevention, and
,,green taxes and accounting. The Bank is providing support to the development of a Strategic
Environmental Assessment for the new Oil and Gas sector via the IDA-funded Natural Resources
and Environmental Governance Program.

                                            C.       SOCIAL ASPECTS

115. Measures supported by the proposed operation are expected to have a significant
positive and direct effect on poverty reduction. These include: (i) the strengthening of social
protection through the adoption of a common targeting mechanism; (ii) adopting legal
instruments for reduced risks of mismanaging oil revenues and increase their allocation in support
of the GSGDA, and (iii) restoring the financial viability of the electricity sector, which is critical
for pro-poor economic growth and employment creation. The strengthening of public financial
management is also expected to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of public resources in
the delivery of social and development services, as is also the clarification of Subvented Agencies
responsibilities and mandate in support of the GSGDA. More broadly, the proposed operation will
support the macro-economic stabilization program, thus reducing the poors and near poors
exposure to macro-economic shocks.

116. The Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) of recent electricity tariff
increases suggests an insignificant impact on poverty. As part of its efforts to restore the
financial restoring the financial viability of the electricity sector, the Government acknowledged
and enacted the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC) ruling to increase residential
tariffs by an average of 27 percent from June 1, 2010 compared with that of November 2007, date
at which tariffs were last modified.64 Tariffs for users consuming less than 50 kWh per month
were nonetheless left unchanged. As the majority of the poor still do not have access to electricity
and/or consume less than 50 kWh per month, the poverty implications of these new tariffs are
expected to be insignificant. Simulations indeed suggest that overall this price increase has
negligible impact on the poor and near poor.65 However, simulations also suggest that lower
middle-income (non-poor) users could be negatively affected by these higher electricity prices.
This is because many of these users consume between 51-150 kWh/month and can no longer take
advantage of the electricity subsidies under the lifeline tariff program, which was restricted by the
same PURC ruling to those consuming 0-50kWh/month. As a result, electricity prices for these
users were effectively increased by more than 79 percent, the highest relative tariff increase for
residential customers. By September 2010, the Government was reviewing options to mitigate
the impact of tariff increases on this large class of users.

117. New Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) could be conducted in support of
policy decisions envisaged under the PRSC8. In particular, the design of the action plan for
Subvented Agencies could benefit from an assessment of its poverty and social impact, to be
conducted with the Ministry of Employment and Social Welfare depending on the nature of
decisions envisaged.




64
   Between November 2007 and May 2010, the consumer price index computed and reported by the GSS rose by 50.3
percent.
65
   The PSIA suggests that the proportion of people which could fall under the poverty line as a result of the change in
the relative price of electricity could be around 0.5 percent, that is, below what could be considered statistically
significant given surveys sample sizes.

                                 D.     FIDUCIARY ASSESSMENT

118. Public financial management is solid enough to warrant the continuation of
Development Policy Operations. Analytical work undertaken by Development Partners in
collaboration with the Government highlighted the strong foundation being built towards
strengthening PFM in Ghana. PEFA 2010 and the ERPFM 2010 reports, as well as the IMF FAD
report of 2010 confirm that Ghana has built a solid legal and regulatory framework and
foundation for public financial management that performs at an average level and occasionally
above-average standards, see Box 2. Timeliness in financial reporting, despite weaknesses in
comprehensiveness, has improved markedly, and so was the effectiveness of external audit, its
compliance with international standards as well coverage. A strong Parliamentary Public
Accounts Committee, reinvigorated since 2009, is currently in place and its proceedings are open
to the public and on both print media and television. A further strengthening of this legislative
oversight role, including a more systematic and aggressive follow up on audit findings will
support the entrenchment of accountability and transparency within the public financial
management realm. Reform successes in the area of public procurement are also quite
encouraging as revealed by the PPAs use of the Public Procurement Model of Excellence as a
self-assessment tool. As against a target of 80 percent set by EGPRC/MDBS for assessment of
performance of high spending entities in public procurement in 2008, actual performance realized
were 97.6 percent, 95.2 percent, and 81.6 percent respectively for (a) use of appropriate
procurement methods, (b) publication of tender notices, and (c) publication of award of contracts.
A lot more remains to be done in the area of improving public procurement systems, however.
Using the results of an analysis by the Bank, using the OECD-DAC tool, it has been concluded
that Ghana still needs to further improve the efficiency of the national procurement systems by
strengthening the legislative framework, enhancing institutional development capacity,
streamlining operations, and increasing transparency.

119. But fiduciary issues remain in terms of budget execution. The implementation of an
effective cash management system, the treasury single account, and the full reinstatement of
commitment controls in all MDAs, will lower the risk of expenditure slippages and support the
predictability of resource flows to MDAs. The planned transfer of Subvented Agencies payroll to
the computerized human resource management system (IPPD-2), especially under the auspices of
the GIFMIS project, will also allow closer monitoring of the public sector size and improved
payroll management. Besides, increased oversight and control of public investments should
include: (i) better screening of public investment proposals; and (ii) broadening oversight over the
finances of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs). As part of the larger Government program aimed at
addressing these issues, the proposed operation aims at further reducing fiduciary risks by
supporting specific policy actions aimed leveraging the planned implementation of an effective
cash management and commitment control system.

120. Upgrading, stabilizing, and rolling-out of a fully Ghana Integrated Financial
Management Information System (GIFMIS) for budget management is critical to sustaining
success in both the maintenance of fiscal discipline and the effective and timely monitoring
of overall government finances. To this end, the Government has initiated and approved a new
PFM Improvement Charter ­ called the GIFMIS Charter ­ that outlines the framework that the
Government has adopted, and seeks to implement on a priority basis, aimed at reversing the key
inherent weaknesses in its fiduciary control environment as also elaborated in paragraph 55. The
Charter, whose implementation has now commenced through the GIFMIS project, and has the full
government ownership and unflinching commitment at the highest level, will address the key


                                             - 49 -
challenges involved in the budgeting, accounting, and reporting systems, processes, and practices
across government. In addition, to support improved cash management, the CAGD has
implemented a form of ,,treasury realignment that provides for integrating the treasuries as part of
the administrative control of MDAs and MMDAs, while retaining the recruitment and posting
powers of the core accounting staff.

121. The IMF conducted a safeguards assessment of the Bank of Ghana in 2009. Under the
Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Ghana (BoG) has been subject to an update
assessment with respect to a new PRGF arrangement approved July 15 2009; the assessment,
completed on December 2, 2009, followed an initial safeguards assessment from October 2003.
The update assessment found that while the safeguards framework of the BoG has been
strengthened in several areas since then, new risks in governance oversight emerged with the
removal of the former Board in January 2009, and a delay, due to a legal challenge, in the start of
the successor Board. Pending the resumption of Board activities some interim measures have
been introduced to provide an independent oversight mechanism. These include the introduction
of an Advisory Panel comprised of three outside members responsible for the external and
internal audit and controls systems. In March 2010, the authorities have advised staff that a new
Board has been appointed. They have also either committed to or implemented all measures
proposed by staff.

122. Overall, the fiduciary risk of the operation is rated `modest'. This is based on the
results of the latest IMF Safeguards Assessment of the Bank of Ghana, the improvements already
made as well as the demonstrated commitment of the Government to implementing other wide
ranging reforms in the area of PFM, including public procurement,

                              Box 3: Ghana's Public Financial Management Systems
Credibility of the Budget. Actual primary expenditure compared with budgeted expenditure shows significant deviations at both
the aggregate level and at the level of individual Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). Aggregate deviation for 2008
was a high of 34.2% (exacerbated in 2009 by the large arrears that were partly paid in 2009 without a supporting original budget as
their existence and quantum was unknown at budget time). Resulting from the arrears brought forward from 2008, the expenditure
compositional variance for 2009 was also unfavorably impacted. Also, the largely ineffective establishment control and
commitment controls, complicated further by continuing unpredictable budget releases, undermined efforts to maintain
expenditure within budget ceilings. In essence the high expenditure arrears, discovered at mid-term budget review (2009), have
contributed immensely to further weakening the credibility of the budget. Notwithstanding, the improved realism in revenue
budgeting was however reported to have cushioned the impact of reduced overall budget credibility.

Comprehensiveness and Transparency of the Budget. While the budget documentation is fairly complete, comprehensible and
comprehensive, and is made publicly available, the budget classification system was, up to 2009, not yet fully GFS compliant and
is incapable of directly supporting a functional outcome budget management process. This is notwithstanding the fact that the
categorization of the administrative classification elements allows some linkage to the National Development Strategic
Framework. Transparency of inter-governmental fiscal relations also requires improvement.

Policy-based Budget. While budgets have become more policy-based in recent years ­ in as much as the approaches instituted
remain severely constrained ­ Ghanas performance is held back by limited ability to cost strategies, the lack of effective wage bill
planning, the absence of a transparent link between planned and executed budget activities, and the lack of an effective feedback
mechanism. The underlying institutional arrangements to support a policy based budget process are absent despite the adoption of
a single stage coordinated budget process for recurrent and development budgets. In spite of the underlying weaknesses in its
implementation experience, the Government has adopted a three-year Medium Term Expenditure Framework for its budgetary
processes. Going forward, the Government has committed itself to adopting and implementing a program-based budgeting
framework, commencing with a pilot for some MDAs for the fiscal year budget 2011.

Predictability and Control in Budget Execution. While Ghanas central government scores well overall with respect to some
aspects of revenue administration, debt management, payroll management and procurement, overall predictability and control in
budget execution remains an area of concern. The areas of concern include the discretionary elements of the legal and regulatory
framework for revenue management, the controls in the taxpayer registration system, the predictability in the availability of funds
for the commitment of expenditures, the extent of consolidation of the Governments bank cash balances, the effectiveness of the
establishment control, and the effectiveness of the commitment control. Cash management remains a particular challenge to the
PFM systems as well as the apparent lack of effective procurement planning as part of the budget process. Although the legal and
regulatory framework is clear on the controls for each of the main steps of the procurement and expenditure cycle, these are not
applied uniformly across all MDAs. The internal audit units are well structured although their focus continues to include pre-audit
functions as well ­ a factor that undermines their independence.

Accounting, Recording and Reporting. Within 4 ­ 6 weeks after each month-end, the CAGD-managed bank accounts are
reconciled, following clear guidelines and procedures contained in the Accounting Manual. For the other government accounts, the
retained IGF bank accounts, statutory funds, and those related to development partner funded projects, these remain outside this
arrangement. The retained IGF accounts are reconciled quarterly in some ministries but at least annually for all in the preparation
of the final accounts. Suspense accounts are also reconciled and cleared, but annually, as part of the year-end closing of accounts.
Data integrity however remains a source of concern, especially in the absence of full consolidation of all government fund types.
The monthly financial statements produced, within 4 ­ 6 weeks after month-end, do not report on expenditure at the time of
commitment but only when actual expenditures have been made. This form of presentation permits only a partial (non-
consolidated) comparison of revenues and expenditures to the original budget appropriations. Timeless in preparing the Public
Accounts (Consolidated Fund) is achieved as they are submitted within 3 months of end of fiscal year, and the accounts are largely
consistent with the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) cash basis of financial reporting. Accounting,
recording, and reporting are predominantly paper-based.

External Scrutiny and Audit. Submission of audit reports to the legislature is now timely - within 3 months and 6 to 9 months
after receipt of draft accounts for the consolidated fund and the MDAs accounts respectively. The scope and nature of audits
performed is satisfactory, although much of risk-based focus is required despite audits being largely compliant with international
standards. Effective follow up on audit reports is only just beginning. With procedures for review of budget documentation by the
legislature being firmly established and respected in terms of available review time, the scope of the scrutiny as well as the failure
in respecting the rules for in-year budget adjustments hampers performance against this PFM dimension. Examination and
completion of reviews of audit reports by the Public Accounts Committee remain untimely notwithstanding the presence of a more
aggressive parliamentary public accounts committee.

                             E.      DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

123. Recipient and Financing Agreement. This proposed operation is a one-tranche IDA
credit of SDR141 million (US$215 million equivalent). The credit disbursement will follow the
standard Bank procedures for Development Policy Lending. The administration of this credit will
be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance & Economic Planning.

124. Funds flow arrangements. The Government of Ghana shall identify a Foreign Exchange
Account with the Bank of Ghana and which forms part of the countrys official foreign exchange
reserves, into which the proceeds of the credit will be disbursed upon meeting the agreed prior
actions and upon credit effectiveness. The Ghana Cedi equivalent of the funds in the Account
will, within two working days, be transferred into the Consolidated Fund of the Government of
Ghana, and the amount recorded appropriately in the financial management system of the
Government of Ghana.

125. Disbursements from the Consolidated Fund by the Government of Ghana shall not
be tied to any specific purchases and no special procurement requirement shall be needed.
The proceeds of the credit shall, however, not be applied to finance expenditures in the negative
list as defined in the Schedule 1 of the Financing Agreement. If any portion of the credit is used
to finance ineligible expenditures as so defined in the Schedule 1 of the Financing Agreement,
IDA shall require the Government to promptly, upon notice from IDA, refund an amount equal to
the amount of the said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to IDA upon such request shall be
cancelled from the credit.

126. Assurance Requirements. Based on the modest fiduciary risk associated with the
operation, there will be no special fiduciary arrangements established for the credit in terms of a
requirement for an audit. However, within seven days of the disbursement of the credit by IDA,
the Chief Director of the Ministry of Finance & Economic Planning. Ghana shall provide a
written confirmation to IDA, certifying the receipt of the Ghana Cedi equivalent of the credit into
the Consolidated Fund Account of the Government of Ghana, the number of the account, the date
of the receipt, and the exchange rate applied to translate the credit currency into Ghana Cedi, and
confirming that the said amount has been appropriately accounted for in the recipient's financial
management system. In addition, as the Controller & Accountant Generals Department is
required by law to submit its annual report and the audited accounts on the public consolidated
fund to Parliament within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year, a copy of the said reports and
accounts shall be provided to IDA within one month after the lapse of the 6 month period. The
Government shall equally ensure that the annual entity financial statements of the Bank of Ghana
(BoG), audited in accordance with international standards on auditing as promulgated by the
International Federation of Accountants, are publicly available.

127. The Association reserves the right to request, at any time, an audit of the receipt and
accounting of the disbursement in the budget management system of the Borrower. Upon
the Associations request, the Borrower shall: (i) have the account and the recording of amounts
of the credit into the Borrowers budget management system audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Association, in accordance with consistently applied auditing standards
acceptable to the Association; (ii) furnish to the Association as soon as available, but in any case
no later than four months after the date of the Associations request for such audit, a certified
copy of the audit report by said auditors, of such scope and in such detail as the Association shall
have reasonably requested; and (iii) furnish to the Association such other information concerning


                                             - 52 -
the said account and recording of credit amounts into the budget management system, and the
audit thereof, as the Association shall have reasonably requested.

                  F.      IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

128. The Ministry of Finance & Economic Planning would be responsible for the overall
implementation of the proposed PRSC7. Bank supervision will be aligned with the
Governments monitoring and evaluation framework for the GSGDA through the MDBS review
process, focusing on the year-long verification process that monitors the implementation of the
policies being supported by the PRSC7.

129. During the period of implementation of the program supported by the proposed
PRSC7 a series of reports would assist in monitoring progress: (i) MOFEP detailed monthly
reports on budget developments (revenue, expenditure, financing, as posted on the MOFEP
website) with a lag of no more that 6 weeks after the end of each month, (ii) MOFEP Public
Expenditure Review, (iii) energy utilities audited accounts, (iv) MDAs and NDPC annual
progress reports, (v) IMF ECF reviews and Article IV reports, (vi) MDBS annual review aide
memoire, and (vii) official documents (memoranda, gazette) as means of verification of effective
policy decisions.

130. The Results Framework in Annex 3 provides the list of outcome indicators to
monitor the progress over time of the proposed programmatic series of PRSC7 and PRSC8.
The latter were agreed upon with the Government of Ghana. The results framework is an
endeavor to identify expected quantifiable medium term outcomes resulting from policy actions
supported by the programmatic series of DPOs, for its ex-post evaluation. Obviously, the
Government of Ghana cannot be made accountable for outcomes which it does not completely
control, as determined not only by policy actions, but also by a number of exogenous factors.

131. In full alignment to the MDBS framework, the review of Ghana's performance in
meeting proposed PRSC8 triggers will be conducted at the next MDBS annual review.

                              G.      RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

132.   The proposed operation comprises significant risks, namely:

       Downside risks from a slow (or absence of) recovery in the global macro-economic
       situation, with implications for export receipt growth and financing prospects (from public
       and private foreign creditors) for Ghana. Combined with the IMF ECF, the proposed
       operation would help mitigate these risks by supporting the fiscal consolidation measures,
       providing needed financing to support the budget and BOP, and sending a strong signal to
       markets and Development Partners of Ghanas continued commitment to bring its fiscal
       stance to a sound and sustainable track;

       Political feasibility risks related to the fiscal adjustment (opposition to increased utilities
       tariffs and taxes, to delayed single spine implementation, and demand for new investment
       programs financed with current and future oil revenues) with new elections looming,
       which would weaken macro-economic stability and further increase banks vulnerabilities.
       The proposed operation would help mitigate some of these risks by supporting actions to
       (i) protect the poor through improved social protection mechanisms, (ii) encourage better
       service delivery through effective decentralization, and (iii) implement the second


                                             - 53 -
       financial sector strategic plan for greater financial stability. In addition, the operation
       supports broader sharing of information (including in oil and gas through EITI), and
       consulting with stakeholders, including CSOs and unions, to build consensus on the
       design of a fiscally sustainable program of reforms;

       Implementation risks, as actions supported by the series mostly comprise policy designs
       and approvals. Ghanas recent track record of reforms indeed suggests that, while
       necessary, policy approvals do not always constitute sufficient conditions for
       implementation. The complementarity of the proposed operation with ongoing and
       forthcoming World Bank projects in PFM, energy (including oil), public sector reform and
       social protection would mitigate such risks.

       Technical and regulatory problems faced with oil production, which would affect the
       environment and diminish expected oil revenues. The proposed operation would mitigate
       some of these risks by supporting efforts to strengthen the petroleum regulatory and
       framework and introduce stabilization mechanisms through the oil revenue management
       framework;

       Energy-related risks of various natures, including higher oil prices than budgeted, lower
       rains than expected, lower flows of gas from Nigeria than planned, which would all have
       negative implications for budget execution (through the accrual of larger contingent
       liabilities in electricity utilities). The implementation of the financial recovery plans in the
       energy sector as supported by the proposed operation would reduce such risks;

       Natural disasters, given the relatively high exposure of Ghanas population to multiple
       natural hazards, in particular in the North were poverty is concentrated.

133. In IDA's assessment, the potential benefits of the proposed operation outweigh the
residual risks and warrant IDAs assistance for implementing critical reforms and policy actions
in a coordinated fashion with other donors, while supporting risk mitigation actions to maximize
the sustainability of the reform agenda.

     INTRODUCTION

1.   I am on behalf of the Government of Ghana, writing to request a seventh Poverty Reduction
     Support Credit (PRSC­7) from the International Development Association (IDA) to support the
     policies and programmes outlined in the Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda
     (GSGDA) - 2010-2013. This letter sets out actions that government will undertake over the
     medium term to implement its development programme. Attached to this letter is a policy matrix
     based on the GSGDA, developed in collaboration with the World Bank team and other
     development partners under the Multi-Donor Budget Support framework. The policy matrix
     summarizes the content of this letter.

2.   As you are already aware, the present government took office in January 2009 and has since been
     implementing a social democratic agenda to promote "A Better Ghana" in which there exists real
     opportunities for gainful employment, prosperous enterprise and social and economic welfare for
     all Ghanaians.

3.   The discovery of oil in commercial quantities in Ghana and the expected revenue inflows is
     critical to sustained and expanded external financing from our development partners in the
     medium term, to support fiscal stabilization efforts and manage the expectations and aspirations of
     the Ghanaian populace. It is in view of these that government is seeking further PRSC support to
     sustain the stabilization of the economy so that it remains diversified and not dependent on oil as
     has happened in other developing countries.



                                            - 56 -
4.    The actions that are being considered aim at consolidating ongoing fiscal stabilization efforts,
      protecting existing social safety net by improving upon common targeting mechanism. The
      GSGDA emphasizes the need for macroeconomic stabilization and greater executive efficiency,
      transparency and accountability to provide the adequate setting for the reduction of poverty and
      socio-economic inequalities through agricultural, infrastructure and human resource development.
      This will ultimately lead to reduced poverty and increase efforts at achieving the Millennium
      Development Goals and middle income status. Specifically, the PSRC7 support will assist with the
      continued deepening of policy reforms initiated in 2009 to: (i) restore budgetary discipline (ii)
      tackle long-standing public sector and energy issues, (iii) protect the poor and (iv) prepare for the
      oil era


      MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

5.    New national accounts were recently published by the Ghana Statistical Services, portraying a
      wealthier and more service-oriented Ghanaian economy. While agriculture and industry GDP were
      revised upward by about 30 and 22 percent respectively, service GDP was revised upward by
      about 147 percent in 2006. As imports, exports, government final consumption and gross capital
      formation were almost unaffected by the revision, most the upward adjustment took place in
      household final consumption (+72 percent in 2006). In turn, the latter found its financing in higher
      income from domestic production for domestic markets, services in particular, mirroring a better
      coverage of the informal sector.

6.    The Ghanaian economy witnessed a steady GDP growth, averaging about 6% in the last few years.
      GDP growth hit 8.4% in 2008 but slowed down to 4.7% in 2009 on the back of low government
      spending and the effects of the global financial crisis. Economic growth is however expected to
      pick up to about 6.6% by end 2010 as the domestic economic environment improves. Real GDP
      growth is projected to reach over 14.4% in 2011 on account of oil production and export coming
      on stream, and subsequently to 7.1% in 2012.

7.    The improvement in growth performance has been led by the services sector with annual growth
      rates of over 6.2% followed by the industrial sector with an average growth of 5.6%. The
      economy is however still dominated by the agriculture sector, with growth rate average of 4.6%
      over the last decade. The low growth record of the agricultural sector is attributed to low
      productivity and limited competiveness due to its reliance on subsistence technology, poor rural
      infrastructure and services, small holder-production, ageing farmers and lack of credit among
      others.

8.    Over the medium-term, the industrial sector is projected to grow by an annual average of 9.8%,
      driven by the expected growth in construction, oil-related infrastructure, electricity and water. The
      services sector is also expected to grow at an annual average of 8.5%, driven mainly by tourism,
      wholesale and retail trade as well as finance.

9.    Until recently, monetary policy adopted a tightened stance aimed at unwinding the high monetary
      growth and its associated inflationary pressures on the economy. As a result, growth in broad
      money supply slowed down from 40.2% in December 2008 to 26.9% in December 2009.
      Following the subdued inflationary pressures, however, monetary policy has since eased, lending
      support to the economic growth process. Subsequently, the policy rate was lowered from 18% in
      2009 to a projected 13.5% in 2010.

10.   The downward trends in the monetary policy rate subsequently triggered declining interest rates
      on the money market. The 91-day Treasury bill rates dropped to 22.5% in 2009, from 24.7% in
      2008 and are projected to drop further to 12.5% in 2010.




                                              - 57 -
11.   Inflation rose markedly from 18.1% in December 2008 to 20.7% in June 2009, fuelled by fiscal
      expansion and rising food and crude oil prices. Since the second half of 2009, however, inflation
      has been on a downward trend, reaching 16% in December 2009, and further down to 9.4% in
      August 2010. This is attributed to stable exchange rate, stable world crude oil prices and good
      food harvests.

12.   The cedi depreciated strongly against the major currencies in 2008 through to the first half of 2009
      on account of the larger twin budget and current account deficits of 2008, depletion of foreign
      reserves, and uncertainties in the domestic and global financial markets. As the macroeconomic
      stabilization measures took effect in the second half of 2009, the cedi gained in strength. By the
      end of June 2010, the exchange rate of the cedi against the US dollar, pound sterling and the euro
      had appreciated by 3.2%, 13.9% and 19.6%, respectively, on a year-on-year basis.

13.   Fiscal stability was seriously strained in 2008, caused largely by the expansionary fiscal stance of
      the Government leading to worsening of the budget deficit, which reached 8.5% of GDP in 2008.
      As a result of Governments commitments to fiscal consolidation, the overall budget deficit was
      brought down to 5.8% of GDP in 2009. Net domestic financing (NDF) also declined from 5.7%
      to 2.8% of GDP in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The fiscal deficit is projected to fall to 5.6% of
      GDP in 2010, and over the medium term to 3.3% of GDP, on account of improved expenditure
      management and enhanced revenue mobilization.

14.   In 2009, prices of the countrys major export commodities gold and cocoa remained reasonably
      firm, while international crude oil prices fell sharply from the peak level of USD132.5 per barrel
      in July 2008. Consequently, the trade deficit which reached 17.3% of GDP in 2008 narrowed
      significantly to 8.6% of GDP in 2009. Similarly, the current account deficit fell from USD3.5
      billion (or 10.9% of GDP) in 2008 to USD1.6 billion (or 3.0% of GDP) in 2009.

      Medium Term Economic Policies

15.   The main challenges facing Ghanas macroeconomic objectives are the labour market and public
      sector wages, job creation constraints, infrastructure deficits, and the burden of arrears. Further
      development challenges and fiscal risks relate to the poor performance of the state owned
      enterprises, achieving sustainable debt-management, improving governance, reducing the
      incidence of corruption and addressing the weaknesses of the countrys mineral laws and mining
      agreements.

16.   Going forward, the Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda (GSGDA) will be
      governments medium term blue print for addressing the challenges stated above and reforming
      the economy for accelerated growth. It outlines the development policies and strategies that will
      guide the management of the economy between 2010 and 2013.

17.   In the medium-term, the strategic direction of government will be to lay the foundation for the
      structural transformation of the economy within the decade ending 2020, through industrialization
      especially manufacturing, based on modernized agriculture and sustainable exploitation of
      Ghanas natural resources, particularly minerals, oil and gas. The process will be underpinned by
      rapid infrastructural and human development as well as the application of science, technology and
      innovation.

18.   In this regard, expenditure will be prioritized in favour of policies, programmes and projects in the
      following areas: agriculture, infrastructure (including energy, oil and gas), water and sanitation,
      health and education (including ICT, Science, Technology and Innovation). The strategy will also
      entail improved enabling environment to empower the private sector; active collaboration between
      the public and private sectors, including public-private partnerships and civil society
      organizations; active government interventions where appropriate; transparent and accountable
      governance and efficiency in public service delivery at all levels; and effective decentralization for
      enhanced local economic development.


                                              - 58 -
19.      Within this context, the thematic areas of the GSGDA will be as follows:

         Ensuring and sustaining macroeconomic stability;
         Enhanced competitiveness of Ghanas private sector;
         Accelerated agricultural modernization and natural resource management;
         Oil and gas development;
         Infrastructure and human settlements development;
         Human development, employment and productivity; and
         Transparent and accountable governance.


         MACROECONOMIC TARGETS AND MEASURES FOR 2010 AND 2011

20.      In 2010 and towards the medium term, the strategy is to consolidate macroeconomic stability to
         lay the foundation for the structural transformation of the economy. For 2011 in particular and the
         medium term in general, Government is committed to continuing the fiscal consolidation that it
         began in 2009 by further reducing the fiscal deficit from the projected 5.6% in 2010 to 4.1% in
         2011 and 2.6% in 2012 and 2013. Additionally government is intent on tackling outstanding issues
         in public financial management, the scope of subsidies to state-owned enterprises (particularly the
         utility companies, public sector reforms with emphasis on the new pay policy and the
         rationalization, divestiture or commercialization of subvented agencies.

21.      The key measure to achieve the fiscal targets include: reforms in public financial management;
         improvement in tax collection; review of the import duty exemption regime; widening the tax net;
         rationalization of recurrent expenditures; restraining expenditures through public sector pay
         reform; and, addressing the threat of high debt burden.

         Agriculture

22.      Agriculture is Ghanas greatest strength and will remain so in spite of the recent discovery of oil in
         commercial quantities. Government remains committed to developing the agricultural sector with
         the oil and gas sector serving as a linkage with other sectors of the economy to generate resources
         that can be used for a rapid development of national infrastructure. The linkage will increase
         agricultural productivity for a paradigm shift in the structure of the economy toward increased
         industrial value- added production, accelerating job creation and facilitating the building of
         national capacity to harness advanced technologies.

23.      Governments agriculture development strategy for the 2010 and the medium term is based on the
         knowledge that agriculture has significant potential to grow beyond the levels experienced in
         recent years. High agriculture growth can only materialize through modernization and
         diversification, driven by public-private investment and increase in productivity. The major focus
         of the agricultural policy in the medium term are to use science, technology and innovations to
         accelerate agriculture modernization to increase agricultural productivity, enhance food security,
         create employment opportunities and improve income levels, strengthen linkages between
         agriculture and industry; and reduce risk in agriculture production and marketing. Over the
         medium term the agriculture sector is projected to grow at an annual average of 6.6%.

24.      To achieve these strategic objectives, government intends to accelerate the use of agriculture
         mechanization by establishing Agricultural Mechanization and Service Centres (AMSEC),
         equipment lease schemes, and collaborate with the private sector to build manufacturing
         companies to produce affordable agriculture machinery and implements. Government intends to
         pilot commercial agricultural schemes across the country by collaborating with key stakeholders
         involved in agriculture development committees.




                                                 - 59 -
25.   Government will also support the improvement of application of modern science and technology
      in agriculture by strengthening the Research Extension-Farmer Linkages Committees (RELCs)
      while promoting the collaboration between research institutions (locally and abroad). In the
      medium term, to mitigate the effects of unreliable rainfall and reduce the risks in agriculture
      production and marketing, government will promote the development of appropriate irrigation
      schemes such as dams, and dug-outs; promote the use of early warning meteorological
      information systems at the district level; and minimize post-harvest losses by providing silos.
      Agricultural financing will be promoted by establishing an agricultural development fund and
      provide incentives to financial institutions to ensure adequate flow of financial resources to the
      agriculture sector.

26.   The unattractive nature of the current farm practices is a significant factor to rural poverty and
      rural-urban migration. To address this situation Government will continue to pursue the Youth in
      Agriculture Programme in the areas of block farming, livestock, fisheries and agribusiness
      development to increase production of crops, livestock and fish as well as generate employment
      opportunities for the youth.

      Private Sector Competitiveness

27.   The GSGDA seeks to systematically address the structural constraints at the policy and
      institutional levels that hamper private sector competitiveness. Governments agenda in 2010 and
      the medium term is the continuation of the implementation of the Private Sector Development
      Strategy II (PSDS II) with emphasis on the following: improving the investment climate; reducing
      the costs and risks of doing business; providing modern, efficient and competitive infrastructure;
      creating the financial sector which is responsive to the private sector demands and making
      available human resources with relevant skill and competences.

28.   A significant amount of governments resources and time in the medium term will be geared
      toward developing and implementing training programmes for key decision makers and policy
      formulators in government on the role of the private sector in the country. This is meant to
      enhance the capacity of the public sector to make effective pro-private and pro-market decisions to
      support private sector development.

29.   Government will continue with initiatives to enhance competences and capacity at the firm level.
      This will include the provision of business support and training, extension of micro-credit, venture
      capital and export credit facilities to businesses. Additionally, government will also complete and
      launch an industrial policy which will focus amongst others the development of small, medium
      and micro-enterprises that would ensure that Ghanaian entrepreneurs perform to the best of their
      abilities.


      RESTORING BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE

      Public Financial Management

30.   The main strategies to be used include the continued enforcement of fiscal discipline,
      improvement in revenue generation and improvement in budget execution measures.

31.   As part of its resolve to strengthen fiscal management, Government intends to implement a
      strategic plan aimed at strengthening revenue collection and transparency in revenue
      administration. This will enhance efficiency, comprehensiveness, and transparency of revenue
      administration in the near term. In this respect, the Government plans to adopt the Ghana Revenue
      Authority (GRA) institutional and organizational structure evaluation report, develop and adopt
      selection criteria for segmentation and allocation of taxpayers to large, medium and small
      taxpayers offices.




                                             - 60 -
32.   Other steps include the setting up of the Transit Monitoring Unit by the Custom Excise and
      Preventive Service (CEPS) to prevent the diversion of transit goods back into the country; the
      improved revenue administration within Internal Revenue Service (IRS), including the
      introduction of computerized systems and expanding the special tax audit of companies to cover
      some medium and small scale businesses in the informal sector; and the continuing registration of
      retailers and intensified public education on the VAT Flat Rate Scheme in VATS.

33.   To improve its capacity for budget monitoring and control, the Government has taken concrete
      steps to develop the Ghana Integrated Financial Management Information System (GIFMIS) over
      the period 2010-14. To this end, government had, in 2009, approved a PFM Improvement Charter
      called the GIFMIS Charter; that calls for the reinvigoration of a country-wide budget management
      system that is premised on the need to capture all public finances at the centre and across all local
      governments; a single, unified chart of accounts and budget classification (for budgeting,
      accounting, and reporting) that is compliant with IMF GFSM2001; developing and implementing
      re-engineered business processes that are best practice; integration of applications, including
      personnel management and payroll database, on a single IT-based platform; accommodating the
      applicable principles and practices of robust commitment accounting; and the need to consolidate
      the reporting of all government finances.

34.   Government has established a basic process of an efficient cash management system for the
      Government of Ghana consolidated funds. Upon eventual transitioning to the GIFMIS in 2011,
      the full implementation of the monthly cash management system all anchored on Treasury Single
      Account mechanism will enhance the predictability of expenditure commitments across MDAs;
      assist to more reliably account for, and reduce the potential for building up a, stock of expenditure
      arrears. The development of a harmonized chart of accounts for budgeting, accounting and
      reporting for all MDAs will ensure that the reporting of the budget implementation is consistent
      with the budget itself and also ensure the comprehensiveness of reporting on the Government
      fiscal position.

35.   Government has prepared a harmonized chart of accounts for budgeting, accounting and
      reporting for all its ministries, departments and agencies. The single harmonized chart of
      account will allow for aggregation and disaggregation of expenditures in the budget across the
      whole of government; and adopt the functional and economic classifications needed for proper
      expenditure review. Following from this, Government intends to start producing and publishing
      Budget and monthly statements of the public accounts based on the harmonized Chart of Account.

36.   To be able to check the consistency of MDAs commitments with their cash plans, Government
      has established the basic process of compiling claims and outstanding payment system. By
      doing so, Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MOFEP) is able to contain the potential
      for arrears accumulation. Towards this objective, the Government is also implementing a
      ,,contract database to allow for a ready flow of information relating to expenditure commitment
      and arising obligations in order to reduce the potentials for accumulation of arrears. Government
      through the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, and the Controller and Account
      General will reinstate and enforce commitment controls for all MDAs, such that, no new
      arrears over their budget accrue through uncontrolled spending on Items 3 and 4.

37.   Government also intends to address the consequences of public arrears on the financial sector and
      institute an improved regulatory and supervision regime in view of the structural changes the
      sector has undergone in recent years. Acknowledging their negative impact on banks
      vulnerabilities, Government through its Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, will
      develop and submit to Cabinet for decision the second Financial Sector Strategic Plan
      (FINSEP II). The FINSEP II which is built on lessons learnt from FINSEP I will define actions
      required in structuring the sector to accompany and strengthen on-going macroeconomic and
      financial stabilization efforts.




                                              - 61 -
38.   Substantial gains have been made in Public Financial Management (PFM) reforms in the recent
      years. Ghana continues to gear itself to building a strong foundation towards achieving aggregate
      fiscal discipline, based on positive developments in the following areas: prevalent low levels of
      unreported extra-budgetary expenditures; good and timely public access to key fiscal information;
      adherence to a fixed and coherent budget calendar; high average debt collection ratios for tax
      arrears and regular and timely revenue transfers to the Consolidated Fund; comprehensive
      recording and reconciliation of debt service and on the debt portfolio; predictable budget support
      disbursements; timely in-year budget implementation reports and annual financial reports on the
      Consolidated Fund; and improved effectiveness and timely external audit scrutiny.

39.   Other salient improvements registered include broadened budget coverage and widened
      information on internally generated funds and external grants, including HIPC and MDRI grants,
      and submission by the Auditor General, of external audit reports to Parliament within 3 months of
      receipt of the draft accounts from the Controller and Accountant General Department (CAGD).
      This has led to a more proactive and transparent oversight of public finances by the Parliamentary
      Public Accounts Committee.

40.   There has also been progress in implementing the Public Procurement Law, with increased
      coverage provided by the entity tender committees and the Tender Review Boards. Also, under the
      auspices of the new Internal Audit Agency Law, the number of government Ministries,
      Departments and Agencies that submitted internal audit reports has risen substantially.


      TACKLING LONG-STANDING PUBLIC SECTOR AND ENERGY ISSUES

      Energy

41.   Structural progress in the energy sector has contributed significantly to macro-economic
      stabilization. Reforms in the sector are also underway to prepare the legal and revenue framework
      for oil production. Both the Petroleum Exploration Bill and the Revenue Management Bill have
      been laid in Parliament, awaiting passage. Furthermore, an amendment to the Income Tax Law to
      create a Petroleum Income Tax Law is to be submitted to Cabinet for approval to regulate the
      Petroleum Tax Regime.

42.   Furthermore, steps are been taken to tackle the under-pricing of energy products, including
      through the recent significant increase in power tariffs and by repaying the accumulated debt of
      the Tema Oil Refinery (TOR).

43.   There was some relief to the financial crisis of the power sector in 2009, as a result of good
      rainfall that enabled a big rise in hydroelectric production, and the decline in world oil prices
      which lowered costs of thermal generation. Thus, the Utility Companies broadly managed to cover
      their operational costs, while the Government repaid part of its accumulated liabilities to the sector
      (GH¢350 million, or 1.6 percent of GDP). It is in this context that the Government, through its
      power utility companies, has commenced implementing recommendations of the electricity
      financial recovery plan. The objective of this plan, which benefited from stakeholders
      consultation, is to restore financial viability to the three power utilities, improve their commercial
      and operational performance and put an end to their dependence on the state budget. The plan, put
      before Cabinet in March 2010, foresaw various options to consider, depending on the ruling of the
      independent Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC) on tariff adjustments, as well as
      prospects to receive gas from Nigeria through the West African Gas Pipeline (WAGP).

44.   Government remains committed to continuing with the implementation of the Power Sector
      Reforms. As a result, Government, through it Ministry of Energy submitted to cabinet the
      Financial Recovery Plan which was subsequently approved. The Public Utilities and Regulatory
      Commission (PURC) announced electricity tariffs increases effective 1 st June 2010, being an
      average tariff, weighted by 2009 levels, of 58% to cover operating costs. This has greatly



                                              - 62 -
      improved the financial performance of the utilities, whiles the needed financing is sought to fund
      new investments for plant refurbishment.

45.   The PURC is committed to re-introducing the Automatic Tariff Adjustment Mechanism by the
      first quarter of 2011. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority will establish and implement
      an electricity automatic tariff adjustment mechanism, with a view to avoid large and
      politically difficult tariff adjustments, while providing greater financial predictability to utilities.
      As a result, it is expected that utilities will not need any more to occasionally rely on public
      subsidies to run their operations, but for the social subsidies embedded in the life line program.
      Such a move will also reduce the oil-related budget volatility through utilities subsidies, and will
      thus strengthen stabilization objectives set forth in the Oil Revenue Management bill.

46.   In the medium term, and as part of the implementation of the Financial Recovery Plan, the Utility
      Companies involved have initiated their corporate governance procedures to give effect to the
      remaining part of the Financial Recovery Plan such as the scale of Assets and Debt Forgiveness.

47.   Government acknowledges that there are major contingent liabilities in the petroleum products
      distribution sector, because the Tema Oil Refinery and Bulk Oil Storage and Transport Co. Ltd
      (both SOEs) built up substantial short-term debts in both local and foreign currency to banks and
      crude oil suppliers in 2008. These debts, arising from past under-recovery of rising oil costs from
      motorists, cannot be paid off in the short-term and need to be refinanced. In 2010, government
      settled part of the TOR debt through a GH¢445 million (1.8% of GDP) equity injection, which
      allowed the refinery to settle part of its debt with Ghana Commercial Bank, and obtain the credit
      lines needed to resume partial operations. Government through its Ministries of Energy and
      Finance and Economic Planning will submit to Cabinet for decision an action plan regarding
      the restoration of Tema Oil Refinery financial sustainability, for decision, based on technical
      and financial review of refining and distribution of petroleum products.

      Public Sector Reform

48.   Government, through its Public Sector Reform Secretariat (PSRS) located in the Office of the
      President, is adopting a new approach based on lessons learned from over two decades of public
      sector reform in Ghana. This new approach will be the overarching strategy for public sector
      reform and is expected to answer the question "reform for what?" A draft of the strategy has been
      presented to a Cabinet sub-committee for consideration.

49.   A new Single Spine Pay Structure (SSPS) has been developed to address inequities in the public
      sector that requires careful analysis and a sequenced approach to implementation. Implementation
      began in July 2010 and Government is committed to ensuring that the cost of the SSPP does not
      disrupt macroeconomic stability. Thus, the fiscal cost has been phased out in a "pyramid manner,
      such that as the outer years of implementation are approached, more resources will be made
      available to public workers until the pay policy is fully implemented in the fifth year".

50.   The Government is committed to improving the performance of public assets and institutions. On
      the way to improve the performance of public assets and institutions, the Government has
      completed a definitive roll of Subvented Agencies, and a categorization of said agencies as
      follows: (a) the Subvented Agencies that would stay on government subvention for the
      foreseeable future; and (b) the Subvented Agencies that would be analysed for a decision
      regarding their closure, withdrawal from government subvention, partial
      commercialization, or full commercialization. The review and classification of Subvented
      Agencies according to their relevance with respect to the GSGDA will form the basis for
      Government through the Ministry of finance and Economic Planning and the Public Sector
      Reform Secretariat, to develop and submit to Cabinet for decision and announcement the
      Action Plan on Subvented Agency Reform ( i.e. decisions on those for closure, withdrawal of
      subvention, those on reduced subvention and timelines for implementation).




                                               - 63 -
51.   Government has already completed 3 pilot processes of voluntary redundancy in the Ghana
      Standards Board, the Ghana National Procurement Agency and the Ghana International Trade
      Fair. It has begun the process for two others; the Ghana Regional Appropriate Technology
      Industrial Service and the Management Development and Productivity Institute for voluntary
      redundancy. The management of these pilots is providing useful lessons to guide future voluntary
      severance packages.

52.   Government is keen on reviewing the decentralization process. Government is seriously
      committed to the decentralization agenda. It has begun a nation-wide consultation process under
      the direction of the Minister of Local Government and Rural Development to collate views from
      stakeholders. A series of regional fora have been organized in all regional capitals. In addition,
      consultations have been held with Parliamentary Committees on Local Government and
      Subsidiary Legislation, Civil Society Groups and Traditional Authorities. The consultations will
      be concluded at the national level before end 2010. The issues cut across political, administrative
      and fiscal decentralization.

53.   Government, through the Ministries of Local Government and Rural Development and
      Finance and Economic Planning, finalized the Comprehensive decentralization Policy
      following all consultations, and has submitted the Policy and Implementation Plan to
      Cabinet for approval. The plan details a series of activities to be undertaken over four years to
      implement the policy framework. High on the agenda is the devolution of basic functions to local
      governments and the operationalization of the Local Government Service. It is anticipated that
      about 30,000 civil servants would be moved to the local government service.

54.   Government intends to adopt a new Bill on the Civil Service to replace the existing Civil Service
      Act that was enacted by Parliament in 1993. The Bill on the Civil Service seeks to take into
      consideration the decentralization policy of Government and delink implementation of polices to
      the decentralized system. It would restructure the centre of government, changing its role by
      introducing a policy on service delivery and reduce the size of central government to around
      10,000 staff.

55.   Additionally government intends to devolve service delivery functions, staff and resources to local
      government from line ministries by merging de-concentrated ministry staff and functions with
      sub-national government staff and functions; require full introduction of the new
      intergovernmental fiscal architecture and change the functions of the centre of government to
      policy formulation, standard setting, monitoring and evaluation functions.


      HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTIVITY AND EMPLOYMENT

56.   Human development continues to be the underlying priority of Ghanas development agenda. As
      stated in the GSGDA, the main aim of human resource development is to ensure the development
      of knowledgeable, well-trained and disciplined labour force. This is expected to transform the key
      sectors of the economy, raise living standards and productivity, and serve as the basis of wealth
      creation. This thematic area addresses issues in the education sector; human resource
      development, productivity and employment; health promotion including HIV/AIDS and STDs;
      population management, including migration and development; youth and sports development;
      poverty reduction and social protection.

      Health

57.   The health status of Ghanaians has improved over the years. In 2009, the holistic assessment of
      the health sector showed overall satisfactory performance. Such a performance is also measured
      by the comparison of the last two demographic and health surveys in 2003 and 2008. The progress
      achieved over this period is impressive: under-5 children mortality was reduced from 111 deaths



                                             - 64 -
      per 1,000 births to 80, the proportion of malnourished under-5 children was reduced from 18 to 14
      percent, and the proportion of medically assisted deliveries went up from 47 to 59 percent. HIV
      prevalence also declined from 2.7 to 2.2 percent of the population between 2005 and 2008.

58.   Health progress results to a large extent from the creation and continued increase in coverage
      under the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), reaching 13.8 million people by June 2009
      about 60% of the population. Pro-poor progress during the 2007-08 food and fuel crisis was
      supported by public subsidies that paid some of the insurance premium due by the poor.

59.   These successes notwithstanding there are persistent policy-related issues that need to be
      addressed to meet equity gaps in access to health and other targets outlined in the GSGDA and to
      meet the MDG targets on health. The key policy objectives to be used include bridging gaps in
      access to health care and nutrition services; improving governance and strengthening efficiency in
      health service delivery; improving governance and strengthening efficiency in health service
      delivery; improving access to quality maternal and child health services; intensifying prevention
      and control; of non-communicable and communicable diseases such as malaria, HIV and AIDS
      and strengthening mental health delivery.

      Education

60.   In line with the Education Sector Development Strategy adopted in 2003, progress in terms of
      access to primary education has been significant. Gross primary enrolment rates went up from 86
      to 95 percent between 2003/4 and 2008/9, while net primary enrolment rates went up from 56 to
      88 percent over the same period. Over the years, increased efforts at building new schools in
      deprived districts, and increased attention to gender parity, have allowed for an extension of
      progress in access to primary education by vulnerable populations. The demand side was
      supported with the initiation of a school feeding program in poor regions, and by the development
      of conditional transfers in the context of the LEAP program.

61.   Government recognizes that it needs to do more to improve access, financing and the provision of
      infrastructure and facilities at all levels, and that education quality issues remain a matter of
      national concern. In responding to these sector challenges, priority policy strategies for the
      medium term have been proposed which when implemented, will promote the achievement of
      structural poverty reduction, facilitate the attainment of the Education For All (EFA) goals and the
      Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to propel Ghana towards attaining middle-income status,
      with emphasis on addressing quality issues in education. The key policy intervention will include
      increase in equity and access to and participation in quality at all levels; improve quality of
      teaching and learning; bridging gender gaps in access to education; improve access to quality
      education for persons with disability and promote science and technical education at all levels.
      Government therefore emphasizes its commitment to stimulate skills and technology based
      development in key economic sectors through demand driven improvements in quality of formal
      and informal training, development and adoption of new technologies.


      PROTECTING THE POOR

      Social Protection

62.   The impact of the current macroeconomic difficulties in Ghana comes at a time when many of the
      poor have not yet recovered from the impact of a series of shocks, starting with floods and drought
      in the North during 2007, and to the food and fuel crisis during 2008. With limited fiscal resource,
      improving social protection mechanisms and resource allocation to pro-poor sectors, becomes
      even more critical to protect vulnerable households from falling into poverty traps.

63.   In 2009, pro-poor public expenditures were protected, in spite of the strong public expenditure
      contraction. Although declining in proportion of GDP compared with 2008 (8.5 against 9.1



                                             - 65 -
      percent of GDP), pro-poor expenditures were protected in 2009 in relation to total public
      expenditures (excluding donor-financed capital expenditures), at 28.2 percent, exceeding both the
      end-year target (26.0 percent) and the achievement of 2008 (24.6 percent). In 2009, the
      Government also reviewed its classification of pro-poor expenditures, and concluded to the need
      to maintain it, for the sake of time consistency. The review allowed the identification of gaps and
      shortcoming in the reporting and computation of pro-poor expenditures, which were both
      corrected. As for 2010, the Government intends to raise the share of pro-poor expenditures in total
      Government expenditures and in GDP.

64.   The Livelihood and Empowerment against Poverty (LEAP) program has also been extended. By
      April 2010, there were about 35,000 households registered as LEAP regular beneficiaries and
      receiving cash subsidies accordingly, against 8,000 by end-2008. By end 2010, the Government
      intends to ensure that fifty five thousand (55,000) regular LEAP eligible households receiving the
      cash subsidies. The LEAP program is vertically well targeted (reaches poor households in areas it
      works), with an estimated 57 percent share of outlays reaching the poor.

65.   Government is pursuing measures aimed at undertaking policy and institutional reforms to
      strengthen existing social protection mechanisms. These measures are being carried out under the
      coordination of the National Social Protection Strategy (NSPS) which was published in March
      2007 with the goal of "providing policy direction in the protection of persons living in situations
      of extreme poverty, vulnerability and exclusion from both expected and unexpected threats to their
      livelihoods, with a view to making them effective participants in the socio-economic development
      of the country." Government intends to ensure that a multi-sectoral National Social Protection
      Steering Committee is established and operational by end 2010, with a view to develop effective
      coordination across relevant MDAs and promote a common approach to targeting.

66.   In 2010, the Government, through its Ministries of Employment & Social Welfare,
      Education, Health and Local Government & Rural Development, has agreed on assignment
      of institutional responsibilities, budget, detail objectives, action plan and timeline for the
      adoption and use of a common targeting mechanism for the Livelihood Empowerment
      Against Poverty (LEAP), National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) & School Uniform
      Programme. The mechanism will be based on proxy means test (PMT), and is foreseen as a
      decisive step towards a common approach including a national single register. Moving forward,
      Government through the Ministry of Employment and Social Welfare will pre-test and
      validate the Common Targeting mechanism for application of LEAP, NHIS indigent and
      School uniform programmes in pilot areas. Once validated the mechanism will be expanded
      nationwide.

67.   Government has initiated an assessment of the beneficiary incidence, targeting efficiency, cost
      effectiveness, impact, and fiscal affordability of a number of social protection programs.
      Specifically, the Government is undertaking an issues paper with a view to making informed
      decisions about how to better coordinate and target public policy in this area. The assessment will
      include a review of the LEAP, the School Feeding Program, exemptions under the National Health
      Insurance Scheme, the National Youth Employment Program, the electricity lifeline, petroleum
      and food products subsidies, and fertilizers subsidies.


      PREPARING FOR THE OIL ERA

      Regulatory Framework

68.   In July 2010, the Government submitted a Petroleum Revenue Management Bill to the
      Cabinet based on broad consultations with stakeholders. The Bill was subsequently adopted by
      Cabinet and submitted to Parliament for an expected rapid enactment before first oil. When
      passed, the new law will tighten existing legal framework to effectively address challenges of the
      Petroleum Upstream Sector.



                                             - 66 -
69.   Government effort in the sector is now focused on developing a regulatory framework to
      encourage sound and sustainable development of the oil and gas industry. Initial stakeholders
      consultations held in 2010 on the oil and gas regulatory framework raised fundamental issues of
      ownership, participation and control, roles, responsibilities and accountability, legitimacy and
      capacity of institutions that underpin effective performance of such a green field sector in the
      Ghanaian economy. Consultations suggested in particular that more time and attention should be
      devoted to reaching a consensus on the key features of the proposed new Ghana Petroleum
      Regulatory Authority, including the scope of responsibility of the regulator (one mega regulator
      for all utilities, or several small specialized regulators); and the local content aspects.

70.   The resonance of these issues was amplified by the difficulties faced by a major international oil
      company to acquire shares in the Jubilee field consortium. Ongoing dialogue with authorities, as
      part of this proposed operation and through the EITI++ scoping mission carried out in parallel also
      helped clarify what is needed to establish a sound and effective regulatory framework for oil and
      gas in Ghana. Discussions also underlined the urgent need for a major capacity building program
      to endow the Government with the skills needed to oversee ad regulate the nascent oil and gas
      industry, to which the World Bank responded positively along with US, and Norway.

71.   Transparency and accountability provisions in the Petroleum Revenue Management Bill will be
      complemented with the extension of EITI principles to the oil and gas sectors. In June 2010, the
      Government prepared and submitted to Cabinet for decision a revised Extractive Industries
      Transparency Initiative (EITI) institutional framework to include the oil and gas sectors.
      Cabinet subsequently adopted the revised framework, which should improve transparency and
      accountability on payments made by oil companies to Government and revenues the Government
      receives from oil companies through independent auditing. The extension to new sectors also
      required extending the Ghana EITI steering committee to the Ministry of Energy, GNPC, oil
      companies, CSO and districts assemblies representatives from the oil finds areas, learning from
      the performance of the mining sector in terms of addressing potential governance vulnerabilities
      along the chain of actions entailed from deciding to extract the resource to using it for the
      sustainable development of the country. Ghana has strongly committed itself to learn from the
      lessons of other countries where oil has proved a curse, rather than a blessing, and ensure that it
      receives the maximum benefits from these sectors, and does so in a transparent as well as an
      environmentally and socially sustainable manner. Moving forward, the Government intends to
      ensure the EITI framework becomes legally binding.

72.   As a result of these consultations, a decision was made to sequence the effort to build a regulatory
      framework into two legal building blocks: (i) amend the existing petroleum exploration and
      production legislation; and (ii) pass the legislation to establish the new Petroleum Regulatory
      Authority. Thus, the Government, through the Petroleum Exploration and Production bill
      submitted to Parliament in July 2010, proposes to revise the existing legislation providing for
      creation of a petroleum regulatory authority with statutory powers covering certain aspects of
      regulation and intends through the Ministry of Energy to submit to Cabinet for decision a
      policy proposal establishing a petroleum regulatory authority. In the meantime, the revised
      exploration and production bill stipulates that regulatory responsibilities be with the Minister of
      Energy.


      EITI

73.   In support of the EITI principles Government interventions would seek to enhance international
      and regional cooperation in the mining industry and actively promote the countrys involvement in
      the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and further extend it to the oil and gas
      sector. Government is currently reviewing the legal framework on mining with special emphasis
      on the fiscal regime to ensure that the state and mining communities derive maximum benefits
      from the countrys mineral resources. This should ultimately provide fiscal and related incentives



                                             - 67 -
      that would encourage value addition downstream in mining activities such as refining and
      smelting.

74.   Weak institutional and regulatory frameworks for natural resource management and environmental
      governance compromise the nations ability to effectively manage its natural resources. The policy
      and the relevant regulatory framework for effective co-ordination among key government agencies
      to improve the performance of the mining sector would be enhanced. Government will in the
      medium-term strengthen and enforce existing environmental laws and regulations including the
      passage of regulations under the current Minerals and Mining Act 2006 (Act 703). The
      formulation of a National Mining Policy would be accelerated and the Minerals Development
      Fund would be reviewed to address concerns of communities, chiefs and District Assemblies on
      percentage of royalty allocations.

75.   Additionally government is initiating far-reaching reforms in accounting for extractive industry
      receipts which includes reinvigorating in 2010 the public accounts committee of Parliament.

      Aid Policy

76.   Despite efforts towards better aid coordination and dialogue on the part of both Government and
      Development Partners, a number of challenges remain. These continue to limit the efficiency and
      effectiveness with which aid is delivered, and weaken Ghanas case for the scaling-up of aid in the
      short to medium term. These challenges, which can partly be attributed to the absence of an aid
      policy, include: difficulties in operationalizing development priorities and aligning aid; the limited
      use of country systems in aid delivery; fragmentation in sourcing and managing aid; high
      transaction costs and inadequate capacity in aid delivery; conditionality and unpredictability of
      aid; the lack of a mutual accountability framework; inadequate information on aid flows; and,
      insufficient coordination among stakeholders.

77.   Government of Ghana endorsed the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness in 2005 and the Accra
      Agenda for Action in 2008. This is to mitigate these challenges and to operationalize commitment
      to increasing the effectiveness of external assistance for improved impact and stronger
      development results. The Ghana Aid Policy and Strategy has thus been developed in response to
      strong evidence showing that recipient countries policies and procedures, human capacity,
      economic management and institutional arrangements determine to a large extent the optimal
      allocation of aid and hence its impact on growth and poverty reduction. In line with this, the
      Ghana Aid Policy and Strategy provides a coherent and consolidated framework to Government
      and its Partners with respect to aid coordination and institutional arrangements to achieve
      development results.

78.   The Ghana Aid Policy and Strategy provides guidelines and procedures the sourcing and
      utilization of aid towards the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.
      Accordingly, it is considered as phase one in governing the aid process towards ensuring Ghanas
      attainment of middle income status by 2020. The rationale for aid arises from the need to fill the
      resource gap and support the Government of Ghana in meeting its GSGDA goals. Aid has also
      contributed immensely to Ghanas efforts in pursuing sound macro-economic management,
      sustainable balance of payments and budget financing.

      Conclusion

79.   Mr. President, for the short time that our government has been in office it has taken appropriate
      measures to enhance fiscal discipline and stabilize the economy in pursuit of the countrys
      development agenda. We have laid a solid foundation to propel Ghana to a middle income country
      by 2015. We believe that with continued support from the World Bank and other development
      partners, Ghana will be able to achieve the objectives it has set out for herself. We have a tall
      order of reducing maternal mortality, eliminating extreme poverty, ensuring sustainable poverty

      reduction as well as creating the conditions necessary for prosperity in our country. The PRSC-7
      support will greatly facilitate these goals.

80.   We thank you for supporting our fledgling democracy to begin to mature and it is our hope that
      Ghana will continue to be a beacon of hope in Sub-Saharan Africa.

           Annex 6: Framework Memorandum between the Government of Ghana and
                                 Development Partners

                     MULTI-DONOR BUDGETARY SUPPORT PROGRAMME
                                     19 May, 2008

1. PREAMBLE


1.1. This Framework Memorandum (FM) describes the common framework for the
implementation of grant and loan agreements through the Multi-Donor Budget Support
Programme (MDBS) to support the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS 11)66. This
FM replaces the previous one between the Government of Ghana (GoG) and Development
Partners (DPs) signed in Accra on 30 June 2003.

1.2. This FM will be supplemented by individual arrangements between each
individual DP and the GoG. The contents in the individual funding arrangements take
precedence over this FM. However, DPs will establish funding arrangements that are
compatible with the spirit and provision of this FM.

1.3.  This FM does not constitute an international treaty and is not intended to create legal
commitments.

1.4.    Amendments to this FM can be made by way of an exchange of letters in terms accepted
by all DPs involved in the MDBS and the GoG.

1.5. When implementing this FM, the signatories endeavour to follow international
recommendations and best practices as regards budget support.

2. INTRODUCTION

2.1. The GoG and DPs consider the FM for MDBS as the common basis for support to the
implementation of GPRS II through the GoG's budget.

2.2. MDBS is open to other DPs who might wish to participate. The decision to
participate does not imply that all participating DPs will be providing resources in any given
year. However, it does imply that the spirit of this arrangement will be respected. MDBS
currently includes the African Development Bank, Canada, Denmark, the European
Commission, France, Germany, Japan, The Netherlands, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the
World Bank.

2.3.       The objectives of MDBS are:

66
     Our subsequent national Poverty Reduction Strategies


                                                     - 97 -
       to provide additional and more predictable budgetary resources to implement GPRS II
       and finance fiscal actions aimed at reducing poverty, reaching the Millennium
       Development Goals (MDGs) and promoting growth;
       to increase aid effectiveness by harmonising DPs' policies and procedures, by
       minimising transaction costs and by fostering ownership, alignment, management for
       results and mutual accountability;
       to enhance the performance and accountability of the GoG's public financial
       management (PFM) systems;
       to facilitate the strengthening of institutional capacity for designing and executing
       development policies;
       to promote an accelerated implementation of policy reforms and an enhanced
       performance in service delivery in order to reach development objectives;
       to foster domestic accountability and transparency.


3. UNDERLING PRINCIPLE


3.1.    The GoG and DPs, to the extent compatible with their statutory mandates, consider
the following to be the underlying principles of MDBS for this FM:

       Continuing sound macroeconomic policies and management;
       Commitment to achieving the GPRS II objectives and MDGs;
       Sound budgeting and PFM systems;
       Continuing peace and respect for human rights, the rule of law, democratic
       principles, and the independence of the judiciary;
       Good governance, accountability of the GoG to the citizenry, and integrity in public
       life, including the active fight against corruption;
       Observance of the underlying principles is considered critical for the implementation of
       this FM.

4. PROGRESS ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK

4.1    A set of growth and poverty reduction objectives, development indicators and policy
reform measures, drawn from the GPRS II, is mutually accepted by GoG and DPs as the Progress
Assessment Framework (PAF) and will be used by all signatories of this FM.

4.2    These development indicators and policy reform measures are referred to in this
document as 'targets'. Targets will be result-oriented, time-bound, specific, measurable, realistic,
within the power of the GoG to achieve, and limited in number. The GoG and DPs will decide
on the means of verification of the targets, including the necessary documentation. The
achievement of a subset of the targets, hereafter called "triggers", will determine the extent to


                                             - 98 -
which the single component or the performance component is disbursed (see chapter 6).

4.3     DPs and GoG operate a multi-annual rolling PAF. The PAF is named by the year in
which policy actions or indicators that are subject to assessment in the subsequent year are
referring to. For example, if policy actions or indicators are to be taken or achieved in 'Yearn',
the PAF will be called 'PAF n'. PAF targets for the outer years will be indicative.

4.4    DPs and GoG will endeavour to ensure complementarity and coordination between
MDBS and sector budget support arrangements. While recognizing that these constitute distinct
processes, the arrangements should be seen as mutually supportive. The MDBS policy
dialogue will add value to and will be informed by policy dialogues at the sector level,
including major policy objectives and issues of crosscutting nature or with significant
macroeconomic and budgetary implications.

5. DIALOGUE AND REVIEW PROCESS

5.1. The signatories have committed to coordinate reporting, dialogue and review missions.
Regular dialogue among the signatories to the FM is essential for continued commitment to the
MDBS.

5.2. The review process for MDBS will be common for all DPs. Participants will meet on a
decided schedule, aligned with the review process of the GPRS II and the budget cycle. The
review will be organised and chaired by the Ministry of Finance & Economic Planning
(MOFEP), and include representatives of the GoG and the MDBS partners (including
observers). Representatives from Parliament may be invited by the GoG to participate or
observe the review.

5.3. The review process will be guided by the work of sector groups, including the
conclusions from existing sector-level reviews. It will use information gathered through these
and other ongoing processes to ensure that DPs do not set up duplicative reviews. It will
endeavour to minimise additional work.

5.4.   The review will include an assessment of overall progress in implementing the GPRS II,
including macroeconomic performance, as well as progress against the PAF.

5.5. The overall progress in implementing the GPRS II will be assessed on the basis of the
Annual Progress Report and other existing central documents. The assessment of
satisfactory macroeconomic performance will be guided by an IMF instrument or
arrangement. If the GoG is broadly on track in both areas, this 'holistic assessment' will be
considered to be positive.

5.6. In addition, the documentation for the review will include, amongst others, regular
reports on budget execution and poverty-reducing expenditures; existing PFM reviews,
including a selected-flows audit; the annual budget statement, and the agreed
documentary evidence for progress achieved in the PAF.

5.7. In order to ensure a fully informed review, the GoG will submit any outstanding
documentation to DPs prior to the review.


                                            - 99 -
5.8. The GoG and DPs endeavour to have joint and regular communication with external
stakeholders at key stages in the MDBS dialogue, including dissemination of the final PAF and
outcomes of the annual review.

6.     DISBURSEMENT MECHANISM

6.1. The DPs' contribution consists of either a single component or two components (a
base and a performance component) each year. Decisions on the number of components and
the ratio between components will be left to the discretion of each DP.

6.2. The decision on the disbursement of the base component will be based on a positive
holistic assessment (see paragraph 5.4). Neither the base nor the performance component will be
disbursed if the holistic assessment is deemed unsatisfactory.

6.3. Progress against the triggers will determine the extent to which the single component
or the performance component is disbursed. When reviewing progress against the triggers,
DPs may take account of the extent to which the trigger was achieved, the GoG's effort to
achieve the trigger, any developments outside the control of the GoG that may have affected
progress, and other key developments in the sector.

6.4. Disbursement decisions will be left to the discretion of each individual DP; however,
DPs will try to reach a joint position.

6.5. In order to increase predictability and alignment with the budget cycle, DPs commit
to give the GoG advance notice of the indicative MDBS funding for the following year, the
amount of which will be announced directly following the completion of the respective PAF
assessment and in time to inform the GoG's formulation of the following year's budget. At the
same time, DPs commit to provide GoG with planned figures for their disbursements in the
outer years. The disbursement of both components will ideally be made in the first four
months of the following fiscal year.

6.6. Installments will be deposited in a convertible foreign exchange account (the MDBS
Account) in the name of the Government held at the Bank of Ghana. Within 48 hours, the Bank
of Ghana will credit the Ghana Cedi equivalent (using the Central Bank (buying) exchange
rate on the date of 'purchase') to the Central Treasury Account for use as budget revenue.

6.7. The Bank of Ghana will provide documentary evidence of the amount and date of the
foreign exchange payment to the respective DP and the Ministry of Finance & Economic
Planning (MOFEP). MOFEP will acknowledge the amount and date of receipt of the Cedi
equivalent in its Central Treasury Account, in writing, to the respective DP and to the co-chairs
of the MDBS group.

7.     AUDIT

7.1.   The following audit arrangements will be established:

       The Ghana Audit Service (GAS) carries out an independent annual external audit of
       the GoG Accounts. The annual audit report by the GAS should be provided to MDBS DPs


                                           - 100 -
       as soon as it becomes available.
       Further exercises will be carried out to complement GAS' annual audit. These include
       public expenditure tracking surveys, performance audits and GAS audit of selected
       flows (with regards to the latter, MDBS development partners will continue to make
       funding available for the purpose of the annual audit of selected flows which must be
       carried out to international standards). To the extent possible, the timing and content of
       these exercises will be coordinated.

7.2.   The Audit Reports will be discussed as part of the MDBS dialogue

8.     PROCUREMENT

8.1.    The GoG will perform all procurement in accordance with national procurement rules,
guidelines and procedures.

9.     RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE GOG

9.1. The GoG, in accordance with its rules, regulations, policies, and procedures, and
subject to the availability of funds, will:

       Respect the underlying principles of this FM.
       Strengthen the monitoring and evaluation system that is used to assess progress on the
       implementation of the GPRS II.
       Implement the GPRS II and ensure that total expenditure and sector allocations
       effectively reflect the GoG's growth and poverty reduction commitment and that the
       budget is comprehensive.
       Further strengthen PFM systems and processes, including procurement and the
       Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), and continue efforts to tackle
       corruption.

10     RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DPS

10.1. To the extent possible and consistent with their internal laws, policies, procedures and
individual bilateral agreements with the GoG, DPs will:

       Improve aid effectiveness, including the facilitation of greater GoG ownership,
       harmonisation, alignment, result-orientation and mutual accountability.
       Coordinate the timing of their disbursements with the GoG's budgetary requirements.
       Work closely with the GoG to coordinate with other dialogue mechanisms and aid
       modalities.


10.2. The DPs will endeavour to follow the principles and procedures enshrined in the FM and
reflect them in their bilateral funding arrangements with GoG to the maximum extent. These
arrangements will mainly provide further details on the obligations of each participant and



                                           - 101 -
the procedures for disbursing funds together with any standard conditions for development
cooperation that the individual DP may have. The DPs will keep such g e n e r a l conditions to
a minimum.

11.    ANTI-CORRUPTION

11.1. The GoG and DPs concur that corruption undermines good governance and wastes scare
resources. The GoG and DPs intend to cooperate closely in order to ensure transparency,
accountability and probity in the use of public resources.

12.    CONSULTATION AND TERMINATION

12.1. Any differences or controversies that arise in relation to the MDBS should be settled by
means of dialogue and consultation between DPs and the GoG. The GoG and each DP will
promptly consult with the other participants whenever a DP proposes to suspend or terminate, in
whole or in part, its support to the GPRS II through MDBS.

12.2. This FM remains valid unless cancelled or replaced by a new FM

                               Annex 7: Fund's Relations Note
                   Ghana--Assessment Letter for the World Bank

                                  December 30, 2010

Introduction

This letter provides the IMF staff assessment of recent economic developments and
prospects in Ghana. It reflects discussions with the authorities during staff missions to
Accra in September and December 2010 relating to performance in 2010 under the ECF
arrangement and the governments macroeconomic policies for 2011 and the medium
term. Discussions are continuing with the government on policies that could be supported
by the Fund under the ECF arrangement with Ghana.

The ECF arrangement was approved on July 15, 2009, with access of SDR 387.45
million (105 percent of quota; about $600 million). Policies supported by the
arrangement focus on (a) fiscal consolidation to address large budget imbalances that
emerged in 2007­08; (b) reforms to budget institutions to help avoid future such
slippages; and (c) development of a policy framework for managing the transition to oil
producer status. The first review under the arrangement was delayed by discussions on
budget policies for 2010 and was completed with the second review on June 9, 2010.

Recent Macroeconomic Developments and Program Performance

Some aspects of Ghanas economic situation have improved over the past year. The start
of oil production in December 2010 was on schedule; growth appears to be recovering
robustly; gross reserve cover has been strengthened; key export prices remain high; and
with revisions to national income, Ghanas debt-GDP ratio is more closely in line with
peer countries than earlier estimated.

Ghana weathered the global financial crisis well, achieving growth of 4.7 percent in
2009, buoyed by favorable terms of trade and good rainfalls. For 2010, preliminary
indicators point to growth in the 5½-6 percent range, with a rebound in construction and
strong growth in business services. Consumer price inflation has stabilized at 9-9½
percent since June 2010, in line with the Bank of Ghanas end-2010 inflation target.

Rebased national accounts were published in late-2010 following a review of the
underlying statistical methodology by IMF advisors. The revised data included upward
revisions approaching 1 percent to recent annual growth rates, and show the 2009 level of
nominal GDP as nearly 70 percent higher than earlier estimates. With the new data, GDP
per capita was about $1,100 in 2009 (formerly around $650), bringing Ghana into the
lower middle-income country grouping. With the start of oil production in 2011, GDP per
capita is projected to exceed $1,400.




                                       - 103 -
On the new national accounts, the fiscal deficit has been revised downwards in relation to
GDP. For example, the 2008 deficit formerly recorded as 14.5 percent of GDP is now
shown as 8.5 percent of GDP. But this does not diminish the adverse economic impact of
Ghanas large deficits. The new data do not detract from the macroeconomic instability
that emerged in 2008­09 on account of large deficits, or from the risks in delaying the
move to fiscal and debt sustainability.

On the rebased accounts, the 2010 cash fiscal deficit is projected at 7.3 percent of GDP,
compared to an adjusted program target of 5.8 percent of GDP (Text Table 1).67 Revenue
collections are projected to be broadly on track by end-2010, with the deficit over-run
reflecting shortfalls in grants (0.7 percent of GDP) as well as higher than budgeted
recurrent spending (1.0 per cent of GDP). At the same time, the government is projected
to have accumulated domestic arrears equivalent to about 1.6 percent of GDP as capital
spending on roads and energy projects ran above appropriated levels.

     Cash-based fiscal deficit                 5.6          8.5         5.8        5.8              7.2

         1/ Program adjusted for loan and grant shortfalls/excesses.
         2/ Cash deficit plus new arrears accumulated, minus arrears settled.

Reflecting these trends, the deficit widened on both a cash and commitment basis in
2010, marking a setback to the authorities fiscal consolidation efforts. This reflected
shortcomings in expenditure discipline, overly ambitious targets for restraining
investment spending, and delays in tightening policies in response to emerging fiscal
pressures. The government also noted that an unexpected slippage of budget support into
2011 provided no opportunity to rein in the spending that these loans had been intended
to finance, contributing to new arrears accumulation.

On the new national accounts, public financial liabilities at end-2010 are projected at
52 percent of GDP, comprising 44 percentage points of GDP of formal debt and 8
percentage points of GDP in respect of domestic arrears and obligations for public
enterprise debts. Public debt (including arrears) is now broadly twice the level in 2006
after debt relief (26 percent of GDP). An updated debt sustainability assessment shows
Ghana to be at somewhat lower risk of debt distress than in the assessment prepared for
the June 2010 review of the ECF arrangement. Assuming a successful multi-year
reduction in the fiscal deficit and with nonconcessional borrowing kept to modest levels,
key indicators of debt distress are projected to remain well below threshold levels. A key
improvement from the June 2010 assessment is in regard to the debt-GDP ratio, which
now remains below the threshold, even for standardized shocks to the baseline. This
67
   The original program target of 4.8 percent of GDP (cash basis) has been revised upwards to reflect higher
than programmed project loans and the associated foreign-financed investment outlays. This additional
financing was only partly offset by shortfalls in program/budget loans.


                                               - 104 -
improvement reflects the lower starting point for this indicator following the upward
revision of the re-based national accounts.

In the financial sector, private sector credit has been sluggish until recently, as banks
pulled back after a sharp rise in nonperforming loans. However, with signs of more
robust economic activity in 2010, currency growth picked up in the second half of the
year, and a modest strengthening is evident in private sector credit. Liquidity conditions
remain accommodating, reflecting Bank of Ghana policy easing during 2009­10 and as a
result of balance of payments inflows that have not been fully sterilized. Gross reserve
levels rose to $4.4 billion in November 2010 (about 3.3 months of imports of goods and
services).

Program performance has been favorable in regards to inflation and reserve cover, but
much less robust on the fiscal front. Fiscal deficit targets were missed through 2010, and
end-year targets are also expected to be missed for domestic arrears and net domestic
financing. Nonconcessional borrowing is reportedly within program limits, and data are
being verified by staff.

Economic outlook for 2011­13

Macroeconomic projections for 2011­13 are provided in Tables 1­2. With a projected
rise in oil production to 80,000 barrels per day in 2011 and more than 110,000 in 2012,
GDP growth is projected to exceed 12 percent in 2011 and 8 percent in 2012. With
spillovers from the oil sector, the non-oil economy is projected to grow at around 6½
percent, notwithstanding assumed tighter fiscal policies in 2011­12.

Despite a small decline in the projected terms of trade, the balance of payments is
projected to remain strong, with buoyant gold and cocoa exports supplemented by the
start of petroleum exports. Private capital inflows are also projected to remain strong.
Reflecting these factors, gross reserves are projected to rise to around $5 billion at end-
2011 (3.5 months of import cover).

The 2011 budget and fiscal policies

The attached macroeconomic projections assume that the government is successful in its
determination to re-launch its fiscal consolidation program in 2011­12, drawing on the
lessons from slippages in 2010. Oil revenues are projected to rise to about 2½ percent of
GDP in 2012­13, up from about 1 percent of GDP in 2011. This is reinforced by
projected efforts to boost tax effort from the non-oil economy (see below). Disciplined
expenditure management is assumed to keep overall outlays broadly unchanged in
relation to GDP in 2011, notwithstanding higher interest and wage outlays and the need
for a realistic provision for capital spending. Modest reductions in spending relative to
GDP are projected for 2012-13. Pending the completion of a plan for an upfront
regularization of domestic arrears and other liabilities (below), the projections in Table 1
show a phased multi-year clearance of arrears. Comprehensive front-loaded arrears



                                         - 105 -
regularization would be associated with a larger fiscal deficit and a larger rise in debt in
the short-term, but stronger fiscal balances in subsequent years.

In developing the near-term fiscal adjustment program, the government intends to focus
on four key themes, as outlined below:

       Stronger tax revenue performance. Tax revenues are equivalent to just 15
       percent of rebased GDP, compared to ratios of 20­25 percent in peer countries.
       The initial tax yield from oil production has been revised down, largely reflecting
       higher than previously expected tax offsets in the initial years of production. The
       2011 budget will strengthen revenue collections by delimiting and better
       controlling some tax exemptions, and by extending through 2011 the temporary
       national stabilization levy (corporate profit tax). To supplement the 2011 budget,
       the government has indicated its intention to boost revenue collections by
       additional measures yielding an additional 1.3 percent of GDP in 2011.

       Strengthened public expenditure management. The continuing accumulation
       of domestic arrears is having a corrosive effect on budget discipline, private
       sector liquidity, and the loan books of the banking system. The government has
       indicated that it will reinforce expenditure management to minimize future arrears
       accumulation. The requirement for ministries, departments, and agencies to obtain
       commencement certificates before initiating spending has been reinforced by a
       Presidential Circular. The government is also requesting IMF technical assistance
       on arrears management and related public expenditure management issues as a
       priority in early 2011. They are also developing in cooperation with the IMF a
       comprehensive strategy to regularize the projected end-2010 balance of
       GHc 3.5 billion of domestic arrears and public obligations in regard of state
       enterprise debts, and plan to launch this clearance program during 2011 after the
       necessary audits and verification processes. Fund staff have cautioned against
       using a new sovereign bond issue to clear domestic arrears until plans are
       developed to limit the domestic liquidity impact of bond-financed arrears
       payments.

       Careful public payroll management. The government believes that the budget
       wage provision for 2011 is adequate to finance the new "single spine" pay
       structure. The precise cost is subject to uncertainty, depending on how the
       520,000 public sector employees are mapped from the old to the new pay
       structure and on the treatment of some former allowances, which will be
       integrated into base pay. To ensure that the new structure is affordable, the
       government will seek to minimize any additional cost pressures in the 2011 pay
       budget, including by maintaining existing pay relativities unchanged in the new
       pay structure to avoid any further steepening of the pay line in 2011.



                                         - 106 -
           Value-for-money in public investment and debt management. The
           government gives a high priority to strengthening Ghanas infrastructure. Overall
           investment levels are not low, at least as a share of GDP and in comparison to
           peer countries. Accordingly, they intend first to explore the prioritization and
           efficiency of existing investment, including through the findings of the
           forthcoming World Bank Public Expenditure Review. If this review suggests that
           additional financing is needed, the intention, as a first resort, is to rely on
           domestic fiscal space created by a stronger tax revenue effort and future tax
           income from the oil sector, supplemented by concessional loans from
           development partners (for which there remains a large undisbursed balance).
           Nonconcessional borrowing will be kept to low levels, focused on the commercial
           needs of the national oil company and a few high-priority government projects for
           which concessional financing is not available. A list of potential projects for
           nonconcessional financing, ranked by priority, has been discussed with Fund
           staff. A short-list of projects to proceed in 2011 and 2012 will be finalized shortly,
           based on the agreed limits on nonconcessional borrowing under the adjustment
           program.

The 2011 budget targets a fiscal deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP,68 corresponding to a
commitment basis deficit of 4.1 percent of GDP. This outcome, if achieved, would mark
a substantial improvement from 2010, though the deficit would remain higher than
envisaged at the time of the last ECF review (the commitment basis deficit was formerly
projected as 2.5 percent of GDP in 2011). Discussions are continuing on the fiscal
policies and fiscal targets for 2011 and the medium term that could be supported under
the ECF. The fiscal situation will be strengthened relative to the budget by the proposed
additional tax measures noted above. At the same time, the realism of some expenditure
allocations may need to be revisited, and the budget does not yet reflect the impact of the
comprehensive arrears regularization exercise that is planned for 2011.

Structural reforms

Progress on structural reforms has been mixed, as outlined below.

Revenue and expenditure management. The roll out of the new automated financial
management system (GIFMIS) has faced technical delays and financing shortfalls. On
revenue administration, a substantial increase in the VAT threshold has been approved by
parliament, and a tax regime for small businesses will be developed shortly with IMF
technical assistance. The appointment of senior management in the new integrated
revenue authority is proceeding, albeit more slowly than planned. A study of tax
exemptions led to a narrowing of certain exemptions in the 2011 budget. The anticipated
parliamentary passage in early-2011of the Oil Revenue Management Bill will provide
welcome clarity on the associated fiscal regime.

     7.5 percent of GDP using the old national accounts.


                                                 - 107 -
Payroll management. Migration of public agency staffing to the centralized public
payroll continues to lag, with ongoing discussions on some agency-specific allowances.
As a result, a considerable part of the public payroll continues to be paid to agencies as a
lump sum, without verifiable data on staffing, grade structures, etc. An independent audit
of public staffing on the centralized payroll is being contracted for 2011.

Debt and project management. Good progress has been made in developing a debt
management strategy, which will be finalized in the coming weeks; and a framework for
appraising and prioritizing public investment projects and associated borrowing has been
developed and will be submitted for Cabinet discussion shortly. A new project evaluation
unit is also to be established in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning.

Public enterprise reforms. In the state enterprise sector, the increase in power tariffs in
mid-2010 re-established cost recovery pricing, contributing to enhanced financial
viability of power generation and distribution companies. The announced intention to
ensure quarterly tariff reviews to sustain cost recovery pricing will be important to avoid
new subsidy needs. Transparency on the usage of oil revenues retained by the national oil
company to finance its commercial investments will be important to sustain confidence in
oil revenue management.

Steps to address banking sector vulnerability

The banking system remains vulnerable on account of high nonperforming loans,
excessive borrower concentration for a few banks, a high cost structure, and a strong
public presence in some banks, which hampers their commercial activities. Reflecting
these factors, the cost of borrowing remains high, particularly for small and medium
borrowers. Stress tests suggest that a few small banks are vulnerable to potential
deterioration in their loan portfolios. While the pick-up in economic activity is beneficial
for banks, the planned resolution of domestic arrears to contractors will be critical to
reducing their nonperforming loans portfolio.

Risks and vulnerabilities

Fiscal performance remains a source of major macroeconomic vulnerability. Unless the
fiscal deficit is substantially reduced in 2011 and beyond, it will be difficult to avoid
continued accumulation of domestic arrears and heavy borrowing from the banking
system. This would risk sapping the emerging growth recovery, and could rekindle the
exchange rate and inflation pressures seen in 2008.

Key risks relate to weak program implementation and shortcomings in expenditure
management. The authorities expressed commitment to a more forceful approach to tax
revenue mobilization, public expenditure control, and payroll management is welcome.
However, credibility has been tested by the governments missed fiscal adjustment goals
in 2009 and 2010, the latter notwithstanding an easing of the 2010 program at the time of
the July 2010 ECF review. A credible reinforcement of policies should include early
implementation of key measures, backed by clear public communication of why policy
correction is needed.


                                         - 108 -
As regards the 2011 budget, the revenue and grant projections appear broadly realistic,
based on current policies. But as noted above, the tax revenue effort remains very low, by
peer country standards, and is a key source of budget vulnerability. A high priority should
be given reinforcing tax administration, broadening the tax base, and eliminating tax
exemptions. This will require a sustained multi-year effort. With oil revenues projected to
be modest in the initial years of production, careful management of public expectations
will remain important.

On the expenditure side, the wage bill has been subject to repeated over-runs, and the
costing for the new pay structure remains subject to an uncomfortable margin of
uncertainty. Efforts will be needed to ensure that the roll out of the new pay structure is
within the confines of the budget pay provision. Even on this basis, the cost of public
administration will have increased substantially in recent years, and efforts to streamline
the public payroll will need to be given more priority going forward.

Expenditures in the capital budget also need better management. The budget provision
for capital spending appears on the low side, and a more realistic budget appropriation,
combined with better within-year spending oversight, may be needed to avoid the
emergence of further arrears in 2011.

More generally, the government should be more proactive in managing budget pressures
during the course of the year. Where new spending pressures emerge, these should be
managed through cuts elsewhere in the budget or by through new revenue mobilization
efforts. New policy commitments should be resisted unless they are fully funded.

On petroleum products, prices have shown limited flexibility over the past year, and the
budget is bearing the costs of a new price hedging regime. Continued inflexibility in
pricing would be inconsistent with adjustment to changing global market conditions and
risks giving rise to new calls for budget subsidies. If the hedging regime is continued,
costs should be borne by consumers.

On monetary and exchange rate policy, Ghana is experiencing a strong balance of
payments position that will improve further with full-scale oil production. This may
intensify the dilemma that is starting to emerge, in managing the liquidity consequences
within an inflation targeting framework. While currency appreciation would ameliorate
inflationary pressures, this would raise concerns regarding competitiveness, in light of the
real appreciation of the cedi through 2010.
