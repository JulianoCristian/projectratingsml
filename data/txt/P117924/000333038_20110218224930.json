presents\n            one-tranche Seventh Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC7)\n            to the Republic of Ghana. This first development policy\n            operation of a programmatic series of two (PRSC7 and PRSC8)\n            supports the authorities' efforts to consolidate\n            ongoing fiscal stabilization efforts and protect the\n            development objectives set in the Ghana Shared Growth and\n            Development Agenda (GSGDA) for 2010-2013. The GSGDA\n            emphasizes the need for macroeconomic stabilization and\n            greater executive efficiency, transparency and\n            accountability to provide the adequate setting for the\n            reduction of poverty and socio-economic inequalities through\n            agricultural, private sector, infrastructure and human\n            resource development. Specifically, the PRSC7 supports\n            continuing and deepening policy reforms initiated in 2009\n            to: (i) restore budgetary discipline and (ii) tackle\n            longstanding public sector and energy issues, while (iii)\n            protecting the poor and (iv) preparing for the oil era. The\n            operation is aligned with the recently updated World Bank\n            Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) objectives\n            for FY08-12 and with the World Bank's Africa Action\n            Plan. The operation is part of a larger program of support\n            to Ghana that notably focuses on public financial\n            management, public sector reform, energy and safety nets."}, "docdt": "2010-12-07T00:00:00Z"}
