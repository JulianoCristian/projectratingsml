Project Development Objective 
1. 
Project 
development objective: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
The 
project's 
development 
objective 
is 
to 
assist 
GO1 
develop 
and implement 
the 
policy 
and 
regulatory 
reforms 
and 
build 
the 
institutional 
and 
social 
foundations 
needed 
to 
enable, 
promote 
and facilitate 
efficient 
and 
sustainable large-scale 
private 
investment 
in 
infrastructure. 
2. 
Key 
performance 
indicators: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
The 
key 
performance indicators 
will 
include: 
Sound 
cross-sector 
policies 
for 
promoting 
and 
realizing public-private 
partnerships 
(P3) 
in 
infrastructure 
are 
developed and 
operationalized. 
Improved 
sector 
policies, regulations and 
procedures enable 
and facilitate efficient private 
investment 
in 
infrastructure. 
Independent 
/ 
non-ministerial 
regulatory 
bodies 
with 
sound 
operating 
procedures 
and 
capable 
staff 
are 
established 
for 
key 
sectors. 
Organization 
structures, 
skill-mixes, and cultures 
of 
sector 
ministries 
are 
changing 
to reflect 
the 
further 
evolution 
of 
government's 
role 
from 
provider 
of 
infrastructure 
to 
enabler 
of 
P3 
in 
infrastructure. 
Key 
government 
and 
public 
enterprise 
officials 
have 
an 
improved 
understanding 
of 
the 
prerequisites 
for 
successful 
P3 
in 
infrastructure. 
Reliable 
and 
up-to-date 
information 
relating to 
P3 
policies, 
regulations, best practices 
and 
project 
opportunities 
is 
readily 
accessible 
and 
where appropriate 
effectively 
disseminated. 
Public 
awareness 
and 
acceptance 
of 
the needs 
for 
and benefits 
of 
well-managed 
P3 
in 
infrastructure 
is 
increasing. 
Note 
that 
it 
is 
not 
considered 
appropriate 
to 
adopt 
outcome 
indicators 
relating 
to 
number 
and 
value 
of 
private 
infrastructure projects 
transacted 
for 
the 
following 
reasons: 
(a) 
the 
full 
impacts 
of 
most 
of 
the 
activities 
to 
be 
supported 
under 
the 
project 
will 
at 
best 
not 
be 
felt 
until 
towards 
the 
end 
of 
the 
implementation 
period-for 
example, 
new 
regulatory 
agencies 
need 
time 
to 
establish 
credibility-while 
preparing, 
tendering, 
negotiating, and 
reaching 
financial 
closure 
on 
private 
infrastructure projects 
typically 
takes several 
years; 
(b) 
the successful 
implementation 
of 
the 
project 
activities 
is 
viewed 
as 
a 
necessary 
but 
not 
a 
sufficient 
condition 
for 
restoring 
large-scale 
private 
infrastructure investment, 
and 
substantial progress 
will 
also 
be 
needed 
in 
other 
key 
areas 
affecting 
the 
overall 
investment 
climate.

2002 
The 
Indonesia 
Country 
Assistance Strategy 
for 
FY 
200 
1-2003 
identifies 
three 
broad 
avenues 
through 
which 
the 
World 
Bank 
Group 
will 
pursue 
its 
overarching 
goal 
of 
reducing 
poverty 
and 
-2- 
Page  9
vulnerability 
in 
a 
more 
open and decentralized 
environment, namely: 
0 
Sustaining 
economic 
recovery 
and 
promoting 
broad-based 
growth; 
0 
Building 
national institutions 
for 
accountable government; 
and 
Delivering 
better 
public 
services 
for 
the 
poor. 
The 
proposed 
project 
will 
support 
all 
three 
of 
these avenues, 
but 
is 
focused 
primarily 
on 
sustaining 
economic recovery 
and 
promoting 
broad-based 
growth. 
The 
CAS 
recognizes 
infrastructure 
bottlenecks 
could 
become 
a drag 
on 
growth 
as 
economic 
recovery 
takes 
hold. 
It 
notes that 
public 
spending 
on 
infrastructure 
maintenance 
and 
preservation 
has 
declined 
since 
the 
onset 
of 
the crisis, and that Indonesia’s 
ability 
to 
develop 
new 
capacity 
in 
line 
with 
growing 
demands 
will 
be 
constrained 
by 
long 
project 
preparation and 
implementation 
lead-times 
as 
well 
as 
by 
financing 
capacity. 
The 
CAS 
also recognizes that 
decentralization 
will 
complicate 
the challenges, and that service 
standards 
and 
investments may 
further 
deteriorate and 
inter-regional linkages 
may 
suffer 
while 
responsibilities 
are 
being 
clarified. 
The 
adopted 
assistance 
strategy 
accordingly 
aims 
at: 
providing 
assistance 
for 
essential investments 
in 
maintenance and 
rehabilitation 
through 
ongoing 
and 
proposed investment 
projects; 
improving 
the 
policy 
and 
legal framework 
for 
key 
sectors 
to 
facilitate competitive private 
sector 
investment, 
including 
through 
better cost-recovery, 
phasing-out 
of 
inefficient 
subsidies, 
development 
of 
regulatory 
capacity, 
and 
restructuring 
of 
sector 
entities. 
facilitating 
implementation 
of 
agreed 
government 
reforms through 
joint 
action 
by 
the 
donors 
and 
contributing 
to 
financing 
of 
future 
infrastructure 
needs 
by 
mobilizing 
co-financing 
from 
ADB, 
JBIC, 
and 
others, 
and, 
where appropriate, 
using 
the 
Bank 
Group’s 
various 
instrument 
’ 
s-including 
guarantees. 
The 
project 
is 
specifically 
designed 
to 
support 
the 
second element 
of 
this 
support 
strategy, 
The 
reforms 
that 
will 
be 
needed 
to 
enable and attract 
efficient 
and 
sustainable 
private 
investment 
in 
infrastructure 
-including 
improved 
legal 
and 
regulatory frameworks, 
more 
capable 
institutions, cost-reflective 
pricing, and more 
transparent procedures and processes-will 
also 
contribute 
to 
improving 
public 
sector 
accountability 
and 
delivery 
of 
better 
public 
services 
for 
the 
poor. 
For 
example, 
adoption 
of 
transparent 
competitive 
processes 
for 
involving 
the 
private 
sector 
in 
public 
service 
delivery 
will 
help 
address one 
of 
the 
more visible 
areas 
of 
corruption 
during 
the 
build-up 
to 
the 
crisis, 
while 
increased 
competition 
in 
service 
delivery 
should 
help 
improve quality 
and 
efficiency 
and 
lead 
to lower 
prices 
in 
sectors 
that 
are 
currently 
dominated 
by 
inefficient 
SOEs. 
Likewise, 
the 
introduction 
of 
negative 
concessioning-possibly 
supported 
by 
output-based 
aid-will 
help 
improve 
access 
to public 
services 
at 
least 
cost. 
More 
generally, 
efficient 
private 
participation 
should relieve 
the 
fiscal 
burden 
and 
hence 
free-up 
government 
resources 
for 
expenditure 
programs 
specifically 
designed 
to help 
the 
poor. 
2. 
Main 
sector 
issues 
and 
Government 
strategy: 
Background: 
Indonesia 
has 
long 
recognized 
the 
vital 
role 
of 
basic 
infrastructure 
in 
enabling 
and 
supporting 
sustained and 
rapid 
economic 
development, and 
in 
improving public 
welfare 
and 
-3- 
Page  10
opportunities 
for 
the 
poor. 
This 
is 
reflected 
in 
the 
high priority 
accorded 
to 
the 
expansion, 
rehabilitation 
and-somewhat 
more 
recently-sound 
maintenance 
of 
transport, 
energy, 
urban 
and 
other 
infrastructure 
under 
six 
successive 
Five-Year Development 
Plans (Repelitas) and 
the 
current 
National 
Development 
Program 
(Propenas 
2000-2004). 
For 
many 
years 
infrastructure 
provision 
had 
remained-with 
few 
exceptions-the 
exclusive 
preserve 
of 
government 
and 
state-owned 
enterprises 
(SOEs). 
By 
the 
late 
1980s, 
however, 
it 
was 
clearly evident 
that 
the 
public 
sector 
was 
no 
longer 
able 
to 
finance 
all 
needed investments 
in 
new 
infrastructure 
capacity 
and, 
moreover, that government 
agencies 
and 
poorly performing public 
corporations 
lacked 
the 
managerial 
capacity 
to 
deliver 
services 
to 
the 
standards 
increasingly 
demanded 
by 
users. 
Indonesia 
accordingly 
embarked 
upon 
parallel 
programs 
to 
promote 
private 
investment 
in 
new 
infrastructure projects 
and 
to 
reform 
and 
privatize 
its 
many 
(160+) 
SOEs. 
The 
first 
major private 
infrastructure 
project 
was 
the 
Cawang-Tanjung 
Priok 
section 
of 
Jakarta’s 
inner 
ring 
toll 
road, 
construction 
of 
which 
commenced 
in 
the 
mid-1980s. 
This 
originated 
with 
an 
unsolicited 
proposal 
from 
a 
politically-connected 
group 
that 
was 
able 
to 
drive 
the 
concession 
negotiation 
process 
and 
secure 
financing largely 
from 
public 
sector 
sources. 
A 
far 
more 
significant 
step 
was 
taken 
in 
the 
power 
sector 
in 
1990, 
when Government 
solicited 
proposals 
for 
Indonesia’s 
first 
Independent 
Power 
Producer 
(IPP) 
project, a 
1,200 
MW 
coal-fueled 
station 
in 
East 
Java. 
The 
Power 
Purchase Agreement (PPA) 
for 
Paiton 
I 
was 
signed 
in 
early 
1994 
and 
financial closing 
was 
achieved 
in 
April 
1995, 
with 
debt 
financing provided 
by 
a 
combination 
of 
export 
credit 
agencies 
and 
commercial 
lenders. 
Many 
other 
private 
infrastructure 
projects, 
most 
unsolicited, 
were 
by 
then 
already 
in 
the 
pipeline 
and-when 
the 
economic crisis 
struck 
in 
the 
second 
half 
of 
1997-Indonesia 
had 
committed 
to 
long-term 
power 
purchase 
agreements 
with 
26 
independent 
power 
producers and awarded 
concessions 
for 
numerous 
toll 
road, telecoms, water 
supply, and other 
projects. 
In 
little 
over 
three 
years 
from 
the 
Paiton 
I 
PPA 
signature, over 
US$20 
billion 
in 
investment 
commitments had 
been secured 
for 
private 
infrastructure 
projects, 
dominated 
by 
electricity 
(US$10.2 
bn), 
telecoms 
(US$8.4 
bn), 
and 
transport 
(US$2.1 
bn). 
In 
stark 
contrast, 
the 
SOE 
reform 
and 
privatization 
program had 
moved 
very 
slowly. 
Nine 
years 
after 
its 
launch, 
GO1 
had sold only 
minority 
stakes 
in 
only 
a 
handful 
of 
SOEs, 
of 
which only 
two 
(Telkom 
and Indosat) were 
infrastructure providers. 
In 
summary, 
Indonesia’s strategy 
for 
involving 
the 
private 
sector 
in 
infrastructure 
provision 
centered 
mainly 
on 
the 
development 
of 
new 
“greenfield” 
projects 
rather 
than 
on 
transformation 
of 
public 
infrastructure 
enterprises. 
Implementing 
projects 
took 
precedence 
over 
improving 
policies 
and regulations, 
with 
the 
eagerness 
shown 
by 
private 
equity 
investors and 
lenders 
helping 
to 
dissuade 
Government 
from 
pursuing 
much-needed 
structural reforms. 
Little 
progress 
was 
made towards 
improving pricing 
policies 
and 
eliminating 
untargeted 
subsidies, 
or to 
introducing competitive market 
structures 
and establishing 
sound 
regulatory 
arrangements. 
The 
procedures 
by 
which private 
partners 
were 
appointed 
were 
generally 
opaque, 
with 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
projects 
being 
either 
unsolicited 
or 
otherwise 
awarded 
through 
non-transparent 
processes 
to 
consortia 
with 
“politically 
connected” 
local 
partners. 
Impacts 
of 
the Economic 
Crisis: 
Private infrastructure 
projects-and 
particularly 
those 
with 
foreign 
financing--were 
quickly 
impacted 
as 
the 
Rupiah 
plunged. 
In 
September 
1997, 
Keppres 
39 
of 
1997 
decreed 
that 
many 
major 
investment 
projects, 
including 
private 
infrastructure 
schemes 
for 
which 
contracts 
had 
already 
been 
signed, 
were 
to 
be 
postponed 
or 
reviewed. 
-4- 
Page  11
Subsequently, 
other 
private 
projects 
that 
had 
been cleared 
to 
proceed 
failed to 
reach 
financial 
closing 
or 
were 
halted 
as 
their 
financing 
sources 
dried-up. 
Affordability 
concerns and 
mounting 
social 
pressures caused 
Government to 
abandon automatic 
tariff 
adjustment mechanisms 
in 
the 
power 
and telecoms 
sectors 
and 
defer 
other 
tariff 
increase proposals, thereby 
affecting 
the 
commercial 
viability 
of 
private 
projects 
already 
in 
operation or 
close 
to 
completion. 
Agreements 
for 
most operating 
and 
committed 
private 
projects-including 
all 
IPPs-were 
“re-opened”, 
with 
the 
subsequent 
renegotiations generally 
proceeding 
slowly. 
Sponsors 
generally 
accepted 
the 
need 
to 
renegotiate, and several subsequently 
agreed 
to 
“close-out” 
their 
projects.  However, a 
few 
opted 
for 
international arbitration 
and 
/ 
or 
to 
claim 
under 
political 
risk 
insurance, and decisions to 
date 
have 
so 
far 
favored 
the 
project 
sponsors. 
The 
rate 
of 
growth 
in 
demand 
for 
infrastructure 
services 
is 
showing 
signs 
of 
picking-up 
as 
Indonesia 
slowly 
emerges 
from 
the 
crisis,. 
However, 
severe 
constraints 
on 
the 
State 
Budget 
have 
necessitated 
sharp 
cutbacks 
in 
the 
level 
of 
development 
spending, 
while 
most 
infrastructure 
SOEs 
are 
in 
very 
poor 
financial 
shape. 
With 
the 
flow 
of 
new 
private 
investment 
for 
infrastructure 
having 
all 
but 
ceased, 
there 
is 
little 
new 
infrastructure 
capacity 
currently 
under 
construction 
while 
in 
some 
sectors-such 
as 
roads--existing 
assets 
are 
deteriorating 
as 
a 
result 
of 
inadequate maintenance. 
This, 
coupled 
with 
the 
long 
lead-times 
for 
developing 
new 
capacity, 
poses 
the 
risk 
that 
infrastructure 
constraints 
will 
impede 
restoration 
of 
rapid 
and 
sustainable 
economic 
growth 
and 
limit 
the 
quality 
and coverage 
of 
public 
services 
for 
the 
poor. 
Key 
Challenges: 
The 
public 
sector 
was 
unable 
to 
finance 
all 
needed 
infrastructure 
investments 
before 
the 
crisis, and 
its 
capacity 
to 
do 
so 
now 
is 
much 
diminished.  Unless Indonesia 
is 
prepared 
to 
accept 
further deterioration 
in 
living 
standards, 
it 
will 
need 
to 
mobilize 
substantial new 
private 
resources 
while striving to optimize 
the 
utilization 
and 
financial 
self-sustainability 
of 
existing 
assets. 
Securing 
renewed 
private 
sector 
participation 
on 
reasonable terms 
will 
be 
extremely 
difficult 
in 
the 
present 
environment, 
and 
will 
require Government 
to confront 
several 
difficult 
and 
inter-related 
challenges.  These can 
be 
grouped 
into 
four broad 
areas: 
1. 
Restoring Indonesia’s overall 
attractiveness 
to 
investors. 
The 
level 
of 
new investment 
in 
Indonesia, and 
particularly 
new foreign direct 
investment, 
has 
slumped 
since 
the 
onset 
of 
the 
crisis. 
While 
many 
other countries 
in 
the 
region 
also 
suffered 
badly 
during 
1997/98, 
Indonesia 
fell 
further 
and 
has 
since 
recovered 
more 
slowly 
due 
to 
a 
combination 
of 
factors 
including 
political 
uncertainty, 
systemic 
corruption, a 
dysfunctional 
judicial 
system, 
and 
sporadic social unrest 
and 
disorder. 
The 
magnitude 
of 
the 
challenges 
now 
facing 
Government 
in 
seeking 
to 
attract 
new investment 
is 
starkly reflected 
in 
assessments 
that show 
Indonesia 
as 
having 
one 
of 
the 
highest 
country 
risk 
ratings 
in 
the 
region, and 
being 
among 
the 
most 
corrupt countries 
in 
the 
world. 
2. 
Restoring 
Indonesia’s 
attractiveness 
to 
infrastructure 
investors. 
Infrastructure 
projects 
are 
characterized 
by 
their 
capital-intensity, 
long 
lead-times, 
long 
pay-back 
periods, 
and-in 
some 
instances-social 
sensitivity. 
Globally, investor 
appetite 
for 
infrastructure 
opportunities 
is 
likely 
to 
have been 
impacted 
by 
the 
fall-out 
from 
California’s 
power 
crisis, 
the 
Enron 
collapse, and the 
bursting 
of 
the 
G3 
mobile 
telephony 
bubble. 
Even 
without 
these 
external 
factors, 
Indonesia 
faces 
a 
much 
tougher task 
in 
persuading investors 
to 
commit 
to 
infrastructure 
schemes than, 
say, 
to 
labor-intensive 
manufacturing 
(and even here 
the 
picture 
remains 
somewhat bleak!). 
Meeting 
the challenge 
will 
require 
concerted action 
on 
several 
-5- 
Page  12
fronts. 
Tarifland 
Subsidy Reform: 
Tariffs 
in 
many infrastructure 
sectors 
remain 
well 
below 
the 
levels 
needed 
for 
long-term commercial 
viability. 
A 
rapid 
transition 
to 
cost-covering 
tariffs, coupled 
with 
mechanisms 
for 
delivering 
well 
targeted 
subsidies 
to 
the 
most 
needy, 
is 
needed 
to 
restore 
fiscal 
sustainability 
and attract 
new private 
investment. 
Modem 
Regulatory 
Frameworks: 
Heightened 
perceptions 
of 
country 
risk 
mean that 
private 
investors 
and 
their 
lenders 
will 
be 
much 
more 
demanding 
as 
regards 
the 
clarity, 
predictability, 
and 
credibility 
of 
regulatory frameworks. 
New 
models 
of 
arm's 
length 
regulation 
have been 
under 
study 
for 
some 
years, 
but 
decisions need 
to 
be 
taken, 
new 
laws 
enacted, 
and 
new 
institutions 
put 
in 
place. 
As 
part 
of 
this 
process, the 
additional 
regulatory 
uncertainties 
arising 
from 
regional 
autonomy 
need 
to 
be 
resolved. 
Other 
Risk 
Mitigation 
Measures: 
Investors 
in 
new infrastructure projects 
in 
Indonesia 
will 
likely 
demand 
some 
form 
of 
public 
support 
to 
mitigate country 
and project 
risks. 
Even 
in 
ordinary 
circumstances, such support 
packages 
require careful 
design 
to 
avoid 
expanding 
public 
exposure 
beyond 
prudent 
levels 
or 
undermining 
incentives 
for efficient 
risk 
bearing. 
Formulating 
sound 
policy 
and 
strategy 
in 
the 
current 
circumstances 
will 
be 
extremely challenging. 
Procurement 
Processes: 
In 
order 
to 
provide comfort to 
prospective 
investors, 
help 
rebuild 
the 
legitimacy 
of 
private 
infrastructure 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
local 
stakeholders, 
and 
help 
ensure 
the 
best 
terms 
possible 
for 
the 
country, 
private 
partners 
will 
need 
to 
be 
chosen 
through 
fully 
transparent, 
competitive 
processes 
so 
as 
to 
preclude later claims 
that 
projects 
were awarded 
corruptly. 
Disputes on 
Existing 
Private 
Projects: 
Until 
disputes 
concerning 
existing 
projects 
are 
satisfactorily 
resolved, 
Indonesia 
will 
find 
it 
difficult 
to 
persuade 
mainstream 
private 
investors, lenders and 
insurers 
to return. 
Moreover, 
the manner 
in 
which 
Indonesia 
handles 
ongoing 
disputes 
on 
private 
infrastructure projects 
may 
have 
more 
general 
implications 
for 
future 
foreign 
direct 
investment 
flows. 
Link 
with 
SOE 
Privatization: 
To 
realize 
the 
full 
potential 
benefits 
of 
private 
participation, 
Government 
will 
need 
to 
accelerate 
the 
restructuring 
and 
privatization 
of 
infrastructure 
SOEs. 
In 
addition 
to 
generating 
resources 
for 
the 
Government, 
this 
will 
help 
enable 
effective competition 
and 
enhance 
efficiency 
and service 
quality. 
It 
can also 
help 
lock-in 
cost-covering 
retail 
tariffs, 
thus 
ensuring investments 
in 
new 
wholesale 
facilities--such 
as 
power 
plants-will 
have 
credit-worthy 
customers. 
Preparation 
of 
sound 
projects: 
Many 
of 
the 
projects 
that were 
offered 
to 
the 
private 
sector 
in 
the past were 
poorly 
prepared 
and, 
in 
some 
instances, 
ill-chosen. 
In 
seeking 
to 
persuade 
private 
investors 
to return quickly, 
Indonesia 
will 
need 
to 
be 
able 
to 
offer 
well 
conceived 
and prepared 
schemes 
that 
are 
amenable 
to 
early 
and 
rapid 
implementation. 
Building 
institutional 
capacities: 
Concerted 
efforts 
will 
be 
needed 
to 
strengthen 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
central 
and 
regional 
agencies 
and enterprises charged 
with 
developing 
and 
implementing 
policy 
and 
regulatory 
reforms 
and 
with 
dealing 
with 
prospective 
private 
investors. 
Few 
central government 
officials 
and 
SOE 
staff 
currently 
have 
relevant 
training, 
in 
part 
because 
there 
are 
few, 
if 
any, 
quality 
programs 
offered 
in 
Indonesia. 
Even 
fewer 
have sound 
practical 
experience 
as 
most 
of 
the 
private 
infrastructure 
deals 
concluded 
pre-crisis 
were concentrated 
in 
a 
few 
sectors 
and 
originated 
with 
unsolicited 
-6- 
Page  13
proposals. 
And 
the 
situation 
is 
worse 
at 
the 
sub-national 
level. 
3. 
Building 
domestic 
financing 
capacities: 
To 
reduce the 
impact 
of 
currency 
risks, 
Indonesia 
will 
need 
to 
strengthen 
its 
domestic capacity 
to 
finance 
infrastructure projects. 
Success 
with 
financial 
sector 
restructuring 
will 
help, 
but 
there 
may 
also 
be 
a 
need 
and 
opportunity 
to 
develop new infrastructure-specific 
financing 
mechanisms 
and instruments. 
4. 
Building 
public 
acceptance 
of 
private 
infrastructure. 
There 
are 
continuing 
indications 
of 
strong 
resistance 
to 
restoring private 
investment 
in 
infrastructure, 
both 
from 
within 
the 
public 
sector 
and 
from 
civil 
society. 
Three 
underlying 
causes 
can 
be identified: 
0 
Private 
participation 
requires 
sector 
departments 
and infrastructure 
SOEs 
to 
accept 
a 
paradigm 
shift 
in 
their 
roles 
and 
in 
the 
way they 
do 
business. 
It 
also 
requires 
effective 
inter-agency 
cooperation 
and 
coordination, 
areas 
where 
Indonesia 
has 
traditionally 
not 
been 
strong. 
Experience 
with 
the 
privatization 
program 
suggests 
that 
securing 
the 
needed 
cultural 
changes 
will 
be 
a slow 
and 
difficult 
process 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
concerted 
efforts 
to 
anticipate and deal 
with 
problems. 
Closely 
linked 
with 
this, 
involving 
the 
private 
sector 
in 
traditional 
public 
sector 
domains 
through 
transparent 
processes 
will 
likely 
threaten vested 
interests 
by 
squeezing 
opportunities 
for 
supplementing 
personal 
incomes 
or 
diverting 
funds 
for 
political 
ends. 
The 
public's 
perception 
of 
private 
infrastructure 
delivery 
has 
been 
colored 
by 
vigorous--but 
often 
poorly-informed--debate 
on 
the 
failings 
of 
the 
power, toll-road, 
water 
supply, and telecoms 
deals 
concluded 
during 
the Suharto 
era. 
This 
is 
reflected 
in 
the 
negative 
stance 
of 
many 
civil 
society organizations, 
which 
in 
turn 
is 
open 
to 
exploitation 
by 
those 
with 
vested 
interests 
in 
maintaining 
the 
status 
quo. 
Recent 
achievements. 
The 
Government 
has 
recognized 
the 
importance 
of 
addressing 
these 
challenges, 
and 
has 
prepared 
the 
draft 
of 
an 
Infrastructure 
"White 
Paper" 
which 
overviews 
current 
status 
and 
issues 
in 
each 
of 
the 
major 
infrastructure 
sectors. 
A 
draft 
of 
this 
paper, 
prepared 
by 
the 
Infrastructure 
Deputy Chairman 
of 
BAPPENAS, 
was 
presented 
at the 
annual 
Consultative 
Group 
on 
Indonesia 
(CGI- 
donors 
forum) meeting 
in 
January 
of 
2003 
as 
a 
discussion paper 
for 
further refinement 
based 
on 
additional 
sector 
studies 
and 
other 
inputs 
expected. 
It 
is 
hoped 
that 
a 
"final" 
version 
of 
the paper 
will 
be 
ready 
for 
Cabinet 
discussion 
by 
late 2003. One 
additional 
input 
to 
this 
process 
and 
to 
guide 
future 
Bank 
activities 
in 
the 
infrastructure 
sectors 
is 
a 
planned 
AAA 
review 
of 
priority 
infrastructure 
issues 
in 
Indonesia 
during 
the 
current 
Bank 
FY 
03 (report 
to 
be 
completed 
by 
June 
2003). 
This 
work 
has 
been 
focused 
on 
power, transport, water supply, 
telecommunications and 
rural 
infrastructure 
sectors 
due 
to 
resource constraints, 
but 
will 
provide 
valuable insights to 
the 
options 
for 
Bank 
and 
GO1 
cooperation 
in 
"Averting 
The 
Coming 
Infrastructure 
Crisis 
in 
Indonesia", 
as 
the 
report 
is 
tentatively 
titled. 
These 
reports 
will 
serve 
as 
a well-advanced 
starting 
point 
for 
the 
sector 
assessments 
and strategy 
options 
work 
of 
the 
advisory 
teams 
to 
be 
mobilized 
by 
the 
project, 
and 
facilitate 
the 
development 
of 
the 
Country Framework 
Assessment 
for 
PPI 
(per 
PPIAF 
guidelines 
- 
see 
Annex 
14) 
now 
incorporated 
in 
the 
draft 
TOR 
for 
the 
OCMEA 
advisory 
team. 
Additionally, 
GO1 
has 
already made 
significant 
progress 
in 
several 
areas, 
including: 
Tarqfand 
subsidy 
policy. 
The 
Government 
has 
announced 
its 
commitment 
to 
restoring 
the 
-7- 
Page  14
power 
tariff 
to 
its 
pre-crisis 
US$ 
level 
by 
2005. 
A 
series 
of 
substantial 
increases 
has 
already 
been 
implemented, 
with 
the 
main 
brunt 
having 
so 
far 
fallen 
on 
large 
consumers, 
and a 
targeted 
subsidy 
scheme 
has 
been 
introduced 
to 
protect very 
small 
residential 
customers. 
Tariffs 
have 
also 
been 
increased 
in 
several other 
sectors, 
including--after 
much 
delay--fixed-line 
telephone 
services. 
However, 
the 
picture 
is 
far 
from 
uniform 
and--for 
example--toll 
road 
tariffs 
have 
not 
increased 
since 1992.

Decree 
7 
of 
1998 
(Keppres 
7), 
issued 
in 
January 
1998, 
provided 
an 
important 
first 
step 
towards 
establishing a overarching 
framework 
for 
private 
participation 
in 
infrastructure 
projects, 
including 
on 
matters such 
as 
the 
choice 
of 
projects to 
be 
offered 
for 
private participation, 
the 
processes 
for 
selecting 
private 
partners and 
dealing 
with 
unsolicited 
proposals, and basic 
principles 
relating to provision 
of 
public 
supports. 
Achievements 
at 
the 
sector 
level 
include: 
o 
Telecommunications: 
A 
new Telecommunications 
Law, 
passed 
in 
1999, 
has 
enabled 
more effective competition 
by 
removing 
the 
“exclusivity” 
and other special 
rights 
previously 
enjoyed 
by 
the 
two 
partially privatized 
SOEs, 
PT 
Telkom 
and 
PT 
Indosat. 
o 
Oil 
and 
Gas: 
A 
new 
Oil 
and 
Natural 
Gas 
Law, 
approved 
by 
the 
DPR 
in 
October 
2001, 
provides 
among others 
for 
the 
removal 
of 
Pertamina’s 
downstream 
monopoly 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
independent 
regulatory 
body 
whose 
key 
duties 
will 
include 
regulation 
of 
gas 
transportation infrastructure. 
o 
Electric Power: 
The 
DPR 
has 
also 
adopted 
a 
new 
Electricity 
Law 
in 
September 
2002 
that 
would 
enable 
bulk 
and 
retail 
competition 
and 
permit 
the 
vertical 
and 
horizontal 
unbundling 
of 
PLN 
in 
line 
with 
the 
policies 
mapped 
out 
in 
the 
Government’s August 
1998 
White 
Paper. 
The 
law 
also 
provides 
for 
the establishment 
of 
an 
independent 
regulatory 
agency, 
and 
of 
a mechanism 
for 
channeling 
targeted subsidies and 
supports, 
although 
not 
yet 
implemented. 
o 
Water: 
The 
Bank-financed 
WATSAL 
sector 
policy reform initiative 
is 
supporting 
the 
amendment 
of 
water 
resources 
legislation 
that 
would, 
inter 
alia, enable 
private 
participation 
in 
water 
resources 
development. 
In 
September 
200 
1 
DKI 
Jakarta 
established Indonesia’s 
first 
urban 
water 
supply regulatory 
body 
and a number 
of 
municipalities, 
including 
Pekan Baru, 
are 
also 
now 
exploring 
such arrangements. 
o 
Transport: 
Government 
has 
recognized 
the need 
to 
revise 
existing 
modal 
laws 
for 
Transport 
(Roads, 
Roads 
Traffic 
and 
Transport, 
Railways, 
Sea 
and 
Inland 
Waterway 
Transport, 
and 
Civil 
Aviation) 
to 
align 
with 
the 
laws 
relating to 
regional 
autonomy and 
to 
broaden the 
modalities 
for 
private 
participation, and 
preliminary 
discussions have started 
for 
some 
sectors 
(e.g., 
maritime 
transport). 
Infrastructure 
SOE 
Restructuring 
and 
Privatization. 
Progress 
on 
SOE 
reform 
and 
privatization 
accelerated sharply 
in 
the 
period 
immediately 
following 
the 
onset 
of 
the 
crisis, 
although 
it 
has 
since 
slowed 
again. 
A 
master 
plan for 
SOE 
reform 
and 
privatization 
was 
launched 
in 
December 1999 
and 
several 
significant 
transactions were 
concluded shortly 
thereafter, 
including 
sales 
of 
stakes 
in 
two 
international 
container 
terminal 
concession 
companies (Jakarta 
and 
Surabaya) 
and 
of 
a 
further 
stake 
in 
PT 
Telkom. 
Political 
commitment 
then 
faltered 
in 
the 
face 
of 
public 
opposition 
to privatization 
in 
general 
and 
privatization 
of 
infrastructure 
SOEs 
in 
particular. 
Another 
private 
placement 
of 
shares 
in 
PT 
Telkom 
was 
concluded 
in 
late 
2001, 
and 
GO1 
is 
now 
completing 
arrangements 
for 
PT 
Indosat 
-8- 
Page  15
to 
be 
majority 
private-owned 
as 
a 
result 
of 
a late-2002 
tender 
and 
is 
acting to 
address 
the 
serious concerns created 
by 
its 
failure 
to conclude 
the 
planned 
further 
privatization 
of 
Semen 
Gresik 
in 
late 200 
1. 
Inter-Agency Coordination. 
In 
June 
200 
1 
the 
Government 
established 
a 
Minister-level 
Committee 
on 
Policy 
for 
the 
Acceleration 
of 
Infrastructure 
Development 
(KPPI 
Committee). 
The Committee 
is 
chaired 
by 
the 
Coordinating 
Minister 
for 
Economic 
Affairs, 
and 
its 
other 
members 
include 
the 
Ministers 
for 
Finance, 
National 
Planning 
(Bappenas), 
and 
the 
key 
infrastructure 
sectors. 
KKPPI’s 
duties 
include: 
(a) 
formulating 
policy 
and 
strategy 
for 
accelerating 
infrastructure 
development, 
including 
through 
creating a 
climate 
conducive to 
private 
investment 
and 
participation; 
(b) 
coordinating integration 
of 
plans and 
programs and 
monitoring 
implementation 
of 
adopted 
policies 
and 
resolving 
emerging problems; 
and 
(c) 
preparing 
an 
improved 
cross-sectoral 
regulation 
on 
public private 
partnerships 
to 
replace 
Keppres 
7. 
The Committee 
is 
assisted 
by 
a 
Secretariat 
and 
supported 
by 
a 
Sub-committee 
for 
Planning 
and 
Investment, 
both 
of 
which 
are 
already operational. 
Work 
on 
the 
revision 
of 
Keppres 
7 
is 
now 
well 
advanced. 
3. 
Sector 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the project 
and 
strategic 
choices: 
The 
Project 
will 
assist 
Government’s 
efforts 
to 
address 
two 
of 
the 
four broad 
challenges 
highlighted 
in 
Section 
B.2, 
namely 
restoring 
Indonesia’s attractiveness 
to 
private 
infrastructure 
investors, and 
promoting 
better 
public 
understanding 
and 
acceptance 
of 
private participation 
in 
infrastructure 
provision. 
It 
will 
focus 
in 
particular 
on 
the 
following 
areas: 
Improving 
cross-sectoral 
and 
sectoral 
policies 
and 
strategies, 
regulatory frameworks, 
and 
related 
operating 
practices 
and 
procedures. 
Strengthening 
the 
organization and 
capacities 
of 
regulatory bodies 
and other 
key 
sector 
agencies, 
and enhancing inter-agency 
coordination 
and cooperation. 
0 
Improving 
the 
availability, 
accessibility, 
dissemination and 
sharing 
of 
information 
on 
or 
relevant 
to 
private 
infrastructure 
development. 
Building 
public 
understanding 
of 
the 
need 
for, 
approaches to, 
and 
benefits 
of 
well 
managed 
private participation 
in 
infrastructure 
delivery. 
Supporting 
the 
preparation 
of 
an 
initial 
set 
of 
demonstration infrastructure projects 
that 
are 
feasible 
for 
private 
investment. 
Restoration 
of 
efficient 
large 
scale 
private 
investment 
in 
infrastructure 
is 
an 
imperative 
rather 
than 
an 
option 
if 
Indonesia 
is 
to 
achieve 
rapid 
and sustainable 
economic 
growth, 
and 
in 
this 
sense 
the 
design 
of 
the 
project 
does 
not 
entail 
making 
strategic decisions, rather the 
project 
seeks 
to 
enhance 
GOI’s 
capacity 
to 
make 
such decisions 
during 
the course 
of 
the 
project. 
Many 
of 
the 
technical 
assistance 
services 
to 
be 
undertaken 
under 
the 
project 
will 
involve 
identifying 
and 
evaluating options 
for 
how 
best 
to 
realize 
such 
investment.

Project 
Description 
Summary 
1. 
Project 
components 
(see 
Annex 
2 
for 
a 
detailed description and 
Annex 
3 
for 
a 
detailed 
cost 
breakdown): 
Overview 
The 
project 
is 
designed 
around 
and 
to 
support 
two 
important 
and 
inter-linked initiatives 
by 
Government 
to restore 
private 
investment 
in 
public 
infrastructure, 
namely: 
0 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
KPPI 
Committee; and 
the 
preparation 
and 
operationalizing 
of 
improved 
cross-sectoral 
policies, 
practices 
and 
procedures 
for 
handling 
private participation 
in 
infrastructure 
provision. 
The 
KPPI 
Committee 
is 
already 
operational and 
well 
advanced 
with 
drafting 
an 
improved 
cross-sectoral 
regulation 
on 
PPI 
to 
replace 
Keppres 
7. 
The 
Project’s 
core 
focus 
is 
on 
assisting 
the 
KPPI 
Committee 
to 
make 
timely 
and 
well-informed 
decisions, 
on 
operationalizing 
the 
new 
cross-sectoral 
framework 
through supporting 
sector-specific 
policy 
and 
regulatory 
reforms, 
on 
strengthening 
institutional 
capacities 
in 
areas 
related 
to 
PPI, and 
on 
improving 
the 
quality 
and 
availability 
of 
information 
on 
PPI-related 
topics. 
Also 
see 
Annex 
12 
for 
the 
Initial 
Project 
Work 
Plan. 
This 
will 
be 
accomplished 
through: 
0 
Cross-sectoral 
technical 
assistance 
and 
advisory 
services, 
including 
the 
development 
of 
a 
country 
framework 
assessment 
for PPI 
policies; 
0 
Sector-specific 
technical 
assistance 
and 
advisory activities, 
including 
sectoral 
assessments 
of 
PPI 
potential 
and strategy; 
0 
Capacity 
building, 
training 
assistance, 
and 
public informatiodeducation 
activities, 
and; 
PMU 
support services. 
The 
agencies 
that 
will 
be 
involved 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
project--notably 
the 
KPPI 
Committee 
and 
key 
sector ministries-have 
limited 
expertise 
in 
the 
PPI 
area, 
but 
of 
necessity 
are 
already 
being 
required 
to 
take decisions 
on 
important 
and 
complex 
issues 
(including 
the 
drafting 
of 
the 
new 
Keppres 
7). 
Accordingly 
the 
project 
will, 
as 
a top 
priority, 
support 
the 
recruitment 
of 
“in-house” 
PPI 
advisors 
to 
assist 
these 
core 
agencies 
with 
their ongoing activities. 
Terms 
of 
reference 
(TOR) 
for 
these 
advisory 
services 
and 
for 
high 
priority 
studies 
have been 
developed 
and 
reviewed 
during 
project 
appraisal. 
However, 
the 
urgency 
of 
mobilizing 
the 
“in-house” 
advisory 
support 
will 
preclude 
the 
TORS for 
all 
envisaged 
activities 
being 
fully 
developed 
prior 
to 
project 
start. 
It 
is 
accordingly intended 
that the 
TORS 
for 
many 
activities 
will 
be 
firmed-up 
during 
the 
initial 
stages 
of 
project implementation 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
“in-house”  advisors.

Key 
policy 
and 
institutional reforms 
supported 
by 
the project: 
The project 
will 
support 
the 
effective 
functioning 
of 
the 
KPPI 
Committee, 
the development 
of 
PPI 
assessments/strategies, 
and the 
operationalization 
of 
the 
planned 
cross-sectoral 
regulation 
on 
public-private 
partnerships 
for 
infrastructure 
provision 
(the 
new 
Keppres 
7 
and related 
regulations). 
These 
will 
in 
turn 
provide 
the 
twin 
supporting 
pillars 
for 
the 
project. 
It 
is 
accordingly 
important 
that: 
(a) 
GO1 
commit 
to 
maintaining 
the 
KPPI 
Committee 
and 
its 
Secretariat 
throughout 
the 
implementation 
period 
of 
the 
project; and 
(b) 
the 
key 
policies 
and 
principles 
contained 
in 
the 
new Keppres 
7 
on 
public-private 
partnerships 
be 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
3. 
Benefits 
and 
target 
population: 
The ultimate 
beneficiaries 
of 
the 
project 
will 
be 
users 
of 
public 
infrastructure 
in 
general, 
and 
users 
of 
transport, 
telecommunications and 
urban infrastructure 
services 
in 
particular. 
Renewed 
private 
investment 
in 
infrastructure 
will 
also create 
new 
employment 
opportunities 
in 
infrastructure construction, 
management and maintenance 
fields 
and 
contribute more 
generally 
to 
economic 
growth. 
4. 
Institutional 
and 
implementation 
arrangements: 
The project 
will 
be implemented 
over 
a 
period 
of 
three 
years 
and 
involve 
several 
central 
government agencies-principally 
MOC 
and 
MSRI 
as 
well 
as 
OCMEA-as 
primary 
implementing 
agencies. 
A 
Project 
Management 
Unit 
will 
report 
to 
and 
work 
under 
the 
technical 
direction 
of 
the 
KKPPI. 
The 
PMU 
is 
chaired 
by 
OCMEA’s 
Assistant 
Deputy 
for 
Transportation 
and 
Telecommunications Infrastructure Development, 
which 
should 
help 
ensure 
the 
project 
supports and 
is 
highly 
responsive 
to 
top-level 
decision-making. 
Administratively, 
the 
project 
will 
form 
part 
of 
the 
OCMEA 
budget. 
The 
PMU 
is 
a newly-established 
(February 
2003) 
body 
but 
its 
design and 
financial 
management 
procedures 
have 
been based 
on 
those 
developed 
for 
the 
ongoing 
Corporate 
Restructuring 
Technical 
Assistance 
Project 
(Loan 
4448-IND) 
and 
reflect 
the 
extensive 
experience gained 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
two 
TAP41 
projects 
(First 
and 
Second 
Technical 
Assistance 
- 
11 
- 
Page  18
Projects 
for 
the 
Public 
and Private 
Provision 
of 
Infrastructure; 
Loans 
3385-IND 
and 
3913-IND). 
The 
project 
flow 
of 
funds 
arrangements 
are 
designed 
to 
be 
broadly 
similar 
to 
those 
for 
the 
TAP4I-I1 
project. 
OCMEA 
has 
already 
recruited 
qualified 
staff 
to 
manage 
the 
project 
preparation 
process 
and 
its 
subsequent 
implementation. 
5. 
The 
Indonesian 
Pilot for 
Enhanced 
Disclosure 
of 
Information 
being pursued 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
Bank’s 
revised 
Information 
Disclosure Policy: 
As 
part 
of 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Bank’s 
revised 
disclosure 
policy, 
countries 
were 
selected 
for 
piloting 
enhanced disclosure 
if 
the 
governments 
of 
these 
countries 
were 
interested 
in 
participating. 
In 
Indonesia 
during 
the 
CAS 
consultations and other discussions, 
both 
the 
government and 
civil 
society 
expressed 
keen 
interest 
in 
substantially 
greater 
access 
to 
information 
on 
Bank 
activities, especially 
during project 
implementation, to 
allow 
full 
public 
discussion 
of 
project implementation 
findings. 
Under 
the 
Indonesia 
pilot 
enhanced disclosure 
is 
proposed 
to 
enable 
civil 
society 
oversight 
leading 
to 
greater 
transparency and 
openness. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
initially 
civil 
society 
will 
require 
time 
to 
become 
familiar 
and reach 
the 
level 
of 
understanding 
of 
the 
information being 
provided, to 
use 
it 
constructively 
to 
reduce 
fiduciary 
risks 
In 
the 
Indonesia 
Pilot 
for 
enhanced 
information 
disclosure 
being 
carried 
out 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
Bank’s 
revised 
Information 
Disclosure 
Policy, 
an approach 
to 
enhanced 
information 
disclosure 
has 
been 
agreed 
with 
BAPPENAS 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Borrower. 
This 
approach consists 
of 
the 
following 
arrangements: 
a. 
b. 
C. 
Agreement 
on 
the approach 
for 
disclosure 
of 
information 
for 
new 
projects 
to 
the 
effect 
that 
specific 
provision 
for 
enhanced disclosure 
will 
be 
built 
into 
the 
project 
arrangements 
during 
project 
preparation 
for 
an agreed 
upon 
list 
of 
projects to 
be included 
in 
the 
initial 
phase 
of 
the 
pilot. 
This 
agreed 
list 
consists 
of 
4 
projects, 
including 
the 
proposed 
Private 
Provision 
of 
Infrastructure 
Technical 
Assistance 
Project. 
(The other 
3 projects 
are 
the 
proposed Water 
Resources 
and 
Irrigation 
Sector 
Management 
Project, 
the 
proposed 
Health 
Workforce 
and 
Services 
Project and 
the 
proposed 
Third 
Kecamatan 
Development 
Project.) 
Annex 
15 
provides 
in 
more detail 
the 
arrangements developed 
by 
the 
KKPI 
secretariat 
to 
put 
in 
place 
an 
anti-corruption 
action plan. 
The 
specific 
issues 
where enhanced disclosure 
has 
been 
agreed 
upon 
concern: 
(i) 
final 
audit 
reports 
issued 
under 
projects 
in 
the 
pilot 
will 
be 
made 
publicly 
available 
by 
both 
the 
Borrower 
and 
the 
Bank: 
(ii) 
the 
mid-term 
report 
on 
progress 
under 
a 
project 
in 
the 
pilot 
will 
be 
made 
publicly 
available 
by 
the 
Borrower; 
and 
(iii) 
the 
procurement 
process, where the 
Borrower 
has 
agreed 
that 
additional 
information 
concerning 
parts 
of 
the 
procurement 
process 
in 
projects 
in 
the 
pilot 
will 
be 
made 
publicly 
available. 
The 
Loan 
Agreement 
for 
this 
Private 
Provision 
of 
Infrastructure 
Technical 
Assistance 
Project (PPITA) 
includes specific 
undertakings 
to 
effectuate 
these 
agreements. These 
undertakings 
would 
eliminate 
the 
need 
for 
GO1 
approval 
to 
be 
obtained 
prior 
to 
the 
public 
release 
of 
such 
information.

GO1 
may 
consider 
moving 
to a 
more

of 
enhanced

based 
on 
this 
guide (together 
with 
the 
covenants 
on 
disclosure 
of 
audits, 
mid-term

are 
expected 
to 
facilitate 
the

D. 
Project 
Rationale 
1. 
Project 
alternatives 
considered 
and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
Loan 
versus 
Grants. 
Realizing 
the 
project 
objectives 
will 
require 
a 
comprehensive and 
coherent, 
cross-sector approach that 
will 
be 
very 
difficult 
to accomplish 
using 
fragmented 
grant 
financing. 
The project 
will 
not, however, 
finance 
all 
PPI-related 
TA 
needs 
in 
the 
target 
sectors 
and 
the 
project's 
PPI 
advisory 
teams 
will 
assist 
government 
to 
secure 
supplementary 
grant-financed 
assistance 
and 
to 
ensure 
this 
is 
integrated 
with 
other 
activities and 
its 
outputs 
are 
used 
effectively. 
Private 
sectorfocus: 
Unlike 
the 
two 
TAP41 
projects, the 
proposed 
project 
focuses 
narrowly 
on 
activities 
that 
will 
support 
restoring private 
investment 
in 
infrastructure. 
This 
decision reflects: 
(a) 
the 
scale 
and 
complexity 
of 
the challenges 
this 
presents 
in 
the 
current environment 
(there 
was 
strong 
private 
sector 
interest 
in 
Indonesia infrastructure projects when 
TAP41-11 
was 
prepared); 
(b) 
lessons 
emerging 
from 
TAP4I-11's 
implementation 
indicating 
its 
broad 
scope 
detracted 
from 
its 
effectiveness 
in 
achieving 
the 
strategic 
private 
infrastructure 
agenda; 
and 
(c) 
the 
availability 
of 
other 
instruments 
to 
support 
improved 
public provision 
of 
infrastructure 
(e.g., 
the 
Eastern 
Indonesia 
Region 
Transport Project 
supports 
more efficient 
planning, 
programming 
and 
implementation 
of 
road 
infrastructure 
works). 
Sector 
focus: 
The 
Project 
will 
focus 
primariZy 
on 
those 
infrastructure 
sectors 
where there 
are 
seen 
to 
be 
good 
prospects 
for 
attracting private 
investment 
in 
the 
medium-term, 
and where 
needed 
technical 
assistance 
is 
not 
already 
being provided 
from 
other 
sources. 
The 
identified 
core 
sectors 
are 
transport 
(including potentially 
roads, 
railways, 
ports 
and 
shipping, 
inland 
waterways, 
and 
civil 
aviation), 
telecommunications, 
and 
urban infrastructure. 
Although 
the energy 
sector 
is 
of 
critical 
importance, 
regulatory 
reform 
and sector 
restructuring 
are 
already well-advanced, and 
existing 
and 
planned 
TA 
support 
from 
the 
Bank, 
ADB 
and 
USAID 
appears 
sufficient 
to meet 
-13- 
Page  20
PPI-related 
needs 
in 
the 
power 
and domestic 
gas 
sectors. 
While 
there 
is 
also 
a 
considerable 
body 
of 
recent, 
ongoing, and 
planned 
PPI-related 
TA 
in 
the 
urban infrastructure 
sector-and 
particularly 
the 
water 
supply 
sub-sector-and 
the 
transport 
sector, 
the 
coverage 
is 
far 
from 
complete and 
there 
are 
substantial 
unmet 
need. 
During 
project 
preparation, the focus 
has 
been 
on 
the 
core 
sectors 
but 
the 
project 
design 
has 
left 
open 
the 
possibility 
of 
financing 
PPI-related 
TAs 
in 
other 
sectors 
later, 
providing 
that 
a 
compelling 
case 
is 
made 
by 
the 
proposing 
agencies. 
Shaping public 
perceptions. 
The 
project 
design 
accords 
high 
priority 
to 
“socializing” 
the 
need 
for 
and 
benefits 
of 
well 
managed PPI. 
While 
the 
conduct 
of 
policy 
studies, 
drafting 
of 
improved 
regulations, and 
delivery 
of 
training 
will 
help 
inform 
opinions and 
attitudes, 
it 
is 
considered that 
these 
activities 
will 
need 
to 
be 
complemented 
by 
a 
conscious “outreach” 
effort 
specifically 
targeted 
at 
building 
a strong 
constituency 
for 
change. 
Primary responsibility 
for 
championing 
the 
case 
for 
private 
infrastructure 
within 
GO1 
and 
with 
the 
DPR 
with 
rests 
with 
the 
KPPI 
Committee, 
and 
the 
project 
will 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
supporting 
its 
efforts 
in 
this 
area. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Project 
will 
also assist 
the 
central 
P3 
unit 
and 
network 
to make available 
better 
information 
on 
private 
infrastructure 
provision 
to NGOs, 
the 
media, 
and 
the general 
public. 
Privatization. 
Project activities 
that 
involve improving 
sector 
policies, 
reforming 
legal 
and 
regulatory frameworks, 
and strengthening capacities 
of 
regulatory 
and other 
institutions 
will 
necessarily support 
efforts 
to 
accelerate 
the 
privatization 
of 
Indonesia’s 
infrastructure 
SOEs. 
In 
addition, 
it 
is 
envisaged that 
the 
project 
could 
also support the 
privatization 
program more 
directly 
through 
support 
for 
studies that 
encompass 
developing 
privatization 
strategies 
for 
specific 
sectors 
or 
sub-sectors. 
However, 
the 
project 
would 
not 
finance 
legal, 
financial 
or 
other 
advisors 
to 
handle 
specific 
privatization 
transactions. 
Financing 
of 
private 
infrastructure 
investments. 
The 
activities 
encompassed 
by 
the 
project 
are 
designed 
generally 
to 
enhance 
the 
bankability 
of 
infrastructure projects proposed 
for 
private 
financing. 
More 
particularly, 
it 
is 
envisaged the 
project 
would 
support 
the 
formulation 
of 
policies 
concerning 
public 
support 
for 
private 
infrastructure projects. 
However, 
it 
is 
not 
envisaged 
the 
project’s 
scope 
would 
extend 
into 
the 
financial 
sector 
reform 
domain 
or, 
for 
example, 
to 
providing 
support 
for 
activities 
designed 
to 
strengthen domestic 
capital 
markets 
and 
develop 
new infrastructure-specific 
financing 
vehicles. 
Dispute 
resolution. 
During 
project 
preparation 
the 
KKPPI 
felt 
that 
it 
would not 
be 
appropriate 
to 
include 
in 
the 
design 
of 
this 
project 
provision 
for 
financing 
legal 
and other 
specialist 
advisors 
to 
assist 
with 
the 
resolution 
of 
individual high profile 
disputes, 
such 
as 
those 
that have 
arisen 
in 
power 
and 
telecoms 
sectors, 
but 
that 
it 
probably 
would 
be 
important 
to 
include provision 
for 
the 
development 
of 
guidelines 
and procedures 
for 
anticipating 
and 
dealing 
with 
the 
types 
of 
disputes 
that 
may 
arise 
with 
smaller projects. 
It 
is 
anticipated 
that 
dispute 
resolution 
will 
be 
a 
part 
of 
the 
sectoral 
and 
cross-sectoral 
policy 
and 
regulations 
development. 
Project 
Preparation 
Support. 
Provision 
has 
been made 
for 
the 
preparation and tendering 
of 
a 
number 
of 
demonstration projects 
for 
private participation 
for two main 
reasons. 
First, 
the 
credibility 
of 
Indonesia’s 
private 
sector 
infrastructure 
program 
will 
be 
greatly 
enhanced 
by 
its 
being 
in 
a 
position to offer 
and 
bring 
to 
early 
financial 
closure 
an 
initial 
set 
of 
soundly 
prepared 
projects. 
Second, 
the 
process 
of 
preparing demonstration projects 
also 
provides 
an 
important 
avenue 
for 
capacity 
building. 
The 
selection 
of 
initial 
projects 
will 
be 
demand-driven, 
with 
proposals 
being 
subject 
to 
rigorous 
screening against 
criteria 
which 
have 
been broadly 
agreed 
- 
14- 
Page  21
during 
appraisal 
of 
the 
Project 
(see 
Annex 
13), 
and 
which 
will 
be 
further 
refined 
during 
the 
development 
of 
sectoral 
policy 
and strategy 
assessments 
with 
each 
participating 
ministry. 
2. 
Major 
related 
projects 
financed 
by 
the 
Bank 
and/or 
other 
development 
agencies (completed, 
ongoing 
and 
planned). 
Several recent and 
ongoing 
projects financed 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
other 
lenders 
have 
addressed, 
in 
some 
way 
or 
form, 
issues 
encompassed 
by 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
proposed 
Project. 
These 
may usefully 
be 
divided 
into two 
broad 
groups: 
(a) 
cross-sectoral 
technical 
assistance 
projects 
with 
a specific 
focus 
on 
private participation 
in 
infrastructure, 
and 
(b) 
sector-specific 
infrastructure investment 
projects that 
include 
technical 
assistance 
components 
aimed 
at 
building 
the 
foundations 
for 
private participation. 
In 
addition, 
some 
important 
technical 
assistance 
has 
also been 
financed 
under 
various grant 
programs. 
Cross-Sectoral 
Infrastructure 
TA 
Projects. 
The 
Bank 
has 
financed 
two 
technical 
assistance 
projects 
that were 
specifically 
designed 
to 
support Indonesia's 
efforts 
to 
promote private 
investment 
in 
Indonesia. 
Technical 
Assistance 
Project 
for 
the 
Public 
and 
Private 
Provision 
of 
Infrastructure 
(TAP4I-I; 
Loan 
3385-IND). 
TAP4I-I 
was 
approved 
in 
1991 
and closed 
in 
March 
1997 
after 
a 
total 
extension 
of 
30-months. 
Its 
objectives 
were 
to 
assist 
GO1 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
its 
framework 
for 
infrastructure 
development 
by 
initiating 
immediate 
actions to: 
(a) 
assess 
priorities 
in 
current infrastructure 
plans 
for 
reducing 
infrastructure bottlenecks; 
and 
(b) 
(i) 
augment and 
enhance 
program 
evaluation 
capability 
(including, 
in 
particular, 
in 
cross-sectoral linkages and 
environment 
aspects) 
within 
BAPPENAS 
and 
(ii) 
project 
preparation 
capability 
in 
line 
agencies 
responsible 
for key 
infrastructure 
sectors, 
including 
projects financed 
by 
or 
jointly with 
the 
private 
sector. 
OED's 
Performance 
Audit 
report, 
issued 
in 
June 
1999, 
rated 
the 
outcome 
as 
Satisfactory, 
institutional 
development 
impact 
as 
Substantial, 
and 
sustainability 
as 
Likely. 
TAP4I-I 
contributed significantly 
to 
the 
assessment 
of 
infrastructure 
plans and bottlenecks 
in 
the 
power 
and 
transport (railways, 
toll 
roads 
and ports) 
sectors, 
and 
helped to 
identify 
and establish 
a 
basis 
for 
increased 
private participation 
in 
service 
delivery 
in 
these 
sectors. 
In 
the 
power 
sector, 
it 
provided 
technical 
assistance 
on 
the 
negotiation 
of 
technical and 
tariff 
aspects 
of 
the 
Paiton 
I 
private 
power 
project, 
and 
on 
the 
formulation 
of 
a 
strategy 
for 
sector 
restructuring, regulatory 
reform 
and 
private participation 
(in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
Cirata Hydroelectric 
Phase 
I1 
Project 
(Loan 3602-IND)) 
and 
for 
more effective 
development 
of 
Indonesia's large 
geothermal energy 
resources. 
In 
the 
maritime 
transport 
sector, 
it 
supported 
a 
study 
to 
develop a 
long-term 
strategy 
for 
port 
development 
in 
western Java and southern 
Sumatera, 
while 
in 
the 
toll 
road 
sector 
it 
financed 
major feasibility 
studies 
used 
in 
soliciting 
private 
proposals. 
By 
contrast, 
the 
project 
provided only 
limited 
support 
in 
the 
urban infrastructure 
sector 
and 
none 
in 
the 
telecommunications 
sector. 
As 
implied 
by 
the 
title, 
TAP4I-I's 
scope 
was 
not 
restricted to 
private 
infrastructure 
and 
a 
significant 
proportion 
of 
the 
available 
resources 
were 
used 
to 
support 
preparation 
of 
infrastructure 
projects 
intended 
for 
public 
sector 
financing. 
Although 
not 
explicitly 
envisaged 
during 
project 
preparation, 
the 
PMU-which 
was 
located 
in 
Bappenas-quickly 
became 
the 
locus 
of 
GOI' 
s 
cross-sectoral 
initiatives relating to 
private 
participation 
in 
infrastructure. 
The 
project's impacts 
were, 
however, 
ultimately 
limited 
inasmuch 
- 
15- 
Page  22
as 
politically 
connected 
project 
sponsors 
were 
basically 
able 
to 
drive 
the 
PPI 
agenda 
in 
all 
sectors. 
Second 
Technical 
Assistance 
Project 
for 
the 
Public 
and 
Private 
Provision 
of 
Znfrastructure 
(TAP4Z-ZZ; 
Loan 3913-ZND). 
TAP4I-I1 
was 
approved 
in 
June 
1995 
and 
closed 
on 
December 
31, 
2001 
after 
a 
total 
extension 
of 
21 
months, 
with 
the 
Draft 
ICR 
rating 
it 
as 
Satisfactory 
on 
achievement 
of 
development 
objectives 
and 
implementation 
performance. 
The 
original 
project 
objectives were to: 
(a) 
assess 
strategic 
priorities for 
reducing 
infrastructure 
bottlenecks; develop 
an 
updated strategy 
for 
public-private 
partnerships and sustainable 
frameworks 
for 
private 
participation 
in 
provision 
of 
infrastructure; 
(c) 
redefine 
the 
role 
of 
central 
and 
local 
authorities 
in 
the 
identification, 
preparation, and 
implementation 
of 
infrastructure 
projects, 
and 
(d) 
enhance 
program 
evaluation 
capacity 
within 
Bappenas 
and 
regional 
planning 
bodies 
and 
project 
preparation 
and 
implementation 
capabilities 
(including 
development 
of 
sound 
environmental 
and 
social practices) 
in 
line 
agencies 
and 
local 
organizations responsible 
for 
various infrastructure 
investments. 
These 
were subsequently broadened 
to 
enable 
the 
project 
to 
support 
Government’s 
efforts 
to 
contain and 
minimize 
possible 
disruption 
to economic and 
social 
infrastructure 
that 
might 
be 
caused 
by 
the 
transition 
to 
Year 
2000. 
The 
implementation 
period 
of 
the 
project 
was 
bisected 
by 
the 
onset 
of 
the economic 
crisis 
and 
more specifically 
by 
the 
issue 
of 
Keppres 
39 
of 
September 
1997, 
which 
required many 
major 
private 
and 
public 
infrastructure projects 
to 
be 
postponed 
or reviewed, and 
by 
the 
subsequent 
issue 
of 
Keppres 
7 
in 
January 
1998, 
which 
belatedly 
established 
an 
overarching 
framework 
for 
private 
participation 
in 
infrastructure. 
The 
project 
was 
managed 
by 
the 
PMU 
established 
for 
TAP4I-I. 
Its 
sector 
focus 
was 
primarily on 
sub-national 
/ 
urban infrastructure, 
and 
particularly 
water supply. 
In 
addition 
to 
supporting 
development 
of 
specific 
water 
supply 
schemes 
for 
private 
participation, 
the 
project 
also 
assisted 
in 
paving 
the 
way 
for 
establishing regulatory 
bodies-notably 
for 
Jakarta-and 
in 
developing 
strategies 
for 
dealing 
with 
projects 
that 
had stalled 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
crisis. 
In 
contrast 
to 
TAP4I-I, 
there 
were 
no 
sub-components 
specific 
to 
the 
energy 
sector, 
principally 
because 
adequate 
resources 
were 
available 
from 
other 
sources. 
However, 
TAP4I-I1 
did 
support several 
important 
initiatives 
in 
the 
transport 
sector, 
including 
most notably 
the 
Java 
Arterial 
Road 
Network 
Study 
(JARNS) 
and 
preliminary 
studies 
concerning 
the 
feasibility 
of 
establishing a 
road 
fund. 
The 
PMU 
continued 
to 
serve 
as 
Indonesia’s 
de 
facto 
Public-Private 
Partnership 
(P3) 
center 
and 
played 
an 
important 
role 
in 
the 
drafting 
of 
Keppres 
7 
and 
its 
implementing 
regulations 
and 
guidelines. 
It 
also served 
as 
the 
central 
repository 
of 
information 
and 
expertise 
on 
private 
participation, 
and 
its 
in-house 
advisors 
provided 
extensive 
ad 
hoc advice 
and 
assistance 
to 
sectoral and 
sub-national 
agencies. 
The 
ICR 
for 
TAP4I-I1 
rates 
the 
project 
outcomes 
as 
Satisfactory 
for both 
achievement 
of 
Development Objectives 
(DO) 
and 
Implementation 
Progress 
(Ip).

Sector 
Investment 
Projects. 
Several 
Bank-financed 
infrastructure projects 
approved 
during 
the 
1990s 
had 
significant 
TA 
components 
aimed 
at 
supporting 
sector 
reform 
and 
restructuring. 
These 
include, 
for 
example: 
0 
Power 
sector: 
A 
series 
of 
Bank-financed power 
projects 
supported 
technical 
assistance 
in 
the 
broad 
area 
of 
power 
sector 
restructuring 
and 
regulatory 
reform.  Notable 
among 
these 
are 
the 
Cirata Hydroelectric 
Phase 
I1 
Project (Loan 
3602-IND; 
closed 
June 
1999), 
which--along 
with 
TAP4I-I-financed 
important 
back-to-back 
studies 
on 
Power 
Sector 
Regulatory 
Reform 
and 
Development 
of 
Private 
Power 
that 
provided 
the 
analytical foundations 
for 
the 
Government's 
August 
1998 
White 
Paper 
on 
Power 
Sector 
Reform 
Policy. The 
ongoing 
Second 
Power Transmission 
& 
Distribution 
Project 
(Loan 
3978-IND) 
is 
financing 
technical 
assistance 
to 
PLN 
with 
its 
corporate and 
financial 
restructuring, 
an 
important 
element 
of 
the 
adopted 
reform 
agenda, 
and a planned 
follow-on 
energy sector operation-now 
scheduled 
for 
Board 
presentation 
in 
late 
FY03-will 
finance 
continuation 
of 
this 
work. 
ADB 
and 
USAID 
are 
also 
important 
actors 
in 
the 
power 
sector, 
and 
both 
are 
currently 
financing 
assistance 
to 
the 
Directorate 
General 
of 
Electricity 
and 
Energy 
Utilization 
with 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
adopted 
sector 
restructuring 
and 
reform 
agenda. 
The 
US AID-financed 
Energy 
Restructuring 
Activities 
Group 
is 
playing 
a 
lead 
role 
in 
assisting 
GO1 to 
develop a 
strategy 
for 
restoring 
private 
investment 
in 
the 
sector. 
Telecommunications 
Sector: 
The 
Bank, through 
the 
ongoing 
Telecommunications 
Sector 
Modernization 
Project 
(Loan 3904-IND; 
Satisfactory 
on 
DO 
and 
IP) 
and 
the 
now-closed 
Telecommunications 
IV 
Project (Loan 
3482-IND; 
ICR 
overall rating 
of 
Satisfactory), 
was 
instrumental 
in 
promoting 
important 
sector 
reforms. 
These 
include 
the 
opening-up 
to 
private 
participation 
in 
the 
mid-1990s 
and 
the subsequent 
passage 
of 
a new Telecommunications 
Law 
in 
1999 that, among 
others, 
removes 
"exclusivities" 
previously 
enjoyed 
by 
the 
two 
telecommunications 
SOEs 
and 
permits 
effective competition. 
The 
closing 
date 
for 
the 
Sector 
Modernization Project 
was 
extended 
by 
one 
year 
to 
June 
2002 to 
enable 
completion 
of 
the 
physical 
investment 
components, 
but 
the 
balance 
of 
MOC's 
allocation 
for 
technical 
assistance 
on 
sector 
reform 
issues 
was 
cancelled 
due 
to 
MOC 
being 
late 
in 
submitting 
proposals 
to 
MOF 
for 
using 
these 
funds. 
The Bank 
is 
supporting 
the 
ongoing Informatics 
Infrastructure 
Project (Loan 
4244-IND). 
While 
this 
project 
does 
not 
focus 
directly 
on 
telecommunications 
sector 
reform, 
some 
of 
the 
project 
components 
are 
complementary 
in 
character. 
USAID 
is 
currently 
providing 
very 
limited 
ad 
hoc advisory 
assistance 
in 
this 
sector-including 
on 
interconnection, 
universal 
service 
obligations 
and 
regulatory 
arrangements-through 
its 
"PEG7 
project, 
but 
has 
no 
plans to 
provide 
expanded support and welcomes 
Bank 
involvement. 
Transport 
Sector: 
During 
the 
last 
decade, 
the 
Bank's 
investment 
lending 
for 
transport 
has 
focused 
exclusively 
on 
the 
land 
transport 
sub-sector, 
including 
inter-urban 
and 
rural 
roads, 
urban 
transport, and 
railways. 
During 
the 
early 
90s, 
the 
first 
Jabotabek 
Urban 
Development 
Project financed 
preliminary 
studies 
on 
the 
development 
of 
a 
strategy 
and policies 
for 
securing 
private 
participation 
in 
the 
development 
of 
a rail-based 
mass 
transit 
system 
for 
Jakarta. 
GOI's 
subsequent 
plans 
to 
proceed 
with 
two mutually 
inconsistent 
mass 
transit 
schemes 
proposed 
by 
politically 
connected groups 
precluded planned 
further 
Bank 
assistance 
in 
this 
area. 
The 
ongoing 
Railway 
Efficiency 
Project (Loan 
4106-IND) 
is 
providing 
support 
for 
restructuring and 
commercializing 
the 
railway 
company and 
reforming 
its 
financial

relationship 
with 
Government 
in 
line 
with 
a 
policy 
framework 
adopted 
in 
the 
mid-1990s. 
While 
not 
specifically 
aimed 
at 
enabling 
and 
promoting private 
participation, 
many 
elements 
of 
the 
agreed 
reforms 
are 
prerequisites 
for 
effective private 
investment 
in 
the 
rail 
subsector. 
Progress 
on 
implementing 
the 
reform 
program 
has 
been patchy, 
however, 
and 
the 
Project 
is 
currently rated 
Unsatisfactory 
on 
implementation 
performance. 
In 
the 
roads 
sector, 
the 
principal 
sources 
of 
financing 
for 
technical 
assistance 
relating 
to 
private participation 
have 
been 
the 
two TAP41 
projects. 
In 
addition, 
PPIAF 
is 
currently financing 
a 
study requested 
by 
GO1 
(MSRI) 
for 
a 
review 
of 
policy 
options 
for 
restructuring 
the 
state-owned 
toll 
road 
company, 
Jasa 
Marga. 
ADB 
has 
financed 
studies 
and 
technical 
assistance 
relevant to 
private 
participation 
in 
the transport 
sector 
under sub-sectoral 
investment 
loans and 
TA 
Grants. 
This 
assistance 
includes a 
recent 
Transport 
Sector 
Strategy 
Study financed 
under 
an 
inland 
waterways 
project 
and 
some 
broad-scope 
private 
participation 
TA 
in 
the 
mid-1 
990s. 
Urban 
Sector: 
The 
very 
innovative 
Urban 
Sector 
Loan 
and 
accompanying 
Policy 
Action 
Plan, agreed 
in 
1988 between the 
Bank 
and 
GOI, 
established the 
agenda 
for 
a very active 
urban 
program 
in 
Indonesia 
from 
1988 
through 
1998 
and 
the 
onset 
of 
the 
multifaceted 
crises 
which 
have changed 
the 
sociopolitical 
agenda. 
The 
ten 
years 
of 
urban 
sector 
policy reform 
and investment 
saw 
major 
progress 
infrastructure decentralization and 
services 
provision 
in 
most 
Indonesian urban 
areas. 
The 
Bank's nearly 
$1 
billion 
in 
lending 
in 
the 
sector 
was 
matched 
by 
other 
donors, 
including 
the 
ADB, 
USAID 
and 
others, 
while 
UNCHS, 
GTZ 
and 
other 
donors also 
worked 
cooperatively 
in 
attempting 
to 
build 
capacity at 
all 
levels to 
improve 
the 
management 
of 
urban 
services 
delivery. 
However, 
the 
enormity 
of 
the 
task 
had 
become 
increasingly 
clear even 
before 
the 
crisis 
and the 
new 
decentralization 
laws 
fundamentally 
changed 
local 
government 
fiscal 
and 
manpower 
capacities. 
Many 
local 
governments 
had 
begun to 
consider 
the 
benefits 
of 
private 
sector 
involvement 
with 
the 
support 
of 
the 
integrated 
planning 
and 
needs 
analysis approach advocated 
in 
the 
Urban 
Policy 
Action 
Plan 
and 
subsequent 
projects. 
In 
most 
cities 
these 
discussions were 
limited 
to 
revenue-producing 
facilities 
and 
services, such 
as 
water 
supply 
and 
solid 
waste 
disposal. 
In 
all 
cases 
major 
potential 
investments were 
not 
discussed 
with 
potential private 
investors 
if 
the 
cities perceived 
the 
possibility 
of 
central 
government 
grant 
funds 
becoming 
available 
(e.g., 
sewerage, 
public 
transport, 
etc.). 
The 
implementation 
of 
GOI's 
new decentralization 
laws 
should 
clarify 
the 
responsibilities 
of 
local 
governments 
for 
providing 
services 
to 
their 
citizens, and 
bring 
into 
sharp 
focus 
the 
need 
to 
involve 
private 
investors to 
help 
close 
the 
huge 
gaps 
in 
almost 
every 
locality 
between 
services 
needs 
and 
current 
delivery 
capacities 
(e.g., 
the 
almost 
total 
lack 
of 
functioning 
sanitation and 
sewerage 
systems 
in 
Indonesian cities 
cannot 
be 
overcome 
by 
public 
investment 
alone, 
particularly 
in 
the 
post-crisis 
financial 
conditions). 
An 
Urban 
Sector 
Review 
was 
recently completed 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
should 
assist 
the 
dialogue among 
the 
Bank, 
Kimpraswil 
and 
urban 
local 
governments 
regarding 
the 
needs, 
priorities 
and 
strategies 
to 
address 
urban 
services deficiencies, 
which 
will 
necessarily 
involve 
significant 
roles 
for 
the 
private 
sector 
in 
investment, management 
and 
maintenance 
of 
urban 
service 
systems. 
Water 
Supply: 
Since the 
last 
major Bank 
water 
supply 
project (JUDP 
11) 
closed 
in 
1996, the 
Bank 
has 
attempted 
to 
engage 
GO1 
in 
a 
policy 
dialogue to 
reform 
the 
regulation 
and 
management 
of 
water 
supply 
provision, 
including 
appropriate 
roles 
for 
the 
private 
sector. 
In 
1997 
the 
Bank 
produced a 
sector 
policy 
paper 
which 
recommended 
GO1 rely on 
private 
investment, management 
and other 
forms 
of 
partnership 
to improve 
water 
supply 
coverage

and 
quality. However, 
with 
the 
onset 
of 
the 
economic/political 
crises 
and 
the 
rapid 
changes 
in 
government 
during 
the 
past 
five 
years, 
it 
has 
been 
very 
difficult 
to 
sustain such 
a 
dialogue. 
As 
a crisis 
response, 
the 
Bank 
has 
provided 
technical 
assistance 
(with 
ASEM 
grant support) 
aimed 
at 
assisting 
local 
PDAMs 
(water 
utilities) 
to 
reschedule 
their 
debts 
to 
the 
Central 
Government 
after 
reaching a 
tripartite 
agreement 
between 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance, 
the 
concerned 
local 
government and 
the 
PDAM 
on 
tariff 
structures and 
accomplishment 
of 
key 
financial 
and 
operational indicators. 
In 
2001, 
WBI 
and the 
ADB 
jointly 
hosted a 
major 
seminar 
in 
Jakarta 
to 
discuss 
water 
sector 
reforms 
in 
the 
context 
of 
decentralization. 
In 
the 
meanwhile, 
the 
government 
renegotiated 
the 
two 
concession contracts 
for 
Jakarta water 
supply, and 
constituted a regulatory 
body 
at 
City 
Government 
level 
to 
oversee the 
contracts. 
The 
outcomes have been 
quite 
disappointing,  and 
tariff 
issues 
have become 
extremely 
political. 
In 
the 
past 
year, 
however, 
the 
Center 
for 
Infrastructure Investment 
Development 
in 
the 
Ministry 
Kimpraswil 
(MSRI) 
has 
facilitated 
the 
successful 
conclusion 
of 
concession 
contracts 
with 
the 
local 
governments 
of 
the 
cities 
of 
Pekanbam, 
Tegal 
and 
Tanggerang 
for 
water supply 
(as 
well 
as 
solid 
waste 
management 
in 
Depok), 
with 
TA 
support 
from 
the 
Asian 
Development 
Bank. 
This 
is 
significant 
because 
it 
validates 
the 
availability 
of 
private 
sector 
financing 
for 
water 
supply 
investments 
in 
Indonesia. 
However, 
in 
general, 
problems 
related 
to 
(a) 
lack 
of 
adequate 
regulatory 
measures, 
(b) 
political 
interference 
by 
local 
government 
officials, 
and 
(c) 
the 
absence 
of 
clear 
definitions 
of 
roles and responsibilities 
of 
local 
governments and 
central 
ministries 
continue to hinder 
credible 
PSP 
interest 
in 
the 
sector. 
The 
Bank 
anticipates that 
GO1 
and 
several 
local 
governments 
will 
utilize 
the 
technical 
assistance 
funds 
made 
available 
under 
this 
project 
to 
strengthen 
the 
policy 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
for 
private 
water 
supply 
investments, 
as 
well 
as 
to 
conduct 
selected 
local 
studies 
to 
attract 
private 
sector 
interest 
in 
water supply.

Lessons 
learned 
and 
reflected 
in 
the 
project 
design: 
(First) 
Technical 
Assistance 
Project 
for 
the 
Public 
and 
Private 
Provision 
of 
Infrastructure. 
The 
OED 
Project 
Performance 
Audit 
Report 
(Report 
19462, 
June 
16, 
1999) 
identified 
the 
following 
main 
lessons 
learned: 
Counterpart 
funding 
should 
be 
significant 
to 
ensure 
increased 
ownership 
and 
sustainability 
of 
this 
type 
of 
project. 
The 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
project 
management 
unit 
depends 
on 
the 
PMU's 
capacity 
to 
access 
key 
decision-makers 
in 
both 
the 
national 
development 
planning 
agency 
and 
the 
executing 
agencies, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
strength 
of 
its 
operational staff. 
Free-standing 
and 
open-ended technical 
assistance 
projects 
need 
to 
emphasize 
1) 
rapidity 
of 
review 
and 
approval 
process 
of 
requests 
for 
financing 
and 
2) 
agreement 
at 
appraisal 
on 
a 
series 
of 
terms 
of 
reference and 
project 
development 
packages. 
Technical 
assistance 
projects 
involving 
executing agentddecentralized 
units 
should 
focus 
more 
on 
these 
units. 
Intermediate 
results 
from 
project 
components 
to overall 
project 
objectives 
(from 
implementing 
studies 
to 
concluding 
contracts) 
must 
be 
made clear 
to 
them 
from 
the 
beginning. 
Specific guidelines 
must 
be 
provided 
by 
the 
PMU 
to 
such 
agencies 
to 
avoid 
having 
to 
reject 
requests 
for 
financing. 
Good 
supervision 
and 
continuity 
in 
the 
supervision 
team 
is 
critical 
for 
satisfactory 
project 
implementation. 
The 
size 
and 
skill 
mix 
of 
the 
team 
should 
be 
adjusted depending 
on 
the 
complexity 
of 
project 
components and 
the 
sectors 
they 
address. 
Second 
Technical 
Assistance 
Project 
for 
the 
Public 
and 
Private 
Provision 
of 
Infrastructure. 
TAP41-I1 
was 
approved 
in 
June 
1995, 
some 
21 
months 
before 
TAP4I-I 
was 
completed, and 
some 
four 
years 
before 
the 
above 
OED 
Performance 
Audit 
Report 
was 
issued. 
Its 
design 
nonetheless 
attempted 
to 
address some 
but 
not 
all-of 
the 
lessons 
flagged 
by 
the 
OED 
audit. 
In 
particular, 
it 
sought 
to 
ensure 
a 
substantial 
pipeline 
of 
well 
prepared 
sub-components 
was 
ready 
by 
the 
time 
of 
appraisal, 
although 
in 
the event 
many 
of 
those 
identified 
subsequently 
lost 
the support 
of 
the 
sponsoring 
sector agencies 
or 
were 
financed 
from 
other 
sources. 
The 
Project 
closed 
in 
December 
2001 
and 
preparation 
of 
the 
ICR 
was 
completed 
in 
June 
2002. 
The 
task 
of 
identifying 
meaningful 
lessons 
is 
complicated 
by 
the 
dramatic 
change 
in 
Indonesia's 
circumstances and attractiveness 
to 
private infrastructure 
investors 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
economic 
crisis.  Nonetheless, 
a number 
of 
important points 
emerged 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
overall 
strategy 
for 
restoring 
PPI: 
Sector 
institutions 
need 
to 
better 
integrate 
private 
sector 
participation 
within 
their overall 
infrastructure  development 
policy 
formulation, 
planning, 
and implementation activities. 
Private 
infrastructure projects 
are 
often 
being 
handled 
by 
different 
groups 
within 
sector 
institutions, 
and there 
has 
been 
a 
tendency 
for 
those 
promoting traditional public 
sector 
programs 
to 
undermine 
the 
case 
for 
private participation 
and hence send 
mixed 
messages 
to 
prospective investors. 
Moreover, 
officials 
involved 
with 
promoting private 
participation 
often 
show 
a 
limited 
grasp 
of 
what 
the 
private 
sector can 
bring 
to 
infrastructure 
projects 
and 
what they 
will 
require 
in 
retum 
(including 
with 
respect 
to 
tariffs 
and 
possible 
needs 
for 
government 
supports).

Don 
’t 
under-estimate resistance 
to 
change 
within public 
institutions. 
As 
noted 
in 
Section 
B 
.2, 
transparently managed 
private 
section participation-whether 
through 
green-field 
projects or privatization-may 
threaten vested 
interests. 
This 
applies 
in 
particular 
to 
private 
projects 
that 
would 
encroach 
on 
the 
domains 
of 
public 
enterprises that 
are 
now 
enjoying 
monopoly 
or quasi-monopoly positions. 
Efforts 
to 
promote 
rapid 
and 
sustainable 
private 
infrastructure 
development 
should 
therefore 
include carefully 
designed 
and 
coordinated 
actions 
to 
anticipate 
and 
address 
such resistance. 
Champions 
are 
needed. 
As 
indicated 
previously, 
the 
TAP4I-PMU 
has 
functioned 
as 
Indonesia’s 
de 
facto 
promoter 
of 
private 
infrastructure investment 
and 
P3 
center. 
However, 
its 
influence 
and effectiveness 
was 
constrained 
by 
the 
absence 
of 
strong 
political 
champions 
and 
by 
its 
remoteness 
from 
key 
decision-makers. 
Champions 
are 
needed 
both 
to 
lend 
weight 
to 
efforts 
to 
overcome 
institutional 
resistance 
and to 
help 
shape 
efforts 
to 
overcome 
public 
opposition 
to 
an 
expanded 
private 
sector 
role. 
Demonstration projects 
have 
value. 
The 
preparation and 
implementation 
of 
demonstration 
or 
pilot 
projects provides 
an 
important 
means 
of 
refining 
and 
applying policies, 
and can 
play 
a 
catalytic 
role 
in 
attracting 
private 
investment.  Negative 
lessons 
in 
particular 
can greatly 
assist 
the 
design 
of 
future 
projects. 
While 
institutional 
and 
regulatory 
reform 
should 
ideally 
precede 
project 
interventions, 
there 
may be 
instances where 
such 
reforms 
can appropriately 
be 
refined 
in 
parallel 
with 
the 
design 
of 
demonstration projects. 
The 
key 
lessons 
and 
issues 
from 
TAP4I-11 
relevant to 
the 
design 
of 
a new technical 
assistance 
operation 
include: 
Need 
for 
clear 
and well-focused objectives. 
The 
objectives 
of 
TAP4I-I1 
were very broad, 
as 
also were 
the 
criteria 
for 
deciding 
whether 
proposed 
studies 
or technical 
assistance 
would 
be 
eligible 
for 
support 
under 
it. 
While 
the 
Project financed 
much 
useful 
assistance, 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
relate 
the 
resultant 
outputs 
meaningfully to 
its 
overarching 
development goals. 
The 
objectives 
of 
a 
follow-on 
operation 
should 
be 
more 
narrowly 
focused 
on 
enabling 
private 
participation 
in 
infrastructure rather 
than 
on 
infrastructure 
development 
in 
general. 
Need 
for 
an 
efSective 
linkage 
to 
senior decision-makers. 
The 
TAP4I-II 
steering 
committee 
did 
not 
function 
as 
envisaged 
and 
the PMU-and 
hence 
the 
project-became 
increasingly 
isolated 
from 
high-level 
decision-making 
on 
key 
infrastructure 
policy 
and 
strategy 
issues. 
These 
problems 
were 
further 
exacerbated 
by 
changes 
in 
the 
structure 
of 
government 
changes 
that 
resulted 
in 
Bappenas’ 
authority 
on 
infrastructure 
issues 
diminishing. 
A 
future project 
should 
be attached 
to and support a 
functioning 
high level 
coordinating 
agency 
or 
central 
agency 
that enjoys 
effective 
support 
within 
Government. 
Need 
for 
strong ownership 
by 
TA 
users. 
Follow-up 
on 
some 
of 
the 
technical 
assistance 
packages 
funded 
under TAPI-11 
has 
been 
very 
limited. 
While 
this 
is 
partly 
attributable 
to 
the 
onset 
of 
the 
crisis 
and 
subsequent 
widespread 
changes 
in 
government 
organization 
and 
staffing, 
there 
are 
also 
indications 
that 
some 
agencies 
did 
not 
fully 
“own” 
the 
assistance 
they 
managed. 
A 
future 
project should 
therefore 
be 
more 
selective 
and 
focus 
on 
supporting 
agencies 
that 
are 
pro-active 
in 
committing 
staff 
resources 
to 
work 
on 
proposal 
development, 
and 
should 
employ competitive 
mechanisms 
for 
allocating 
scarce 
TA 
resources. 
Need 
for 
clear roles 
of 
participating 
agencies. 
Many 
individual 
technical 
assistance 
services 
suffered 
long 
delays 
due 
to 
lack 
of 
clarity 
regarding 
the respective 
roles 
of 
the 
PMU 
and 
-21

Page  28
individual 
implementing 
agencies. 
In 
principle, 
the 
PMU 
was 
responsible 
for 
ensuring 
funds 
were 
used 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
Loan 
Agreement 
while 
implementing 
agencies 
were responsible 
for 
ensuring 
the 
quality 
of 
outputs 
and their transformation 
into 
outcomes. 
In 
practice, 
there 
were numerous instances 
of 
procurement-related 
issues 
causing 
long 
implementation 
delays. 
The 
design 
of 
a 
follow-on 
project 
accordingly 
needs 
to 
incorporate 
a 
clearer 
accountability framework. 
Positioning 
technical 
assistance 
at 
the 
right 
level. 
It 
is 
not 
realistic 
to 
expect 
agencies 
to 
reform 
themselves. 
Thus 
for 
example, 
providing 
technical 
assistance 
relating 
to 
the 
development 
of 
a new 
non-ministerial 
regulatory 
body through 
a 
Directorate 
General that 
will 
lose 
powers 
if 
such 
a 
body 
is 
established 
is 
unlikely 
to 
be 
successful. 
It 
will 
be 
important 
therefore 
to 
ensure 
that 
technical 
assistance serves 
the 
right 
clients. 
4. 
Indications 
of 
borrower 
commitment 
and 
ownership: 
The 
initial 
request 
for 
the 
Bank 
to 
support 
the 
project 
was 
taken 
at 
the 
first 
meeting 
of 
the 
KPPI 
Committee 
in 
July 
2001. 
Earlier, 
in 
April 
2001, 
the 
Coordinating 
Minister 
for 
Economic 
Affairs 
had written 
to 
advise that 
GO1 
was 
planning 
to 
establish 
the 
KPPI 
Committee 
and 
would 
be 
looking 
to 
the 
Bank to 
support 
its 
efforts 
to 
restore 
private 
investment 
in 
infrastructure. 
Following 
the 
change 
of 
Government 
in 
August 
2001, 
the 
KPPI 
Committee 
did 
not 
meet 
for 
several 
months 
and 
little 
progress 
was 
made towards 
setting 
up 
a 
project 
preparation 
team 
or 
involving 
the 
key 
sector 
ministries. 
The 
reconstituted 
KPPI 
Committee 
met 
for 
the 
first 
time 
in 
mid-November 
2001 
and 
since 
then 
interest 
in 
the 
private 
infrastructure 
challenge and 
commitment 
to 
the 
project 
has 
strengthened considerably. 
In 
late 
December 2001, 
the 
Coordinating 
Minister 
for 
Economic 
Affairs 
re-affirmed GOI’s intention to 
proceed 
with 
the 
project, 
and 
the 
Bank 
completed 
the 
preparation 
of 
a 
Project 
Concept 
Document 
which 
was 
reviewed 
and 
approved 
as 
the 
basis 
for 
project 
preparation 
in 
April 
2002. 
In 
July 
2002 
a Project 
Preparation 
Facility 
(PPF) advance 
was 
formally 
requested 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
for 
this 
project. 
After 
protracted discussion 
regarding 
the 
scope 
and 
size 
of 
the 
PPF 
advance, 
the 
Bank 
approved 
the advance 
in 
November 
2002 
and 
the 
counter-signature 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
was 
completed 
on 
December 
31, 
2002. 
OCMEA 
then 
moved quickly 
to 
appoint 
staff 
to 
assist 
with 
its 
preparation 
and management and 
to 
secure 
the 
active 
participation 
of 
MOC 
and 
MSRI. 
Project preparation 
is 
being 
handled 
by 
GO1 
personnel supported 
by 
consultants, and 
this 
is 
helping 
to 
build 
a 
sound 
and 
common 
understanding 
of 
the 
issues 
and 
a strong 
sense 
of 
ownership 
of 
the 
individual 
project 
components. 
The 
KPPI 
Committee 
now 
meets 
frequently 
and 
high 
priority 
is 
being given 
to 
finalizing 
the 
revised 
Keppres 
7.

Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
The 
Bank 
brings 
to 
the 
project 
an 
unrivalled 
combination 
of 
global knowledge 
and 
expertise 
in 
the 
broad 
area 
of 
private participation 
in 
infrastructure and 
in-depth 
understanding 
of 
Indonesia’s 
key 
infrastructure 
sectors 
and 
its 
experiences 
to 
date 
with 
private 
participation. 
The Bank’s 
Private 
Sector 
Advisory 
Services 
Department, 
through 
its 
Private 
Provision 
of 
Public 
Services 
(PPPS) 
group, 
has 
rich 
experience 
in 
critically 
important 
sector 
policy 
areas-including 
regulatory 
reform 
and 
regulatory 
agency 
development, 
public 
supports 
for 
private 
projects-and 
is 
developing 
“tool 
kits” 
designed 
to 
provide 
practical 
guidance 
on 
PPI-related 
topics. 
The 
group 
- 
22 
- 
Page  29
was 
the 
driving 
force 
behind 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
multi-donor 
Public-Private 
Infrastructure 
Advisory 
Facility 
(PPIAF) 
and 
is 
responsible, 
at 
arm’s 
length, 
for 
the 
ongoing 
management 
of 
the 
Facility. 
The 
PPPS 
group 
has 
long 
been 
involved 
in 
Indonesia, 
including 
through 
providing 
guidance 
on 
the 
shaping 
of 
a 
cross-sectoral 
regulatory 
framework 
for 
private 
participation 
in 
infrastructure 
that 
was 
ultimately 
issued 
as 
Keppres 
7. 
It 
is 
intended 
that 
this 
important 
link 
would 
be 
maintained 
during 
project 
preparation 
and implementation. 
The 
Bank 
has 
been 
closely 
involved 
in 
supporting 
Indonesia’s 
efforts 
to 
establish 
sound 
overarching 
policies 
and 
strategies 
for 
private participation 
since 
the 
early 
1990s, 
including 
through 
the 
two 
TAP41 
projects 
described earlier. 
It 
has 
also 
worked 
closely 
with 
Indonesia 
on 
regional 
initiatives 
aimed 
at 
promoting 
PPI 
and, 
for 
example, 
in 
1996 
co-hosted 
with 
Bappenas 
the 
Ministerial 
Level 
International 
Conference 
on 
Infrastructure 
Development 
(proceedings 
published 
as 
“Frontiers 
of 
the 
Public-Private Interface 
in 
East Asia’s 
Infrastructure” 
(Institute 
for 
National 
Development 
Studies). 
The 
Bank 
has 
also 
has 
been 
actively 
involved 
in 
helping 
shape 
the 
policy 
and 
regulatory 
reform 
agenda 
in 
all 
key 
infrastructure 
sectors, 
including 
transport 
(roads, 
railways, 
ports), energy (power, domestic 
gas), 
urban 
(water supply, 
public 
transport, 
solid 
waste), 
telecommunications,  and water 
resources 
through 
both 
lending 
and 
ESW 
support 
activities. 
This 
combination 
of 
global 
and 
local 
and 
cross-cutting and 
sector-specific expertise 
enables 
the 
Bank 
to 
provide effective 
support 
for 
the 
Project, 
a capacity 
that 
will 
be 
further 
enhanced 
by 
the 
recent 
consolidation 
of 
EAP’s 
Transport, 
Urban 
and Energy 
Sector 
Management 
Units 
into 
a 
single 
Infrastructure 
Department, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
on-going 
Infrastructure 
AAA 
work 
by 
June 
2003, 
as 
noted previously. 
ADB 
and 
USAID 
have 
and 
will 
continue to 
play 
very 
important 
roles 
in 
supporting 
Indonesia’s 
efforts 
to 
promote 
private 
participation 
in 
infrastructure. 
ADB, 
along 
with 
USAID, 
has 
now 
taken 
the 
lead 
in 
providing 
assistance 
on 
regulatory 
reform 
and 
private 
sector development 
in 
the 
power 
sector, 
and 
has 
provided 
parallel 
assistance 
for 
the domestic 
gas 
sector. 
ADB 
has 
also 
been 
active 
in 
promoting 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
urban infrastructure 
development, and 
is 
considering 
to 
continue 
this 
support 
through a proposed 
Private 
Sector 
Participation 
(PSP) 
Facility 
for 
Urban 
Infrastructure. 
It 
has 
also 
financed relevant technical 
assistance 
in 
the 
transport 
sector. 
USAID 
has 
also 
been 
very active 
in 
the 
past 
in 
promoting 
reforms 
designed 
to 
facilitate private 
provision 
of 
urban infrastructure 
(e.g., 
through 
the 
“PURSE’ 
project), and 
continues 
to 
provide 
limited 
and 
narrowly 
targeted 
support 
in 
the 
transport 
and 
telecoms 
sectors 
through 
its 
“PEG” 
project. 
CIDA 
has 
financed technical 
assistance 
to 
Bappenas 
in 
the 
broad 
area 
of 
infrastructure development 
policy, 
but 
as 
yet 
there 
are 
no 
firm 
plans 
for 
further 
support 
in 
this 
area. 
The project 
has 
been designed 
to 
complement, 
reinforce 
and integrate 
ongoing 
and planned 
initiatives, 
including 
through 
helping 
to 
ensure 
that 
each 
of 
these 
activities 
is 
positioned 
within 
a 
sound 
overall 
PSP 
strategy 
and 
that outputs 
and 
lessons 
emerging 
from 
them 
are 
properly 
analyzed and disseminated.

4.2 
Project 
management: 
Technical Management. 
A 
key 
challenge 
during 
project implementation 
will 
be 
the 
limited 
technical 
capacities 
of 
the 
executing and 
implementing 
agencies 
on 
matters 
relating 
to PPI. 
During 
preparation, 
this 
has 
been 
addressed 
through inter-active 
support 
from 
the 
Bank 
preparation 
team and 
the 
PPF-financed 
project 
preparation 
consultants. 
GO1 
personnel have 
been 
closely 
involved 
and 
in 
consequence 
have developed a stronger 
ownership 
of 
the 
program. 
During 
implementation, 
the 
OCMEA 
Core 
Advisory 
Team and 
the 
MOC 
and 
MSRI 
PPI 
Advisors 
will 
play 
a 
key 
role 
in 
assisting 
the 
implementing 
agencies 
to 
prepare 
TORS 
for 
the 
additional 
TA 
packages 
to 
be 
identified 
/ 
firmed-up 
during 
project 
implementation, 
and 
to 
guide 
and 
oversee 
their 
implementation 
and support 
subsequent 
assimilation 
and dissemination 
of 
outputs. 
Administrative 
and 
Financial 
Management. 
The 
administrative 
and 
financial 
arrangements 
for 
the management 
of 
the 
project 
have been 
modeled 
on 
those 
developed 
for 
the 
ongoing 
Corporate 
Restructuring 
Technical 
Assistance 
Project 
and draw 
heavily 
on 
the 
experience gained 
during 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
recently 
closed TAP4I-11 
Project. 
Particular attention 
was 
given 
to 
streamlining 
the 
review 
and approval 
process 
for 
those 
TAs 
to 
be 
identified 
/ 
firmed-up 
during 
project implementation 
as 
this 
was 
frequently 
a 
source 
of 
long 
delays 
on TAP4I-II. 
Selection 
criteria 
for 
subsequent 
projects 
are 
broadly 
summarized 
in 
Annex 
13 
which 
will 
be 
further 
refined 
during 
the 
sectoral and cross-sectoral 
PPI 
assessments 
and 
strategy 
formulation. 
Overall 
project 
administrative 
procedures and 
financial 
management arrangements 
have 
been 
carefully 
documented 
in 
operating 
manuals

4.3 
Procurement 
issues: 
The 
2001 
CPAR 
for 
Indonesia, prepared 
in 
close 
collaboration 
with 
ADB 
and 
a 
GO1 
working 
group, 
concluded 
that Indonesia’s 
public 
procurement 
system 
is 
severely 
prone 
to 
corruption 
and 
collusion, 
lacks 
transparency, 
and 
fails 
in 
its 
principal 
objectives 
of 
procuring 
goods 
and 
services 
with 
due 
consideration 
to 
maximizing 
economy and 
efficiency 
and 
promoting 
competition 
and 
fair 
and equitable treatment 
of 
all 
suppliers, contractors 
and 
consulting 
firms. 
The 
report 
has 
generated a 
continuing 
high-level dialog 
with 
GOI, 
and agreement 
has 
been reached 
on 
a 
number 
of 
important 
elements 
of 
an 
action 
plan for 
addressing 
the 
problems. 
The 
procurement 
plan for 
the 
project 
has 
been designed 
in 
the 
context 
of 
these 
findings 
and 
reflects 
experience 
gained 
with 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Corporate Restructuring Technical 
Assistance and 
TAP4I-I1 
projects. 
It 
is 
not 
expected 
to 
pose 
any 
unusual 
procurement 
issues 
or 
risks. 
A 
detailed procurement 
procedures 
manual 
has 
been prepared and agreed 
during 
project 
appraisal, 
as 
well 
as 
an 
Anti-Corruption 
Action 
Plan 
(see 
Annex 
15).

4.4 
Financial 
management issues: 
Financial 
management 
is 
not 
expected 
to 
pose 
significant 
problems, 
in 
part 
because 
the 
project 
does 
present 
any 
unusual 
challenges and 
in 
part 
because 
the 
systems 
to 
be 
used 
have

modeled 
on 
those 
recently 
developed 
for 
the 
ongoing 
Corporate 
Restructuring 
Technical 
Assistance 
Project 
and 
reflect 
lessons 
learned 
from 
the 
recently closed 
TAP4I-I1 
Project. 
As 
noted 
above, 
a detailed 
Financial 
Management 
Manual 
was 
prepared 
and 
agreed 
during 
project 
appraisal. 
5. 
Environmental: 
5.1  Summarize 
the 
steps 
undertaken 
for 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
EMP 
preparation 
(including 
consultation 
and disclosure) and 
the 
significant 
issues 
and 
their 
treatment 
emerging 
from 
this 
analysis. 
The 
project 
will 
not 
finance 
any 
physical 
investments 
and 
no 
significant 
environmental 
issues 
are 
envisaged. 
Where 
applicable-for 
example 
in 
technical 
assistance packages 
involving 
the 
design 
of 
proposed 
PPI 
pilot 
projects-appropriate 
provision 
will 
be 
included 
in 
TORs 
for 
identifying, 
evaluating 
and 
mitigating 
adverse 
environmental impacts 
and 
for 
consultation 
with 
stakeholders. 
Such 
TORs 
will 
be 
required 
to 
be 
cleared 
by 
the 
Bank 
before 
consultant 
recruitment 
commences. 
Annex 
11 
provides a 
summary 
of 
the procedures and 
a 
checklist 
of 
potential 
issues 
to 
be 
used 
in 
screening 
all 
TORs, 
resulting 
recommendations, 
and 
potential 
demonstration projects 
for 
safeguards 
issues 
to incorporate 
appropriate 
provisions. 
(The 
Bank 
will 
NOT 
finance 
the 
implementation 
of 
these 
demonstration 
projects; 
the 
project 
will 
only 
assist 
in 
the 
design, 
tendering 
and 
negotiation 
with 
private 
investors 
for 
the 
pilot 
schemes.) 
5.2 
What 
are 
the 
main 
features 
of 
the 
EMP 
and 
are 
they 
adequate? 
Not 
required.

5.4 
How 
have stakeholders been 
consulted 
at 
the 
stage 
of 
(a) 
environmental 
screening and 
(b) 
draft 
EA 
report 
on 
the 
environmental impacts and 
proposed 
environment 
management 
plan? 
Describe 
mechanisms 
of 
consultation 
that were 
used 
and 
which 
groups 
were consulted? 
Where 
applicable, 
TORs 
for individual 
TA 
packages 
will 
specify 
arrangements 
for 
stakeholder 
consultation 
that 
conform 
to 
the 
Bank's 
policies. 
Such 
TORs 
will 
be 
required 
to 
be 
cleared 
by 
the 
Bank 
before consultant 
recruitment 
commences. 
5.5 
What 
mechanisms 
have been established 
to 
monitor 
and 
evaluate the 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
on 
the 
environment? 
Do 
the indicators 
reflect 
the 
objectives 
and 
results 
of 
the 
EMP? 
Not 
applicable. 
6. 
Social: 
6.1 
Summarize 
key 
social 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
objectives, and 
specify the 
project's 
social 
development 
outcomes. 
Appropriate 
provision 
will 
be 
made 
in 
TORs 
for individual 
technical 
assistance packages 
for 
identifying 
potentially 
important 
social 
issues 
and 
impacts. 
6.2 
Participatory Approach: 
How 
are 
key 
stakeholders 
participating 
in 
the 
project? 
The project 
design 
will 
seek 
to 
ensure 
the 
effective 
involvement 
of 
stakeholders 
in 
the 
formulation 
of 
policy 
and 
in 
the 
design 
of 
PPI 
pilot 
projects. 
This 
will 
be 
accomplished 
through 
the 
careful 
design 
of 
TORs 
for 
the 
technical 
assistance packages 
to 
be 
financed 
under 
the 
project. 
- 
26 
- 
Page  33
More 
generally, 
the 
project 
design recognizes 
the 
importance 
of 
building public 
awareness, 
understanding and 
acceptance 
of 
the 
need 
for 
and benefits 
of 
PPI, and incorporates outreach 
activities 
design 
to 
help 
accomplish 
this. 
6.3 
How 
does 
the 
project 
involve 
consultations 
or 
collaboration 
with 
NGOs 
or 
other 
civil 
society 
organizations? 
The 
roles 
of 
and 
approaches 
for 
involving 
civil 
society 
will 
differ 
significantly 
for individual 
technical 
assistance 
packages 
and 
TORS 
will 
be 
designed 
accordingly. 
It 
is 
not 
envisaged that 
the 
project 
would 
provide 
resources 
to 
NGOs 
or 
disburse 
resources 
through 
them. 
6.4 
What institutional 
arrangements 
have 
been 
provided 
to 
ensure 
the 
project 
achieves 
its 
social 
development outcomes? 
The 
principal 
social 
development outcome envisaged 
to 
result 
directly 
from 
project 
implementation 
is 
improved public 
awareness 
of 
the 
need 
for 
and 
benefits 
of 
well 
managed PPI. 
The 
planned 
P3 
network 
is 
expected 
to 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
promoting improved public 
awareness 
and 
also 
in 
gathering feedback 
from 
NGOs 
/ 
CSOs 
(e.g., 
through participation 
in 
workshops and 
seminars 
and 
through 
more 
targeted outreach and survey 
activities). 
6.5 
How 
will 
the 
project 
monitor 
performance 
in 
terms 
of 
social 
development outcomes? 
See 
above. 
7. 
Safeguard 
Policies: 
7.2 
Describe provisions 
made 
by 
the 
project 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
applicable 
safeguard 
policies. 
Annex 
11 
provides 
the 
screening 
criteria, 
procedures and summary 
checklist 
to 
be 
applied 
to 
any/all 
subprojects 
which 
may 
involve 
safeguards 
issues 
during 
the 
course 
of 
project 
implementation 
(e.g., 
demonstration 
schemes 
for 
private 
investment 
not 
yet 
identified 
during 
project 
preparation).

Sustainability and Risks 
1. 
Sustainability: 
Indonesia 
needs 
to 
attract 
large 
scale 
and 
efficient 
private 
investment 
in 
infrastructure 
on 
reasonable 
terms 
in 
order 
to 
sustain 
its 
economic recovery, 
maintain 
and 
improve 
its 
international 
competitiveness, and 
expand 
and 
improve 
delivery 
of 
basic 
public 
services. 
This 
need 
should 
in 
principle 
provide 
strong 
and 
sufficient 
incentives 
for 
ensuring 
the 
sustainability 
of 
project 
benefits. 
There 
will, 
however, 
be 
a 
need 
for 
strong 
political 
commitment 
to ensuring 
the 
private 
sector 
is 
involved 
through 
processes 
that 
are 
transparent, 
competitive 
and 
maximize public 
benefits, and 
to 
resisting 
vested 
interests 
urging 
a 
return 
to 
business-as-usual. 
More 
generally, 
there 
will 
also 
be 
a 
need 
for 
significant 
progress towards 
improving 
the 
overall 
investment 
climate 
and strengthening 
the 
domestic 
banking 
system 
and 
capital 
markets 
if 
improvements 
in 
policy 
and 
regulatory environments 
and 
institutional 
capacities 
are 
to

in 
increased

At 
the

play 
important 
and 
complementary roles 
in 
enabling 
the

effectively, 
including 
through: 
(a) 
helping 
to

(b) 
providing 
concise, well-analyzed,

(c) 
assisting 
it 
to function 
as

effective 
political 
champion 
for 
private participation 
in 
infrastructure 
provision.  They 
are 
also positioned, 
in 
conjunction 
with

to play 
a 
pivotal role 
in 
guiding 
and 
supporting 
the 
development 
of 
an 
over-arching 
strategy and 
policy 
framework 
for 
infrastructure development and 
private 
participation. 
The 
Sub-committee 
has 
primary 
responsibility 
for 
developing 
recommendations 
on 
cross-cutting 
policy 
and 
strategy 
issues 
(e.g., 
it 
has 
the 
lead 
on 
the 
drafting 
of 
the 
revised

while 
the 
Secretariat

primary 
responsibility 
for 
supporting 
the 
Committee on 
more 
ad 
hoc 
issues, 
including 
matters 
specific to 
individual 
projects. 
The project 
will 
provide 
support 
to 
the 
Secretariat and 
Sub-committee 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
small 
KPPI 
Core 
Advisory 
Team 
for 
the 
period 
of 
the

This

advice 
and

to 
individual 
sectoral and 
regional 
agencies 
on 
an 
“as

basis. 
It 
is 
envisaged that 
the 
size 
of 
the team 
will 
diminish 
as 
skills 
and expertise 
are 
transferred 
to

The

will 
be 
expected 
to 
have extensive 
broad-based, 
high-level 
international 
experience 
in 
the 
preparation

of

and 
maintain information 
on 
policies, 
regulations, 
lessons 
of 
experience and 
current and 
potential 
project 
opportunities, and to 
disseminate and 
share 
this 
with 
interested parties, 
including public 
institutions 
and 
agencies 
(both 
central 
and 
regional), prospective 
investors, 
and 
the 
general 
public. 
It 
would 
also 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
supporting 
and 
complementing 
the 
KPPI 
Committee’s 
efforts 
to 
foster 
greater 
public 
awareness 
of 
the need 
for 
and 
expected 
benefits 
of 
PPI, and 
to 
promote 
institutional 
capacity 
building 
on 
PPI 
topics. 
The 
draft 
of 
the 
revised 
Keppres 
7 
provides 
for 
the 
development 
of 
a central 
P3 
unit 
whose 
role would 
include 
supporting 
the 
development 
of 
a 
P3 
network. 
The 
project 
will 
support 
the 
planning 
and establishment 
of 
this 
central 
unit, 
which 
is 
to 
be 
attached 
initially 
to 
the 
KPPI 
Secretariat, 
and 
the 
initial 
period 
of 
its 
operation. 
A 
short study 
will 
be 
conducted 
to 
identify 
and evaluate 
possible options 
for 
the 
development and operation 
of 
a 
P3 
network, and to 
prepare 
detailed 
proposals, 
including 
a 
work 
program and 
budget 
for 
establishing 
the 
central 
P3 
unit. 
The 
study 
is 
expected 
to 
include 
a 
small 
and 
carefully planned program 
of 
visits 
to 
P3 
networks 
/ 
centers 
in 
other 
countries 
in 
the 
region. 
Project 
Component 
2 
- 
US$8.58 
million 
2. 
Sector-specific 
technical 
assistance 
and 
advisory 
activities 
The 
largest 
part 
of 
the 
project 
resources 
will 
be 
allocated 
sector-specific 
activities 
aimed 
at 
establishing 
conditions 
conducive to 
sustainable 
private 
investment 
in 
infrastructure, 
and 
to 
developing specific opportunities 
for 
such 
investment. 
The 
project 
will 
focus 
primarily on 
the 
transport, telecommunications,  and 
urban infrastructure 
sectors, 
and 
support 
activities 
involving: 
0 
0 
0 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
reform 
(drafting 
of 
sector 
laws 
and 
implementing 
regulations); 
design 
and 
establishment 
of 
regulatory 
institutions; 
conduct 
of 
sector 
policy 
and strategy 
studies 
with 
a strong 
PPI 
focus 
and 
impact 
(including 
sector 
/ 
sub-sector 
privatization 
strategy 
studies); 
establishment 
of 
key 
sectoral 
“nodes” 
in 
the 
national 
P3 
network; 
preparation 
and 
tendering 
of 
pilot 
PPI 
projects; 
conduct and 
dissemination 
of 
“lessons 
learned” 
analyses 
for 
recent 
private 
infrastructure 
projects 
and 
privatization 
initiatives. 
The 
project 
will 
also 
finance 
small 
teams 
of 
“in-house” 
PPI 
advisors 
to 
work 
with 
each 
of 
the 
two key 
sector 
agencies, 
namely 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Communications 
(MOC) 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Settlements and 
Regional 
Infrastructure 
(MSRI). 
The 
MOC 
advisors 
will 
be 
attached 
to 
its 
Secretariat General and 
report 
on 
a 
daily 
basis 
to 
the 
Head 
of 
the 
Bureau 
of 
Planning, 
while 
the 
-

- 
Page  46
MSRI 
advisors 
will 
be attached 
to 
its 
Agency 
for 
Investment 
and 
Construction, 
whose 
structure 
already 
includes 
an 
embryonic 
P3 
unit. 
TORs 
for 
the 
priority 
assistance 
in 
these 
sectors, 
including 
in 
particular 
for 
the 
PPI 
advisors, 
have 
been 
drafted 
during 
project 
preparation. 
However, 
a 
significant 
pool 
of 
funds 
has 
been 
left 
un-earmarked 
so 
as 
to 
enable 
the 
project 
to 
respond 
effectively 
and 
promptly 
to 
evolving 
needs 
and 
opportunities. 
The 
MOC 
and 
MSRI-PPI 
advisors 
will 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
developing 
the 
TORs 
for 
such 
activities, and 
in 
helping 
to 
guide and 
manage 
their 
implementation 
and 
ensure 
outputs 
are 
disseminated and 
used 
effectively. 
Legal 
and 
regulatory 
reform: 
The 
Government 
recognizes 
the 
need 
to 
replace 
the 
four 
MOC-administered 
modal 
transport 
laws 
(Road 
Traffic 
and 
Transport, 
Railways, 
Civil 
Aviation, 
and 
Maritime 
Transport) and the 
MSRI-administered 
Roads 
Law. 
Changes 
are 
needed 
to 
align 
with 
the 
Law 
on 
Regional 
Autonomy 
as 
well 
as 
to 
create an 
improved 
environment 
for 
private 
participation 
by 
enabling 
more effective competition 
and 
private participation 
in 
sectors 
currently 
controlled 
by 
SOEs, 
and 
through establishing 
improved 
regulatory 
arrangements 
and 
licensing 
procedures. 
MSRI 
and 
its 
predecessor 
agencies 
have already prepared several 
drafts 
of 
the 
new 
Road 
Law, 
although 
there 
is 
as 
yet 
no 
clear 
consensus 
on 
several 
key 
policy 
issues, 
including 
the 
restructuring 
of 
the 
toll 
road 
sector. 
Discussions 
on 
the 
revision 
of 
four modal 
laws 
administered 
by 
MOC 
are 
at 
a 
much 
earlier 
stage, 
in 
part 
because 
consideration 
is 
now 
being given to 
the 
possible 
need 
for 
an 
over-arching “umbrella” 
transport 
law 
to 
create an 
environment conducive 
for 
efficient 
multi-modal 
transport 
and 
inter-modal 
connections. 
The project 
will 
support 
the 
revision 
of 
the 
transport 
Laws 
through 
a 
three-phase 
approach 
designed 
to 
avoid 
problems 
that 
impeded 
the 
drafting 
of 
other sectoral 
laws 
in 
recent 
years. 
The 
first 
phase 
would 
focus 
on 
developing 
the 
overall 
“architecture” 
for 
the 
new legal 
framework, 
including 
assessing 
the 
need 
for 
an 
umbrella 
transport 
law, 
determining 
the topics 
to 
be 
addressed 
under 
this 
and 
the 
individual 
modal 
laws, 
and ensuring 
consistency between, 
for 
example, the 
laws 
on 
road 
infrastructure 
and 
on 
road traffic 
and transport. 
The 
second 
phase 
would 
encompass 
assisting the 
teams 
charged 
with 
drafting 
the 
individual 
laws 
and 
their 
implementing 
Government Regulations 
to 
assess 
options 
in 
key 
policy 
areas 
and 
to develop 
conceptual 
drafts 
for 
review 
by 
top-level 
decision-makers. 
It 
would 
encompass 
reviews 
of 
international 
best 
practices 
and 
involve 
extensive 
consultations 
with 
the 
key 
stakeholders. 
The 
third 
stage, 
which 
should be 
the 
most 
straightforward, 
would 
involve 
the 
preparation 
of 
Indonesian 
language 
drafts 
of 
the 
Laws 
and 
associated 
Elucidations 
(in 
a style and 
format 
suitable 
for 
immediate 
submission 
to 
the 
DPR), 
and 
of 
the 
implementing 
Govemment 
Regulations. 
Regulatory institutions. 
Some 
infrastructure 
sectors 
have advanced 
further 
than others towards 
placing 
regulatory 
authority 
at 
arm’s 
length 
from 
the 
political 
process. 
Most 
notably, 
the 
new 
Oil 
and 
Gas 
law 
and 
the 
new 
Electricity 
Law 
make 
explicit 
provision 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
independent 
/ 
non-ministerial 
regulatory 
agencies. 
Considerable preparatory 
work 
has 
also 
been 
done 
to develop 
arm’s 
length 
regulatory models 
for 
the water supply 
sector, 
with 
the 
first 
such 
agency 
having 
been established 
by 
DKI 
Jakarta and another 
in 
process 
of 
being 
designed 
for 
Pekanbaru. 
By 
contrast, 
the 
transport and 
telecommunications 
sectors 
are 
lagging 
well 
behind, 
with 
regulation 
remaining 
firmly 
in 
the 
hands 
of MOC 
and 
MSRI 
or 
regional 
government 
agencies. 
Likewise, 
the 
1999 
Telecommunications 
Law 
does 
not 
explicitly 
provide 
for 
an 
- 
39 
- 
Page  47
independent 
regulatory 
agency, 
although 
the 
need 
is 
now 
recognized 
and 
there 
has 
already 
been 
some 
discussion 
of 
possible options. 
The 
project 
will 
provide 
support 
in 
this 
area 
through technical 
assistance 
to 
evaluate alternative 
regulatory 
models, and 
to 
design and 
assist 
with 
the 
establishment 
of 
regulatory 
agencies. 
The 
initial 
focus 
would 
be 
on 
the 
flagship 
telecommunications 
sector, 
where 
deficiencies 
in 
the 
regulatory environment 
are 
already 
deterring 
much 
needed 
new private 
investment, 
on 
the 
railway 
and 
toll 
road 
sectors, 
where 
the 
roles 
of 
government 
and 
SOEs 
remain 
blurred, 
and 
on 
the 
water supply 
sector. 
Sectorpolicy 
and 
strategy 
studies. 
Indonesia’s 
PPI 
program 
during 
the 
Suharto era 
was 
driven 
principally 
by 
unsolicited 
proposals, 
with 
little 
prior 
attention 
being 
given to 
establishing 
sound 
policy 
and 
regulatory frameworks or to 
shaping and 
positioning 
individual 
projects 
in 
the 
context 
of 
sound 
sector 
development 
strategies. 
While 
significant 
progress 
has 
made 
in 
some 
areas 
since 
the 
mid-l990s, 
many 
important 
gaps 
remain.  Moreover, 
some 
of 
the 
recommendations 
already 
developed have 
been 
partly 
overtaken 
by 
subsequent 
events-notably 
the 
economic crisis 
and 
regional 
autonomy-while 
others 
are 
too broad 
in 
scope 
to 
provide 
an 
actionable 
framework 
for 
supporting 
private participation. 
The 
project 
will 
support 
the 
conduct 
of 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
policy 
and strategy studies whose 
common 
theme 
will 
be 
development 
of 
recommendations 
that 
contribute 
to 
a 
more 
conducive 
environment 
for 
PPI. 
The particular 
focus 
will 
be 
on 
pricing 
and subsidy 
policies, and 
on 
developing 
structures 
for 
promoting efficient 
delivery 
of 
affordable 
basic 
public 
services 
using 
output-based supports 
(e.g., 
for 
“pioneer”  transport services 
or 
rural 
telecommunications 
services). 
The 
project 
will 
also 
assist 
with 
the 
preparation 
or 
updating 
of 
sector 
/ 
sub-sector 
needs 
assessments, 
development options and 
privatization 
strategies 
for 
key 
sectors 
(e.g., 
telecommunications, 
toll 
roads) where 
there 
is 
strong 
interest 
and 
ownership 
by 
the 
key 
agencies. 
TORs 
for 
the 
highest 
priority 
studies 
have 
been 
drafted 
during 
project 
preparation, 
but 
it 
is 
intended 
that 
a 
major 
part 
of 
the study 
needs 
will 
be 
defined 
during 
the 
initial 
year 
of 
project 
implementation. 
Sector 
agencies, 
assisted 
by 
the 
MOC 
and 
MSRI-PPI 
advisors 
will 
be 
invited 
to 
submit 
outline TORs 
for 
such 
studies 
to 
the 
PMU, 
which 
would 
then 
screen 
them 
against 
agreed 
criteria 
(see 
Annex 
13) 
before 
forwarding to 
the 
KPPI 
Secretariat and 
the 
Bank 
for 
clearance. 
P3 
network 
nodes: 
In 
parallel 
with 
supporting 
the 
establishment 
of 
a central 
P3 
unit, 
the 
project 
will 
also 
assist 
with 
setting 
up 
P3 
“nodal” 
units 
in 
MSRI 
and 
MOC. 
Within 
MSRI, 
the Agency 
for 
Investment and 
Construction 
has 
been 
given 
clear 
responsibility 
for 
promoting 
private 
investment 
within 
its 
sectoral domain. 
The 
project 
will 
assist 
the 
Agency 
to 
strengthen 
its 
capabilities, 
including 
initially 
through knowledge 
management 
technical 
assistance 
aimed 
at 
helping 
it 
improve 
the 
accessibility 
of 
MSRI’s 
extensive 
PPI-related 
information 
resources. 
While 
MOC 
has 
not 
yet established 
a structural 
unit 
to 
be 
responsible 
for 
promoting 
PPI, 
the 
Head 
of 
Planning Bureau 
(in 
the 
Secretariat General) 
has 
been charged 
with 
coordinating 
the 
Ministry’s 
activities 
in 
this 
area. 
The project 
will 
provide 
support 
for 
the 
development 
of 
an 
embryonic 
P3 
capacity 
in 
the 
Ministry, 
again 
focusing 
initially 
on 
knowledge 
management and 
most 
probably 
located 
within 
the 
Bureau 
of 
Planning. 
Demonstration 
projects. 
The 
project 
will 
support the 
preparation 
of 
a 
limited 
number 
of 
demonstration 
projects 
designed 
to 
be 
feasible 
and attractive 
for 
private 
investment. 
The 
choice 
- 
40 
- 
Page  48
of 
projects 
will 
be 
demand-driven, 
with 
the 
PPI 
advisors assisting 
MOC 
and 
MSRI 
(in 
conjunction 
with 
regional 
agencies 
where appropriate) 
to 
firm-up 
suitable proposals, 
and 
the 
focus 
will 
be 
on 
schemes 
that 
will 
be 
amenable 
to 
replication 
(e.g., 
possible 
pilot 
for 
rural 
connectivity). 
The 
support 
to 
be 
provided 
under 
the 
project 
would 
extend through 
the 
tendering, 
award 
and 
contract 
negotiation 
stages. 
Clear 
criteria 
will 
be 
established 
for 
deciding 
whether 
proposals 
qualify 
for 
the 
allocation 
of 
preparation 
financing 
under 
the 
project 
(see 
Annexes 
11 
and 
13), 
and 
the 
preparation 
process 
for 
the 
approved 
schemes 
will 
include 
documenting 
key 
decision 
issues 
so 
as 
to 
assist 
the 
design 
of 
future 
projects 
of 
a 
similar 
nature 
and the 
preparation 
of 
case 
study 
materials. 
Lessons 
learned 
analyses. 
It 
will 
be 
important 
for 
Indonesia 
to 
learn 
effectively 
from 
its 
past 
initiatives 
to 
attract 
private 
investment 
in 
infrastructure and 
restructure 
and 
privatize 
state-owned 
infrastructure 
enterprises, 
and to 
be 
able 
to relate 
these 
lessons 
to 
international 
experiences. 
Where 
possible, such lessons-learned 
analyses 
would 
be 
funded 
from 
grant 
resources 
(e.g., 
PPIAF). 
However, 
it 
is 
planned 
that 
a 
small 
number 
of 
high 
priority 
reviews 
will 
be 
supported 
by 
the 
project, 
and that 
the 
outputs 
would 
be 
used 
as 
case 
studies 
for 
the 
proposed 
training 
program. 
Project Component 
3 
- 
US$ 
1.50 
million 
3. 
Capacity 
building 
and training 
The 
project 
will 
contribute 
to 
capacity 
building 
and 
training 
in 
areas 
relating 
to 
private 
participation 
in 
infrastructure through 
three 
main 
channels: 
assistance 
with 
development 
of 
curricula 
and 
training 
modules 
on 
issues 
relevant 
to 
PPI 
and 
training 
of 
trainers 
for 
a 
range 
of 
courses 
designed 
to 
be delivered 
by 
qualified 
universities 
and other 
institutions; 
support 
for 
key 
staff 
from 
agencies 
directly 
engaged 
in 
dealing 
with 
prospective 
private 
infrastructure investors 
or 
responsible 
for 
sector 
policy 
matters 
and 
regulation 
to 
participate 
in 
short 
training 
courses, conferences, 
workshops 
or 
other 
developmental 
programs 
of 
relevance 
to 
their 
specific 
duties; 
technical 
transfer 
to 
counterparts 
from 
the 
conduct 
of 
studies and 
provision 
of 
technical 
advisory 
services. 
A 
range 
of 
domestic 
training 
courses 
is 
required 
and 
these 
will 
be 
developed 
sequentially. 
The 
most 
pressing need 
is 
for 
short 
courses 
(in 
Bahasa Indonesia) 
to familiarize 
senior government 
and 
SOE 
officials 
with 
the 
issues 
they 
will 
confront 
when 
seeking 
to 
involve 
private 
investors 
in 
infrastructure 
provision. 
It 
is 
envisaged that 
this 
need 
would 
be 
met 
through 
a very 
short 
(one-day) 
overview 
course 
for 
top-level 
government 
officials 
(e.g. 
Mayors, Bupatis, 
and senior 
central 
agency 
officials 
with 
no prior 
PPI 
involvement), 
and short 
(circa two-week) 
introductory 
course 
for “working 
level” officials.  The 
content 
of 
the 
overview 
and 
introductory 
courses 
will 
need 
to 
be 
linked 
to 
the 
revised 
Keppres 
7 
and designed 
for 
delivery 
in 
the 
regions 
as 
well 
as 
in 
Jakarta. 
Beyond 
this, 
there 
is 
also 
an 
urgent 
need 
for 
a 
more 
comprehensive 
modular, 
case 
study-based 
PPI 
training 
program 
targeted 
at 
practitioners 
who 
will 
be 
actively 
involved 
in 
the 
detailed 
preparations 
for 
and 
processing 
of 
PPI 
projects.

Limited 
provision 
will 
also 
be 
made 
for 
supporting 
individual 
participation 
in 
short 
overseas 
courses, 
study tours, 
and 
overseas 
placements programs, and 
in 
domestic and 
overseas 
conferences and workshops where 
this 
demonstrably 
offers 
a 
cost-effective 
means 
of 
acquiring 
PPI-related 
expertise and where 
the 
participants 
occupy 
positions 
that 
will 
enable 
them 
to 
use 
it 
effectively. 
To 
ensure 
good 
use 
of 
limited 
resources, 
prospective participants 
will 
be 
required 
to 
identify up-front 
how 
the 
proposed 
activity 
would 
contribute to 
the 
better 
performance 
of 
their 
duties. 
In 
addition, 
they 
would

was

for publication 
in

Capacity 
Assessment 
4. 
February 
2000, 
with 
the 
final 
report 
being 
issued 
in 
February 2001. 
A 
Procurement Capacity 
Assessment 
Report (PCAR) 
has 
been 
completed 
for 
the 
Project 
and 
is 
available 
in 
the 
Project 
file. 
This 
covered 
legal 
issues, 
project cycle 
management, 
organization 
and 
functions, 
support 
and 
control 
systems, 
record 
keeping, 
staffing, 
the 
general 
procurement 
environments, and 
overall 
risk 
assessment 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
instructions 
issued 
by 
OCSPR. 
The 
tendency 
of 
implementing 
agencies 
to 
negotiate 
rates 
in 
the 
case 
of 
QCBS 
does 
not 
pose 
a 
significant 
risk 
in 
this 
case 
since 
staff 
of 
the 
PMU 
are 
aware 
of 
the 
Bank’s 
requirements and 
these 
are 
clarified 
in 
the 
PMM. 
The 
last 
Country 
Procurement 
Assessment 
Report 
for 
Indonesia 
was 
carried out 
in 
5. 
the 
following 
reasons: 
The 
assessment 
of 
procurement 
risk 
of 
this 
proposed Project 
is 
rated 
as 
‘average’, 
due 
to 
(i) 
Contracting 
is 
simpler 
since 
it 
consists 
entirely 
of 
selection 
of 
consultants. There 
are 
no 
goods 
or 
works 
under 
this 
project 
of 
only US$19 
million 
- 
46 
- 
Page  54
(ii) 
The 
Project 
Management 
Unit 
(PMU) 
is 
operational 
with 
adequate 
capacity and 
staff 
experienced 
with 
Bank 
procedures 
for 
selection 
of 
consultants. 
The 
procurement 
officer 
has 
many 
years' 
experience 
with 
procurement 
in 
Bank 
funded 
projects and 
has 
strong 
back-up 
by 
a 
financial 
management specialist 
with 
four 
years' 
experience 
in 
a 
Bank-funded project 
where 
she 
supervised 
the 
procurement 
activity; 
All 
contracting 
will 
be 
done 
by 
the 
PMU 
or 
PIUs 
with 
the 
guidance 
and 
oversight 
of 
the 
PMU. 
Since the 
PMU 
and 
PIUs 
are 
located 
in 
Jakarta extensive 
supervision 
is 
possible. 
All 
selection procedures 
are 
clearly 
defined 
in 
the 
PMM, 
which 
is 
based 
on 
an 
existing 
TA 
project 
financed 
by 
the 
Bank; 
An 
anti-comption 
action 
plan 
has 
been 
agreed 
(see 
Annex 
15) 
which 
includes 
appointment 
of 
members 
from 
civil 
society 
in 
the 
evaluation 
committees. 
Since 
the 
general 
procurement environment 
is 
weak, 
therefore 
a 
rating 
of 
"high 
to 
average" 
was 
considered, 
but 
given 
the 
strong procurement 
capacity 
of 
the 
PMU 
a 
rating 
of 
"average" 
risk 
is 
appropriate. 
However, 
the thresholds 
and supervision 
intensity 
is 
similar 
to a 
"high" 
risk 
case. 
Based 
on 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
first 
year 
an 
adjustment 
in 
the 
thresholds and 
supervision 
intensity 
can 
be 
considered.

the 
first

based 
on 
emerging

The 
Procurement 
plan 
gives 
the 
details 
of 
various selection 
methods 
for 
contracting 
Given below 
are 
the 
planned 
selection methods: 
a. 
QCBS 
(US$14.36 
million) 
will 
be 
used 
as 
the 
default 
method 
and 
will 
be 
used 
for 
most 
of 
the 
assignments. 
These 
assignments 
are 
normally 
greater 
than 
US$200,000 
including 
assignments 
like 
the: 
advisory 
services 
to 
KKPPII 
Secretariat, 
in-house 
advisor 
to 
MOC, 
and, 
in-house advisor 
to 
MSRI. 
Short 
lists 
may 
comprise 
entirely 
of 
national 
consultants 
for 
assignments 
estimated to 
cost 
less 
than US$400,000. 
QBS 
(US$1.32 
million) 
will 
be 
used 
for 
assignment 
which 
are 
complex 
in 
nature and 
with 
substantial 
downstream 
impact. 
These 
assignments 
include 
the 
following: 
research 
and development, 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
reform 
complex 
assignment,

Individual 
Consultants (US$1.54 
million) 
these 
includes 
consultants 
selected 
on 
a 
single-source basis 
due 
to 
the 
unique qualifications 
of 
the consultants. 
Fourteen 
consultants 
were selected 
under 
the 
PPF 
on 
a 
competitive 
basis. These 
consultants 
from 
various 
specializations 
were 
hired 
as 
needed. 
It 
is 
not 
feasible 
to 
hire 
a 
firm 
with 
the 
diverse 
specializations required. 
The 
estimated 
aggregate 
disbursement 
for 
single-source 
selection 
is 
US$S20,000 
that 
will 
be for 
consultants 
with 
unique qualifications 
or 
for 
continuance 
in 
accordance 
with 
paragraph 
5.4 
of 
the consultant guidelines.

INDONESIA: 
Private Provision 
of 
Infrastructure Technical Assistance Loan 
Financial 
Management 
1. 
Summary 
of 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Assessment 
The 
Private 
Provision 
of 
Infrastructure Technical 
Assistance 
Loan 
is 
designed 
to 
assist 
GO1 
to 
develop 
and 
implement 
policy 
and 
regulatory reforms and 
build 
the 
institutional 
foundations 
required 
for 
sustainable 
large 
scale 
private 
investment 
in 
infrastructure. Towards 
his 
outcome, 
the 
project 
will 
support 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
KPPI 
Committee 
that 
is 
already operational and 
finance 
the 
preparation and operationalization 
of 
improved 
policies, 
practices 
and 
procedures 
for 
handling private 
investment 
in 
infrastructure. 
The 
program 
will 
be 
carried out 
as 
a Technical 
Assistance 
Loan 
(TAL) 
over a 
three 
(3) 
year 
period. 
The 
Project 
involves 
a 
total 
expenditure 
of 
US$19 
million, 
of 
which Bank financing 
will 
comprise US$17.1 
million. 
All 
of 
this 
amount 
will 
be 
for 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
activities, 
except 
for 
notional 
amounts 
of 
US$0.39 
million 
for 
incremental operating 
expenses 
of 
the 
PMU, 
and 
the 
recovery 
of 
the 
PPF Advance 
of 
US$0.4 
million. 
The 
Project Management 
Unit 
(PMU) 
will 
be 
located 
at 
the 
Office 
of 
the 
Coordinating 
Minister 
for 
Economic 
Affairs, 
with 
Project 
Implementing 
Units 
(PIUS) 
in 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Communications 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Settlements and 
Regional 
Infrastructure. 
Inter-agency 
coordination 
will 
be 
undertaken 
by 
the 
Committee 
on 
Policy 
for 
Acceleration 
of 
Infrastructure 
Development 
(KKPPI). 
It 
is 
anticipated 
that essentially 
all 
of 
the 
project activities 
and 
expenditure 
will 
actually 
be 
managed 
by 
centralized 
PMU 
and 
PIUs, 
who 
have 
had 
prior 
experience 
in 
managing 
Bank 
financed 
projects, 
it 
is 
anticipated 
that 
implementation 
and 
financial 
management 
will 
not 
impose 
special challenges.  Based 
on 
these 
factors, 
financial 
management 
risks 
inherent 
in 
the 
project entity 
have been 
rated 
as 
“moderate”. 
An 
analysis 
of 
project 
specific 
risks 
indicates 
that moderate 
risks 
may 
arise 
from 
several 
features. 
The 
inherently 
weak 
financial 
management capacity 
in 
Government organizations 
imposes 
moderate 
risks 
on 
financial 
accounting and reporting, 
particularly 
in 
view 
of 
the 
proposed 
introduction 
of 
quarterly 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Reporting 
for 
this 
project. 
This 
is 
sought 
to 
be 
mitigated 
by 
concentrating 
all 
project 
accounting 
activities 
at 
the 
PMU 
level 
and 
the 
recruitment 
of 
a trained 
individual 
financial 
management consultant 
to 
assist 
in 
the 
preparation 
of 
project 
financial 
statements. 
Accounting 
will 
be 
computerized.  Payment 
validation 
systems 
have 
traditionally 
been weak 
in 
Bank 
financed projects 
in 
Indonesia 
and consequently 
risks 
here 
are 
rated 
as 
substantial. 
To 
mitigate 
these, 
more 
intensive 
validation 
procedures, 
including 
community 
disclosure 
and oversight 
mechanisms where applicable, 
have 
been 
suggested 
and 
documented 
in 
a 
Project Manual. 
It 
is 
proposed that we 
accept 
BPKP 
as 
project 
auditors, 
given 
the 
relatively 
moderate 
financial 
management 
risks. 
Based 
on 
the 
on-going efforts 
to 
strengthen the 
Supreme 
Audit 
Agency 
(BPK), 
there 
will 
be 
discussion 
during 
project implementation 
regarding 
the 
possible 
use 
of 
this 
project 
as 
a 
training 
example 
for 
BPK 
staff 
auditors 
to 
familiarize 
themselves 
with 
project 
audits 
procedures.

Summary 
of 
Project 
Description 
The 
project 
is 
designed 
as 
a 
set 
of 
four distinct 
components, 
all 
of 
which 
are 
for 
technical 
assistance, 
capacity 
building 
and 
training, 
except 
the 
small 
PMU 
support component. 
The 
components 
on 
advisory 
services 
will 
focus 
on 
Cross 
Sector 
policy 
and 
strategic 
issues; 
a 
sector 
specific 
component 
will 
help 
prepare 
similar 
sector 
policies 
and 
strategies 
on 
a 
selection 
of 
infrastructure 
investments, 
including 
the 
development 
of 
appropriate 
regulatory institutions. 
These 
will 
be 
arranged 
through 
suitably 
qualified 
consultants. 
Capacity 
building 
and 
training 
activities 
will 
also 
be 
undertaken. 
A 
notional 
amount 
of 
US$700,000 
will 
also 
be 
spent 
in 
assisting 
local 
govemments 
with 
specific 
PPI 
studies. 
Project 
organization 
proposed 
The 
Project 
will 
involve 
several 
central 
government 
agencies, 
notably 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Communications 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Settlements and 
Regional 
Infrastructure, 
as 
well 
as 
OCMEA, 
as 
Project Implementing 
Units. 
A 
Project Management 
Unit 
will 
work 
under 
the 
KPPI 
Secretariat. 
The 
PMU 
is 
chaired 
by 
the 
OCMEA’s 
Assistant 
Deputy 
for 
Transportation 
and 
Telecommunications Infrastructure Development, 
and 
its 
administrative 
budget 
will 
be included 
in 
the 
OCMEA’s 
budget. 
The 
PMU 
was 
recently 
established (February 
2003), 
but 
its 
administrative and 
financial 
management procedures 
are 
similar 
to 
the 
on-going 
Corporate 
Restructuring 
Technical 
Assistance 
Loan 
(Ln. 
4484). 
A 
local 
individual 
consultant 
has 
been 
appointed 
for 
assisting 
the 
PMU 
in 
financial 
management, 
including 
preparation 
of 
project 
financial 
accounts. 
The 
consultant 
will 
be 
trained 
by 
Bank 
staff 
in 
the 
preparation 
of 
FMRs 
and 
other 
Bank 
requirements 
on 
financial 
management. 
Impact 
of 
procurement 
arrangements 
on 
financial 
management 
Technical 
Assistance 
packages 
and 
training 
consulting 
contracts 
will 
be 
procured 
centrally 
at 
the 
PMU 
and 
international 
bidding 
will 
be 
used 
for 
about 
60% 
of 
the 
project 
expenditures, 
all 
of 
which 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
prior 
review 
procedures. 
The 
expenditure proposed 
in 
regional 
governments 
will 
be 
defined 
in 
the second 
project 
year 
and 
thereafter. 
These 
will 
be 
undertaken 
and accounted 
for 
centrally 
at 
the 
PMU. 
Overall 
procurement 
risk 
has 
been 
assessed 
by 
the 
project 
DPS 
as 
“Average 
”. 
Project 
supervision 
in 
this 
area 
will 
need 
to 
be intensive 
in 
the 
beginning. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
financial 
management 
a 
stringent 
scrutiny 
of 
payment 
validation 
systems 
will 
be 
undertaken 
to 
mitigate 
risks 
of 
collusion. 
Internal 
controls

The 
financial 
management 
risks 
of 
this 
project 
are 
rated 
as 
moderate 
overall.

Strengths 
and 
weaknesses 
The 
primary 
strength 
of 
this 
project 
is 
its 
simple 
design 
in 
terms 
of 
both 
categories and 
organizational framework. 
Most 
of 
the 
project 
expenditure 
will 
be 
on 
consultant 
expenditure. 
Implementation 
will 
also 
be 
managed 
by 
a small 
group 
of 
two 
(2) 
implementing 
agencies 
in 
central 
ministries 
in 
Jakarta 
and 
the 
PMU. 
This 
narrow focus 
will 
facilitate 
supervision 
and 
provide 
an 
opportunity 
to 
strengthen 
financial 
controls 
during 
implementation. 
Payment 
validation 
systems 
have 
often 
been 
weak 
in 
Bank 
financed projects. 
This 
weakness 
may 
get 
emphasized 
here 
because 
of 
the 
intangible 
nature 
of 
outputs 
or 
services that 
are 
generally 
inherent 
in 
technical 
assistance 
and 
will 
be 
paid for 
through 
consultants.  Recent experience 
in 
other 
Bank 
projects 
is 
that 
expenditure 
on 
consultant 
expenses 
are 
vulnerable to 
misuse. 
To 
mitigate 
this 
risk, 
additional 
procedures have 
been 
prescribed 
in 
the 
project 
FM 
manuals 
to 
incorporate 
lessons 
from 
recent experience, 
notably a 
requirement 
for 
direct 
and independent 
documentary evidence 
to 
verify 
completion 
of 
contracted services 
before 
payments 
are 
released 
to 
consultants. 
For 
training 
activities, 
payment 
validation 
procedures 
will 
require 
attachment 
of 
direct 
original 
supporting 
evidence 
of 
completion 
of 
all 
these 
activities, 
duly 
certified 
by 
agencies 
I’ 
entities 
receiving 
the 
training. 
To 
further 
strengthen 
accountability, 
it 
is 
proposed 
to 
encourage 
FMR 
based 
disbursements. 
To 
help 
prepare 
accurate 
and 
timely financial 
reports 
and 
FMRs 
on 
a quarterly 
basis, 
an 
individual 
local 
consultant 
will 
be 
appointed, 
to 
whom 
appropriate 
training 
will 
be 
provided.

Organization. 
For 
purposes 
of 
financial 
management 
a 
simple project organization 
is 
proposed, 
comprising 
a 
project 
treasurer at each 
of 
the 
three 
(3) 
PIUs (including 
the 
PMU 
at 
OCMEA). 
Payment 
requests 
(SPP) 
will 
be 
prepared 
and validated 
by 
project 
treasurer 
and 
authorized 
for 
release 
after 
validation 
and 
approval 
by 
the 
Pimpro. 
A 
list 
of

will 
be 
prepared 
by 
each 
PIU 
and 
sent 
monthly 
to 
the 
PMU 
for

Accounting. 
Given 
capacity 
constraints 
expected, 
it 
is 
proposed 
that 
financial 
accounting 
for all 
project 
activities 
is 
done 
at 
the 
PMU 
offices 
instead 
of 
at each 
PIU, 
for which 
the 
source 
documents 
will 
be 
collected 
at 
PMU 
office 
and 
reconciled 
monthly or 
quarterly 
with 
records 
of 
KPKN. 
Detailed 
arrangements 
for 
this 
has 
been 
incorporated 
in 
the 
Project Financial 
Management manual. 
A 
qualified local 
individual 
financial 
management 
consultant 
has 
been 
hired, 
tasked 
with 
ensuring 
that 
project financial 
accounting reports and 
FMRs 
are 
prepared 
accurately 
and 
at 
regular 
quarterly 
intervals. 
This 
consultant 
will 
also 
train 
government 
staff 
in 
the

Accounting 
policies 
and

An 
assessment 
of 
the 
country’s 
budgeting 
system 
has 
been 
comprehensively 
made 
in 
recent diagnostic 
products 
from 
the 
Bank, 
including 
CFAA 
(Report 
No. 
21824-IND 
April 
27,2001) 
and 
Indonesia 
Public 
Spending 
in 
a 
Time 
of 
Change 
Report 
(No. 
19845 
IND 
March 
30, 
2000). 
The 
CFAA 
has 
classified 
the 
control 
environment 
in 
the 
country 
as 
“weak’, 
and 
has 
recommended a 
series 
of 
measures 
to 
strengthen 
this. 
Since 
then, 
the 
Government 
has 
drafted 
a 
set 
of 
three 
new laws 
to 
reform 
the 
Public Expenditure 
systems 
in 
the 
country. 
These 
laws, 
covering 
State 
Finance, 
State 
Treasury 
and State 
Finance 
Accountability 
have been 
submitted 
to 
the Indonesian 
Parliament. 
Subsequently, 
in 
May 
2002, 
a 
White 
Paper 
titled 
“Reform 
of 
Public 
Financial 
Management System 
in 
Indonesia” 
has 
been 
issued 
by 
the 
ministry 
of 
Finance. 
This 
White 
Paper 
addresses 
most 
of 
the 
recommendations 
made 
in 
the 
CFAA 
Report. 
A 
new law on 
State 
Finance 
has 
been 
passed 
by 
Parliament 
in 
March 
03. 
Public Expenditure 
accounting 
continues 
to 
be 
on 
a 
cash basis. 
However, recently 
in 
July 
2002 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
has 
set 
up 
an 
Accounting 
Standards 
body to 
coordinate 
the 
development 
of 
accounting 
standards 
in 
Indonesia 
generally. 
BAKUN 
(of 
MOF) 
is 
also 
worlung 
to 
plan 
the 
introduction 
of 
modified 
accruals 
based 
accounting 
systems 
for 
public 
expenditure 
in 
the 
country. 
The 
first 
set 
of 
draft 
standards 
on 
this 
basis 
have 
been issued 
in 
Oct. 
2002. 
State 
Finance 
is 
audited 
by 
BPKP, 
the 
Administrative 
Audit

of

for 
Economic

and 
3 
PIUs 
in 
other 
Ministries 
(Ministry 
of 
Communications, 
OCMEA 
and

Job 
descriptions 
for 
project 
staff 
at 
each 
locations 
have been 
prepared 
and 
included 
in 
the 
Project 
Manual. 
Much 
of 
the 
project 
activity 
will 
be 
procured and 
implemented 
in 
central ministries 
in 
Jakarta, 
with 
some 
limited 
activity 
in 
the regions. 
This 
reduces 
organizational 
risks. 
The 
PIUs 
normally 
have 
full 
time 
accounting staff 
available 
at 
their finance divisions, 
for 
basic government accounting. 
The capacity 
is 
limited, similar 
to 
that 
in 
government 
cadres. 
A 
qualified 
accounting consultant 
has 
been 
hired 
for 
the 
project 
preparation 
period, 
and 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
available 
for 
the 
project 
period 
also, 
considering 
that 
additional 
support 
may 
be 
needed 
in 
view 
of 
the 
technical 
accounting 
requirements 
of 
the 
FMR 
system proposed 
for 
this 
project. 
It 
is 
therefore 
proposed 
the 
individual 
Financial

and 
procurement reports 
through 
the 
project.  Appropriate 
training 
will 
be provided 
by 
Bank 
staff. 
Under 
existing 
GO1 
systems, 
financial 
accounting 
is 
based 
on 
payment 
vouchers 
(SPM) 
issued 
by 
local 
treasury 
offices 
of 
the

has 
been 
appointed 
to 
help 
maintain financial 
accounting. 
They 
will 
also 
be 
tasked 
with 
suitably 
training 
full 
time 
Govemment 
staff 
and 
handing 
over 
the 
accounting 
work 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
project. 
All 
the 
project 
expenditure 
will 
be 
for 
consulting 
services. 
There 
is 
no 
expenditure 
envisaged 
on 
civil 
works 
or 
procurement 
of 
goods. 
Completion 
of 
consulting 
work 
will 
need 
certification 
by 
beneficiary 
organizations 
or 
agencies. 
The 
intangible 
nature 
of 
such 
benefits 
of 
TA 
gives 
it 
a 
higher 
inherent 
risk. 
Under existing 
GO1 
systems, 
financial 
accounting 
is 
based 
on 
payment vouchers 
(SPM) 
issued 
by 
local 
treasury 
offices 
of 
the 
MOF 
(KPKN). 
GO1 
accounting 
systems 
follow 
a 
standard 
chart 
of 
accounts. 
Not 
applicable. 
Payment 
validation 
will 
be 
undertaken 
by 
the 
respective PKJ. 
Current payment 
verification 
systems 
prescribed 
by 
GO1 
will 
be 
followed. 
Past 
experience 
in 
other 
Bank 
projects 
is 
that expenditure 
on 
consultant 
expenses are 
vulnerable 
to 
misuse. 
To 
mitigate 
this 
risk, 
additional 
procedures 
have 
been 
prescribed 
in 
the 
project 
FM 
manuals 
to 
require 
direct 
and independent 
documentary evidence 
to 
be furnished 
to 
verify 
completion 
before 
payments 
are 
released 
to 
consultants.

Conditions 
for 
eligibility 
of

Contractor payments 
will 
be approved 
by 
Pimpro 
and 
paid 
out 
through central 
treasury 
offices 
(KPKN). 
These 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
standard 
KPKN 
control 
procedures. 
All 
components 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
procured 
at 
the 
PMU, 
with 
about 
60% 
of 
project 
activity 
procured 
subject 
to

procedures. 
The

will 
be 
authorized 
for

the 
PMU 
subject

mechanisms. 
All 
payments 
will 
be 
paid 
out through a 
Special

Replenishments 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
based 
on 
quarterly 
FMRs 
and 
Withdrawal 
Applications 
prepared 
by 
PMU 
and 
approved 
by 
DG 
Budget. 
Quarterly 
FMRs 
will 
be 
introduced 
from 
inception, 
for 
which 
training 
will 
be 
given. 
FMR 
based

be implemented. 
Since 
a

will 
be 
in 
use, 
inaccuracies 
may 
arise. 
Computers 
will 
be 
provided 
for 
these 
applications. 
Procedures 
have 
also been 
prescribed 
in 
the 
FM 
Manual 
to 
reconcile 
project financial 
accounting 
statements 
with 
comparable statements 
issued 
internally

produce 
social or 
environmental 
impacts, 
nor 
resettlement 
issues. 
These changes 
in 
policy, 
law 
and 
regulations 
could 
improve or 
detract 
from 
the 
ability 
of 
GO1 to 
enforce 
the 
existing 
environmental 
and 
social 
safeguards 
requirements 
(generally 
adequate) 
in 
projects 
implemented 
by 
private 
parties. 
The 
Project 
will 
include 
an 
evaluation 
of 
the 
impact upon 
safeguards 
effectiveness 
of 
all 
new legal 
and 
regulatory 
measures 
assessed 
by 
the 
project 
advisory 
team and consultants. 
Additionally, 
the 
project 
will 
support 
the 
preparation 
of 
a 
limited 
number 
of 
demonstration 
projects 
designed 
to 
be 
feasible 
and attractive 
for 
private 
investment. 
These 
pilot 
projects 
would 
generally 
be 
schemes 
targeting 
sectors such 
as 
telecommunication 
and transportation. 
These 
demonstration 
projects 
could 
produce environmental 
and 
social 
issues 
when 
physical 
works, 
for 
example 
telecommunication 
towers 
or 
public 
transport 
schemes, 
are 
carried 
out 
by 
selected 
private 
investors 
who 
are 
contracted 
as 
the 
results 
of 
this 
project. 
Under 
the 
PPITA 
project, 
the 
Bank 
support 
to 
be 
provided 
would 
extend 
through 
the 
tendering, 
award 
and contract negotiation 
stages 
for 
such 
demonstration 
projects, 
as 
well 
as 
evaluating 
the 
replicability 
of 
such 
projects. 
During 
PPITA 
project 
preparation, however, 
no 
attempt 
was 
appropriate 
to finalize 
the 
selection 
of 
such 
demonstration 
schemes. 
It 
is 
therefore 
necessary 
to develop a 
safeguards 
procedure and 
screening requirements 
for 
environmental 
and 
social 
issues. 
This 
procedure and 
its 
environmental 
and 
social 
requirements 
are 
based 
on 
the 
existing GO1 
regulations 
and 
World 
Bank 
policies, 
and 
should be 
applied 
in 
all 
demonstration 
project 
preparation and integrated 
into 
the 
tendering and 
implementing 
documents 
for 
each 
selected 
scheme. 
1. 
Environmental 
assessment 
1.1 
Project 
screening 
The 
EA 
screening 
should 
be 
based 
on 
the 
environmental 
screening 
of 
the 
PPITA pilot 
projects 
which would 
utilize 
Prosedur Penyaringan 
Amdal 
and 
UKWUPL 
(Prosedur 
Kerja 
No. 
1.1) 
to 
determine whether 
Amdal 
or 
UKWUPL 
is 
required. 
This 
process 
was 
an 
output 
of 
the 
Institutional 
Strengthening 
in 
Environmental 
Management 
(ISEM) 
project 
and 
has 
been adopted 
by 
Kimpraswil 
(Ministry 
of 
Settlements and 
Regional 
Infrastructure) 
as 
the 
recommended 
screening procedure 
for 
all 
projects. The 
two-stage screening 
process 
consists 
of 
0 
Initial 
screening 
to 
determine 
whether 
any 
environmental examination 
is 
required; 
and 
(Andal 
or 
UKIAJPL). 
0 
Second 
stage 
screening 
to 
determine 
the 
extent 
of 
further environmental examination 
-

Page  78
The 
initial 
screening 
should 
be 
used 
to 
determine 
the 
classification 
of 
EA 
requirement equivalent 
to 
Category 
A, 
B 
and 
C 
under 
the 
World 
Bank 
safeguard 
policies. 
As 
a 
general 
rule, 
projects 
determined 
in 
the 
screening 
to 
require 
ANDAL 
will 
be 
considered 
as 
falling into 
the 
Bank’s 
Category 
A; 
such 
schemes 
will 
be included 
for 
preparation 
support 
from 
PPITA 
only 
if 
an 
adequate 
ENAndal 
study 
is 
already 
prepared 
at 
the 
time 
it 
is 
proposed 
for 
PPITA 
support 
(i.e. 
PPITA 
will 
not 
devote 
significant 
resources 
to 
funding 
ENAndal 
preparation, 
but 
could 
review 
such 
studies 
prepared 
previously). 
Projects 
determined to 
require 
UKUUPL 
for 
less 
intensive 
treatment 
will 
be 
considered 
as 
falling into 
Category 
B 
and 
potentially 
acceptable 
for 
inclusion 
in 
PPITA. 
Any 
exceptions 
to 
this 
rule 
for 
A 
and 
B 
decisions can 
be 
dealt 
with 
as 
special 
cases 
in 
consultation 
with 
the 
World 
Bank 
environmental 
specialists. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
preparation 
of 
demonstration projects 
designed 
to 
be 
feasible 
and 
attractive 
for 
private 
investment, 
each 
project 
will 
have clear 
environmental 
requirements 
resulting 
from 
the 
EA 
screening 
available 
when 
the 
government 
invites private 
investors 
for 
bidding on 
the 
project. 
During 
the 
initial 
screening 
stage, 
the government can 
utilize 
existing 
data 
and 
maps 
already 
available 
during 
project 
preparation. 
If 
such 
data and 
information 
are 
not 
available, 
site 
visits 
or 
other 
means 
of 
data and 
information 
collection 
will 
be 
undertaken 
by 
the 
PPITA 
PMU 
to 
establish 
the 
data needed 
for 
screening 
(PMU 
budget 
are 
available 
for 
limited 
field 
work 
only). 
An 
approval 
from 
the 
World 
Bank 
for 
the 
EA 
classification 
and proposed 
safeguard 
measures 
for 
each 
of 
the 
demonstration projects 
is 
a 
condition 
before 
the 
government 
invites 
investors 
for 
bidding 
the 
proposed projects. 
The 
second 
stage 
screening 
(equivalent 
to 
scoping 
in 
EA) 
requires a 
more 
detailed 
assessment 
of 
the 
characteristics 
of 
the 
projects, 
available 
from 
existing 
project 
preparation 
data, 
and 
more 
detailed 
assessment 
of 
the 
characteristics 
of 
the 
area 
to 
be 
developed or 
occupied. 
Key 
environmental 
concerns 
such 
as 
the 
scope 
of 
impacts, 
assessment 
boundaries, sensitive factors 
such 
as 
nature conservation, 
biodiversity, 
etc., 
should be 
considered. 
It 
will 
be 
necessary 
to 
undertake 
field 
studies 
during 
this 
second 
stage 
of 
screening 
in 
order 
to 
fully 
understand 
the 
potential 
environmental impacts 
caused 
by 
the 
proposed 
project. 
When 
the 
proposal 
for 
a 
pilot 
project 
is 
initially 
accepted and agreed 
between 
the 
government and 
private 
investor(s), 
the 
government 
should 
provide 
at 
least 
partial 
financing 
(to 
be 
negotiated 
case-by-case) 
for 
the 
potential 
investor to 
conduct 
the 
second 
stage 
EA 
screening 
and 
prepare 
the 
draft 
environmental 
documentation. 
1.2 
EA 
preparation 
It 
is 
the 
developer’s 
responsibility 
to 
carry 
out 
an 
environmental 
assessment 
although 
the 
local 
governments and 
institutions 
can 
provide 
policy 
guidance 
and technical 
support. 
In 
the 
meantime, seeking 
advice 
from 
the 
World 
Bank 
environmental staff 
is 
always 
encouraged. 
The 
environmental 
assessment 
should 
be 
carried out 
at 
project 
feasibility 
stage 
and 
the 
results 
of 
which 
should 
be, 
to 
the 
largest extent, 
reflected 
in 
project 
feasibility 
study 
and 
design. 
For 
projects 
under 
the 
Bank’s 
Category 
A 
and 
B 
equivalent, 
a 
formal 
EA 
is 
required 
and 
the 
contents 
of 
the 
EA 
statement 
should 
be 
in 
consistent 
with 
the 
GO1 
and 
Bank 
requirements. 
For 
projects 
under 
Category C, 
an 
environmental 
analysis 
should 
be 
carried 
out 
and 
an 
environmental 
review 
checklist 
be 
filled 
as 
part 
of 
the 
project 
feasibility 
study 
for 
appraisal 
(see 
the attached 
checklist).

1.3 
Project 
ENanalysis 
approval 
For 
demonstration projects 
under 
the 
PPITA 
project, 
both 
the 
EA 
report 
and environmental 
review 
checklist 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
the 
review 
and approval 
by 
relevant 
local 
environmental 
authority 
and 
the 
World 
Bank. 
1.4 
Public participation, 
consultation 
and 
information 
disclosure 
During 
the 
course 
of 
project 
EA 
screening 
to 
approval, the 
public 
should 
at 
least have 
two 
formal 
opportunities 
to 
be 
consulted 
and 
to participate 
in 
project 
EA 
activities. 
The 
first 
opportunity 
should 
be 
at 
the 
screening 
stage 
and 
EA 
preparation 
when 
NGOs, 
local 
communities, and 
project 
affected people 
should 
be 
fully 
informed 
of 
the 
project 
and 
consulted 
in 
the 
forms 
of 
meetings, 
surveys, 
publicity 
through 
handouts, and 
local 
media. 
Their 
experience 
and 
considerations 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
potential environmental 
impacts 
should 
be 
fully 
included 
in 
screening 
and 
EA 
preparation. 
The 
second 
opportunity 
should 
be 
after 
an 
EA 
report 
or 
environmental 
analysis 
report 
is 
completed and before 
the 
approval 
by 
the government 
authority 
and 
the 
Bank. 
During 
this 
period, 
the 
EA 
report 
or 
analysis 
should 
be 
made 
available 
in 
the 
local community 
such 
as 
local 
library, 
project 
development 
office 
and 
other 
venues. 
NGOs, 
local 
communities 
and 
project 
affected 
people 
should 
be 
informed 
of 
such 
availability 
through 
local 
media 
and 
public 
meetings 
or 
gatherings. 
The 
time 
for 
the 
EA 
report/analysis 
report 
to 
be 
displayed 
for 
comments 
should 
be 
no 
less 
than three 
weeks. 
1.5 
Environmental 
management 
plan 
(EMP) 
implementation 
and 
monitoring 
For 
Category 
A 
and 
B 
equivalent 
projects, an 
environmental 
management 
plan 
(EMP) 
should 
be 
developed 
in 
the 
EA. 
The 
EMP 
should include 
the 
major 
environmental impacts 
caused 
by 
the 
project 
during 
construction 
and operation 
stages, 
the 
proposed 
mitigation 
measures, 
and 
monitoring 
and 
reporting 
requirements 
(see 
format 
samples attached) 
to 
ensure 
the 
implementation 
of 
such 
measures. 
The activities 
proposed 
in 
EMP 
should 
be 
integrated 
into 
contract 
tendering documents 
as 
part 
of 
the 
bill 
of 
quantities, 
which would allow 
the 
proper 
budget 
for 
implementing 
such 
mitigation 
and 
monitoring 
measures. 
The 
contractor 
should 
implement 
all 
the 
mitigation 
measures 
as 
required 
in 
project 
contracts 
and 
the 
supervision 
engineers 
have 
the 
responsibility 
to 
supervise 
the 
implementation 
of 
such 
measures 
and report to 
the 
private 
investor. 
The 
private investor should report 
the 
results 
to 
the 
local 
environmental 
authorities, 
who 
would 
forward 
these 
to 
the 
project 
management 
office (PPITA 
PMU). 
The 
local 
environmental 
authority 
should 
carry 
out 
periodic 
monitoring for 
the 
implementation 
of 
EMP. 
The 
results 
of 
which 
should 
be 
reported 
to 
the 
project 
management 
office, 
and 
the 
PMU 
should 
inform 
the 
World 
Bank 
of 
such 
results 
and 
EMP 
implementation 
progress. 
2. 
Social 
assessment 
Social 
assessment, 
land 
acquisition 
and resettlement 
for 
pilot 
projects 
are 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
government. 
Land 
acquisition and 
resettlement 
must 
be

and 
land be

implementation 
before 
the 
government 
signs 
contracts 
with 
private 
investors 
for 
respective 
projects. 
For 
demonstration projects 
which 
need considerable 
land 
acquisition 
and resettlement, 
a 
resettlement 
action 
plan 
(RAP) 
should 
be 
prepared 
under 
the 
policy 
frameworks 
developed 
for 
the 
relevant 
sectors 
(such 
as 
that 
in 
East 
Indonesia Transport 
Project). 
However, 
such 
projects 
would 
generally 
not 
fit 
the 
above-stated 
criteria 
for 
a 
PPITA 
pilot 
project. 
For 
projects 
with 
limited 
land 
acquisition 
and 
resettlement, 
the 
attached 
Environmental/Social Review 
Checklist 
will 
be 
used. 
For 
both 
projects 
with 
either 
considerable 
or 
minor 
land 
acquisition 
and 
resettlement, the 
implementation 
of 
a 
RAP 
or 
Checklist should be 
strictly 
in 
compliance 
with 
the 
policy 
framework 
developed 
in 
the 
Institutional 
Strengthening 
in 
Environmental 
Management 
(ISEM) 
project. 
2.1 
Land 
acquisition 
and 
compensation 
ISEM 
prepared 
a 
set 
of 
procedures, 
processes 
and 
guidelines 
connected 
with 
land 
acquisition 
and

They 
incorporate 
the

future 
approach 
for 
consultation. 
The 
key

Resettlement 
ISEM 
prepared 
a 
set 
of 
procedures, 
processes 
and guidelines 
connected 
with 
resettlement. They 
incorporated 
the 
requirements

2.3 
Isolated vulnerable 
people 
ISEM 
prepared 
a 
set 
of 
procedures, 
processes 
and guidelines connected 
with 
isolated 
people. 
They incorporated 
the 
requirements 
of 
both 
the

that 
will 
accrue 
to 
the

2.4 
Other 
possible 
social 
impacts 
The 
PPITA 
project 
has 
selected 
telecommunication, 
water supply, 
urban 
services and transport 
as 
the 
key 
target 
sectors 
to 
attract 
the 
private 
investment. 
One 
of 
the 
other 
potential 
social 
impacts 
in 
addition 
to 
land 
acquisition, 
resettlement and 
indigenous people 
is 
the 
effects 
on 
isolated 
communities and 
culture 
caused, 
for 
example, 
by 
wireless 
communication 
which 
can reach every 
comer 
of 
the 
islands 
in 
Indonesia. 
It 
is 
suggested 
that 
the 
PMU 
seek 
a 
grant-based 
fund 
to 
study 
this 
issue 
through 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
completed and on-going projects 
in 
telecommunications 
and 
other 
relevant projects 
which 
accessed 
to 
such 
isolated 
communities.

of 
which 
is already available 
A revised Keppres 7 has been prepared 
to 
reflect 
the 
implications 
of 
the 
decentralization legislation for projects 
undertaken by regional governments and 
to 
provide a 
more 
comprehensive guidance 
on the various requirements for effective 
private participation, including 
on: 
unsolicited projects, the clarification in the 
contract documents 
of 
government 
support, 
the tariff setting principles 
and 
tariff 
adjustment mechanism, 
and 
on dispute

With

extent 
of

be clearly spelled 
out 
in

(and later 
in 
the

While the 
relevant 
regulation provides for 
land acquisition based 
on 
either eminent 
domain 
or 
negotiation, eminent domain is 
rarely used. Negotiation 
is 
generally 
very 
time consuming and often unnecessarily 
costly. Negotiation also 
can

unfair

As 
earnings

infrastructure projects 
are 
typically 
in 
domestic 
funds 
while investment 
is capital intensive and requires long 
maturities, substantial foreign exchange 
risks arise when financing comes from

in

Approach and 
Criteria for 
TA 
Assignments 
1. 
Introduction 
Proposals 
for 
TA 
assignments 
to 
be 
supported 
by 
the 
project 
or 
other 
funding 
sources 
in 
the 
context 
of 
Aid 
Coordination 
will 
be 
very 
diverse 
in 
nature and 
scope. 
They 
will: 
relate 
to 
different 
sectors and sub-sectors 
and 
originate 
in 
different 
clientshmplementing 
agencies 
deal 
with 
cross-sectoral, 
sectoral 
and 
sub-sectoral issues 
address 
issueshmpediments 
to 
effective 
PPI 
at 
different 
levels 
(i.e., 
at 
the 
level 
of 
policy 
development 
or 
at various 
levels 
of 
policy 
implementation) 
in 
the 
process 
of 
developing 
and 
establishing 
an 
appropriate 
framework 
for 
PSP. 
For 
this 
reason, the 
selection approach 
will 
be 
anchored 
in 
the 
sectorhub-sector 
PSP 
Framework 
Assessments 
and 
the 
Country 
PPI 
Strategy 
which 
will 
be 
developed at the start 
of 
the 
project 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
Advisory 
TA 
in 
CMEA, 
MSRI 
and 
MOC. 
As 
the 
PPI 
Strategy 
will 
set 
out 
the 
requirements 
for 
an 
effective 
policy 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
to 
enable 
and 
facilitate 
PPI, the 
approach 
will 
ensure 
that 
TA 
assignments 
being 
proposed 
will 
contribute 
significantly 
to 
establishment 
of 
an 
appropriate 
enabling 
framework 
for 
PPI. 
The 
overall 
process 
and 
responsibilities 
for 
respective 
steps 
will 
be 
following. 
2. 
Sector 
PSP 
Framework 
Assessments 
and 
Country 
PPI 
Strategy 
The 
PSP 
Framework 
Assessments 
will 
identify 
impediments 
and constraints 
to private participation 
in 
infrastructure 
and 
develop 
the requirements 
of 
an 
effective 
policy 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
for 
each 
of 
the 
main 
sectors/subsectors. 
The 
Country 
PPI 
Strategy 
will 
provide 
an 
overall 
strategy 
for 
preparing 
the 
key 
component 
elements 
of 
the 
enabling 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
within 
the 
timeframe 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
sectoral/sub-sectoral 
Frameworks 
will 
be 
prepared 
in 
collaboration 
between 
the 
Advisory 
TA 
and the respective 
Directorates General 
within 
MOC 
and 
MSRI. 
The 
Country 
PPI 
Strategy 
will 
be 
prepared 
in 
collaboration 
between 
the 
KKPPI 
and 
the 
Advisory 
TA 
at 
CMEA. 
This 
work 
will 
be 
completed 
within 
the 
first 
3 
months 
of 
the 
start 
of 
the 
Advisory 
TAs. 
3. 
Proposal 
Identification 
and 
Preparation 
The 
relevant ministries 
and 
sub-sectoral directorates 
will 
identify 
proposals 
aimed 
at 
developing 
the 
key 
elements 
of 
the 
enabling 
framework 
set 
out 
in 
the 
country 
PPI 
Strategy. 
The 
proposals 
will 
be 
prepared 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
and 
with 
inputs 
from 
the 
Advisory 
TA 
as 
the 
case 
may 
be 
at 
MOC, 
MSRI 
and 
CMEA. 
It 
is 
likely 
that 
high 
priority 
tasks 
will 
be 
identified while 
the 
sectoralhub-sectoral 
PSP 
Framework 
Assessments are 
being firmed 
up. 
Thus, 
the 
identificatiodpreparation 
of 
high 
priority 
proposals 
would 
not 
necessarily 
have 
to 
await 
completion 
of 
these 
assessments. 
4. 
Preliminary 
Screening 
Preliminary 
screening 
will 
be 
undertaken at 
the 
sectoral 
level 
as 
follows: 
by 
the 
Agency 
for 
Construction 
and Investment 
at 
MSRI 
for 
proposals 
from 
MSRI; 
by 
the 
Bureau 
of 
Planning 
at 
MOC 
for 
proposals 
from 
- 
90 
- 
Page  98
MOC; 
and 
by 
the 
PMU 
at 
CMEA 
for 
proposals 
from CMEA, 
Bappenas, 
Ministry 
of 
SOE 
and 
Local 
Government. 
This 
step 
will 
involve 
verification 
that: 
the 
proposal 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
priorities 
identified 
in 
the 
sub-sectoral PSP 
Framework 
all 
necessary 
supporting 
documentation 
is 
provided, 
including 
outline 
TOR, 
preliminary 
budget 
Assessment 
and 
the 
Country 
PPI 
Strategy 
estimate, 
clarification 
of 
links 
with 
other 
ongoing 
or 
past 
work, 
and any other 
pertinent 
information. 
5. 
Final 
Screening 
The 
purpose 
of 
this 
step 
is 
to 
ensure 
that: 
(i) 
relative 
priorities 
from 
the perspective 
of 
the 
infrastructure 
sector 
as 
a 
whole 
will 
be 
reflected 
in 
the 
final 
proposals 
forwarded 
to 
the 
Steering 
Committee 
for 
approval; 
(ii) 
proposals are presented 
in 
a comparable 
format. 
Final 
screening 
will 
be 
undertaken 
by 
an 
Ad-hoc 
Group 
appointed 
by 
the Steering 
Committee 
for 
purposes 
of 
final 
screening 
It 
is 
envisaged 
that 
the 
task 
of 
final 
screening 
could 
also 
be 
entrusted 
to 
the 
Advisory 
TA 
at 
CMEA. 
The 
Ad-hoc 
Group 
will 
conduct 
its 
work 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
Advisory 
TA 
at 
CMEA. 
This 
step 
will 
involve 
assessment 
that: 
w 
the 
proposal 
is 
consistent 
with 
the recommendations 
of 
the 
Country 
PPI 
strategy 
the 
supporting documentation 
provided 
is 
appropriate 
in 
content 
and format 
for 
a 
decision 
by 
the 
Steering 
Committee 
Proposals 
which 
are assessed 
as 
eligible 
for 
financing 
will 
be 
forwarded 
to 
the 
Steering Committee 
together 
with 
the 
evaluation 
and recommendation 
of 
the 
Ad-hoc 
Group. 
If 
the 
assessment 
of 
the 
Ad-hoc 
Group 
is 
that 
the 
proposal 
would 
require modifications 
or 
further 
strengthening 
or clarifications 
it 
will 
be 
returned 
to 
the 
proponent 
entity 
(as 
the 
case 
may 
be through 
the 
Agency 
for 
Construction 
and Investment, 
Planning 
Bureau, 
PMU) with 
guidance 
as 
to 
the 
additional 
work 
required. 
6. 
Approval 
Stage 
The proposal 
will 
be 
reviewed 
by 
the 
Steering Committee 
based 
on 
the 
evaluation and 
recommendation 
of 
the 
Ad-hoc Group. 
The main 
focus 
of 
the 
review 
of 
the 
Steering 
Committee 
will 
be 
on 
the 
relative 
priority 
of 
the 
proposal 
within 
the 
Country 
PPI 
Strategy 
and 
taking 
into 
account the 
available 
or potential 
funding 
identified 
in 
the 
context 
of 
Aid 
Coordination. 
The 
review 
by 
the 
Steering 
Committee 
can 
result 
in 
the 
following 
potential 
outcomes: 
Approval 
is 
given 
subject 
to 
the 
proposal 
being 
finalized 
within 
the parameters 
of 
the 
outline 
The 
proposal 
needs 
modification or 
further 
clarification or 
development 
of 
particular 
aspects 
and 
Approval 
is 
not 
provided. 
This 
will 
likely 
be 
a 
situation 
where the 
proposed 
timing 
of 
the 
TOR 
and 
budget 
as 
provided 
in 
the 
proposal 
and any other 
specific 
guidance 
given 
by 
the 
Steering 
Committee 
the 
approval decision 
is 
deferred 
until 
this 
additional 
work 
has 
been completed. 
In 
this 
case 
clear 
guidance 
is 
provided 
as 
to 
the 
remaining 
work to 
be 
done 
activities 
is 
not 
appropriate, 
for 
example, when the start 
of 
the 
activities should await 
the 
results 
of 
ongoing 
work 
or 
key 
decisions 
by 
government. 
It 
is 
possible 
to 
foresee 
situations 
where 
a 
proposal should 
not 
proceed 
until 
and 
unless 
policy 
on 
government 
support 
or 
guarantees, 
or 
policy 
on 
risk 
allocation, 
or 
on 
tariff 
setting and 
adjustment 
has 
been 
clarified.

Proposals 
for 
Investment 
Project Preparation 
Support 
For 
investment 
project 
preparation 
support 
the 
same 
general 
process 
will 
be 
followed 
as 
for 
proposals 
to 
develop the 
enabling 
policy, 
legal 
and 
regulatory framework. 
However, 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
preparation 
of 
these 
proposals Preparation support 
would 
extend through 
the 
tendering, 
award 
and 
contract negotiations 
stages 
can 
be 
finalized 
during 
the 
timeframe 
of 
the 
project additional criteria 
will 
apply. 
The 
general 
process 
and 
the 
additional criteria 
are 
outlined 
below: 
Proposal 
Identification 
and 
Preparation 
First, 
proposals 
should 
be 
consistent 
with 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
sector/subsector PSP 
Framework 
Assessment 
and 
the 
Country 
PPI 
Strategy. 
In 
addition 
the 
following 
requirements should 
be 
met: 
There 
should be 
an 
appropriate sectoral/subsectoral 
policy 
on 
PSP, 
or 
if 
this 
is 
not 
yet 
the 
case, 
Environmental 
Safeguards. 
In 
principle, 
the 
proposed investment should 
not 
have 
significant 
there 
should 
be 
no 
major 
outstanding 
issues 
in 
regard 
to 
sectoral/subsectoral  PSP 
policies 
environmental impacts 
(as 
a general 
rule, 
projects determined 
to 
require 
an 
AND& 
would 
be 
considered 
as 
falling 
in 
the 
World 
Bank’s 
Category 
A). 
Schemes 
presenting 
Category 
A 
impacts 
will 
be 
considered 
for 
preparation support 
only 
if 
an 
adequate 
EA/Andal 
is 
already prepared 
at 
e 
-

Page  100
the 
time 
of 
proposal 
preparation. 
Further 
guidance 
on 
the 
environmental 
assessment 
process and 
requirements 
is 
outlined 
in 
Annex 
11 
of 
the 
World 
Bank 
Project 
Appraisal Document 
Social 
Safeguards. 
The 
proposed investments 
should 
not 
have 
significant social impacts (land 
acquisition, 
resettlement, 
impacts 
on 
isolated 
vulnerable 
people). 
For 
projects 
with 
limited 
social 
impacts, 
an 
impact 
assessment 
should be 
prepared 
and 
an 
Action 
Plan 
should be implemented 
in 
compliance 
with 
the 
policy 
frameworks 
agreed 
between 
GO1 
and the 
World 
Bank 
for 
the relevant 
sectors. 
Further 
guidance 
on 
the 
social 
assessment 
process 
and requirements 
is 
outlined 
in 
Annex 
11 
of 
the 
World 
Bank 
Project 
Appraisal 
Document. 
The 
proposed 
investment should 
have 
demonstrated 
economic and 
financial 
viability 
and 
indications 
of 
investor 
interest. 
If 
viability 
has 
not 
been 
formally 
demonstrated, 
the 
prima 
facie 
evidence 
based 
on 
costs 
and 
benefits 
as 
available 
from 
similar 
projects should 
clearly 
indicate 
that 
there 
are 
no 
issues 
of 
economic 
viability. 
In 
that 
case, 
economic 
and 
financial 
viability 
will 
need 
to 
be 
demonstrated 
as 
part 
of 
the 
project preparation 
The 
proposal should 
indicate 
the 
merits 
of 
the 
proposed 
project 
as 
a demonstration 
activity 
and 
the scope 
for 
replicability 
The 
proposal 
should 
confirm 
that 
the 
procurement 
process 
and 
procedures 
outlined 
in 
Keppres 
7/98 
(or 
its 
revision 
as 
of 
the date 
of 
the proposal) 
will 
be 
followed. 
Alternatively, 
in 
case 
it 
is 
not 
the 
intention to 
adhere 
strictly 
to 
this 
Decree, the 
proposal should 
spell out 
the procedure 
that 
would 
be 
followed 
and 
provide 
justification 
for 
any 
deviation 
from 
Keppres 
7. 
The 
proposal should 
detail 
the nature and 
scope 
of 
the various 
activities 
of 
project 
preparation 
support that 
are 
being 
sought and a 
timetable 
for 
their 
implementation 
till 
final 
contracting 
with 
the 
private 
sector 
party. 
It 
is 
expected that 
the 
work 
of 
investment 
project 
preparation 
support 
will 
include 
among 
other: 
developing regulatory 
guidance 
on 
issues 
of 
tariff 
setting 
and 
tariff 
adjustment, 
of 
risk 
allocation, 
and 
of 
government 
support; the 
preparation 
of 
standard 
contract documents and/or 
project 
specific contract 
documents: 
final 
design 
work 
and 
due 
diligence 
in 
general 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
implementing 
entity; and 
assistance 
on 
tendering 
and 
contract negotiation. 
Preliminary 
Screening 
and 
Final 
Screening 
The 
preliminary 
and 
final 
screening 
of 
proposals 
for 
investment preparation 
support 
will 
verify 
that 
in 
addition to 
the 
requirements 
for 
TA 
assignments 
to 
develop 
the 
policy, 
legal 
and 
regulatory framework, 
the above 
additional 
criteridrequirements 
are 
satisfied. 
Verification 
in 
the 
final 
screening 
step 
will 
focus, 
among 
other, 
on 
the 
following: 
That 
if 
deviations 
are 
proposed 
from 
Keppres 
7/98, 
these are 
well 
justified 
and 
are 
consistent 
That 
the 
proposal 
has 
clearly 
identified 
all 
the 
preparatory activities 
and requirements 
for 
That 
the 
timetable 
for 
completion 
of 
all 
project 
preparation 
activities 
till 
contracting 
with 
the 
with 
the 
spirit 
of 
Keppres 
7/98 
development 
of 
a 
sound 
private 
sector 
investment 
private 
party 
are 
compatible 
with 
the 
completion 
date 
of 
the 
project

Depending 
on 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
review, 
proposals 
will 
be 
either 
forwarded 
to 
the 
Steering Committee 
or 
returned 
for 
modifications 
or 
further 
strengthening.

Approval 
and 
Further 
Processing 
of 
the 
Proposal 
The 
main 
focus 
of 
the 
review 
by 
the 
Steering 
Committee 
will 
be 
on 
the 
merits 
of 
the 
project 
as 
a 
vehicle 
for 
testing and 
demonstrating 
the 
feasibility 
of 
a 
particular 
approach. 
It 
is 
expected that 
only 
in 
exceptional 
cases 
the 
approval 
by 
the 
Steering 
Committee 
will 
be 
final 
as 
the 
proposal 
documentation 
is 
unlikely 
to 
include 
all 
the 
final 
details 
on 
the 
nature and 
scope 
of 
the 
activities 
proposed 
to 
be 
carried 
out. 
If 
the 
Steering 
Committee provides 
its 
approval 
it 
would 
therefore generally be 
an 
approval 
in 
principle. 
Proposals 
would 
be 
returned 
to 
the 
proponent 
agency 
for 
further 
development 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
parameters 
of 
the 
proposal 
and guidance 
provided 
by 
the 
Steering Committee. 
The 
further 
processing 
steps 
will 
be 
similar 
to 
those 
for 
TA 
assignments 
to 
develop 
the 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
framework.

Additional 
Annex 
15: 
Anti-Corruption 
Action 
Plan 
INDONESIA: Private Provision 
of 
Infrastructure 
Technical Assistance 
Loan 
1. 
Background 
Since 
the 
resources 
of 
PPITA 
will 
be expended 
entirely 
on 
technical 
assistance, 
the 
corruption 
risks 
inherent 
in 
infrastructure projects 
will 
not 
be 
present. 
However, 
a 
significant 
performance 
issue 
in 
the 
Bank's urban 
sector 
programs 
in 
Indonesia 
to 
date 
has 
been 
the 
very uneven 
performance 
of 
consultants. 
In 
exploring 
the 
reasons 
for 
poor 
performance 
by 
consultants, 
interviews 
with 
project 
officials 
and consultants 
indicate 
that the 
problem 
is 
frequently 
caused 
by 
financial 
demands 
being 
made 
on 
the 
contract 
winner, 
in 
fact 
as 
a 
condition 
for 
winning 
the 
contract. 
The 
selected 
consultant 
then 
must 
cut 
other 
costs, 
perhaps 
by 
not 
filling 
some 
lower 
positions 
(which 
are 
still 
invoiced) 
or 
by 
providing 
under-qualified 
(less 
expensive) personnel. 
These 
are 
the 
primary 
sources 
of 
corruption 
which 
must 
be 
avoided 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
the 
PPITA 
project. 
Of 
course, 
the 
procurement 
and 
financial 
management 
systems 
which 
will 
be 
used 
in 
PPITA 
are 
based 
on 
Bank 
and 
GO1 
guidelines 
and regulations, 
but 
these 
have 
often 
not 
been 
sufficient 
to prevent 
corruption 
in 
previous 
projects. 
Nevertheless, 
The 
Project 
Operations 
Manual, 
which 
includes 
procurement, 
internal 
control, 
auditing, disbursement, 
accounting and reporting, 
will 
be 
the 
most 
important control 
in 
ensuring 
that 
opportunities 
for 
corruption 
are 
reduced to 
the 
absolute 
minimum 
possible. 
As 
noted 
Section 
9 
of 
the 
Project 
Implementation 
Plan, 
the 
procurement 
plan 
for 
the 
project 
has 
been 
designed 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
2001 
Country 
Procurement 
Assessment 
Report 
for 
Indonesia and 
is 
not 
expected 
to 
pose any 
unusual 
procurement 
issues 
or 
risks. 
In 
addition, 
financial 
management 
is 
not 
expected 
to 
pose 
significant problems 
because 
the 
project 
does 
not 
present 
any 
unusual 
challenges. 
The 
World 
Bank Policy 
on 
Disclosure 
of 
Information 
(June 
2002) 
states 
that 
'timely 
dissemination 
of 
information 
to 
local 
groups 
affected 
by 
the 
projects and 
programs supported 
by 
the 
Bank, 
including 
nongovernmental 
organizations, 
is 
essential 
for 
the 
effective implementation 
and 
sustainability 
of 
projects'. 
The 
strategy enunciated 
in 
these 
pages 
is 
intended 
to 
reflect 
the 
intention 
of 
this 
statement. 
2. 
Public 
Disclosure 
A 
primary 
safeguard against 
corrupt 
practices 
will 
be 
full 
and 
open 
disclosure 
of 
all 
selection 
activities 
and decisions, 
in 
particular 
concerning short-listing, 
evaluation, 
and staffing. 
All 
activities and 
documents 
will 
be 
open 
for 
public 
inspection 
and 
comment, 
but 
the 
keys 
to 
effective 
public 
disclosure 
are 
timely 
and complete dissemination 
of 
information 
and ready 
availability 
of 
documents 
for 
all 
who 
may wish 
to inspect 
them. 
Finally, 
the 
public 
must 
be 
made 
aware 
of 
where 
and 
how 
their 
comments 
and suggestions can 
be 
received 
and 
properly 
taken 
into 
consideration. 
All 
Procurement 
Officers 
(see 
below) 
will 
be 
instructed 
in 
mechanisms 
for 
public 
disclosure, 
and 
the 
PMU 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
monitoring 
compliance 
in 
each 
selection 
process.

The 
PPITA 
web site 
will 
contain 
data 
and 
information 
concerning 
the 
status 
of 
project 
implementation, 
including 
for 
example 
an 
annual 
work 
plan, 
ongoing 
activities, 
and 
current 
problems and 
issues. 
Since 
the 
web 
site 
will 
be 
interactive, 
persons 
desiring 
more 
detailed 
information 
will 
be 
able 
to 
submit 
request 
through 
this 
vehicle. 
Web 
site design 
and content 
will 
no 
doubt 
be 
revised 
as 
it 
becomes 
clear 
what 
type 
of 
information 
is 
most 
frequently 
sought. 
PPITA 
documents, 
including 
periodic 
and special reports, 
will 
be 
available 
for 
inspection 
at the 
PPITA 
office. 
However, 
internal 
memos, 
invoices 
and other documents 
will 
not 
be 
considered 
as 
available 
for 
public 
inspection. 
Annual 
audits 
by 
BPKP 
are 
public 
documents, 
but 
must 
be 
obtained 
from 
that 
agency. 
3. 
Selection 
of 
Consultants 
by 
Central 
Government 
Ministries 
It 
is 
expected that 
80-90 
TA 
contracts 
will 
be 
entered 
into 
over 
the 
3-year 
life 
of 
PPITA; 
these 
will 
be located 
in 
the 
three 
primary 
ministries 
(CMEA, 
MSRI, 
MOC). 
Within 
each 
of 
these 
ministries, 
there 
will 
be 
one 
designated Procurement 
Officer 
to handle 
the 
normal 
administrative 
aspects 
of 
contracting. 
This 
Officer 
may be 
from 
the 
PMU 
if 
the 
IA 
so 
desires. 
He 
will 
prepare 
the 
TOR’S 
and 
Owner’s Estimates 
for 
proposed 
sub-projects, 
with 
the assistance 
of 
the 
In-House 
Advisors. 
The 
PMU 
will 
submit 
these 
proposals 
to 
the 
KKPPI 
Committee 
for 
review 
and 
approval/rejection,  again 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
its 
In-House Advisors. 
The 
Procurement 
Officers 
will 
be 
assisted 
by 
Technical 
Evaluation 
Committees, 
which 
will 
include 
at 
least 
four 
persons 
with 
competency 
in 
the 
technical 
and/or 
managerial 
issues 
of 
the 
tender 
concerned. 
These 
Committees 
will 
include 
one 
member 
from 
the 
PMU 
and 
may include 
a 
consultant 
if 
specific 
required 
expertise 
is 
not 
otherwise 
available. 
One member 
from 
civil 
society 
will 
be 
included 
on 
each 
committee. 
The Technical 
Evaluation 
Committees 
will 
evaluate 
the 
technical 
proposals. 
Similarly, 
a 
Financial 
Evaluation 
Committee 
will 
be 
established 
in 
each 
IA, 
chaired 
by 
the 
Project Manager or 
PMU 
Financial 
Management Specialist 
and 
including 
the 
chairperson 
of 
the 
Technical 
Evaluation Committee 
and others 
as 
required. 
As 
above, one 
member 
from 
civil 
society 
will 
be 
included 
on 
each 
committee. 
These 
Committees 
will 
evaluate 
the 
financial 
proposals 
after 
the 
Technical 
Evaluation 
Report 
has 
been completed. 
Technical 
and 
Financial Committee 
members 
from 
civil 
society 
will 
be 
selected 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
procedures 
and 
criteria 
contained 
in 
the 
Procurement 
manual. 
The 
Procurement 
Officer 
and 
TechnicalFinancial Evaluation 
Committees 
will 
closely 
monitor 
the 
tender process. 
After 
receiving 
the 
evaluation reports 
of 
the 
two 
Committees, 
the 
Project 
Manager 
will 
submit 
the 
documents 
to 
the 
Bank 
as 
required 
to 
obtain 
the necessary 
NOLs. 
4. 
Safeguarding the 
Selection 
Process 
Bank 
guidelines 
concerning procurement 
will 
be 
made 
known 
and 
strictly 
adhered to. 
Of 
particular 
concern 
is 
that 
the 
short-listing 
is 
done 
completely 
transparently, 
with no 
influence 
exerted 
by 
any 
party 
concerned 
on 
behalf 
of 
any 
company 
or 
individual. 
All 
evaluations 
must 
be 
- 
102- 
Page  110
made 
in 
strict 
accordance 
with 
the procedures and 
criteria 
as 
stated 
in 
the Procurement 
Manual 
and made 
available to 
anyone 
for 
inspection.  Another concern 
is 
that 
selection 
for 
technical 
assistance 
to 
local 
governments 
will 
be 
difficult 
to 
monitor 
if 
conducted 
locally; 
for 
this 
reason, 
such 
selection 
will 
be 
managed 
by 
the 
CMEA 
Procurement 
Officer. 
Each 
Procurement 
Officer 
must 
ensure 
that 
a 
TechnicalFinancial 
Evaluation Committee 
member 
does 
not 
have 
a 
bias 
either 
for 
or 
against 
a 
consultant, 
such 
that 
his 
or 
her 
objectivity 
will 
be 
compromised. 
If 
so, 
such 
a person 
must 
be removed 
from 
the 
committee. 
5. 
Selection 
Criteria 
An 
important 
mechanism 
to 
safeguard 
the 
integrity 
of 
PPITA 
is 
the 
application 
of 
criteria 
by 
which 
sub-projects 
will 
be 
deemed suitable 
or 
not 
for 
inclusion 
in 
the 
program. 
This 
is 
essentially 
a 
quality-control 
function, 
whereby 
only 
those 
proposals 
(TORS) 
which 
(1) 
meet 
the 
objectives 
of 
PPITA 
and 
the 
implementing 
agency 
concerned and 
(2) 
present 
a 
cohesive, 
viable 
approach, 
will 
be 
approved 
for 
funding 
under 
PPITA. 
While 
this 
will 
ensure 
that 
in 
principle 
only 
proposals 
of 
merit 
will 
be 
approved, 
it 
does 
not 
address 
the 
issue 
of 
quality 
of 
output. 
6. 
Monitoring and 
Reporting 
Each 
TOR 
for 
technical 
assistance 
services 
will 
contain a 
statement 
of 
objectives, 
description 
of 
specific 
tasks 
to 
be 
undertaken, and requirements 
for 
reporting 
and/or 
deliverables. 
These 
services, 
although 
selected 
by 
the 
implementing 
agency 
concerned, 
will 
be 
monitored 
by 
the 
PMU 
advisory 
team. 
It 
is 
intended 
that 
each 
IA 
will 
have 
a 
Project 
Manager responsible 
for 
supervising 
the 
services contracted, 
including 
monitoring 
and evaluation. 
The 
PMU 
advisors 
will 
also 
monitor 
and 
evaluate, 
with 
priority 
given 
to 
those 
contracts 
(if 
any) 
which 
may 
be 
in 
some 
manner 
problematic. 
PMU 
will 
also 
conduct 
spontaneous, 
unannounced 
visits 
to 
observe 
PPITA 
undertakings. 
Reports 
are 
submitted 
to 
the 
Bank 
after 
clearance 
by 
the 
PMU 
and 
based 
on 
approval 
by 
the 
advisors. 
The 
In-House Advisors 
may 
also 
assist 
in 
this 
regard, 
but 
they 
will 
be 
assumed 
to 
be 
less 
neutral 
in 
identifying 
and dealing 
with 
problems 
related 
to 
implementation 
quality 
or 
malfeasance. 
Of 
particular 
concern 
in 
this 
monitoring 
will 
be 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
consultants, and 
more specifically 
adherence 
to 
the 
Terms 
of 
Reference. 
As 
stated 
in 
the 
PPITA 
Project 
Operations 
Manual, 
responsibility 
for monitoring 
and reporting 
concerning contract 
implementation lies 
with 
the 
IA 
in 
close 
coordination 
with 
the 
PMU. 
The 
basis 
is 
monitoring 
indicators 
as 
agreed at 
contract 
negotiation 
and 
as 
elaborated 
in 
the 
Terms 
of 
Reference and signed contracts. 
Results 
of 
monitoring 
and 
all 
periodic 
reports 
will 
be 
available 
for 
public 
inspection 
at 
the 
PMU. 
7. 
Reporting 
of 
Malfeasance 
While 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
PMU 
representative and 
member 
of 
civil 
society 
on 
the 
Technical/Financial 
Evaluation 
Committees 
will 
strengthen 
the 
monitoring 
of 
all 
aspects 
of 
contracting, 
this 
will 
not 
provide 
sufficient 
coverage, 
and 
the 
assistance 
of 
the concerned 
parties 
will 
be 
solicited. 
In 
all 
Pre-Proposal 
Meetings 
it 
will 
be 
made clear that 
anyone, 
including 
from 
the 
public 
at 
large, 
may 
report 
any 
malfeasance 
or 
suspected malfeasance, 
such 
as 
collusion, 
- 
103- 
Page  111
falsification 
of 
shortlists, unreasonable 
evaluation 
results, 
falsified 
submissions 
from 
consultants 
etc. 
Reports 
may 
be 
made 
to 
the 
PMU 
and/or 
KKPPI 
Steering Committee, 
either 
anonymously 
or 
with 
full 
disclosure, 
but 
must 
be 
accompanied 
by 
sufficient 
information 
to 
support 
investigation 
by 
the 
PMU 
and/or 
KKPPI. 
8. 
Handling 
of 
Complaints 
Upon 
receipt 
of 
any 
such 
information, 
the 
PMU 
will 
investigate 
and 
make a determination 
as 
to 
whether 
any 
malfeasance 
has 
occurred 
serious enough 
to 
warrant 
punitive 
action. 
The 
conclusions and recommendations 
for 
sanctions 
or 
other 
action 
will 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
KKPPI 
Steering 
Committee, 
which 
will 
make 
a 
final 
decision 
as 
to 
the 
disposition 
of 
each 
case. 
The 
selection 
may 
be 
suspended 
pending resolution 
in 
a 
timely 
manner, 
at 
the 
discretion 
of 
the 
PMU. 
Resolution may entail disqualification 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a consultant 
or 
cancellation 
of 
the 
selection 
process 
in 
the 
case 
of 
malfeasance 
by 
the 
committee.  Other 
sanctions 
may be 
deemed 
appropriate, 
depending 
on 
the 
circumstances. 
Documents concerning 
cases 
reported 
and 
their 
disposition 
will 
be 
made 
available 
for public 
inspection 
at the 
PMU. 
9. 
Conclusion 
PPITA 
provides 
mechanisms 
for 
closely 
monitoring 
the 
selection 
process 
and contract 
implementation 
itself. 
However, 
while to 
some 
extent 
it 
will 
be 
possible to 
safeguard 
against 
illegal 
practices 
such 
as 
billing 
‘invisible’ 
staff 
and 
using 
under-qualified 
personnel, 
ultimately 
the 
integrity 
of 
each 
Implementing 
Agency, 
Project 
Manager, 
Procurement 
Officer, 
TechnicalFinancial Evaluation 
Committee 
and 
consultant 
will 
be 
the 
determining 
factors 
in 
the 
prevalence 
of 
corruption. 
Full 
public 
disclosure 
of 
all 
project 
activities 
and 
an 
‘open 
door’ 
policy 
concerning 
information 
which 
may 
be 
offered 
from 
the 
public 
will 
be 
important 
safeguards, 
and 
hopefully 
will 
act 
as 
deterrents 
to 
would-be 
perpetrators 
of 
malfeasance. 
In 
particular, 
PPITA 
must 
scrutinize 
the 
formulation 
of 
long 
and short 
lists, 
billing 
rates 
and 
other 
costs, 
personnel 
qualifications, 
actual 
staffing 
and 
the 
invoicing 
process. 
There 
will 
be 
no 
bricks 
and 
mortar 
by 
which 
to 
judge 
PPITA, 
but 
only 
studies 
and 
other reports. 
It 
is 
clear, 
therefore, that every 
effort 
must 
be 
made 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
best 
consultants 
possible 
are 
obtained 
and that 
PPITA 
gets 
what 
it 
pays 
for.
