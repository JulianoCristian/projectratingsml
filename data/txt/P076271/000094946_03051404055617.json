Given these\n            projects could produce environmental, and social adversity,\n            these safeguards and environmental screening procedures have\n            been developed, to be applied in all demonstration project\n            preparation, and integrated into the bidding and contract\n            documents for each selected scheme. During the initial\n            screening stage, the Government shall utilize existing data\n            available during project preparation, but in the absence of\n            such data, site visits, and information collection will be\n            undertaken by the Project Management Unit (PMU) to establish\n            the data needed for screening, and approval by the Bank for\n            the environmental assessment (EA) classification, as a\n            condition prior to the investors' invitation to the\n            bidding process. A second stage screening will require a\n            detailed assessment of project characteristics, considering\n            key environmental issues, e.g., scope of impacts, assessment\n            boundaries, nature, and biodiversity conservation, which\n            should include field studies on environmental impacts. The\n            Government should provide case-by-case partial financing to\n            investors for implementation of the second stage EA\n            screening, and prepare draft environmental documentation, to\n            determine the appropriate environmental category of a\n            project, consistent with the Government, and Bank\n            requirements. The local environmental authority shall\n            implement periodic monitoring on environmental management,\n            to be reported to the PMU.
