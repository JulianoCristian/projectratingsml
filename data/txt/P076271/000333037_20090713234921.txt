1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

1.     The Indonesia Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY2001-2003 identified
three broad avenues to reduce poverty and vulnerability in a more open and decentralized
environment. These were (a) sustaining economic recovery and promoting broad-based
growth; (b) building national institutions for accountable government; and (c) delivering
better public services for the poor. PPITA was envisioned to support all three of these
avenues, but with a particular focus on item (a), recognizing that infrastructure could
become a significant bottleneck to economic growth in Indonesia.

2.     The PPITA project was designed to complement, reinforce and integrate ongoing
and planned initiatives within a sound overall PSP strategy to accelerate private
investments in infrastructure. The main aim is to develop a more competitive, transparent
policy and legal framework for key sectors. For this to happen, policy and institutional
reforms are necessary.

3.     The World Bank has extensive institutional knowledge and experience in private
sector participation (PSP) in infrastructure internationally coupled with local experience
in delivering Technical Assistance Project for the Public and Private Provision of
Infrastructure (TAP4I-I) and the Second Technical Assistance Project for the Public and
Private Provision of Infrastructure (TAP4I-II).

4.     The Bank has also been actively involved in helping to shape the policy and
regulatory reform agenda in all key infrastructure sectors, including transport (roads,
railways, ports), energy (power, domestic gas), urban (water supply, public transport,
solid waste), telecommunications and water resources. This combination of global and
local and cross-cutting and sector-specific expertise placed the World Bank in a strong
position to design and deliver the PPITA project in conjunction with the Government of
Indonesia (GoI).

(as approved)

5.     The project's development objective was "to assist GoI to develop and implement
the policy and regulatory reforms, and build the institutional and social foundations
needed to enable, promote and facilitate efficient and sustainable large-scale private
investment in infrastructure."

6.     The key indicators in the loan agreement (LA) did not correspond exactly to those
in Annex 1 of the PAD. From the beginning of implementation, the task team used the
indicators from the PAD to track project performance in the ISRs, which in turn are
automatically generated in the ICR. After considerable deliberation, the current ICR team
determined that the best approach was to keep using the ISR (PAD) indicators in the data
sheet while describing the differences between the competing sets of indicators. The



                                                  7

detailed explanations in the data sheet and main ICR text of values achieved are not
expressly compared against the LA indicators, but do provide the information relevant to
them.

7.    The LA stipulated 21 indicators, of which 12 were to be achieved by the mid-term
review and 9 by loan closing (tables 1 and 2).

                     Table 1: Mid-term indicators in loan agreement
 1.    Mobilization of advisory teams

 2.    Sectoral strategy for key infrastructure sectors

 3.    Country framework assessment for P3 potential

 4.    Draft guidelines for P3 by local governments

 5.    Finalization of a revised Keppres 7/98
       Draft of sectoral implementing guidelines for revised Kepres 7 in water, toll
 6.
       roads,

       Technical drafts for revised sector laws and regulations in roads, maritime and
 7.
       railway sectors

 8.    Training needs assessment and selection and target criteria

 9.    Curriculum development for training program education strategy

 10. Design of P3 network and open central files and library

 11. Establishment of P3 network at central level

 12. Establishment of CIIF


                     Table 2: End-term indicators in loan agreement
 13.   Updated sector and country framework assessments

 14.   Establishment of at least five P3 nodes outside Jakarta;

 15.   Network of P3 training providers established and provision of training on-going
       About 7 private infrastructure project opportunities have been prepared and
 16.
       tendered

 17.   Regulations for at least four sectoral regulatory bodies have been prepared

 18.   Amendments to at least three sector laws have been prepared

 19.   Impact evaluation of effectiveness of advisory consultants has been carried out
       Assessment of effectiveness of public communication development has been
 20.
       conducted

 21.   Actions required for continuation of P3 initiatives have been designed


8.    Furthermore, the following two performance indicators from Annex 1 of the PAD
are not in the data sheet or the LA:




                                              8

    ·    Organization structures, skill-mixes, capacities and cultures of government
         agencies understand and are pro-active in the expansion and evolution of their
         current roles as providers of infrastructure and services to include the enabling of
         private provision.
    ·    Information relevant to PPI is actively maintained, more accessible, and more
         effectively disseminated and discussed with all stakeholders.

9.    While these indicators can not be added to the data sheet, for completeness, these
indicators are included the discussions in Section 3.2 Achievement of Project
Development Objectives.

10. In some cases the indicators in the LA conflict with those in the PAD. The most
significant discrepancy is between indicator number 16 in the LA (see Table 2), which set
a target of seven tendered transactions, while the Key Performance Indicators section in
the PAD explicitly discouraged using a specific number or value of private infrastructure
projects as a performance indicator due to the short duration of the project and because
the primary focus of PPITA was to lay an effective institutional foundation and create an
enabling environment for infrastructure PPP projects rather than to actually reach
financial closure on such projects.1 This is further discussed in sections 2.3 Monitoring
and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization, 3.2 Achievement of Project
Development Objectives and 5.1.(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

11. Neither the PDO nor the Key Indicators were revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD
and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
to benefit from the project)

12. The ultimate beneficiaries of the project are the users of public infrastructure
services that would be more affordable and better operated. The people of Indonesia ­
including private entrepreneurs, their companies and shareholders ­ are also expected to
benefit from economic growth and increased employment generated by new investments
through the private provision of infrastructure (PPI) and a consequent reduction in
poverty level. However, the benefits from the project and to Indonesia are more likely to
be sustained in the longer term if PPI is implemented under a more transparent and
competitive PSP framework. The beneficiaries of capacity building are central and local

  The PAD noted in this context that: "(a) the full impacts o f most of the activities to be supported under
the project will at best not be felt until towards the end of the implementation period ....." and "(b) the
successful implementation of the project activities is viewed as a necessary but not a sufficient condition
for restoring large-scale private infrastructure investment and substantial progress will also be needed in
other key areas affecting the overall investment climate.

government officials, and other stakeholders, including non-governmental organizations
(NGO).

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component A: Cross-sector TA & advisory services ($6.06m)
13. This component was (a) to strengthen the secretariat to KKPPI (Committee on
Policy for the Acceleration of Infrastructure Provision) and the KKPPI sub-committees;
and (b) to provide technical assistance (TA) to BAPPENAS through a core advisory team
(CMEA TA). Objectives of this component include (i) revision of Keppres 7/1998 and
replacing it with a better cross-sector framework for PSP; (ii) an infrastructure needs
assessment; (iii) a PSP country framework assessment; (iv) a strategy for PSP; and (v)
establishment of a P3 network, including a P3 Central Unit.

Component B: Sector TA & advisory services ($8.58m)
14. Technical assistance to the Ministry of Public Works (MoPW) and Ministry of
Transportation (MoT) mainly to assist them to (i) prepare sub-sector policy, and legal and
regulatory reforms; (ii) prepare sub-sector specific guidelines and procedures for PSP;
(iii) enhance institutional capacity for the units involved in PSP; and (iv) identify and
assist with the preparation of PPP projects for offer to the private sector. The TA was to
be provided through core advisory teams in MoPW and MoT.

Component C: Capacity building (including communications) & training ($1.5m)
15. Technical assistance to the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs (CMEA) to
develop curricula and training modules, and to provide short training courses,
conferences, workshops and other developmental programs on relevant issues in
infrastructure PSP.

Component D: PMU ($0.39m)
16. Funding to strengthen the capacity of the Project Management Unit (PMU) in
administration, procurement and financial management.

1.6 Revised Components

17. There was no formal revision of components. However, the country-wide
infrastructure needs assessment under Component A was considered impractical in the
project context and in consultation with GoI was not pursued. Instead a Bank staff study,
Averting an Infrastructure Crisis, was helpful in informing policy makers and other
stakeholders of the macroeconomic needs and the key sectoral issues.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

18. Although there were no changes in the project's core design, there were material
changes in the scope and scale of the project and project schedule as detailed below.




                                            10

19. Focus on project identification: While it was not necessarily intended to be an
output of PPITA, at the request of GoI, PPITA began to focus strongly on supporting
potential PPP project identification following the Indonesia Infrastructure Summit (IIS)
in January 2005 and the Indonesian Infrastructure Conference and Exhibition (IICE) in
November 2006. Further details are provided in section 2.2 Implementation.

20. Increasing availability of grant funds: During the later years of implementation,
PPITA found itself in a very different environment from the one for which it was
designed. Substantial grant funds had flowed into the sector making the project's IBRD
loan funds less attractive. This is discussed further in section 2.2 Implementation.

21. Risk Management Unit: While it had not originally been identified as an
implementing agency of PPITA, the Risk Management Unit (RMU) in the Ministry of
Finance (MoF) began playing a key role in the PPP network. This role, and its
implications for PPITA, is further discussed in section 2.2 Implementation.

22. Project schedule: The project was originally scheduled to end on 31 December
2006. The project was extended twice, the first to 31 December 2007 and subsequently to
31 December 2008.

23. Funding allocations: Of the original US$17.1 million, US$3,946,723 was cancelled,
mainly due to the unattractiveness of the borrowing terms (as discussed above).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

24. Project focus: The PPITA project was designed around two inter-related initiatives
by GoI to restore private investment in public infrastructure by (i) the establishment of
KKPPI, and (ii) introduction of improved cross-sector policies, practices and procedures
to facilitate PPI. The main focus of the loan was on item (ii) since KKPPI was already
established before the PPITA loan.

25. The Project's core focus was on assisting the KKPPI to make timely and well-
informed decisions, on operationalizing the cross-sectoral framework through supporting
sector-specific policy and regulatory reforms, on strengthening institutional capacities in
areas related to PPI, and on improving the quality and availability of information on PPI-
related topics.

26. Project Preparation Facility: The World Bank provided a Project Preparation
Facility (PPF) to CMEA to prepare the PPITA loan. Key outputs prepared and agreed
were: (i) TOR for three core TA teams (in CMEA, MoPW and MoT); (ii) TOR for high
priority studies; (iii) the Project Operations Manual; (iv) a detailed procurement
procedures manual in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Selection and
Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (May 2002), and (v) a detailed
financial management manual.


                                             11

27. Risk mitigation: Two major institutional risks were identified from the outset: (i)
absence of a strong political commitment to implementation of PPP projects in a
transparent and competitive manner, and (ii) failure of the key participating agencies to
assign competent and motivated staff to work as counterparts to the advisory consultants.
The task team attempted to mitigate these risks through maintaining a constant dialog
with the KKPPI Secretariat and other high-level decision makers within line ministries.


28. Lessons learned: Major lessons learned from TAP4I-1 & 2 taken into account in the
design were:

    ·   Objectives should be focused specifically on enabling PPI, not on broad
        infrastructure development;
    ·   Counterpart funding must be at levels which ensure ownership and sustainability;
    ·   Effective PMUs must have access to key decision-makers, issue clear and specific
        financing guidelines, and have a clear mandate to ensure project funds are
        properly used;
    ·   Implementing agencies should be responsible for ensuring the quality of outputs
        and their transformation into outcomes; and
    ·   TA services need to be (i) carefully positioned in the bureaucracy where their
        outputs can be effective, (ii) demand-driven not imposed, (iii) able to respond
        rapidly to financing requests, and (iv) focused on directly assisting executing
        agencies and any decentralized units.

29. Overly complex design: The project design was complex; and its complexity made
it difficult to apply many of these lessons in the day-to-day management of the project.
Also, the large number of entities involved made supervision difficult, both by the Bank
and by GoI itself.

30. PPITA also piloted a range of procurement, fiduciary and supervision initiatives
including a new system of financial management reporting, dual auditing by BPKP and
an independent auditor, an internet public disclosure campaign, setting of the billing rates
by the market and including the non-government member on the procurement committee,
which was in conflict with government regulations that the procurement committee must
comprise government officers. Applying all of these requirements under PPITA placed a
strain on the project management and supervision resources of both government and the
Bank; especially compared with the relatively small loan amount.

31. Deficiencies in project management arrangements: PPITA was managed by a PMU
in CMEA, which managed PIUs in MoT and MoPW and individuals within in
BAPPENAS, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MoEMR) and Tangerang and
Yogyakarta regional governments that worked with the PMU to manage PPITA projects.
Two major problems emerged with this arrangement: (i) The PMU, under CMEA, did not
have the requisite authority and capacity to ensure that all other project management




                                             12

entities were fulfilling all of their obligations under the loan;2 and (ii) the vital role of the
MoF (with its RMU) was not foreseen such that the MoF was not included as an
implementing agency of the project.

32. Sub-national PPPs: Sub-national governments were targets for capacity building
and the implementation of projects, yet Perpres 67/2005 did not provide a mechanism for
the provision of public support to sub-national projects. This limited the sorts of projects
that they could undertake to those that were already financially viable without
government support.

33. Unidentified risks: The complex nature of PPP reform was a major risk that was not
identified during project preparation. The agencies involved in the implementation of the
project (KKPPI, key sector ministries and sub-national governments) had limited
expertise in PPI, but were required to take decisions on important and complex issues.
The "international best-practice" PPP framework designed for Indonesia was an amalgam
of models from a number of different countries: the exact PPP framework designed for
Indonesia had not been tried elsewhere. This, coupled with the inherent difficulty of
establishing institutions in Indonesia, was a major risk to the project. The PPP network
establishment was not completed as envisioned in the PPITA project design documents,
although a PPP network does exist. This, and its implications for PPP development in
Indonesia in future is discussed in section 2.5 below.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status,
and actions taken, as applicable)

34. Good early progress: PPITA was approved in 2003 and closed at the end of 2008
after being extended twice ­ a period of over 5 years. Implementation progress was very
good during the first three years earning consistent Satisfactory ratings until 2006 and
showing good progress against a large numbers of mid-term and key outcome indicators.
Many laws were drafted, institutions established and capacity building activities carried
out. The Mid-Term Review was completed in October 2005, at which time progress was
again rated Satisfactory.

35. Later setbacks and their resolution: A confluence of factors then led to much less
impetus in 2007 and early 2008 resulting in an implementation rating of Moderately
Unsatisfactory in February 2008. Main negative influences were the ongoing PPP agenda
debate within GoI, less costly grant funds becoming available for TA (discussed below),
and reassignment of many PMU staff following the IICE in December 2006 which
seriously reduced project management capabilities--especially on procurement and
financial monitoring. In early 2007, the task team held informal discussions with
counterparts toward canceling the remaining loan funds, but GoI strongly requested that
the project continue.


2
 In hindsight, with its strong role in determining the fate of future infrastructure projects, the placement of
the PMU in BAPPENAS might have been a better option.




                                                     13

36. The supervision team expressed their concerns via ISR Management Letters on
January 30, 2007 and January 7, 2008; the latter of which recommended that GoI conduct
a formal "full and frank assessment of the progress of all activities under PPITA at the
end of January 2008", and that "if meaningful progress still appears unlikely, the mission
recommends that Government freeze any new activities and requests cancellation."
Following this latter Management Letter, the proposed meeting was held and GoI
reiterated their commitment to the loan. The PMU was restaffed and then started to make
commendable progress in reestablishing planned activities such that implementation was
rated Moderately Satisfactory in the final ISR dated October 2008.

37. The major factors affecting implementation are discussed below in more detail.

38. Project focus changes: While the PAD explicitly discouraged PPITA's focus on
sub-project delivery as a project output target, at the request of GoI, primarily as the
result of the Indonesia Infrastructure Summit (IIS) in January 2005, there was a
significant refocusing of the project's efforts towards achieving PPP investments. This
reflected the drive to achieve infrastructure transactions in the PPP agenda for Indonesia
as a whole. Various sectors nominated infrastructure projects, with 91 of these being
announced at the summit. A further summit, the Indonesian Infrastructure Conference
and Exhibition (IICE), was held in November 2006 for which PPITA assisted in the
identification of ten high-priority Model Projects intended to demonstrate the new PPP
framework. As a result of this project focus TA resources in MoPW and MoT were
redirected to preparation of sub-projects. CMEA TA continued to focus on the revision of
Keppres 7/1998 and institutional design for PPP, but also assisted in the prioritization of
transactions, preparation of information memoranda and pre-feasibility studies to assist in
the prioritization process. Despite all of these efforts, including those of other donors in
the sector, GoI has struggled to deliver a PPP project, although progress has been made
toward that objective. For a further discussion of the outcomes and outputs of these
efforts, please refer to section 3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives.

39. Procurement delays: Procurement delays were pervasive throughout the duration of
the project due to the complicated project design, which posed an even greater challenge
given the lack of procurement capacity in the line ministries, with the PMU in CMEA
filling the gap. This slowed down implementation and loan disbursement. The
procurement plan was seriously disrupted when the PMU was dissolved in 2007. An
analysis of a selection of QCBS procurements indicates that procurement took an average
of 269 days. The breakdown of the average figure in Table 3 shows that bottlenecks
occurred more often on the government side.

40. Counterpart buy-in: The most important factor for buy-in was political commitment
at the ministerial level. Achieving toll road transactions had the full attention and backing
of the Minister of Public Works. However, buy-in in MoT was significantly less than in
MoPW, partly because the PIU head was not of sufficient rank and the high-level buy-in
was not sufficient to overcome the bureaucratic inertia.

41. Inadequate supervision of consultants: The PIUs in MoT and MoPW did not have
the capacity to supervise the TA staff and thus had to rely on the staff of the relevant
Directorate General (DG). In MoPW, where PPP was already a priority of the relevant
DG, supervision was adequate. In the case of MoT, where PPP was not such a high
priority, the various DGs were not actively involved in supervision and the quality of
outputs suffered. In recognition of this, the core advisory consultant in CMEA was
brought in to assist, and work was completed, however operationalization of the policies
prepared under the TA was disappointing due to the lack of high-level counterpart buy-in
described in the previous paragraph. This disappointing performance is discussed further
in section 5.2.(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies' performance.

42. Waning GOI commitment to PPITA: As the implementation progressed, grant
funds for TA became increasingly available, including from ADB, AusAID, JBIC, the
Government of the Netherlands, and the Private Provision of Infrastructure Advisory
Facility (PPIAF) channeled by the World Bank. Commitment to PPITA began to falter in
late 2006 as GoI questioned the wisdom of borrowing at IBRD rates for TA. As a result,
PPITA-specific targets slipped (e.g. establishment of the P3CU during the life of the loan,
although it was established after the loan closed), while reform in the PPP agenda
continued under other projects (e.g. support to the RMU). Combined with other
implementation problems in early 2007, this led to the discussions on canceling a portion
of the loan, which the GOI initially resisted, but eventually requested as the closing date
approached and the availability of competing TA grants made the project funding less
critical.

43. Reconsideration of the PPP agenda: The perceived importance of PPP for delivering
infrastructure services, coupled with slow progress on initiating projects after the two
infrastructure summits, led to high-level debate on the PPP strategy. The office of the
Vice President expressed impatience with the long PPP process, viewed the KKPPI as the
bottleneck and pushed to fund non-Perpres-67-compliant projects. A second group


                                                  15

centered on MoF was unwilling to approve government support outside prevailing laws
and regulations.

44. While the push for non-compliant projects would provide short-term gains, a small
number of compliant projects was needed to prove that the PPP framework worked fairly
and transparently, and to lay the foundation for desired large-scale private investment.
GoI has recognized these priorities and is now proceeding with a smaller number of PPP
demonstration projects supported by a range of development partners.

45. Reform of public/private support channels: Prior to the 1997/98 Asian financial
crisis, any ministry could issue guarantees for private ventures. A moratorium on such
risky activity was then imposed until MoF decree PMK 38/2006 established the Risk
Management Unit (RMU) as the sole institution for providing public support to private
projects.

46. The RMU has been under significant pressure from line ministries and other parties
to issue guarantees to non-Perpres 67/2005 compliant projects, but has remained
understandably cautious. The ability of the institutional and regulatory framework to
withstand such challenges is testament to its strength. The next step is for the RMU to
issue a government guarantee to a qualifying project.

47. While an allocation of public support to a specific infrastructure project has not yet
been made under the new framework, GoI, via the RMU, has made some progress
towards providing financial support to PPI. GoI allocated Rp 4.9 trillion to a "land-
capping" scheme, under which toll-road concessionaires that were awarded concessions
prior to the financial crisis in the late 1990s (including a number of key sections along the
crucial Trans-Java route) will pay 110% of the land costs initially envisaged, with GoI to
pay for the remaining land acquisition costs. Transactions which do not move to financial
close after accessing the land-capping funds will be terminated. While these are not
Perpres 67/2005 compliant projects, dealing with such special cases in a fair and
transparent manner will go a long way towards building Indonesia's reputation as a
destination of choice for foreign direct investment in infrastructure.

48. In recognition of the increasing importance of the RMU in MoF, the task team
attempted to add it as an implementing agency and provide PPITA loan support in 2006
and 2007; however, the lower cost of a World Bank facilitated PPIAF grant was a more
attractive option for GoI.



2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

49. Design: There are difficulties inherent in monitoring progress of TA loans.
Completion of reforms, such as issuing draft laws or establishing institutions, do not in
themselves represent meaningful improvements in the sector. In many cases, the benefits
of such reforms will not be felt for some time: output indicators are easy, outcome
indicators are hard. With this in mind, the M&E framework of PPITA, designed under
the PPF, adopted outcome indicators designed to demonstrate increased understanding



                                               16

and engagement of PPP on the part of various stakeholders. These are very hard to
measure, and the design documents did not provide instructions on how to measure them
beyond "stakeholder feedback through discussions with supervision missions" and
reports produced by the PMU, consultants and other advisors; without arrangements to
design and implement a reliable or objective methodology to measure the knowledge and
attitudes of a broad range of stakeholders, the project mainly relied on outputs to
represent such indicators.

50. Implementation: The inconsistencies between the PAD and the LA posed
difficulties in terms of selecting performance monitoring indicators for use in the ISR
(and by extension the ICR).

51. Utilization: As discussed above, TA loans are inherently difficult to monitor. Some
creativity was required on the part of the supervision team to assess the progress of the
loan using the data collected during supervision missions, but also--and arguably more
importantly--through the ongoing dialog with GoI. This ongoing dialog led to the pursuit
of MoF as a potential additional Implementing Agency due to the importance of the
RMU in the PPP framework (even though it was not an output indicator of PPITA).
However, not surprisingly MoF opted for financing from a World Bank administered
PPIAF grant rather than an IBRD loan.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

52. Anti-corruption action plan (ACAP): An ACAP was agreed during project
appraisal. PPITA was one of the pilot projects under the Bank to safeguard against
corruption. The plan included the Financial and Development Supervisory Board (BPKP)
as the auditor for the project, members from civil society were to be appointed to the
procurement evaluation committees, and the principle of public disclosure was to be put
into practice. All supervision missions conducted by the task team included an appraisal
of compliance with the ACAP and the results were consistently satisfactory.

53. Financial audit and reporting: The published annual audit reports for the years 2003
to 2007 achieved an unqualified opinion, indicating that PPITA implementation fully
complied with the accounting standards and principles set. The Bank awarded PPITA the
2006 award for financial management. In 2007, financial reporting deadlines were not
met because the PMU was in effect dissolved. Consequently, the timelines for the
submission of financial reports were revised and these later deadlines were met.

54. Public Disclosure: Public disclosure was consistently practiced through several
media: newspapers, the PMU's Infrastructure magazine, the KKPPI website, and a series
of seminars and workshops. An electronic-based complaints handling mechanism was
installed and the head of the PMU was responsible for addressing complaints. Non-
government personnel participated in the procurement process; however, their
participation in the evaluation committees was mainly passive and not as active as
anticipated. Independent observers were present at the opening of bids.




                                             17

55. Environmental and social: Proposed PPP investments are required by the prevailing
laws and regulations to comply with environmental and social standards and to complete
Environmental Impact Assessments (Analisa Mengenai Dampak Lingkungan, AMDAL),
and Land Acquisition and Resettlement Action Plans as necessary. Line ministries are
responsible for these matters as part of the normal project preparation process.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed
by present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and
institutional capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

56. GoI has a robust and wide-ranging program of PPP reforms planned in the coming
years supported by their annual reform agendas--in the form of Presidential Instructions
5/2007 and 5/2008--and various donor funded program loans. These include ADB's
Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program (IRSDP) in BAPPENAS, the World
Bank's Infrastructure Development Policy Loan and a similar loan from the Government
of Japan. Under ADB's IRSDP, a Project Development Facility (PDF) and Technical
Advisory Services (TAS) are in place. The PDF will fund PPP project preparation and
transactions, ensuring compliance. The funding will be for national and regional projects.
TAS will build upon the achievements of PPITA, particularly with respect to further P3
network development. The World Bank will continue to support the PPP agenda through
a number of trust funds provided by PPIAF and AusAID. AusAID's Indonesia
Infrastructure Initiative (IndII) and grants from other bilateral agencies could be further
tapped to fund this area of work.

57. Regulatory and policy reforms: While the Rail and Sea Transport laws were drafted
and established during the life of PPITA, they still require a government regulation (PP)
to be issued if they are to be operationalized. Each PP should further clarify how PSP is
to be implemented in the relevant sector. The same will apply to the Air Transport, Land
Transport and Electricity laws when they are passed by Parliament.

58. There has been discussion of an amendment to Perpres 67/2005 to permit the
provision of public support to sub-national PPPs, however, it has yet to appear in GoI's
official policy reform package. While this is so, the proposed Ministerial Regulation
under MoPW concerning PPP in the Water Sector, detailed in the Inpres 5/2008 Policy
Package, proposes to address some of the sectoral sub-national issues.

59. At the policy level, the concept of non-ministerial sector regulators is still to be
debated and formulated. Such regulators would enhance competition and make Indonesia
a more competitive, and hence attractive, country for PPP. In some quarters, this is now
recognized as a necessary next phase of development. Promoting the acceptance of such a
concept to the relevant line ministries needs to come initially from KKPPI, as experience
shows that few institutions are willing to reform themselves and to cede power.

60. Institutional reforms: A fully empowered, functioning P3 network is necessary if
PPP is to be sustained in the long-term; however, it is not clear that the P3 network
described in the PPITA design documents in 2003 is still the ideal model for Indonesia.



                                             18

While the P3CU was not established during the life of the loan, one of the last activities
carried out under PPITA was the drafting of the Ministerial Decree to establish the P3CU
in BAPPENAS. The establishment of this decree was effected in March 2009, after the
close of PPITA. The CIIF and KKPPI Secretariat are not currently operational and the
P3CU in BAPPENAS and the P3 nodes in the line ministries and sub-national
governments still need further capacity building. The RMU and the P3CU are currently
fulfilling some of the functions of the KKPPI Secretariat, but more study is needed to
determine whether this is the best way forward. To this end, the World Bank is providing
technical assistance to re-evaluate the relevance of the current form of the P3 network in
Indonesia.

61. Regardless of the final shape of the P3 network, standard operating procedures, at
present under preparation, defining the inter-relationships of the P3 institutions still have
to be operationalized to speed up PPP transactions and the contracting agencies still
require guidance to prepare projects to ensure compliance with PPP regulations. As PPP
projects begin to come online, the establishment of an independent Guarantee Fund by
MoF will help Indonesia conform with international best practice in the field, this is
being supported by a PPIAF funded trust fund administered by the World Bank.

62. PPP Projects: The progress in PPPs being implemented outside the legal framework
provided by Perpres 67, while promising, will permit only those projects that are already
financially viable to be successful PPPs. If GoI is able to allocate financial support,
successfully and transparently, to economically viable but financially non-viable projects
in an efficient manner, then a whole new world of infrastructure projects will open up for
the private sector. GoI spread its PPP project preparation resources too thinly in the early
years, tabling ninety-one unprioritized projects worth billions of dollars at the IIS 2005.
The introduction of the ten Model Projects at the IICE 2006 with well-prepared
information memoranda was a positive step, yet some of these projects were not
financially viable and others had legal issues that would not have permitted them to have
been brought to market as "model" PPPs. In recognition of this weakness in project
preparation, GoI is focusing on bringing a small number3 of well-prepared compliant
projects to market. This agenda is supported by GoI's infrastructure reform packages
(Inpres 5/2007 and Inpres 5/2008) and by the program loans of ADB, JICA and the
World Bank.

63. Recommended follow-up actions by the World Bank: The World Bank's support of
GoI's infrastructure agenda via its IDPL and other instruments described above are well
considered. Given the large number of donors and many facets of PPP reform, close
donor coordination will be key to ensure that efforts harmonize properly.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation


3Between one and three depending on whether the source is GoI's own infrastructure
reform packages, or the various development partner program loans.



                                            19

(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

64. Objective: The main theme of the World Bank's Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) for FY2009-12 is investing in institutions to improve service delivery. The CPS
recognizes that Indonesia's infrastructure needs may be in excess of what can be
provided in a timely manner by public finance. By supporting GoI reforms and projects
the World Bank hopes to assist in an increase in private sector financial commitments to
infrastructure projects from 0.5% of GDP in 2005 to 0.75% by 2010. Private sector
development and infrastructure are two of the five thematic areas in the CPS. Thus, the
objective set out under PPITA, laying a strong foundation through policy reforms and
institutional development for PPI to materialize, remains highly relevant.

65. Design and Implementation: PPITA was designed to lay the groundwork for a PPP
agenda for Indonesia. It did so, however, the PPP framework that emerged was slightly
different from that envisioned at project design. Given the nature of large-scale, cross-
sectoral institution building and the extended life of PPITA this was inevitable. The task
team managing PPITA did try to adjust to this new landscape, although their ability to do
so under the framework of PPITA was limited due to the uncompetitiveness of IBRD
loans against grant funds. Thus, the design and implementation of PPITA are judged to
be moderately relevant.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details
on outputs in Annex 2)

66. Project development objective: The project's development objective is to assist
GOI to develop and implement the policy and regulatory reforms and build the
institutional and social foundations needed to enable, promote and facilitate efficient and
sustainable large-scale private investment in infrastructure.

67. Although there are certain deficiencies, the PPP framework established by GoI
through the policy and regulatory reforms made and the institutional and social
foundations established, assisted by PPITA has made significant improvements to the
ability of GoI handle potential PPP projects in a transparent manner.

68. There is large-scale private investment in Indonesian infrastructure occurring at
present (detailed below under Indicator 7) and much of it is being undertaken by
reputable international investors and contractors. Clearly, there is still scope for further
substantial private participation in Indonesian infrastructure projects, and bottlenecks
remain in the provision of public support to such projects, but the groundwork is laid.
The ability of the institutional and regulatory framework to stand up to political
challenges to issue public support on an ad hoc basis is particularly commendable.

69. The institutional framework did not end up exactly as envisioned at appraisal and
some key institutions lack capacity, but the project succeeded in introducing a regulatory
framework and the foundations of a strong institutional framework, despite the
difficulties of establishing new institutions in the country (as further discussed in section
5.1.(a) Bank Design Performance).


                                             20

70. The results for the seven PDO indicators, as recorded in the Results framework
entered into SAP, plus the two additional PDO indicators included in the PAD, are
summarized below as a basis for assessing the achievement of the PDO.

71. Indicator 1: Sound cross-sector and sector policies for promoting and realizing
PPI are based on sound analysis, embodied in laws and regulations, and operationalized.

72. PPITA was instrumental toward creating a cross-sector policy and regulatory
framework for PPP in Indonesia. Perpres 67/2005 concerning private participation in
infrastructure was issued in November 2005. MoF regulation on the provision of
government financial support PMK 38/2006 was issued with assistance from PPITA.
Inpres 3/2006, the Policy Package for Improving the Investment Climate in Indonesia
issued in February 2006 was followed by Inpres 5/2007 and 5/2008, the annual Policy
Packages in which the PPP agenda featured prominently.

73. Laws on Road (38/2004) and Water Resources (7/2004) were passed with
implementation government regulations issued, all with support from PPITA. Laws on
Railways (23/2007) and Sea Transport (17/2008) were passed, however the government
regulations (PPs) are still under discussion; the new Laws on Air Transport, Land
Transport and Electricity remain under consideration by Parliament.

74. These laws were drafted with input from PPITA funded consultants located within
the ministries in question. The KKPPI's strong role in disseminating information and
capacity building and training ensured these policies were based on sound analytical
processes.

75. While the direct effect of these laws and regulations in helping to stem the tide of
non-Perpres 67/2005 compliant infrastructure projects has been substantial, Indonesia has
yet to see a compliant PPP project brought to operation.

76. The framework is yet to be put to the test in a comprehensive way, yet in
recognition of its impacts on "almost compliant" projects, the achievement of Indicator 1
is judged satisfactory or as 75% achieved.

77. Indicator 2: Independent, non-ministerial regulatory bodies with sound operating
procedures and competent personnel are established for key sectors.

78. Designs for these bodies were completed under the various sectoral TAs, however,
as was identified as a risk in TAP4I-II, "it (was) unrealistic to expect agencies to reform
themselves."

79. These regulatory bodies were established in roads and water, but were staffed by
civil servants and report directly to MoPW. The envisioned water regulator, BPP-SPAM
now operates more like a strategic planning institution for the water sector rather than a
regulator. BPJT, also reporting to MoPW was established and is operating as both the



                                             21

regulator and PPP contracting agency for toll roads; a situation that presents competing
incentives for the different parts of the institution. That said, it is operating in its
envisioned role.

80. In MoT there are no plans to establish independent, non-ministerial sub-sector
regulatory bodies. Due to the lack of success in establishing these non-ministerial
regulatory bodies, the achievement of Indicator 2 is judged unsatisfactory or as 30%
achieved.

81. Indicator 3: Local governments understand the role of PPI, factors conducive to a
favorable investment climate and their roles and responsibilities in enabling PPI.

82. The extensive CBT program established by PPITA extended regular invitations to
local government representatives in Jakarta, but to augment this, regional workshops
were also conducted to socialize Perpres 67 and the Operational Guidelines Manual on
PPP implementation.

83. P3 nodes in Tangerang, Sumedang, Klungkung and Bandung have been established
to facilitate PPP implementation. West Java Province is about to issue a decree to
establish a P3 node to advise on PPP matters and ensure compliance. These local P3
nodes still require capacity building and assistance from central government and
development partners, but the framework is beginning to operate with the signing of the
Tangerang water supply concession August 2008 upon approval from the local
parliament.

84. Certain local governments with high capacity have demonstrated their
understanding of the role of PPI, and have begun to implement sub-national PPPs. As
such, the achievement of Indicator 3 is judged highly satisfactory or as 90% achieved.

85. Indicator 4: Public awareness and understanding of the needs for and benefits of
well managed PPI increase.

86. A very significant outcome of the project is the much broader understanding in the
minds of GoI, private investors and the general public concerning PPI in Indonesia.
Indonesian PPP in infrastructure is a regular item in newspapers and other media. The
two infrastructure summits were landmark events that could have been better capitalized
on, but still raised much awareness about the possible advantages of PPP in Indonesia.
The KKPPI remains the driver of infrastructure reform in Indonesia and, as discussed in
Indicator 5 above, their website provides much relevant information. The seriousness of
GoI's commitment to PPP reform is evident in its presence as a major theme of their
infrastructure reform agendas issued in each of the last three years.

87. The achievement of Indicator 4 is judged to be highly satisfactory or 100%
achieved.




                                            22

88. Indicator 5: Opportunities for public participation are ensured in formulating and
formalizing laws, policies, regulations and procedures concerning PPI at all government
levels.

89. Prior to PPITA, GoI regulations already required public participation on draft laws
both by the ministries, prior to submission to parliament, and by parliament itself when
the laws have been submitted. While no similar requirement exists for policies and
regulations, KKPPI's understanding of the importance of close cooperation with the
private sector led them to undertake extensive public consultations surrounding
infrastructure policy packages issued over the period of PPITA's operation.

90. The achievement of Indicator 5 is judged to be highly satisfactory or 90% achieved.

91. Indicator 6: Private sector investors are informed of the efforts by government to
promote PPI and participate in the formulation and enactment of a favorable investment
climate.

92. The prominent inclusion of PPI in the annual Policy Reform Agenda issued via
Presidential Instructions over the last three years point to the seriousness with which GoI
tackled this issue. Indonesia's two infrastructure summits and numerous other public
information events were well publicized and received substantial international attention.
The main conduit of dissemination of electronic information concerning PPI is the
KKPPI website, hosting laws, regulations, policies and public information documents
about infrastructure related matters in Indonesian and English.         In addition to this
website, an internet search for "Indonesian PPP" returns many relevant links to
information relevant to private sector investors.

93. The achievement of Indicator 6 is judged to be highly satisfactory or 100%
achieved.

94. Indicator 7: Soundly conceived PPI schemes have been developed and tendered
through transparent competitive processes.

95. GoI is dealing with large-scale private investment in their infrastructure in a
transparent and competitive manner. The Tangerang Water Supply project identified as a
Model Project at the IICE 2006 and prepared and tendered with PPITA assistance
reached financial close (i.e. all conditions precedent to drawdown of funds from
financiers fulfilled or waived) in late 2008 and is targeted for operation by late 20094.
This project had the requisite number of bidders and fulfilled all guidelines of Perpres
67/2005; however, as it did not require public support, it did not provide an opportunity
for the RMU to issue a guarantee. Furthermore, the Solo-Kertosono toll road is well on
the way to reaching financial close, again without public support; although as this project
only had one qualified bidder and GoI decided to move forward without retendering, this


4Inpres 5/2008



                                             23

is not a Perpres 67/2005 compliant project. These are two major PPP projects for
Indonesia (both in dollar terms and symbolically) that benefited from the clear regulatory
framework established by GoI with support from PPITA.

96. While this progress is commendable, the only projects that have reached financial
close to date have not required public support (contingent or otherwise) so have not
provided the demonstration effect that GoI had hoped for. If GoI is able to demonstrate
the efficacy of the RMU in providing support to private infrastructure projects, then a
large bank of economically viable, but not financially viable projects will be open to
investment. GoI recognizes this fact and is focusing strongly on bringing a small number
of demonstration projects to market supported by infrastructure program loans from the
World Bank, ADB and the Japanese government. The Central Java Coal-Fired Power
Plant mentioned above, the preparation of which is being handled by IFC, is the most
likely candidate for the first demonstration project; it is expected to be tendered in 2009.
In addition to this, there are many other small PPP water and power projects being
conducted at the sub-national level.

97. Finally, Indonesia is moving forward on its 10,000 MW Coal-Fired Power Crash
Program under which it tendered dozens of Engineering Procurement Construction (EPC)
contracts for coal-fired power projects across the archipelago. These are not the Build
Operate Transfer model that is envisioned within the PPITA project design, however, it
will give GoI an opportunity to demonstrate its willingness to engage with the private
sector in infrastructure provision.

98. In recognition of the progress made, yet mindful of the challenges that still remain,
achievement of Indicator 7 is judged moderately unsatisfactory, or as 30% achieved.

99. Indicator 85: Organization structures, skill-mixes, capacities and cultures of
government agencies understand and are proactive in the expansion and evolution of
their current roles as providers of infrastructure and services to include the enabling of
private provision.

100. As further detailed in Indicator 4 below, PPITA's extensive CBT program helped
build understanding as to the new public role in PPI. This program included dozens of
seminars, workshops and short courses (detailed in Annex 2) attended by thousands of
public servants chiefly from CMEA, BAPPENAS, MoT, MoPW, and a number of local
governments, but also from MoH, MoEMR and others.

101. The IIS and IICE held in 2005 and 2006 respectively were conceived and delivered
solely by GoI with assistance from development partners limited to the preparation of
information memoranda for some key projects and general advice. The prominent
inclusion of PPP reforms in GoI's reform agendas (including the issuing of a specific


5 Additional indicator included in the PAD but not in the ISR monitoring and, as such,
not included in the Datasheet generated by the system.



                                            24

policy package targeted at increasing private investment in infrastructure) was similarly
not required by any development partner loan or grant, but as a pure government
initiative. The establishment of the P3CU after the close of PPITA also points to GoI's
proactivity in the ongoing PPP reform agenda.

102. The prominence of PPP in the national policy reform agenda points to a clear
growth in the understanding and proactivity of government agencies in enabling PPI. As
such, the achievement of Indicator 8 is judged highly satisfactory or as 100% achieved.

103. Indicator 96: Information relevant to PPI is actively maintained, more accessible,
and more effectively disseminated and discussed with all stakeholders.

104. The KKPPI website, which receives thousands of visitors per month, provides up to
date news, analysis and copies of laws, policies and regulations relating to PPI in
Indonesian and, to a lesser extent, English. While GoI has not run a major infrastructure
investment summit since 2006, regular smaller events are run to disseminate information
and receive stakeholder input. The most recent such event was the launching of the
P3CU in March 2009 held by BAPPENAS attended by a wide range of stakeholders from
government, private sector, development partners and civil society.

105. In recognition of the usefulness of the KKPPI website in disseminating information
relevant to PPI and GoI's continuing commitment to running public information
dissemination events, the achievement of Indicator 9 is judged highly satisfactory of as
90% achieved.

106. For a table of PPITA's outputs, please refer to Annex 2.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms,
least cost, and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

107. As the direct benefits to society of the policy reforms supported by PPITA are
expected to accrue well past the closing date of the loan, it is very difficult to talk about
economic rates of return. However, the transparent manner in which the government is
dealing with the private sector in the 10,000 megawatt crash program, the Tangerang
Water Supply Project, Solo-Kertosono Toll Road and other smaller infrastructure projects
worth, in aggregate, investments of over a billion dollars were shaped in large part by the
reforms championed in the early years of PPITA's implementation. PPPs are difficult
and to rush implementation before a solid framework is established for them would be
unwise. As such, PPITA's approach of establishing the legal and institutional basis for
PPP before focusing on project delivery still appears to have been the most cost effective
strategy.

                                            25

108. For these reasons, the efficiency of PPITA is judged to be Satisfactory.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

109. PPITA did experience significant project management issues. However, in the
context of PPITA's status as an IBRD loan in a broader environment of grant funds
(including those managed by the World Bank), this is understandable. The lack of
progress against some specific PPITA indicators does not indicate a lack of interest in the
PPP agenda generally. On the contrary, GoI's identification of PPP as a high priority in
their annual infrastructure action plans issued over the past three years and the myriad
other development partner initiatives detailed previously in this document demonstrate
their strong commitment to doing PPP right in Indonesia.

                          Indicator                                 Rating
      Relevance of Objective                               Highly relevant
      Relevance of Design and Implementation               Moderately relevant
      Achievement of Project Development Objectives        Moderately Satisfactory
      Efficiency                                           Satisfactory

110. The Outcome of the project is rated Moderately Satisfactory given the robust
regulatory and institutional framework established, but also recognizing the work still
required compared with appraisal plans.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
111. Not applicable as the impacts of PPP provision on poverty, gender aspects and
social development will not be measurable until well after this ICR is due.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional
development)

112. Under PPITA, a number of new institutions were established including the KKPPI
secretariat, P3 nodes, the Consolidated Indonesia Infrastructure Forum (CIIF), sectoral
regulatory bodies and the RMU. These institutions and the various counterpart
institutions of PPITA have varying levels of capacity, were not always implemented as
initially envisioned, and in some cases may not currently be operational, but it is clear
that their knowledge and understanding of the role of PPP in infrastructure, as well as that
of other key agencies and institutional bodies, has increased notably under the project.
See section 3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives for further details on the
Capacity Building Program established under PPITA.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

There were no significant unintended outcomes or impacts.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

113. Beneficiary Surveys and Stakeholder Workshops were not conducted by the World
Bankfor this operation. Please see the Borrower's ICR for GoI run stakeholder
workshops.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

114. It is envisaged that the work of PPITA will be carried on through the initiatives
detailed in section 2.5 Post-completion/Next Phase. Funding for communications and
CBT is unlikely to be a constraint with a properly formulated program. The possibility
that the push to provide public support to non-compliant projects could again become a
political issue can not be ruled out, yet the RMU has withstood such challenges in the
past, and its success in providing land-capping support to toll-roads (detailed in section
2.2 Implementation) further strengthen its position.

115. A very promising sign following the close of the loan was the establishment of the
P3CU under BAPPENAS. This is a clear demonstration of GoI's commitment to the PPP
agenda and recognition of the value of such an institution in its own right rather than as a
purely output focused exercise to comply with development partner loan covenants.

116. With these factors in mind, the risk to development outcome is judged to be
Moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)

117. The project's objectives were consistent with GoI's development priorities and the
Bank's CAS. Lessons learned from TAP4I (1 and 2), were incorporated in the design.
The Bank provided a PPF to assist the Borrower to prepare a detailed system for
managing and monitoring the PPITA project. Particular attention was paid to
safeguarding against corruption.

118. However, the project design was extremely complicated and did not take into
account the new decentralization legislation that governed sub-national governments'
participation in PPPs. Neither did it recognize the importance of the RMU in the PPP
process and did not identify MoF as an implementing agency.             Most importantly,
however, it failed to recognize the significant bureaucratic inertia involved in the
establishment of new institutions and reassignment of roles, responsibilities and budgets.

119. While outcome indicators were identified, the data collection strategy for the M&E
was limited to a list of desired outputs (see PPITA PAD Annex 1: Project Design
Summary). This made evaluation of the project at close difficult. Further, the inherent




                                            27

difficulties of establishing an inter-ministerial institutional and regulatory framework
should have been foreseen at the project design phase.

120. As such, the Bank's performance in the identification, preparation and appraisal of
the project is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

121. The World Bank conducted nine supervision missions over the life of the loan.
Supervision was not just limited to these missions as there was a regular dialog between
the Bank and GoI; especially during the early years of PPITA. The aide memoire from
the mission held from 24 October to 4 November 2005 was the Mid-Term Review
(MTR). The aide memoires succeeded in identifying pertinent issues to be addressed. The
Bank also provided external resources (World Bank Institute, PPIAF) to advise and assist
on PPP implementation in response to GoI's desire for more PPP transactions.

122. In recognition of the implementation difficulties encountered in the later years of
the loan, the task team held a meeting with GoI in mid-2007 to discuss options including
canceling the loan, however, GoI requested very strongly that the loan continue. In light
of the shifting PPP landscape, the PPITA team could have been more proactive in
adjusting the Key Indicators and reevaluating the proposed PPP framework; yet its ability
to do this was constrained by the uncompetitiveness of PPITA's IBRD terms (e.g. the
failure of the attempt to add MoF as an implementing agency).

123. The Bank's quality of supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

124. Overall, the Bank's performance is judged Moderately Satisfactory in terms of
preparatory input and quality of supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

125. "Government" in this case is defined as the central authorities responsible for the
policy direction in the thematic area of the loan, i.e. BAPPENAS, CMEA and MoF.

126. GoI through KKPPI remains committed to PPI as part of GoI's policy. It showed
strong commitment to a transparent and competitive process for PPI. GoI provided
requisite levels of counterpart funding, audit oversight and compliance with the anti-
corruption action plan.

127. While there were implementation issues that threatened the continuity of PPITA,
the task team attributes this to the decreasing competitiveness of an IBRD loan in the
context of the abundance of grant funds arriving in Indonesia for TA rather than a lack of
GoI commitment to the PPP agenda generally. The politicization of the PPP agenda and
the internal frustration by what some saw as the overly stringent requirements for public



                                              28

support and slow progress did threaten the framework established by GoI assisted by
PPITA (further discussed in section 3.5(c) above). However, the ability of the
institutional and regulatory framework to withstand such challenges and the progress it
has made since that time reconfirms the strength of the foundation established to support
PPP in Indonesia.

128. For these reasons GoI's performance is rated Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

129. "Implementing Agencies" in this case are referred to as the parts of GoI responsible
for the day-to-day management of the project.

130. Although two PIU were established for PPITA, project management across all of
the implementing agencies relied heavily on a strong PMU in CMEA. When the PMU
was operating in full strength it was able to mitigate, to some extent, the weaknesses in
project management at the line ministries resulting in Satisfactory ratings for project
implementation for the first six supervision missions. After it was downsized in late
2006, the PMU was unable to discharge its role properly and procurement and other key
project management tasks in the line ministries ground to a halt for much of 2007 and the
beginning of 2008.

131. When the KKPPI secretariat was dissolved alongside the PMU, Bank management
looked to the implementing agencies to show leadership and either reinstate the KKPPI
or propose a replacement. The KKPPI Secretariat has yet to be reinstated, and the PMU
was only reinstated almost a year after the issue was identified in a management letter
from the World Bank.

132. The PIUs are supposed to champion PPITA and to elicit buy-in from the
directorates general within their ministry. In the case of MoT, buy-in was the poorest. A
consequence was that no sub-projects were implemented in the ministry, although these
were provisioned in the PPITA loan.

133. In MoT, supervision of consultants' work was also very weak, leading to poor
performance and delivery of output from their advisory TA. In MoPW, the relevance of a
P3 node is still not appreciated. Although the node was established, it lacks
empowerment. Despite significant amount of supervision, the first TA in BAPPENAS to
develop the P3 network was aborted. This was due to the inability of the consultants to
perform.

134. The Implementing Agencies' performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

135. Implementation was problematic in certain key areas, as detailed above.
Nevertheless, the GoI's success in laying the foundation for transparent and competitive
PSP by 2005 is a landmark achievement, especially when put in the perspective of other




                                             29

countries' experience. For this reason alone, the Borrower's performance overall is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

136. Project complexity: PPITA and previous experience indicate that complex projects
involving many stakeholders (ministries and other agencies) are susceptible to
institutional risks. Project designs with such complex arrangements should include
explicit mitigation measures to reduce risks.

137. Ensuring senior ownership and buy-in is easier said than done: The PPITA PAD
identifies the need for an effective linkage to key decision makers as a key lesson learnt
from TAP4I-II; saying "a future project should be attached to and support a functioning
high level coordinating agency or central agency that enjoys effective support within
Government." Task teams can continue to build capacity of their counterparts and
continue a high-level dialog with their superiors but, in practice, the World Bank has no
power to suggest or approve appointment of counterparts in implementing agencies. A
greater sense of ownership of an advisory TA and hence more buy-in is likely to occur if
it is situated in a specific sectoral area within a ministry (e.g. a DG) but, as noted above,
this must be complemented by ongoing dialog with senior decision makers (e.g. a
Minister or Secretary General).

138. Donor coordination: As stated previously, PPP reform is enormously complex,
involving many governmental and non-governmental entities. Donors working in an area
such as this need to ensure that they coordinate closely with GoI and harmonize their
agendas to avoid working across purposes.

139. Institutional development: PPITA's experience shows that creating new institutions
and empowering them is much more difficult than anticipated in the project documents.
Such change requires a long gestation period and a willingness to re-distribute power
between the various institutions.

140. Loans vs. grants: Borrowers have been willing to borrow at IBRD rates for program
lending and larger project loans, however, IBRD technical assistance loans may not be
competitive where an abundance of grant funds exist as is the case in Indonesia at
present. This lesson is consistent with the experience of many other countries where only
grants or IDA money are accepted for TA and non-income-earning projects.
