{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Private Provision of\n            Infrastructure Technical Assistance (PPITA) Loan Project for\n            Indonesia were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: PPITA experience shows that\n            creating new institutions and empowering them is much more\n            difficult than anticipated in the project documents. Such\n            change requires a long gestation period and a willingness to\n            re-distribute power between the various institutions.\n            Borrowers have been willing to borrow at International Bank\n            for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) rates for program\n            lending and larger project loans; however, IBRD technical\n            assistance (TA) loans may not be competitive where an\n            abundance of grant funds exist as is the case in Indonesia\n            at present. This lesson is consistent with the experience of\n            many other countries where only grants or International\n            Development Association (IDA) money are accepted for TA and\n            non-income-earning projects. Public Private Partnership\n            (PPP) reform is enormously complex, involving many\n            governmental and non-governmental entities. Donors working\n            in an area such as this need to ensure that they coordinate\n            closely with Government of Indonesia (GoI) and harmonize\n            their agendas to avoid working across purposes."}, "docdt": "2009-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
