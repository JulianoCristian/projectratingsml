Loan and Project Su-arT
Borrowers:     Empresa Metropolitana de Obras Sanitarias (EMOS) and
Empresa de Obras Sanitarias de la Region V (ESVAL)
Guarantor:     The Republic of Chile
Amounts:       US$60.0 million equivalent for EMOS and
US$6.0 million equivalent for ESVAL
Terms:         Repayment in 15 years, including three years of grace, with
interest at the Bank's standard variable rate
Project
Description:  A. Santiago - ENDS: (i) Sewerage:  construction of about
70 km of trunk mains and 200 km of collection sewers, a pilot
sewage treatment plant and 13 waste water stabilization ponds;
{ii) Water Supply: construction of about 150 km of trunk and
distribution mains, about 80,000 m3 of reservoir storage and
about 30 wells; and (iii) General Operations: technical as-
sistance, construction of operations building for EMOS, oper-
ating equipment, office equipment and water meters.
B. Valparaiso - ESVAL: (i) Water Supply: construction of
a 5,000 m3 reservoir and a 500 1/sec surface water treacment
plant, and connection of about 1,500 houses and rehabilitation
of a 750 1/sec surface water treatment plant; and (ii) Opera-
tions and Studies: general technical assistance, project pre-
paration studies and operations equipment.
Benefits and   The Santiago water supply component would directly benefit
Beneficiaries: about 830,000 people by 1992, of which about 80 percent would
be the urban poor. The sewerage component would facilitate
access to the system for about 810,000 people, of which 80
percent would also be low income. Aspects of the sewerage
component designed to abate pollution through the adequate
disposal and control of raw sewage use would benefit the  pop-
ulation of Santiago as a whole, contribute to a significant
reduction in the incidence of typhoid fever and other enteric
diseases and enhance general living conditions in Santiago.
The population served by ESVAL (Valparaiso) would benefit from
the reconstruction of the facilities damaged by the March 3,
.1985 earthquake and the operational improvements designed to
prepare the utility to become more efficient in providing
services.
Risks:         The major risks of the Santiago project relate to the timeli-
ness with which land acquisition, expropriations and compensa-
tion and the obtaining of municipal permits are undertaken.
These actions, however, are well advanced and the time

required for them was taken into account in phasing project ex-
ecution. In the case of the Valparaiso project, the timeliness
of future tariff action is the main risk. However, the Govern-
ment's commitment to having financially independent service en-
tities in the sector substantially m1itigates this risk. Re-
garding both projects, the risk also exists that notwithstand-
ing the cash iflow positions of EMOS and ESVAL, changing fiscal
requirements at the national level could result in lower total
budget authorizations for the two companies than those re-
quired. The Government, however, attaches high priority to the
two projects.

ERNATIONAL DANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AD DELOPMENT
REPORT AIND RE    N N  OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
ID THE EECUTIVE DIRECORS ON TWO PROPOSED LOANS
TO THE EMESA   TOPOLITANA DE OBRAS SANITARIAS (ENOS)
FOR A SANTIAGO MA3ER SUPPLY AND SEUERAGE II PROJEIC AID
TO THE EMPRESA DE OBRAS SANITARIAS DE LA REGION V (ESVAL)
FOR A VALPARAISO WATER SUPPLY RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on two proposed
loans: one to the Empresa Metropolitana de Obras Sanitarias (EMOS) for the
equivalent of US$60.0 million to help finance a Santiago Water Supply and
Sewerage II Project and the other to the Empresa de Obras Sanitarias de la
Region V (ESVAL) for the equivalent of US$6.0 million to help finance a
Valparaiso Water Supply Reconstruction Project. The proposed loans would
have a term of 15 years, including three years of grace, at the standard var-
iable interest rate and would be guaranteed by the Government.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic memorandum on Chile (Report No. 5099-CH) was circulated
to the Board on September 24, 1984. The following paragraphs are based on
the conclusions contained in that memorandum and on information gathered by
subsequent missions that visited Chile in 1985. Country data sheets are
attached as Annex I.
Evolution of the Economy to the end of 1983
3.        For the past century, Chile's economic development has been charac-
terized by high dependence on one or two mineral exports. Buoyant copper and
nitrate revenues, and their considerable export taxes, accustomed Chileans to
high levels of government outlays and sophisticated benefit systems without a
corresponding tax sacrifice. The Great Depression then devastated Chile. By
1932, the real value of Chile's exports had fallen 82 percent, the real value
of imports by 87 percent, and real per capita GDP 50 percent. Post-Depres-
sion Governments expanded state ownership and followed extreme import-substi-
tution policies which often led to overvalued exchange rates supported by
high levels of tariff and nontariff protection. Negative real interest
rates, low administered prices for food and other wage goods, and legally
mandated wage adjustments were combined with high and growing levels of
social benefits. These policies were overlaid by tax exemptions, tariffs,
controls, and subsidies in pursuit of special distributional or allocative
objectives. All these activities required a substantial shift of resources
to the public sector, a shift accomplished to a significant degree by infla-
tionary monetary expansion and foreign borrowing. In spite of this, in the
post-Depression decades, Chile experienced slow growth, rapid inflation, fre-
quent balance of payments crises, a growing foreign debt burden, a highly
protected and inefficient manufacturing sector, and continued dependence on a
single primary export commodity, copper.



- 2 -
4.        The Popular Unity Government of 1971-73 continued these policies;
indeed, it followed many of them to extremes. In early 1971, it raised real
wages considerably and pursued highly expansionary fiscal and monetary poli-
cies. The exchange rate and interest rates lagged behind increasing infla-
tion, an inflation that accelerated in spite of massive price controls and
direct state allocation of many consumer goods. The pressure on the balance
of payments from these activities became unsustainable; by end-1971 Chile was
unable to service its foreign debt and the economy began encountering severe
financial, and economic constraints. By 1973 real per capita GDP and real
wages had fallen far below the levels of 1970, agricultural output had drop-
ped to the level of the early 1960s, monthly inflation had reached an annual-
ized rate above 1,000 percent, the Central Government deficit alone exceeded
20 percent of GDP, the black market exchange rate had risen to over ten times
the official rate, and net international reserves were negative.
The 1974-1980 Adjustment Program
5.        After a one-year hiatus, the next Government undertook a severe ad-
justment program. Its development strategy included the phased introduction
of low and even import tariffs, state enterprise pricing based on opportunity
and/or actual costs, decentralized social programs, positive and flexible in-
terest rates, reduction of wage taxes, virtual freeing of all product and
factor prices, innovative nutrition and education programs with benefits and
subsidies targeted to the poor, and a major social security reform. After an
initial recession, the effect of these policies and programs was highly posi-
tive.
6.        Between 1976-1980 real economic growth averaged 8.5 percent per
year; by 1977, GDP in real terms had returned to 1971-1972 levels; by 1980
annual inflation was reduced to 30 percent. The balance of payments position
improved markedly; the value of agricultural and manufactured exports grew
more than sevenfold between 1973 and 1978. Copper revenues-traditionally
over 80 percent of export receipts--had been reduced to half of total export
earnings. Net foreign reserves during the 1973-1978 period averaged over
US$1.5 billion. By 1978, real wages and salaries had recovered to their 1970
levels and rose further as worker productivity increased. The efficiency of
the State enterprises improved greatly, and the public sector had an overall
surplus by the late 1970s. Unfortunately, however, a consequence of much im-
proved worker and enterprise efficiency was that the unemployment rate fell
slowly, in spite of a major emergency employment program.
7.        While the Government was eager to reduce the economic role of the
State, it was equally determined to improve the quality of, and access to,
social services to the poor. Previous income distribution policies and pro-
grams--such as price controls, public housing, cheap credit, factor sub-
sidies, tax exemptions and broadly-based social expenditure programs-not
only had had perverse growth effects, but often had been of equal or, in some
cases, greater benefit to the urban middle class than to the poor. From the
mid-seventies on, although the Government spent less on the social sectors
than predecessor governments (public social outlays only reached 1972 levels
in real per capita terms in 1980), it carefully targeted its spending on the
extreme poor through a series of health and educational reforms that lowered
substantially Chile's infant mortality and child malnutrition rates.



8.        After 1980, economic conditions changed with a major shift in
macroeconomic policy and the later world recession. On July 1, 1979 the
Government ended its pre-announced crawling peg policy and fixed the Chilean
Peso at Ch$39:US$1. This, combined with greatly lessened restrictions on ex-
ternal capital flows and public sector surpluses, was expected to adjust
domestic inflation quickly to international levels. Unfortunately, the time
lag in the adjustment of inflation, combined with the subsequent appreciation
of the US dollar and the 1981-83 world recession, produced an unsustainable
boom financed by massive inflows of foreign borrowings. Between end-1979 and
end-1981, Chile's private external debt tripled.
9.        The appreciation of the peso-combined with the growing world re-
cession--finally had an overwhelming effect as Chile's export earnings and
inflows of foreign savings both dropped. By the end of 1981, Chile's economy
entered a recession. The lag in adjusting Chile's foreign exchange policy
led the economy from recession into depression. In 1982 GDP fell 14 percent
as real value-added in construction, which had boomed in 1980/81, dropped al-
most 22 percent and real value-added in commerce and transport decreased by
15 percent and 10 percent, respectively. Manufacturing value-added declined
by 22 percent. Real fixed investment fell almost 37 percent, a most dis-
couraging drop considering that the country had only begun to improve its in-
frastructure, which had deteriorated greatly during the 1970s.
10.       With the onslaught of the depression, unemployment soared to 19
percent by 1982. The financial situation of many firms and banks deterior-
ated. As early as November 1981, the Government had assumed responsibility
for day-to-day management of a few insolvent banks, but the situation worsen-
ed considerably in 1982, with a series of corporate bankruptcies. The crisis
finally forced the Government to devalue in June 1982, and subsequently fol-
low a crawling peg exchange rate policy. In January 1983, after the IMF
agreed to an SDR 795 million Stand-by, a financial crisis was triggered by
massive banking insolvencies and a huge capital outflow. The Government
liquidated some banks and intervened 1/ others, providing immediate liquid-
ity to avoid collapse of the financial system. A "shadow program"--by which
the original targets could be met by September--was then drawn up. By
end-July, agreement was reached with foreign banks, providing Chile with
much-needed financial support.
Recent Economic Developments and Prospects
11.       The depression bottomed out in late 1983.  A growing public invest-
ment program and Central Bank financing of domestic debt reschedulings sup-
ported strong increases in demand and production in the first semester of
1984. A March agreement with its international creditors provided Chile with
$780 million in fresh medium-term capital and a major increase in short-term
debt followed. As a result, GDP grew 6.3 percent in 1984. Industrial, agri-
cultural and fishing output all grew faster than GDP.   Employment increased
by 9.2 percent, allowing the Government to reduce 137,000 jobs in its
emergency-work programs while unemployment dropped to a 13.3 percent rate-
its lowest since 1981. However, as a result of this expansion, the current
account deficit of the balance of payments reached 10 percent of GDP-an un-
sustainable level.
1/    Intervention- ir, the Chilean context, means the taking over, by the
Superintendency of Banks, of the day-to-day management of financial
institutions, without affecting t;.e institution's ownership structure.



- 4 -
12.         In January 1985, the Authorities defined a medium-term adjustment
program which the Bank is supporting with a US$250 million Structural Adjust-
ment Loan (SAL) approved in October 1985. The IMF is also providing support
to the program with a three-year SDR 750 million Extended Fund Facility
(EFF). Policy measures defined in the adjustment program address the three
major structural problems of the economy: the need to accelerate and divers-
ify exports, the savings/investment disequilibrium, and the financial dis-
tress that permeates the economy. Besides specific fiscal, monetary and re-
serve targets for 1985, the EFF program stressed the phasing out of the pre-
ferential exchange rate and swap operations of the Central bank, a lower pub-
lic deficit and major reductions in Chile's need for new external commercial
funds.
13.       A commercial bank financial package providing US$1.1 billion in new
money for 1985-1986, rescheduling of amortizations coming due during 1985-
1987, as well as reduced interest payments, supports the country's program.
Still, even to attain a moderate annual GDP growth rate of about 2.5 to 3
percent over the medium term, Chile will not only need to increase signifi-
cantly domestic savings and accelerate exports, it will also need further
substantial net inflows of capital. So far, Chile has made determined ef-
forts to increase export incentives in the economy. Following a five per-
centage point reduction in import tariffs in February, in July 1985, the
Government reduced import tariffs further from 30 to 20 percent-devaluing
the peso to compensate for the tariff decrease--announced an easing of re-
serve requirements to banks lending to exporters and reduced taxes for ex-
port-related activities. The public investment program is now oriented to
support more strongly a productive recovery. Emphasis is also being placed
on improving the efficiency of public sector management. Private incentives
are also being oriented to export expansion or efficient import-substitution
as well as to employment and savings generation.
14.         Recent Bank and Fund missions found the SAL-EFF targets for 1985
were met. Export diversification increased at a strong pace (noncopper ex-
ports grew 9 percent in real terms), but depressed prices kept export earn-
ings to about their 1984 level. A 12 percent real drop in imports together
with lower interest rates permitted a reduction in the current account
deficit to US$1.3 billion. By December 1985, inflation was under control (25
percent annually) but open unemployment remained at a 14 percent rate. Pub-
lic savings were increased to 3.4 percent of GDP and the deficit of the non-
financial public sector was reduced to 2.9 percent of GDP. GDP growth, how-
ever, slowed to an estimated 1.7 percent for the year.
15.         Chile's prospects to sustain an export-led recovery were demon-
strated by the strong 1985 real export expansion. When supported by export-
oriented policies such as the ones currently in place, Chile's producers in-
vest and diversify into nontraditional exports at an accelerated pace. The
public sector has also shown its determination to support the recovery by es-
tablishing fiscal measures to increase public savings while supporting pri-
vate sector savings. Based on the EFF/SAL program and its successful 1985
implementation, we consider Chile creditworthy for Bank lending.



PART II - BANK GROUP OPERAIIONS IN CHILE
16.       By December 31, 1985, the Bank had made 36 loans to Chile, amount-
ing to US$1,241.3 million (net of cancellations) of which eight were not yet
fully disbursed. IDA had also extended a US$22.9 million credit to the coun-
try for a road project. IFC gross commitments in Chile as of the same date
stood at US$56.4 million. Annex II has further details on IBRD and IFC oper-
ations as at September 30, 1985.
17.       Of total Bank and IDA lending to Chile, 27 percent has been for
transportation, 20 percent for structural adjustment, 13 percent for power,
13 percent for industry, 12 percent for agriculture (including irrigation),
6 percent for housing, 4 percent for mining, 3 percent for water supply, and
the balance (2 percent) for education and technical assistance.
18.       Historically, the volume of Bank lending to Chile has fluctuated
substantially in accordance, inter alia, with the country's economic perform-
ance and the availability of suitable projects. In the FY75-77 period, the
Bank made four loans totalling US$107.8 million to help finance projects in
the agriculture, copper mining and power sectors. The Bank did not lend to
Chile in FY78-79, but in FY80 it approved a US$38 million loan for a water
supply project and, in FY81, two loans in the amounts of US$36 million and
US$42 million for a second agricultural credit project and a highway recon-
struction project, respectively. During FYB2-85, five Bank loans were ap-
proved: a US$128 million loan for a Second Highway Reconstruction Project, a
US$56 million loan for Agricultural Services and Credit, a US$80 million loan
for Public Sector Housing, a US$11 million loan for Public Sector Management
Technical Assistance, and a US$140 million Road Sector Loan. The Bank also
modified existing operations to permit almost US$25 million in proceeds to be
used for earthquake-related emergency repairs and reconstruction, principally
in the transport sector, but also in housing. During FY86, three loans have
thus far been approved: US$100 millib,n for Industrial Finance Restructuring,
US$40 million for Small and Medium Industry, and US$250 million for a
Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL). Additionally, a US$300 million B-Loan was
prepared (to complement the above-mentioned Road Sector Loan) with a Bank
guarantee of US$150 million.
19.       Execution of Bank-financed projects in Chile has been satisfac-
tory. Disbursement of Bank loans to Chile reached US$32.6 million in FY82.
Then in FY83, with Chile's current depression at its nadir, disbursements de-
clined to US$22.3 million.  They rebounded, however, in FY84 increasing to
US$34.5 million and in FY85 to US$67.7 million. In the first semester -
FY86, Bank disbursements to Chile surged above US$180 million, a large por-
tion (US$125 million) of which corresponded to the first tranche of the re-
cently-approved SAL.
20.       The Bank's lending strategy is to support the Government's medium-
term economic adjustment program by focussing on improvements in: (i) ex-
ternal trade policies that would ensure an acceleration of export growth and
efficient import-substitution and would further diversify production and ex-
ports; (ii) public sector management and fiscal policies to reactivate the
economy and strengthen public savings in a timely way with emphasis on making
better use of existing infrastructure and productive capacity; (iii) finan-
cial policies to stimulate domestic savings and to allocate credit more effi-
ciently; and (iv) policy incentives to expand productive employment.

21.       Over the next few years, it is expected that the Bank will continue
to support the Government's medium-term economic adjustment program with at
least one additional SAL operation. Additionally, several other proposed
lending operations are being considered that would complement the SALs and
reinforce the effort to meet the objectives of the Government's structural
adjustment program. Lending for energy, agriculture, forestry and mining
would not only contribute to expanding output and employment, but would also
increase foreign exchange earnings and savings. Additionally, as part of the
Bank's program of emergency assistance to Chile, following the March 3, 1985
earthquake, a port reconstruction project might also be prepared over the
next two years. A proposed multimodal transport operation would emphasize
rationalizing competing modes of transport and prepare the country better for
the container age. For the later years, a subsequent possible loan for water
and sewerage facilities would build on the sectoral, institutional and policy
improvements addressed in this proposed lending operation and a follow-up
housing loan would further the important policy improvements being introduced
under the ongoing housing operation.
22.       The responsible way in which the Authorities are handling the coun-
try's external obligations augurs well for future operations in which the
Bank could co-lend with commercial banks. International commercial banks
have agreed to provide Chile with new funds to tide the country through 1986,
and are participating with the Bank in the above-mentioned US$300 million
B-Loan (para. 18). Opportunities for cofinancing with the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB), are also being explored. IDB has a sizeable program
in Chile; it is focussing primarily on agriculture, industry, power, and
transportation-sectors in which the Bank is also preparing operations.  IBRD
exposure in Chile currently stands at around 3 percent of public debt and
about 2 percent of total medium- and long-term debt but could increase sub-
stantially in the next two years.
PART III- WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERSCE SECTOR
The Setting
23.       Chile's population (11.7 million in 1983) is currently growing at
an annual rate of 1.6 percent, down from 2.1 percent during the 1960s. The
growth rate is expected to decline further to 1.2 percent by the year 2000.
The spatial distribution of the population has also changed considerably.
The urban population accounts for 82 percent of the total and is projected to
grow to 85 percent by 1990 and 89 percent by the turn of the century. Half
of the urban population lives in the Santiago Metropolitan Region with about
4.6 million inhabitants, while 25 percent lives in Valparaiso and Concepcion.
24.       Chile has made siTnificant progress over the last two decades in
expanding its water supply and sewerage services. In 1974 it was estimated
that about 69 percent of the urban population had access to piped water and
38 percent was connected to sewerage systems. These figures were 89 percent
and 69 percent, respectively, in 1983. Of the non-dispersed rural popula-
tion, about 55 percent has access to piped water of which 80 percent is
served through house connections.



25.       The impressive achievements in service levels are, to a consider-
able degree, offset by increased water pollution caused by the discharge of
untreated sewage into open water courses. Water is scarce during the dry
summer months and surface water is used extensively for both domestic and
agricultural purposes. The pollution problem is most severe in the Santiago
Metropolitan Region where about 280 million m3/year of untreated sewage are
discharged into two rivers (the Mapocho and the Maipo) and a canal (Zanjon de
la Aguada). The Zanjon runs through the middle of the city and thus receives
the major portion of the city's sewage.
Health Situation
26.       Infectious and parasitic diseases are among the eight leading
causes of death in Chile, accounting for seven percent of all deaths. Enter-
itis and other diarrheal diseases associated with water account for over 40
percent of these deaths. Typhoid fever is parcicularly prevalent, with a
morbidity incidence of over 119 cases per 100,000 inhabitants for Chile as a
whole in 1983 and over 214 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Metropolitan
Santiago (the morbidity incidence specifically attributed to the practice of
irrigation with raw sewage is 156 per 100,000 inhabitants). In Santiago, the
highest risk group comprises persons between six and 21 years of age, for
which the rate is 296 per 100,000. Considering that Santiago has a temperate
climate and relatively good water supply, the frequency of this illness is
alarming. These rates are the highest in Latin America and far exceed rates
for countries with similar climatic conditions (Tunisia-17/100,000; Turkey-
6.3/100,000; Spain-6.5/100,000; Cyprus-1.4/100,000).
Sector Organization
27.       The water supply and sewerage sector in Chile is now under the
supervisory authority of the Servicio Nacional de Obras Sanitarias (SENDOS),
a tax-exempt, financially autonomous body with corporate status, under the
Ministry of Public Works (MOP). SENDOS establishes overall sector policies
and is responsible for their enforcement as well as for the water supply and
sewerage operations in 11 of the country's 13 regions. To carry out its task
in these regions, SENDOS works through 11 regional offices. SENDOS is also
responsible for the execution of rural water supply and sanitation throughout
the country.
28.       The sector also comprises two public sector companies in Santiago
(Empresa Metropolitana de Obras Sanitarias-EMOS) and Valparaiso (Empresa de
Obras Sanitarias de la Region V--ESVAL), as well as a small private company
in a high-income neighborhood (Lo Castillo) and a municipal company in a mid-
dle- to low-income area of Santiago (Maipo). EMOS and ESVAL, the utilities
under the proposed project, are responsible for the planning, management,
programming, construction, operation, maintenance and other activities re-
lated to the provision of water and sewerage services within their respective
urban areas. The two entities have the authority to allocate their revenues
and other sources of funds. EMOS has recently been granted the authority to
set tariffs automatically in line with its financial requirements but the
Ministry of Economy still approves tariffs proposed by ESVAL. The Ministry
of Finance approves both companies' respective budgets. The Office of
Planning of the Presi'tency (ODEPLAN) reviews all sector investment projects
to ensure that they are economically and socially justified and conform to
macroeconomic objectives.



-8-
Operational Performance
29.       Operating efficiency in the sector is improving.   This is exempli-
fied by the reduction in unaccounted-for water nationwide from ahout 50 per-
cent to 42 percent between 1979 and 1983 and from 34 percent to 30 percent in
Santiago as a result of assistance in metering and leak detection provided by
the project financed by Bank Loan 1832-CH. Efforts are being made to further
reduce these figures. The ratio of employees to water connections has also
shown remarkable improvemert. Staff per 1,000 water connections nationwide
stands at 4.3, down from about seven in 1978. EMOS has 2.4 employees per
1,000 water connections. These ratios are among the lowest in Latin America
for which the average is nine employees per 1,000 connections.
Sector Invest ents
30.       About US$500 million were invested in the sector in 1973-1984.  In-
vestments in the Metropolitan Region amounted to 27 percent of the total.
Thirty five percent of the total funds invested in the sector were provided
by the Government through grants. SENDOS was the beneficiary of over 60 per-
cent of the Government grant funds, while EMOS received 14 percent, all prior
to 1978. Although Government contributions have been important, the sector
in turn has contributed about 20 percent of gross sector revenues to general
public finances through a value-added tax (IVA-established in 1975). The
origin and use of funds in the sector between 1973-1984 are summarized in
Table I below.

Sector Objectives, Policies and Finances
31.       The Chilean Government, in line with the goals of the International
Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade (IDWSSD), aims at providing water
and sanitation to all its citizens and at making major improvements in en-
vironmental health. The following medium-term targets for service coverage,
which were reviewed by the Bank and are considered attainable, have been es-
tablished.



- 9 -
Table 2: SECTOR PHYSICAL GOALS
Coverage Z
1987        1990
Water Supply (Urban Areas)          98           100
Sewerage (Urban Areas)              70           90
Rural Water Supply (Concentrated
Population)                       73          100
In addition to achieving and maintaining the above targets, the problems of
improving water quality and addressing the problem of inadequate sewage and
storm water disposal are being addressed through construction of necessary
infrastructure and waste treatment plants. To this end, with assistance un-
der Loan 1832-CH, a sewerage master plan has been prepared for the Santiago
Metropolitan Region, where the problems of inadequate sewage disposal and use
of untreated sewage are most acute. Quality of service would become the
primary focus during the following decade once the quantitative targets have
been met.
32.       Meeting the coverage targets would mean providing an additional 3.3
million and four million people in urban areas with water supply and sewer-
age, respectively, and 0.3 million people in rural areas with water by 1990.
Total investment required to meet these targets is about US$770 million in
1985 prices. Additionally, US$60 million is needed for the first phase
(1985-1990) of the Santiago sewage disposal program, and US$20 million to re-
pair facilities damaged by the recent earthquake in the Valparaiso/San
Antonio area. These investments, which represent about US$140 million annu-
ally in 1985-1990, more than double the historic annual average, were ana-
lyzed and found satisfactory during a Bank public sector investment review
for Chile.
33.       The Ministry of Economy has recently stated that the attainment of
financial self-sufficiency for urban water and sewerage services and self-
sufficiency in operations and maintenance for rural services is one of its
major sector objectives. To this end, a reform in tariff policy and the
rate-setting framework has been undertaken and completed for EMOS which now
allows the company to increase automatically its water and sewerage tariffs
in line with cost increases and standards of services. Sector-wide applica-
tion would follow later on as well as other measures to attain financial
self-sufficiency (para. 36).
34.       The Government's other sector objectives are in the institutional
and administrative areas. Current and planned actions are primarily oriented
to confirming and strengthening the existing framework and amending laws and
regulations to make them more effective. Additionally, the Government aims
to actively organize rural communities to participate in the planning, finan-
cing, construction and operation of water systems. Administrative objectives
are to introduce modern management techniques, to improve operations and to
provide adequate training for sector staff. The metering and water-loss-
reduction programs initiated under the first Bank-financed project will be
continued and sound corrective maintenance programs will be developed and im-
plemented.

Past Bank Experience in the Sector
35.       The Bank has made one loan to the sector (Loan 1832-CH for US$38
million equivalent in FY80). That project includes financing for the con-
struction of an additional water treatment plant, transmission mains and dis-
tribution system improvements for Santiago, preparation of the sewerage
Master Plan for Santiago, and provision of equipment and studies to improve
water quality and reduce water losses throughout the country. It is also
financing technical assistance to strengthen SENDOS. Despite initial delays,
project execution is now progressing well and the project is expected to be
substantially completed by June 30, 1986 (one year after the original closing
date). Compliance with loan conditions has been satisfactory.
Bank Sector Strategy
36.       The Bank's sector strategy is to help strengthen the management and
technological development of EMOS and ESVAL, so that they can serve as an ex-
ample for the rest of the sector. Bank assistance to the sector supports
Government objectives and efforts to achieve a more rational sectoral devel-
opment and modernization, to improve efficiency, to alleviate poverty and un-
employment, and to address critical public health problems arising from inad-
equate waste disposal in the large urban centers, particularly in Santiago.
Through macroeconomic and sector dialogue, the Bank is encouraging reforms in
sector financial policies. Agreement was reached on the topics to be ad-
dressed in a study of sector financial policies to be carried out and dis-
cussed with the Bank by not later than December 31, 1987.
PART IV - THE PROJECr
Project Origin
37.       The proposed Santiago project will further the improvements in san-
itation achieved under the earlier Bank-financed project for EMOS, which in-
cluded the first phase of modernization and rehabilitation of the Santiago
water supply system and studies for the long-term development of the Santiago
sewerage system. The proposed Valparaiso project is part of the joint World
Bank-IDB earthquake reconstruction effort. It will help to address the water
supply needs of this region which were exacerbated by the earthquake of March
3, 1985. The proposed Santiago project was appraised in February 1985 and
the Valparaiso project was appraised in April 1985. Annex III contains a
Supplementary Project Data Sheet. Negotiations were held in Washington in
November 1985. The Chilean Delegation was led by Messrs. Dario Rodriguez,
General Manager of EMOS and George Seal, General Manager of ESVAL.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
38.       The proposed Bank participation in the project stems from a country
strategy to support Chile's efforts to bring about better financial and ins-
titutional performance of the public sector entities and to induce greater
efficiency in the use of resources. The project will also help meet the
basic needs of the population, in particular the lower-income segments, to
alleviate unemployment and to address severe environmental problems in the
capital city.



- 11 -
Project Objectives
39.       The proposed Santiago project is designed to strengthen EMOS man-
agement and cost control and to support the first phase of a plan to address
the sewage disposal and use problems, with a view to reducing the incidence
of typhoid fever and other enteric diseases. In Santiago, trunk sewers will
be constructed to intercept sewage discharge starting with the upper reaches
of the three main water courses. Thus, an increasing number of irrigation
intakes will have access to unpolluted water. A similar strategy will be
used for the construction of sewerage systems and stabilization ponds for the
13 provincial centers close to Santiago. The Santiago project is also de-
signed to increase further potable water quality and quantity, by improving
operations and maintenance, tightening control of working pressures and re-
ducing water losses in the Santiago water distribution system. The project
for Valparaiso would help to reconstruct the water supply system for Greater
Valparaiso, to prepare the studies needed to support improvements and exten-
sions of its water supply and sewerage systems and to improve ESVAL's opera-
tions. Both projects are expected to generate significant new employment
in the civil works industry which has been severely depressed for the past
few years.
Project Description
40.       The project components for Santiago and Valparaiso include:  A.
Santiago - EMOS: (i) Sewerage: construction of about 70 km of trunk mains
and 200 km of collection sewers, a pilot sewage treatment plant and 13 sta-
bilization ponds for provincial centers; (ii) Water Supply: construction of
about 150 km of trunk and distribution mains, about 80,000 m3 of reservoir
storage and about 30 wells; and (iii) Technical Assistance: improvement of
management, information and operating systems; development of a staff train-
ing program; construction of an operations building and provision of opera-
tions and office equipment and water meters; B. Valparaiso - ESVAL:
(i) Water Supply:  construction of a 5,000 m3 reservoir and a 50a '/sec sur-
face water treatment plant, connection of about 1,500 houses and rehabilita-
tion of a 750 1/sec surface water treatment plant; and (ii) Technical Assist-
ance: improvement of operations and provision of consulting services for the
preparation of feasibility studies and final design of the expansion of the
ESVAL water supply systems; and procurement of operating equipment.
Project Cost
41.       The total cost of the Santiago project, excluding interest during
construction, is estimated at US$121.2 million equivalent. The foreign ex-
change component is estimated at US$60 million or 50 percent of project cost.
The total cost of the Valparaiso project, excluding interest during construc-
tion, is estimated at US$10.8 million equivalent. The foreign exchange com-
ponent is estimated at US$6.0 million or 55 percent of project cost. Costs
are based on July 1985 prices and include physical contingencies of 15 per-
cent. Identifiable taxes totalling about US$15 million are reflected in the
local cost. Price contingencies are based on estimated international infla-
tion of 7.0 percent in 1986, 7.5 percent in 1987 and 1988, 7.7 percent in
1989, 7.6 percent in 1990 and 4.5 percent in 1991. Domestic inflation is es-
timated to be 25 percent in 1986, 20 percent in 1987 and 15 percent there-
after. Movements in exchange rates are assumed to offset the difference be-
tween local and foreign inflation. Consulting services are estimated at 700
man-months of which about 30 percent would be for foreign consultants. Cost



- 12 -
estimates are based on the experience obtained in the execution of the first
Bank-financed Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Loan 1832-CH) and updated by
the design consultants.
Project Financing Pln
42.       Two Bank loans of US$60 million and US$6 million equivalent (50
percent of combined total cost of both projects) would go respectively to
EMOS and ESVAL and would finance total foreign costs. Both ENOS and ESVAL
would finance from their internal cash generation the local cost of their
respective projects. The financing plan for the two projects can be summar-
ized as follows:

TOTAL                    4.8     6.0      10.8
Project Implementation
43.       The Borrowers would be EMOS (Santiago) and ESVAL (Valparaiso).
The ENOS and ESVAL projects would be implemented over the years 1986-1991 and
1986-1990, respectively. The proposed EMOS project would be the first stage
of EMOS' ten-year investment program. It follows, without interruption, the
execution of the previous Bank-financed project for EMOS. Experience during
the implementation of the previous project has shown that EMOS' staff is cap-
able of executing an increasing level of investment. ENOS' project prepara-
tion is satisfactory:  about 20 percent of final designs, equivalent to about
one year and a half of EKOS' average annual investment. The project imple-
mentation schedule for the ESVAL project reflects the emergency nature of the
reconstruction works.  Agreement was obtained that EMOS and ESVAL will retain
qualified consultants, under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, for
the preparation of bidding documents, tender analysis and the supervision of
construction and that consultants will be selected in accordance with Bank
guidelines for the selection of consultants.
Procurement and Disbursement
44.       Procurement under both projects would be in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines for Procurement (May 1985). Contracts for civil works es-
timated to cost US$2 million or more and equipment purchases of US$300,000 or
more would be procured through international competitive bidding; those esti-
mated to cost less than US$2 million but over US$100,000, and equipment pur-
chases of less than US$300,000 but over US$100,000 would be awarded on the
basis of local competitive bidding procedures satisfactory to the Bank. The
aggregate amounts of contracts so procured would not exceed US$10 million for



- 13 -
EMOS and US$1 million for ESVAL. Contracts of less than US$100,000 would be
procured directly on the basis of a minimum of three quotations and subject
to a maximum aggregate of US$2 million for EMOS and US$0.5 million for
ESVAL. For purposes of bid comparison, Chilean manufacturers of equipment
would be entitled to preferences of 15 percent or the applicable tariff,
whichever is lower. A summary of procurement by method is as follows:

45.       The EMOS and ESVAL projects would be completed by December 31, 1991
and December 31, 1990, respectively, and the closing dates would be December
31, 1992 and December 31, 1991, respectively. The proposed loans are ex-
pected to be disbursed on the basis of: (i) 50 percent of total expenditures
for civil works and locally-manufactured goods; (ii) 50 percent of total ex-
penditures for local consultant services; and (iii) 100 percent of foreign
expenditures for equipment, materials and consultant services. Disbursements
would be made against Statements of Expenditure (SOE) for eligible expendi-
tures and contracts valued at under US$500,000 equivalent. Supporting
documentation would be retained by EMOS/ESVAL and made available for review
during project supervision. All other disbursements would be made against
normal documentation submitted to the Bank.
46.       In order to improve the timeliness oG  disbursements and thereby the
availability of funds, at the request of the two companies, the Bank would
make an advance payment from the respective loan accounts into Special Ac-
counts for EMOS and ESVAL to be opened and maintained in US dollars in the
Central Bank or any commercial bank in the United States acceptable to the
Bank. The funds would be used to reimburse EMOS and ESVAL for the Bank's
share of project cost, as well as to effect direct payments in foreign cur-
rency. The total amount in each of the Special Accounts would not exceed a
figure that is about four months of estimated average disbursements for each
respective project (about US$4 million equivalent for the two projects com-
bined).

Project Executing Agencies
Institutional Profile of EMOS
47.       EMOS is a public agency responsible for providing water and sewer-
age services to most of Santiago and small neighboring municipalities
(para. 28). The President of Chile appoints EMOS' General Manager, who re-
ports directly to the Minister of Publi^ Works. The General Manager is in
principle empowered to appoint all employees but in practice the approval of
the Minister of Public Works is required. EMOS has some 1,600 employees, who
are in general adequztely qualified at all levels.
48.       EMOS' billing and collection management is proficient but opera-
tions and maintenance, management information systems, personnel management
and training need to be strengthened. To improve productivity in these
areas, the project would provide technical assistance, implement a training
program and introduce new technology. These actions would enable EMOS to re-
duce the unaccounted for water from 32 percent in 1984 to 26 percent in
1990. Moreover, they would enable EMOS to maintain a ratio of no more than
2.5 employees per 1,000 water connections while increasing the efficiency,
quality and coverage of water supply and sewerage services under the project.
49.       EMOS is a financially sound company.  It has satisfactorily fi-
nanced its investment program under Loan 1832-CH during 1980-1985. During
1980-1982, investments were small and EMOS accumulated substantial cash sur-
pluses which it invested at the high interest rates that prevailed in Chile
in those years. By the end of 1982, EMOS' excess cash balances amounted to
about CH$800 million, which it used during 1983 and 1984 to finance the cash
shortfalls caused by increasing levels of investments. EMOS was able to hold
tariffs down through control of personnel costs and efficient collection of
receivables. Effective January 1985, to ensure a satisfactory cash flow,
the Government increased EMOS' tariffs by 35 percent, some 10 percentage
points above the 1984 inflation rate.
50.       During execution of the proposed project (1986-1992), EMOS plans
total investments equivalent to US$231 million, including US$128 million of
investment costs and capitalized interest for the Bank-assisted project. To
finance these investments, EMOS will need to cover a minimum of 55 percent of
its investment costs out of its internal cash generation. Agreement was
reached that EMOS would generate for each year funds from internal sources
equivalent to at least 55 percent of the annual average of its capital ex-
penditures incurred or expected to be incurred for that year, the previous
year and the following three years. Before September 30 of each year, EMOS,
on the basis of projections satisfactory to the Bank, would review whether it
would meet that financial requirement for at least the current and the fol-
lowing year, and would promptly take any necessary measures to meet such re-
quirements. Compliance with the proposed cash generation/capital expendi-
tures covenant translates into a rate of return of about four percent, which
is consistent with EMOS' long-range expansion requirements.
51.       It is estimated that for EMOS to generate sufficient funds from in-
ternal sources during 1986-1992, it needs to increase gradually its tariffs
by about 40 percent in real terms. To achieve this overall increase, EMOS
has: (i) increased tariffs 15 percent effective November 1, 1985; (ii) ob-
tained legal authorization to increase tariffs automatically whenever the in-
dex of EMOS' costs increases by 3 percent or more; and (iii) obtained



- 15 -
government authorization to increase tariffs in real terms by 10 percent in
1986, 10 percent in 1987 and 13.4 percent in 1988. As present tariffs are
very low, resulting tariffs will still be affordable to the low-income popu-
lation.
52.       While adequate tariffs are the key to successful project financing,
further improvements in EMOS' overall operating performance are expected. To
help improve the monitoring of operating performance, it vas agreed that EMOS
would provide the Bank regularly with sufficient information to monitor key
performance targets agreed with the Bank.
53.       In some years, it is likely that EMOS will have significant cash
surpluses because of the discrete nature of investment expenditures. As
these cash surpluses will be needed for subsequent investments, agreement was
reached that EMOS would continue to be allowed to retain them to finance its
investment program (a covenant that exists under Loan 1832-CH).
Institutional Profile of ESVAL
54.       ESVAL's institutional arrangements, including appointment of em-
ployees, are similar to those of EMOS (para. 47). ESVAL has some 900 em-
ployees. While the total number is reasonable, the staff composition is im-
balanced with an insufficient number of qualified middle managers and tech-
nicians. Moreover, ESVAL needs to upgrade the uneven quality of its staff
through selective appointments and training. Deficiencies in ESVAL's manage-
ment systems compound staffing deficiencies.
55.       ESVAL needs to upgrade its capabilities for project planning and
execution and substantially improve its operational and maintenance facil-
ities, its commercial operations and management information systems. ESVAL's
installations are rundown because of inadequate operations and maintenance
and, to a lesser extent, lack of funds. Inefficient commercial practices
compound the problem of unaccounted for water which is currently high,
running at about 50 percent. Moreover, ESVAL's management information and
control systems are inadequate. To address these problems, ESVAL plans a
number of actions which are being developed in collaboration with the Bank
and include technical assistance, training, reorganization and upgrading of
staff and appointment of qualified staff for key operational positions.
These actions would enable ESVAL, inter alia, to reduce unaccounted for water
to 40 percent by 1989.
56.       ESVAL's financial situation has been weak for years.  The average
tariff (which was US$0.11/m3 in 1984) has been maintained at a level just
sufficient to cover operating costs. Thus, ESVAL has deferred needed main-
tenance and investments and has been chronically short of working capital
In the past, Government reluctance to let ESVAL raise tariffs and inefficient
cash planning accounted for ESVAL's poor financial performance.
57.       Mainly because of inadequate tariffs, ESVAL's financial situation
continues to be weak. Emergency loan funds from IDB and the proposed loan
would provide some 71 percent of the US$24 million of total investments to be
carried out under the earthquake reconstruction program in 1985-1988. As the
IDB project works are fully financed by IDB loan funds and Government trans-
fers, ESVAL will only need to increase internal generation of funds to pro-
vide for its operating requirements and counterpart funds for the Bank-
assisted project. To this end, it was agreed that ESVAL would maintain



- 16 -
tariffs sufficient to cover operation and maintenance expenses, debt service,
working capital needs and its 45 percent contribution to finance investments
in the Bank-aso3sted project. Before September 30 of each year, ESVAL, on
the basis of projections satisfactory to the Bank, would review whether it
would meet those financial conditions in the current and the following three
years, and promptly take the necessary measures to meet such conditions at
least for the current and the following year.
58.       The covenanted 45 percent contribution to the project from internal
funds aims at enabling ESVAL to recover from the earthquake, meet the finan-
cial requirements of its 1986-1988 investment program and to be in an accept-
able financial situation in 1989. ESVAL would revise its financial perform-
ance targets in line with a long-range investment program to be developed in
1986-1988.
59.       Compliance with the above-mentioned cash generation covenant, as
portrayed in the financial projections, is predicated on adequate tariffs and
on improvements in ESVAL's operating performance. To be able to contribute
to the financing, ESVAL needs to increase tariffs in real terms by about 20
percent by late 1986. It plans to introduce that increase in early 1986.
ESVAL would also monitor tariffs closely to ensure that they appropr-ately
reflect changing costs. To help improve the monitoring of operating perform-
ance, it was agreed that ESVAL would provide regularly sufficient information
for the Bank to monitor agreed key performance targets.
60.       ESVAL might have significant cash surpluses in some years which
would be needed to cover investments in subsequent years. It was agreed that
ESVAL would be allowed to retain cash surpluses for the financing of invest-
ments in subsequent years.
Auditing and Reporting
61.       EMOS' and ESVAL's financial statements would be audited by inde-
pendent auditors satisfactory to the Bank. The auditors' reports would be
sent to the Bank no later than six months after the close of each fiscal
year. EMOS and ESVAL would also furnish to the Bank by February 28 and
August 31 of each year an evaluation report on progress made in the execution
of their respective projects and on the monitoring indicators for the prior
semesters ending June 30 and December 31.
Justification for the Santiago Project
62.       Least-Cost Solution.  The Santiago project sewerage components fol-
Low the Master Plan's (May 1984) recommendations for the phased development
of the sewerage system in the Santiago Metropolitan Region. Both the sewer-
age Master plan and water supply studies, completed in August 1983, provided
the basis for detailed integrated feasibility studies. Based on an analysis
of several alternatives, the works selected represent the least-cost solution
at discount rates of between 8 percent and 17 percent. Particular importance
was also given to optimal timing, design horizon and staging.
63.       Health Benefits and Environmental Impact.  The incidence of the
various diseases related to inadequate sewage disposal has been documented in
Chile and internationally as the source of a major health and environmental
problem. Data show that: (i) the occurrence of typhoid attributed to the
inadequate disposal and use of raw sewage for vegetable irrigation in
Santiago is almost double that of the country as a whole and is three times
that of the rest of the country when Santiago is excluded; (ii) inadequate



- 17 -
sewage disposal has substantially cut down on the traditional recreational
uses of water courses in the Santiago Region and endangers the health of
those who live and/or work along the banks of the water courses; and (iii)
disregard of the environment would have detrimental effects on Santiago's
budding tourist industry, which has a considerable potential for further de-
velopment.
64.       The proposed sewerage component is a crucial first phase of the
rational implementation of solutions to address the discharge and use of un-
treated sewage in Metropolitan Santiago. At completion of the first phase,
the Metropolitan Area will begin to be rid of the obnoxious odor and unsight-
ly conditions resulting from the major water courses serving as open sewers
in the city. Completion of the sewerage development program will result in,
among other benefits, substantial savings in health care, benefits from
recreational uses of water courses and use of less polluted water for irriga-
tion.
65.       Economic and Social Impact.  The proposed Santiago project is fully
justified in economic terms as it represents the expanded use of existing
capacity, yields relatively high returns (although many benefits have been
underestimated and others that cannot be quantified reliably, excluded from
calculations) and improves efficiency through the rehabilitation of infra-
structure and better operation of facilities. During the five year major
construction period (1987-1991), it will provide about 16,000 man-years of
local employment. The project also has a high social impact in that 80 per-
cent of the beneficiaries of new extensions would be the urban poor. Because
of the nature of the works to be undertaken, economic rates of return (ERRs)
have been calculated for various project components both without and with
relevant sunk custs, and for the total project.
66.       The weighted average ERR for the Santiago project based on the exe-
cution of the water supply works, sewerage collection networks, and addition-
al connections, which directly increase sales (covering 50 percent of total
project cost), is 16 percent. When the analysis takes into account the
applicable water supply investments and associated benefits from Loan
1832-CH, the ERR of the proposed project is 17 percent.  All ERR analyses
exclude costs and benefits of technical assistance and maintenance equipment,
which would improve water pressure, sewerage and water services to present
consumers and provide benefits which are not reflected by the incremental
volume sold. The cost of these items is, however, small (7 percent of total
cost of the Santiago project). A rate of return was not calculated for
interceptors and pilot treatment facilities (34 percent of total project
cost) because these investments would not result in new connections or sales;
benefits would accrue to society as a whole and do not lend themselves to a
reliable ERR analysis.
67.       Average Incremental Costs.  Average Incremental Cost (AIC) for the
Sartiago water supply components was calculated separately using an 11
percent discount rate. The AIC for water is Ch$11.45/m3 which is 55 percent
higher than the present tariff (Ch$7.40/n3 including IVA) and slightly lower
than the projected average 1987 tariff levels (Ch$11.67/m3 including IVA)
expressed in December 1984 prices.
68.       Beneficiaries, Urban Poverty Impact and Afford&,ility.  Because of
the characteristics of some of the works (improvement in water pressure,
operating efficiency, etc.), direct benefits of the Santiago water supply



- 18 -
component would accrue to virtually the total population served by EMOS.
EMOS' and the Government's target is to serve all inhabitants through house
connections, eliminating discrimination in the quality of service. Without
the water supply component, the population served through house connections
would be reduced from about 90 percent in 1985 to 81 percent in 1992. At the
end of 1993, the component would serve about 830,000 more people than at
present. Sewerage secondary connections and networks would serve about
810,000 more people. Sewerage interceptors and pilot treatment facilities
would benefit the population as a whole by abating pollution and reducing
health risks. The impact of these investments will continue to increase as
complementary works are completed.
69.       An estimated 47 percent of the cost of the Santiago project will
directly benefit the poor, while about 80 percent of the beneficiaries of
both the water supply component and sewerage secondary networks and connec-
tions will be the poor. The poverty group is defined as families earning a
monthly monetary income of less than Ch$6,500 (on an annual 'asis, this cor-
responds to about 30 percent of the national per capita income); in December
1984 prices. Affordability of water supply and sewerage services was evalu-
ated assuming 1984 tariffs under the current tariff structure. Based on a 15
mm connection and a "lifeline monthly consumption of 10m3, a poor family
spends about Ch$116.2 for water and sewerage, representing about 1.8 percent
of family income.
Justification of the Valparaiso Project
70.       The justification of the Valparaiso emergency project (12 percent
of total cost of both projects) is based on the need to rehabilitate and re-
construct damaged facilities. Therefore, ERRs have not been calculated.
The population served by ESVAL (about 500,000 people) would as a whole bene-
fit from the reconstruction of the damaged facilities and the operational im-
provements envisaged. The large majority of the beneficiaries are expected
to be the urban poor, given the characteristics of the city.
Project Sensitivity, Risks and Safeguards
71.       Sensitivity.  There is a high degree of certaintv that the two pro-
jects will provide the desired benefits and will be implewented properly.
The ERRs are only moderately sensitive to pronounced adverse variations in
costs, benefits, and project implementation delays.
72.       Risks and Safeguards.  The major risks in the case of the Santiago
project relate to the timeliness with which land acquisition, expropriations
mid compensation and the obtaining of municipal permits are undertaken.
These actions, however, are well advanced and the time required for them was
taken into account in phasing project execution. In the case of the
Valparaiso project, the timeliness of future tariff action is the main risk.
The Government's commitment to having financially independent service enti-
ties in the sector substantially mitigates this risk. Regarding both pro-
jects, the risk also exists that notwithstanding the cash flow positions of
EMOS and ESVAL, changing fiscal requirements at a national level could result
in lower total budget authorizations for the two companies than those re-
quired. The Government, however, attaches high priority to the two pro-
jects.
