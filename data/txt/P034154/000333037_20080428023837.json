The present project, Rehabilitation of\n            berths 5 & 6 includes repair of a collapsed section of\n            the existing quay, establishment of a new quay section with\n            12 meters water depth, dredging and reclamation. The project\n            further includes clearing of part of the port area and\n            provision of new cargo handling equipment. The berth\n            rehabilitation is assumed to lead to a slight increase in\n            the water circulation within the port. The construction of\n            berths will cause minor temporary impacts but will not cause\n            lasting damage to the marine environment. The material to be\n            dredged is suitable for reclamation purposes and free from\n            contamination of heavy metals. The possibility of spillage\n            during dredging and reclamation shall be minimized by the\n            use of a suction dredger, installation of a sheet pile wall,\n            and a survey and subsequent removal of all unexploded\n            ordinances. Residents within port boundaries will be\n            resettled into adequate alternative housing. The port will\n            establish improved procedures for handling and storing\n            hazardous and noxious cargo. Facilities are suggested to\n            handle ship waste. An oil spill contingency plan will be\n            drawn up and recovery equipment procured. Negative impacts\n            includes: air, water quality, and oily wastes. (a) the main\n            mitigation measures here are to carry out maintenance and\n            repair work on vehicles and machines in dedicated areas with\n            sealed surfaces and water treatment facilities, and to store\n            fuels, lubricants and chemicals in safe places away from\n            water; (b) use only adequate and well maintained\n            construction and transportation equipment including diesel\n            fuel of good quality. The reduction of particulate (soot)\n            emitted by diesel engines is by far the most efficient\n            measure for keeping the air pollution low; and  (c) oil is a\n            common form of pollution that could cause a lot of damage in\n            areas of noted sensitivity. As such, steps should be taken\n            to ensure that it is not released into the sea or allowed to\n            seep into the ground. These measures include the bunding of\n            stored oils, the use of biodegradable oils and the provision\n            of waste oil reception facilities (or oil banks). It is\n            important that where water quality endangering liquids are\n            handled for any purpose, the methods employed meet accepted\n            standards for health, safety and the environment. A\n            continuous regimen of maintenance and technical monitoring\n            of processes is highly recommended to ensure that problems\n            are identified early on, thus minimizing the risk of oil\n            accidentally entering the sea or ground."}, "docdt": "2008-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
