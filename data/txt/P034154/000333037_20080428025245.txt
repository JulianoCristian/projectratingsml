Executive Summary

A Fire Risk Assessment and Training Plan has been prepared for the Front End Engineering Design
(FEED) Phase of the new jetty project for Massawa, Eritrea. This document will then be updated
during the system definition phase of the project.

Central to the Fire Risk Assessment and Fire Training Plan are the identification of fire locations
along the new jetty and the fire types that can occur due to the products being offloaded at
Massawa.

This fire risk assessment is based upon the fire locations provided in the original base data and the
fact that LPG and a range of white products and black products are to be offloaded.

Statistical release sizes during product offloading operations have been obtained from international
data based upon vessel sizes which will offload at Massawa. This data may be seen in Appendix A.

The physical properties of the products to be offloaded (in particular the flammability data and
recommended firefighting methods for small, large and huge fires) at Massawa have been obtained
from representative Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), which are given in Appendix B.

The causes, consequences and a coarse risk assessment for these fire types, sizes and locations
has been documented in the Hazard Register given in Appendix D. Also on this register is
documented the design and operational safeguards that have been detailed in the FEED documents.
The impact of the safeguards on the raw risk levels is seen by the resulting level of residual risk. The
recommended actions for the Massawa Jetty Fire Team to tackle the fires are then documented.
This semi-quantitative risk assessment has been the result of table top exercises at EPConsult's
London offices, and it is recommended that operations personnel become familiar with the register
and participate in keeping the document up to date so as to become familiar with the process of
control of major accident hazards.

Given that huge fires are associated with product storage and not jetty operations per se, two
matrices are produced in the document, which give for small and large fires at the locations identified
for the jetty, the relevant firefighting approach, equipment, media and personal protective equipment.

Thus the resulting FEED level firefighting training plan is seen to be hazard based and proportionate.
It is then a short step to design the training segments and refreshers and the manning requirements
of the fire team for the new jetty.

This FEED level fire risk assessment and fire training plan raises the following design issues, which
may be in consideration:

     · Windsocks are provided for the new jetty for LPG releases.
     · Leak detection devices are considered for offloading product.
     · The possibility of providing passive fire protection for the slops tank should be considered if
          this does not constitute corrosion under insulation risk.

     · Passive fire protection should be considered for critical shutdown valves and ESD initiation
          stations.

     · Strict no smoking and speed restrictions should be in force on the jetty.
     · All work on the jetty should be subject to the appropriate permit to work, including electrical.
     · Water sprays, including for personnel protection should be considered for confirmed gas
          release.

     · A fixed inert gas / fresh water spray system should be considered for the electrical switchgear
          room and the firewater pump house due to gas oil fuel and electrical supply the fire pumps.

     · Passive fire protection is considered for the roadside and piperack-side walls of the firewater
          pumphouse, with a fire rated wall between the switchgear room and the firewater pump
          house. Consideration should be given to providing passive fire protection to the roof of this
          building.

     · Consideration should be given to locating each fire water pump in a separate pump house on
          the jetty.

     · Clearly flanges should be minimized in this area.
     · Consideration should be given to the option of providing foam induction at hydrants, with
          drums of foam stationed along the jetty.

     · Hose reel cabinets to be provided with the necessary lengths of hose, couplings and nozzles.
     · Spare firefighting BA to be provided on the jetty.
     · Careful design, construction and siting of the operator huts.

It is recognized that many of these measures cannot be considered without cost benefit analyses,
and thus it is recommended that this document is revised in the next engineering phase so as to
provide the basis for doing this.

This document should be read in conjunction with the companion Oil Spill Risk and Contingency
Plan.

1 Introduction


1.1 General


The existing jetty at Hirgigo Bay, Massawa will be demolished and removed and will be replaced with
a new jetty. New pipelines will run along the jetty to tie-in to the existing tank farm. A future project
will increase the storage capacity of the tank farm by installing additional tanks.
The existing petroleum jetty serves the Hirgigo Power Plant, the Shell Petroleum depot and the
Erigas depot. The existing petroleum jetty was constructed by Italians in the 1930's and is in very
poor condition and now which requires replacement. The Department of Maritime Transport (DMT)
has commissioned Royal Haskoning to produce a preliminary design to replace the jetty. The jetty is
of strategic value to Eritrea and so the existing jetty will be kept operational while the new jetty is
under construction and will not be decommissioned and demolished until the new jetty is operational.
Figure 1 gives the location of Massawa on the map of Eritrea.

3      Scope of Work and Objectives


3.1 Scope of work
The scope of work of this document is to:
1)     Conduct a qualitative risk assessment of fires occurring at points along the new jetty import
       route through consideration of the hydrocarbon products that will be imported across the new
       jetty and the size of each fire.
2)     For each fire at each location on the jetty import route, identify the safeguards and equipment
       required to prevent, detect, control, mitigate against and recover from each fire.
3)     From this, derive a firefighting training plan for the new jetty that is hazard based.


3.2 Objectives

The objective of this document is to produce a firefighting training plan for the new jetty facilities. For
the fire training plan to be proportionate and applicable to the new jetty facilities, it is hazard based.

That is to say, the scope of the firefighting training is based on the fire types, fire sizes and fire
locations that can be expected along the new jetty import route; and the firefighting equipment that
has been scoped and identified for the new jetty facilities.

The plan will also be risk based in that the relative importance and hence duration of a given training
segment will be determined by the assessed likelihood of occurrence of a particular fire type. A
preliminary assessment of this is given in the Hazard Register in Appendix D. This document gives
the basis for such training segments.

4      Facility Overview


4.1 Existing Jetty and Pipelines

There are three pipelines running the full length of the Jetty as follows:

       · 10" Fuel Oil line;
       · 10" White Product line (gasoline, gas oil and jet fuel/kerosene);
       ·     6" LPG line.

The lines run along the seabed at the seaward end the end of the Jetty. Both the white product and
the LPG seabed lines end in fixed manifold connections on the dolphin. The fuel oil line is connected
to an 8" flexible submarine hose and the end is hoisted to a vessel at a marker buoy located to the
seaward of the dolphin.

All lines are located on roller type or Y-type shoe supports. The pipe work and fittings are reported
generally in reasonably condition but pipe supports are in poor condition.


4.2 New Jetty and Pipelines

The proposed new Jetty will be located to the south of the existing Jetty as shown in Figure 1.3). The
new Jetty is proposed to be a total length of 1125m, of which 625m will be built as a rock bund with
500m as a concrete trestle to support the pipelines to the unloading platform. The requirements for
the new Jetty are as follows:

     · The existing Jetty will remain in operation throughout the construction of the new Jetty.
     · The new jetty will be designed to receive a 50,000 DWT vessel.
     · The new jetty will be able to handle a wide range of oil products.
     · A new 16" Fuel Oil line will be installed along the full length of the new Jetty and will run to
          the boundary of the existing Tamoil terminal with a spur to the boundary of the Hirgigo power
          plant.
     · A new 16" White Products line will be installed along the full length of the new Jetty and will
          run to the boundary of the existing Tamoil terminal.
     · A new 8" LPG line will be installed along the full length of the new Jetty and will run to the
          boundary of the existing Erigas terminal.
     · Provision will be made for a future additional pipeline for bitumen.
     · The new Jetty will be equipped with fire fighting equipment.


A composite drawing of the new Jetty is given as Figure 5.1. This figure has been constructed from
facility layout drawings of the new jetty given with the Feasibility and Preliminary Design Report.   [1]




4.3 Firefighting Equipment for New Jetty
Fire fighting and fire prevent equipment will be provided for the hazardous zones around the vessels
and along the new Jetty. A water spray will be provided to enable escape of personnel from the jetty

Equipment layout of the new Jetty facilities will include the following preventive safeguards against
unignited and ignited releases:

     · Good natural ventilation to provide for rapid dissipation of vapours to prevent build up of
          flammable pockets and atmospheres;

     · Protection of piping and equipment by barriers against vehicle collisions;
     · Automatic product transfer isolation devices and leak detection instrumentation.

Sea water will be the main medium for fire fighting and will be supplied by a sea water pumphouse
that will be located on the new Jetty at least 50m away from the Jetty head. Firewater pumping will
consist of one automatically controlled electrically driven main fire pump and one automatically
controlled gas oil driven fire pump as standby. Small pressure losses due to minor leakage will be
made up with a submersible self priming centrifugal Jockey pump.

A high voltage sub station will be located adjacent to the fire pump house outside the hazardous
area associated with the jetty transfer lines and gas oil supply to the standby firewater pump.

The firewater mains will be located on the pipe rack spanning the whole length of the Jetty. Pillar
type wet-barrel above ground hydrants will be connected to the firewater main along the Jetty and
will be spaced no more than 80m apart.            Each hydrant will have two hose reels with nozzle
connections located in an accessible cabinet close to the hydrant.

Two manually controlled firewater/foam monitors will be located on towers with sufficient height to
project a firewater / foam spray on to a berthed vessel and the Jetty head. The firewater / foam
monitors will be incorporated with a water spray to protect the operator platforms and monitor tower
from fire and heat radiation. It will also provide for a means of escape.

Additional equipment will be provided for first aid fire fighting. This equipment includes:

· Fire Extinguishers;
· Fire buckets;
· Fire Trailer with monitor;
· Hand foam extinguisher;
· Portable firewater / foam monitor;
· Mobile foam extinguisher.

This equipment will be additional to the fixed firewater / foam monitors and will be positioned in the
new Jetty buildings and along the new Jetty span for fighting small fires.

At the new Jetty head, Fire Alarm activation devices and Fire Alarms (both visible and audible) will
located at regular intervals and at convenient locations.

Telecommunication facilities will be provided for day to day operations. In the event of an
emergency, contact will be made with the local emergency services. In addition to the Fire Alarms,
operators will be able to activate the firewater pumps, to stop product transfer pumps and to arrest
product transfer. These emergency shutdown facilities will be located remote from the valve and
pump locations.

A sprinkler system will be provided along the pipe rack to cool pipes and to protect against fire
exposure for escaping personnel.

The new Jetty roadway will be accessible to local emergency service trucks/ fire engines to attend to
the Jetty head in the event of fire, with piping and the firewater pump house being protected by crash
barriers. Fire main manifold facilities will be available at the Jetty head for the provision of fire water
to the fire trucks. Figure 4.1 gives the fire fighting and fire prevention equipment for the new Jetty.

Good housekeeping and the prevention and quick clean up of releases and spills of product are key
to the prevention of fires. The Port of Massawa has oil spill recovery equipment, which is stored
close to the main berth areas. This equipment includes:

· skimmer pump;
· 200m inflatable harbour booms;
· a self propelled barge for the collection of recovered oil; and
· various other pieces of clean up and spill response equipment.

For the new Jetty, in the event of a spill, the recovery equipment will be launched from the Jetty head
and installed/operated by a local work boat. The recovery equipment consist of a floating boom to
contain the spillage and a skimmer device, which separates the spilled product from the sea water,
recovers and delivers the residues to slops tank. This equipment will be stored at the rear of the
jetty head so that it will be readily accessible. It will also be reachable by firefighting equipment.

5      Hazard Identification


5.1 General

This section outlines the hazard identification review conducted for the new Jetty. The potential
causes and consequences of releases of product during unloading operations along the new Jetty
have been identified and documented on to a hazard register, which is given in Appendix D. For
each ignited release scenario, which can involve LPG, White Product and Black Product, a coarse
qualitative risk ranking is given and the firefighting equipment required to tackle each of these fires is
documented.

Depending on the product being handled, a range of fire types are possible ranging from pool fires,
jet fires, flash fires and possible explosions.

This hazard register serves to link the firefighting equipment to the identified ignited releases, which
will provide the hazard based context to the firefighting training plan.


5.2 Location of Ignited Release

Based on the Feasibility and Preliminary Design Report , the following release locations have been
                                                                  [1]

identified as a potential cause of fire hazards:

              A. Vessel entering and leaving the harbour.

              B. Fire on the surface of the sea, beneath or around the seaward end of the Jetty
                 resulting from a spillage of petroleum products in a vessel moored.
              C. Fire on the seaward end of the Jetty offloading hoses resulting from a spillage and
                 subsequent ignition of petroleum products.
              D. Fire at any point of the connections during discharge:

                      a. Quick Connect / Quick Disconnect;
                      b. Flange or seal;
                      c. Valve.
              E. Fire at the slops tank.

              F. Fire along the pipeline rack from:

                      d. Fractured pipe;
                      e. Leaking Valves;
                      f.   Flange or seal leaks.
              G. Fire on the roadway surface arising from vehicle impacts.

              H. Fire in the electrical switchgear room/ operator hut facilities.

              I. Fire at seawater pump house.


The location of these ignited releases are given in Figure 5.1, which is a composite diagram
constructed from facility drawings of the new Jetty, given with the Feasibility and Preliminary Design
Report.    [1]


The hazard register given in Appendix D details which fire types have the potential to exist at each
location and the consequences of these fire types. The register given in Appendix G of the Oil Spill
Risk and Contingency Plan            [4] also provides similar details for unignited releases, which translate to
spills and vapour clouds. Both these registers derive from a source hazard register.

5.3          Preliminary Fire Risk Assessment

The following table gives an indication of the statistical release sizes encountered during tanker ship
and port operations. The statistics would in general apply to the loading of product on to tanker ships
as opposed to the unloading of product across the jetty, but are considered to give a good indication
of the release sizes (and hence fire sizes) likely to be encountered at Massawa.

A closer analysis in Detail Design, which addresses the following aspects, would confirm these
volumes, release rates and their frequency of occurrence, but for FEED, the following figures, when
taken in conjunction with the coarse risk assessment are applicable.

              oil




5.4 Safeguards to minimize spill sizes

The minimization of release volumes will be achieved by the provision of the recovery tank
underneath the loading arms beneath the Jetty head deck. The use of Quick Connect Disconnect
Couplers and integral isolation valves on the end of the loading arms will reduce the amount of the
spillage caused during the separation of the two mating flanges.

Fire Alarms, Gas detection and Fireproof Communications systems will be provided as the first step
to dealing with release, both ignited and unignited.

6         Firefighting Training Plan


6.1       General Training Requirements for All Staff

All personnel assigned to new Jetty operations at Massawa should receive a basic grounding in the
HS&E aspects of the operation. Such basic induction should include workshops for staff and should
deal with such topics as:

     · Products handled and physical properties;
     · Basic first aid;
     · Basic firefighting using hand held extinguishers;
     · Incident reporting and STOP programmes;
     · Permit to Work System and safe systems of work;
     · Task Risk Assessments and Hazard Identification;
     · Environmental impact.

A register should be kept of all personnel who attended the course, and bi-annual refresher sessions
should be scheduled for staff.


6.2       General Training Requirements for Fire Safety Staff

This training segment will commence with the basic HS&E induction segments given above in
Section 5.1. It will also include the participation in:

· Process and Electrical HAZOPs;
· HAZIDs.

The purpose of this will be to provide a grounding in HAZOP and HAZID techniques as well as
maintain live hazard registers (as given in Appendix D) as a first step in developing risk assessment
skills and attaining a COMAH type culture at the new Jetty.

Also fire safety staff should attend a week long course at a municipal fire station, so as to become
proficient in:

· Choice and use of appropriate extinguishing mediums;
· Fire and combustion theory;
· Use of hydrants and monitors with and without foam.
· Use of hose reels;
· Isolating fuel sources (including electrical);
· Use of fire team BA sets.
· Rescue skills and first aid.
· Team work and working in pairs

Once proficiency has been attained in these basic grounding courses, staff will move on to fire
location training at the new jetty, which will have a practical element and a written element.

This should be backed up by weekly muster drills and fortnightly exercises, for night shift staff as well
as day shift staff.

6.3 Training Plan for Fighting Small Fires

Jet Fires and Residual LPG Fires

Residual LPG fires can occur along the length of the new Jetty and should be tackled directly using a
handheld portable foam extinguisher or a dry chemical powder extinguisher.

It is important that only a residual LPG fire should be tackled in this way. A small LPG jet or spray
fire should not be extinguished as this will release unignited product to the atmosphere, which if
allowed to accumulate in a confined area and in concentrations between the LEL and the UEL, could
ignite causing a flash fire.

Thus a small jet fire should be allowed to burn itself out under controlled conditions, so as to avoid
explosive re-ignition. This will include ensuring that the jet fire is not directed towards a product line,
an escape route, a building (including the firewater pump house), pollution control equipment or
other firefighting equipment.

Every effort should be made to shut-off the fuel to the fire. Deflector shields should be used to
redirect a small jet fire and water spray cooling should be deployed on an impinged product line,
either with a fixed water spray system or with a hose reel attached to a fire hydrant with a spray
nozzle affixed.

Small jet fires should not be tackled by personnel not trained specifically to tackle such fires. The
firefighting training programme for members of the fire response team should include a segment in
tackling small jet fires.

It is important to keep LPG from flowing into drains and to ensure all jetty systems are correctly
bonded to earth so as to avoid electrostatic discharges and fire.

Fire team members should not expose themselves to any smoke from a small jet fire, and should
ensure they are wearing fire retardant coveralls, gloves and helmet. Goggles should be worn. It
should not be necessary to don full firefighting PPE, but this remains the decision of the on scene
commander.

It is important that an unignited release of LPG is detected quickly and unloading operations stopped
quickly and the wind direction established via reference to the windsock.

Gasoline Fires

Gasoline fires can occur along the length of the new Jetty and should be tackled directly using a
handheld portable foam extinguisher, a dry chemical powder extinguisher, a Carbon dioxide fire

equipment) or using the mobile foam extinguisher.

An unignited spill of gasoline will result in the liberation of flammable vapour, which if allowed to
accumulate in a confined area and in concentrations between the LEL and the UEL could ignite
causing a flash fire.

Every effort should be made to shut-off the fuel to the fire and the area around a container involved
in a fire should be isolated.

It is important to keep gasoline from flowing into drains and to ensure all jetty systems are correctly
bonded to earth so as to avoid electrostatic discharges and fire.

Fire team members should not expose themselves to any smoke from a small fire, and should
ensure they are wearing fire retardant coveralls, gloves and helmet. Goggles should be worn. It
should not be necessary to don full firefighting PPE, but this remains the decision of the on scene
commander.

All tanker trucks / bowsers brought on to the jetty will be suitable for operation in the hazardous
areas established for the jetty, have their cigarette lighters removed and be equipped with a Carbon
dioxide extinguisher and water fire extinguisher.

Electrical Fires
Small electrical fires are to be tackled with portable Carbon dioxide extinguishers by the fire
response team and are to be tackled with the advice of the Responsible Person Electrical so as to
ensure that the power supply has been correctly and positively isolated.
Additional PPE may be required to protect fire team members from the hazards of electrical shock
and the RPE should be consulted.
Cellulosic Fires
Small cellulosic fires are to be tackled using portable water extinguishers, fire buckets and hose
reels connected to the fire hydrants. These types of fires should not occur on the jetty, as all
matches, cigarette lighters and other sources of ignition will not be permitted on the new Jetty, which
will also be a non-smoking area.
All electrical equipment and hot surfaces will be suitable for the hazardous zones established for the
new Jetty and a berthed tanker vessel.
A risk assessment will be completed to determine whether the switchgear room and fire water pump
house walls and ceilings require to have hydrocarbon pool fire rating (H). It is possible, but unlikely
that the walls of these buildings facing the pipework (which should not be flanged in this area) will
require to be rated to withstand jet fires (J) due to the low manifold pressures.
It likely will be the larger pool fires that will determine the fire rating of these walls.


6.4 Training Requirements for Fighting Large Fires

Jet Fires and Residual LPG Fires

In the first instance large LPG releases must be prevented through:
     · Cleaning up the spill quickly using rapid dilution if necessary;
     · Maintaining the integrity of pipework and fittings;
     · Flange management;
     · Careful driving of tanker trucks and strict adherence of the speed limit on the new Jetty;
     · Maintenance of crash barriers to protect piping and the firewater pump house.
Secondly, the leak must be detected through:
     · Alert new Jetty operations personnel raising the alarm and acting;
     · The possible use of coupling position indicating alarms;

Petroleum Jetty ESIA                                                               Date March 25, 2008

     · The detection of LPG vapours.
Thirdly, should a leak occur it must be controlled immediately through:
     · Shutting down the pumped import of product;
     · Providing quick and effective segmentation and isolation of the source of the leak.
Then the leak must be mitigated by:
     · Attempting to contain it;
     · Diluting it with firewater;
     · Good natural ventilation.
In order to prevent ignition, the following measures must be in place:
     · The strict control of the hazardous area classification on the new Jetty, through carefully
          controlled modifications to design that might occur on the jetty;
     · The strict control of permitted work on the new Jetty, allowing no work to occur without the
          correct permit;
     · Strict controls on the suitability of mobile plant, vehicles, hand tools and power tools on the
          jetty in relation to the hazardous areas;
     · Ensuring that ship shutdown and new jetty shutdown systems and communications are
          connected;
     · Ensuring that good bonding and earthing is applied to a discharging ship.
     · A strictly observed no smoking policy;
     · The condition of personnel's PPE is in good order and of the appropriate type, particularly
          boots.
LPG vapour may be ignited rapidly when exposed to heat, spark, open flame or other source of
ignition. When mixed with air and exposed to ignition source, flammable vapours can burn in the
open or explode in confined spaces. Vapours may travel long distance to an ignition source and
flash back.
It is prudent to initiate water spray equipment, particularly on personnel escape routes along the jetty
on detection of gas or release of LPG, provided the equipment is well bonded to earth, as it is
becoming established practice that release of water spray will mitigate against the creation of a
flammable atmosphere.

Residual LPG fires can occur along the length of the new Jetty and should be tackled directly as per
gasoline fires or small residual LPG fires.

It is important that only a residual LPG fire should be tackled in this way. A large LPG jet fire should
not be extinguished as this will release unignited product to the atmosphere, which if allowed to
accumulate in a confined area and in concentrations between the LEL and the UEL could ignite
causing a flash fire.

Thus a large jet fire should be allowed to burn itself out under controlled conditions, so as to avoid
explosive re-ignition. This will include ensuring that the jet fire is not directed towards a product line,
an escape route, a building (including the firewater pump house), pollution control equipment or
other firefighting equipment.

Every effort should be made to shut-off the fuel to the fire. Deflector shields should be used to
redirect a jet fire and water spray cooling should be deployed on an impinged product line, either
with a fixed water spray system or with a hose reel attached to a fire hydrant with a spray nozzle
affixed.

Jet fires should not be tackled by personnel not trained specifically to tackle such fires. The
firefighting training programme for members of the fire response team should include a segment in
tackling jet fires.

It is important to keep LPG from flowing into drains and to ensure all jetty systems are correctly
bonded to earth so as to avoid electrostatic discharges and fire.

Fire team members should not expose themselves to any smoke from a small fire, and should
ensure they are wearing fire retardant coveralls, gloves and helmet. Goggles should be worn. It is
important that an unignited release of LPG is detected quickly and unloading operations stopped
quickly and the wind direction established via reference to the windsock.

It is recommended that a windsock is installed in a prominent location at the new Jetty.

Gasoline Fires

1) Large gasoline fires can occur along the length of the new Jetty and should be tackled with the
utmost caution and only by qualified and trained members of the fire team using the appropriate
equipment and PPE.
In the first instance large gasoline releases must be prevented through:
     · Cleaning up the spill quickly using rapid dilution if necessary;
     · Maintaining the integrity of pipework and fittings;
     · Flange management;
     · Careful driving of tanker trucks and strict adherence of the speed limit;
     · Maintenance of crash barriers to protect piping and firewater pump house.
Secondly, the leak must be detected through:
     · Alert new Jetty operations personnel raising the alarm and acting;
     · The possible use of coupling position indicating alarms;
     · The detection of gasoline vapours.
Thirdly, should a leak occur it must be controlled immediately through:
     · Shutting down the pumped import of product;
     · Effecting quick and effective segmentation and isolation of the source of the leak.
Then the leak must be mitigated by:
     · Attempting to contain it;
     · Diluting it with firewater.

     · The strict control of the hazardous area classification on the new Jetty, through carefully
          controlled modifications to design that might occur on the jetty;
     · The strict control of permitted work on the new Jetty, allowing no work to occur without the
          correct permit;
     · Strict controls on the suitability of mobile plant, vehicles, hand tools and power tools on the
          jetty in relation to the hazardous areas;
     · Ensuring that ship shutdown and new jetty shutdown systems and communications are
          connected;
     · Ensuring that good bonding and earthing is applied to a discharging ship.
     · A strictly observed no smoking policy;
     · The condition of personnel's PPE is in good order and of the appropriate type, particularly
          boots.
The effect of a fire is mitigated by ensuring redundancy and fire proofing of communication and fire
and gas cables.

open or explode in confined spaces. Vapours may travel long distance to an ignition source and
flash back.
2) For a major gasoline fire on a berthed ship or at the jetty head, the following equipment should be
started automatically and should be checked as being operational by trained personnel:
     · Firewater pumps and salt water fire main and fire main distribution system;
     · Foam generation tank and header.
As a result, the following fire fighting equipment will be available for use:
     · Fire water foam monitor towers;
     · Fire hydrants and fire hose cabinets;
     · Water spray and water fog spray.
Fire team personnel should don:
     · Full firefighting personal protective equipment including respiratory equipment;
and should ensure:
     · Their escape route is secure through the deployment of water sprays at the fire monitor tower
          and back along the jetty;
     · They are not working alone;
     · The alarm has in fact been raised and product transfer has in fact stopped.
Support should arrive in the form of:
     · The fire trailer with monitor;
     · Portable foam monitor;
     · The deployment of shipboard firefighting systems.
An incident team must be set up, allowing for relief of fire team members and provision of medical
attention as required.
3) If the major gasoline fire occurs along the length of the jetty as opposed to the jetty head, then the
fire water monitor towers will not be available, and the fire should be tackled with:
     · The fire trailer with monitor;
     · portable foam monitor;
     · Fire hydrants and fire hose cabinets;
Bearing in mind that water may not be effective against gasoline fires, personnel should also ensure
that:
     · The water spray is being successfully applied to the pipeway to effect skin cooling;
     · A possible spray fire or jet fire is not directed across the road;
     · A possible spray fire or jet fire does not impinge directly on neighbouring pipework;
     · A possible spray fire or jet fire does not impinge directly on the wall of the electrical
          switchgear room, the firewater pump house or the operator huts.
4) Recommendations: the following additional measures should be considered:
     · The possibility of inducing foam at the fire hydrants;
     · Strategic location of firefighting foam drums along the jetty;
     · Spare firefighting PPE at the jetty;
     · Passive fire protection of the firewater pump house walls and roof;
     · Passive fire protection of emergency shut-off valves at the jetty.

the fire water monitor towers will not be available, and the fire should be tackled with:
· The fire trailer with monitor;
· portable foam monitor;
Bearing in mind that water may not be effective against kerosene fires. personnel should also ensure
that:
· The water spray is being successfully applied to the pipeway to effect skin cooling;
· A possible spray fire or jet fire is not directed across road;
· A possible spray fire or jet fire does not impinge directly on neighbouring pipework;
· A possible spray fire or jet fire does not impinge directly on the wall of the electrical switchgear
     room, the firewater pump house or the operator huts.
4) Recommendations: the following additional measures should be considered:
· The possibility of inducing foam at the fire hydrants;
· Strategic location of firefighting foam drums along the jetty;
· Spare firefighting PPE at the jetty;
· Passive fire protection of the firewater pump house walls and roof;
· Passive fire protection of emergency shut-off valves at the jetty.
Jet ­A1 Fires
1) Large Jet-A1 fires can occur along the length of the new Jetty and should be tackled with the
utmost caution and only by qualified and trained members of the fire team using the appropriate
equipment and PPE.
In the first instance large Jet-A1 releases must be prevented through:
     · Cleaning up the spill quickly using rapid dilution if necessary;
     · Maintaining the integrity of pipework and fittings;
     · Flange management;
     · Careful driving of tanker trucks and strict adherence of the speed limit;
     · Maintenance of crash barriers to protect piping and firewater pump house.
Secondly, the leak must be detected through:
     · Alert new Jetty operations personnel raising the alarm and acting;
     · The possible use of coupling position indicating alarms;
     · The detection of Jet-A1 vapours.
Thirdly, should a leak occur it must be controlled immediately through:
     · Shutting down the pumped import of product;
     · Effecting quick and effective segmentation and isolation of the source of the leak.
Then the leak must be mitigated by:
     · Attempting to contain it;
     · Diluting it with firewater.
In order to prevent ignition, the following measures must be in place:
     · The strict control of the hazardous area classification on the new Jetty, through carefully
          controlled modifications to design that might occur on the jetty;
     · The strict control of permitted work on the new Jetty, allowing no work to occur without the
          correct permit;
     · Strict controls on the suitability of mobile plant, vehicles, hand tools and power tools on the
          jetty in relation to the hazardous areas;

     · Ensuring that ship shutdown and new jetty shutdown systems and communications are
          connected;
     · Ensuring that good bonding and earthing is applied to a discharging ship.
     · A strictly observed no smoking policy;
     · The condition of personnel's PPE is in good order and of the appropriate type, particularly
          boots.
The effect of a fire is mitigated by ensuring redundancy and fire proofing of communication and fire
and gas cables.
Jet-A1 vapour may be ignited rapidly when exposed to heat, spark, open flame or other source of
ignitions. When mixed with air and exposed to ignition source, flammable vapours can burn in the
open or explode in confined spaces. Vapours may travel long distance to an ignition source and
flash back.
2) For a major Jet-A1 fire on a berthed ship or at the jetty head, the following equipment should be
started automatically and should be checked as being operational by trained personnel:
· Firewater pumps and salt water fire main and fire main distribution system;
· Foam generation tank and header.
As a result, the following fire fighting equipment will be available for use:
· Fire water foam monitor towers;
· Fire hydrants and fire hose cabinets;
· Water spray and water fog spray.
Fire team personnel should don:
· Full firefighting personal protective equipment including respiratory equipment;
and should ensure:
· Their escape route is secure through the deployment of water sprays at the fire monitor tower
     and back along the jetty;
· And they are not working alone;
· The alarm has in fact been raised and product transfer has in fact stopped.
     Support should arrive in the form of:
· The fire trailer with monitor;
· portable foam monitor;
· The deployment of shipboard firefighting systems.
An incident team must be set up, allowing for relief of fire team members and provision of medical
attention as required.
3) If the major Jet-A1 fire occurs along the length of the jetty as opposed to the jetty head, then the
fire water monitor towers will not be available, and the fire should be tackled with:

Electrical Fires
It is not expected that large electrical fires can take hold at the new Jetty. Electrical switchgear
rooms are fitted with fixed CO2 systems, with manual release at the outside of the entrance.
More recently, Innogen or equivalent systems have been used, due to the concentrations and
harmful effect of a CO2 release on personnel.
A fixed Innogen or equivalent system should be considered for the electrical switchgear room


Cellulosic Fires
Large cellulosic fires are to be tackled using hose reels connected to the fire hydrants. These types
of fires should not occur on the jetty, as all matches, cigarette lighters and other sources of ignition
will not be permitted on the new Jetty, which will also be a non-smoking area.


6.5 Training Requirements for Fighting Huge Fires
Huge fires are associated with storage tank fires, both at Massawa and on the vessel itself. Storage
Tank fires at Massawa are outside the scope of this document, but could involve retreating and

leaving the storage tank fire to burn itself out. Emergency services from the municipality would be
called in as would federal assistance. It would also be important to pass advice to inhabitants in the
local area to stay in doors until further notice to minimize the ingestion of smoke and harmful
products of combustion.
A huge fire could occur on the tanker vessel due to fire in the storage compartments. There would be
little the new Jetty could do in this situation apart to bring the fire monitor towers to bear if the vessel
was within reach, but it is expected that the heat radiation would overcome the operators even with
the water spray providing protection to personnel; thus the approach would be to retreat and to
generally act in a support role.
Thus the new Jetty fire response effort should not be designed to tackle these huge fires.

·       Parcel sizes for white product (Gas oil, Kerosene & Gasoline) are based on a maximum vessel
        size of 50,000 tonne vessel (DWT).
·       White product will be delivered in a single vessel (70% Gas oil, 20% Kerosene & 10%
        Gasoline).
·       Parcel sizes for fuel oil are based on a maximum vessel size of 30,000 tonne vessel (DWT)
·       Delivery pressure at the vessel manifold will be a minimum of 7 bar for white product, 10 bar for
        fuel oil and 16 bar for LPG.
·       Minimum required inlet pressure at the storage tank is 1.5bar for white product and fuel oil and
        7.5 bar for LPG.

·      Elevation difference between the Jetty head and the storage tank inlet will not exceed 2m.
·      Lay time should not exceed 36 hours.
·      Product discharge time should not exceed 31 hours, excluding connection, sampling,
       paperwork and unberthing.
·      All the tanks in the Tamoil tank farm are bounded sufficiently to contain the oil product in the
       event of catastrophic rupture of the tanks.
·      Any small oil spills onshore should be contained by a team using a dike made of sand. Drip
       trays should be covered with a non-porous medium and have a dike around them. Cleanup
       should be with a sorbent such as `Speedy Dry', sorbent pads or boom.


A.3          Gathered Data

A.3.1        Climate Conditions

The climate conditions are based on the wind and wave data for Red Sea, Gulf of Aden Pilot and the
data purchased from BMT.

For the operational conditions in these waters, the one minute mean wind speed with a return period
of 10 years was estimated to be 25m/s. Rarely does the wind speed exceed 25m/s, and in this case,
the vessel will not be at berth and will ride out the storm at anchor.

The relevant wave directions for the project site are East and Southeast. The operational conditions
of a three hours storm with return periods of 10 years and 100 years were used for the design
conditions.

A.3.2        Design Vessel and Sizing of Pipeline

The existing facility is limited by water depth and storage capacity at the oil terminal. These
considerations restrict the vessel size to a length of 176m and a draught of 8.7m. This corresponds
to a fully laden 16,000 DWT vessel or vessels with DWT of slightly over 25,000 tonne which are
partially laden. The smallest vessel using the terminal is the LPG tanker (2,266 tonne and 71.2m
length) Mereb Gas with a cargo of pressurised LPG sailing under the Eritrean flag.

In the Red Sea there are two routing transport systems used for the transport of oil products:

·      Direct supply via shuttle tankers that have a direct service between the port of export and the
       port of import. There are two shuttle routes: one from the port export to Massawa; and the
       other from port to Djibouti with a weighted average of 817 nautical miles (817x 1852m)
·      Multi port routing where a vessel sails a route from the port of export, calling at a number of
       import terminals and finally sailing back to the export terminal. The vessels will sail a route
       from the export terminal via Djibouti and Massawa back to the export terminal. The total length
       of this route is 1635 nautical miles.

Massawa is currently served by both routing scenarios. It is proposed that a 50,000DWT tanker
would be the maximum design vessel; and the existing LPG carrier will be used as the minimum
design vessel unloading product at Massawa.

A.3.3        Product Storage Capacity

The oil products are currently distributed by; ExxonMobil, Total and Tamoil. Total is in the process of
acquiring the ExxonMobil assets and business, which will give Total a 70% share of the overall
market. Tamoil will have the remaining 30% of the market share. Shell sold their local assets and
business to Tamoil. Shell still has an oil depot in Assab.

The following bulk oil products are currently imported in Eritrea:

· Regular (i.e. leaded) gasoline;
· Jet-A1;
· Kerosene;
· Gas oil;
· Fuel oil;
· LPG.

The total annual import ranges from 20,000 tonnes to 250,000 tonnes. The import volumes are
based on monthly forecasts which depend on the following factors:

· Oil demand;
· Daily stock reports;
· Oil purchase price;
· Economic development;
· Availability of foreign currency.

Figure A-1 shows the historic throughput of oil product. Gas oil is the oil product most in demand.

The existing Jetty has four storage facilities at Massawa as follows:

· Tamoil depot (7 tanks);

· Total/Mobil storage facility (9 tanks);
· Erigas LPG depot (2 spherical tanks);
· Hirgigo Power plant storage facility 9.

The future storage capacity is proposed to not be less than 1.5 to 2 times the tanker ship parcel size.

The Hirgigo Power plant 15,000 m3 fuel oil storage capacity is adjacent to the Tamoil tank farm. It is
also reported that sometimes the vessels discharge more than the available storage capacity. In
such cases road tankers are loaded simultaneously as the vessel is discharging. These are taken to
contain on average 20 tonnes of product. (i.e. non-articulated bowsers).

 Class I           Liquids that have flash points below 21oC

 Class II (1)      Liquids that have flash points from 21oC up to and including 55oC, handled below flash point

 Class II (2)      Liquids that have flash points from 21oC up to and including 55oC, handled at or above flash point

 Class III (1)     Liquids that have flash points from 55oC up to and including 100oC, handled below flash point

 Class III (2)     Liquids that have flash points from 55oC up to and including 100oC, handled at or above below flash point

The Institute for Petroleum area classification code for discharge facilities is as follows:

· Jetty with only discharge operation without loading facilities including ballasting other than to
     vapour-free segregated ballast tanks, then the vent of flammable vapours will not take place
     during discharging operations. It is
· Recommended that Zone 2 classification should be an area extending from the hull horizontal
     distance of 20m in the landward direction up to 10m height above the Jetty deck and down to
     water. Where berths are restricted to barges, coaster or other Vessels with discharge rates that
     do not exceed 10m3/min then the above distance may be reduced to 5m horizontally
· If ballasting is carried out during discharge into un-segregated vessel's tanks which could contain
     vapours or if vent of tanks is carried out along side the Jetty then the Jetty should be classified in
     accordance with discharging and loading facilities.

Guidance note GS40 of the HSE recommends the following for separation distance:

· Adequate separation should be maintained between cargo transfer facilities and boundaries,
     occupied buildings (exception with small shelters), storage tanks and fixed sources of ignition.
     This is significant for liquefied gases such as LPG and liquids with flash point below 21oC.
     Where it is practicable at least 20m separation and it could be increased to 30m for boundary
     and distances between ships. For passenger ferries and their associated assembly areas, a
     distance of 75m is recommended.

D.1 Definitions


Flash Fire

Flash fires may occur due to a release of a flammable gas between its flammability limits. Generally
speaking, the majority of clouds which are ignited do so at their edge as they disperse and meet a
strong source of ignition such as naked flame, sparks, internal combustion engine etc. Then the
combustion flame spreads back to the release point.

Vapour Cloud Explosion

This usually takes place in partially confined or congested areas, and it is also known as flash fire
explosion or fuel air explosion. The flame spreads at subsonic velocity, so the overpressure damage
is usually negligible and the bulk of the damage comes from thermal radiation, direct flame contact
or secondary fires.

Pool Fire

A pool fire occurs when a spill of flammable liquid is ignited. A pool fire may also occur on the
surface of flammable liquid spilled onto water or as a trench fire in a vessel tank containing
flammable liquid.

Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosion (BLEVE)

BLEVE explosions are classed as extremely hazardous, and usually occur when a vessel containing
a pressurized liquid is ruptured. An example of such kind of explosion will be a vessel containing
LPG which is a gas at atmospheric pressure but liquid when pressurized.

A BLEVE does not require a flammable substance, and therefore is not usually considered a type of
chemical explosion. However, if the substance involved is flammable, it is likely that the resulting
cloud of the substance will ignite after the BLEVE has occurred, forming a fireball and possibly a
VCE.

Jet Fire

Jet fire results from the combustion of a material as it is being released from a pressurized process
unit. The main concern is in thermal radiation effect and erosional action of the tip.

All the above fire types have the potential to exist during normal operation of the port facilities.

Other Fires

In addition the following fire types also can occur:

     · Electrical fires in the switchgear room;

     · Fires of combustible (i.e. cellulosic) materials in operator huts.

The following section gives more details regarding what fire types can occur during port operations.
