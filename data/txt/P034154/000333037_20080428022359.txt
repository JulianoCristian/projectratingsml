EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

              The present ESIA was done according to the TOR given to the Consultant, the
              Technical Proposal prepared by the Consultant and the Contract signed by the Client
              and the Consultant, dated October 17, 2007. The aim of the study was the preparation of
              an independent Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Study (ESIA) for the
              project of a new Petroleum Jetty in Hirgigo Bay, Massawa, Eritrea, which shall replace
              the existing jetty; the latter is not considered to be safe for use any longer. The Project is
              classified as a Category A Project according to World Bank OP 4.01 as well as
              according to Eritrean EIA Guidelines, meaning that a full impact assessment study nees
              to be carried out.

              The Study had to be made according to Eritrean as well as World Bank standards.
              Chapter 2 describes the institutional and legal framework for the present study. The
              most relevant legal document is the Eritrean document entitled National Environmental
              Assessment Procedures and Guidelines, enacted in 1999, which describes the
              procedures to be followed for such studies. No major inconsistencies have been found
              between this document and the relevant WB standard defining EIA procedures (WB OP
              4.01).

              The Project is described shortly in Chapter, 3 as well as the project area; project
              description is based on the technical documents, mainly the Feasibility Study and
              Preliminary Design Report (RH 2006). Project location is Hirgigo Bay, south of the
              town of Massawa, the most important harbour of the country. The project consists in a
              new jetty which will replace the existing one, built in the 1930ies by the Italians. This
              structure is now in a very bad state (see Photos in Annex 17 of the Report), and presents
              an increasing risk of a major accident to happen. The possibility of rehabilitating this
              existing structure in a way that would allow its continued use was ruled out in the
              feasibility study, and alternatives were developed and compared to replace it. The
              feasibility study identified first three locations for the new jetty (north and south of the
              existing jetty, and on Taulud Island). This last option was ruled out in an early stage and
              is not investigated any further in the present Report. Initially, the feasibility study
              identified 6 alternatives at the two remaining locations. Later on, a seventh alternative
              was added, with an intermediate location (south of the existing Jetty, but closer to it).
              The main characteristics of the 7 alternatives are shown in Table 1.

                 Alternative 7 was first selected as the most favourable one on economic grounds, but
                 was later on abandoned due to a risk of interference with the cooling water intake
                 structure of the existing Hirgigo Power Plant. Finally, Alternative 3 was selected as the
                 most favourable alternative technically and economically. This alternative was
                 developed further by the Design Consultant in parallel to the ESIA study.

                 As a first step of the ESIA, a comparative environmental analysis of the 7 alternatives
                 had to be done; this is described in Chapter 4. For a number of environmental
                 indicators, impact values were attributed to the various alternatives, on a range of -3
                 (very strong negative impact) over 0 (no or negligible effect) to +3 (very strong positive
                 effect). From these evaluations, a first ranking of the alternatives was made. Alternative
                 3 (the preferred alternative technically and economically) resulted as the preferred
                 option from this evaluation.

                 Since most differences of impacts between the alternatives are small, and since the
                 impacts as such were mostly classified as small, it was somewhat questionable whether
                 this result was very reliable. For this reason, for a number of indicators a ranking was
                 made, of the type "although impacts are small, Alternative x is still somewhat better
                 than Alternative y, because...". This led again to an overall rank of the 7 alternatives. In
                 addition, a sensitivity analysis was carried out by attributing different weights to
                 different indicators.

                 In this analysis, Alternative 3 consistently ranked first, while the others, to some extent,
                 changed position depending on the weights attributed to different indicators. The main
                 arguments against the other alternatives were:

                      · Longer jetty, and especially longer rock bund, leading to more impact on sea bed
                         habitats (Alternatives 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7).

                      · Dredging required, and through this again risk of a negative impact on sea bed
                         habitats, mainly on coral reefs, through mobilisation of sediments (Alternatives
                         1, 2, 4, 5 and 7).

                      · Interference with cooling water intake of Hirgigo Power Plant (Alternative 7).

                      · Higher risk of pipeline leakages remaining undetected for prolonged periods,
                         and potentially much larger amount of oil spilled in case of a pipeline rupture,
                         due to entirely submarine pipelines (Alternative 6).

                 The conclusion of this analysis was that Alternative 3 is indeed the preferable one. This
                 alternative, the only one which is analysed further, is described in some detail in
                 Chapter 5, again based on the technical documents and information received from the
                 Design Consultant. The main features of this option are summarised in Table 2.

                 One of the Tasks for this study was stakeholder involvement. A number of stakeholders
                 were listed as such in the TOR, additional ones have been identified by the Consultant
                 during the study. All of these stakeholders were contacted at least once during the study
                 period, some of them several times, in order to inform them about the Project and to
                 obtain comments and input data. Towards the end of the study period, two stakeholder
                 workshops were held, one in Asmara and one in Massawa, where the results of the
                 study were presented and discussed (Chapter 6).

                 The following Chapters are devoted to the impact assessment of this preferred
                 alternative. The results can be summarised as follows:

Massawa Port Authority                                                           PÖYRY ENERGY LTD.
Petroleum Jetty ESIA                                                             Date March 25, 2008
ESIA Final Report                                                                Page D


              Land use: no impacts will be noted in this respect, since there is no alternative land use
              there now, nor is there any real possibility for using this land alternatively. It is a
              designated industrial area, of no tourist or cultural and historical interest whatsoever
              (Chapter 7).

              Air Quality and noise: impacts will occur due to the construction activities, the most
              important of which will be due to transport of material through residential areas of
              Massawa town. However, given the volume and duration of these activities, effects will
              still be within accepted air quality and noise standards. Nevertheless, it is recommended
              to do the necessary for keeping the impact as low as possible. This can best be done by
              a good maintenance of the vehicles (mainly to prevent unnecessary air pollution) and a
              careful planning of transports (to prevent unnecessary driving of lorries and heavy
              equipment) (Chapter 7).

              Water quality: as mentioned above, the main risk in this respect stems from the oil
              spill risk, which is considerably larger now as it is expected to be with the new jetty.
              The second most important source is the flushing of pipelines, which will remain the
              same as it is now unless dedicated pipelines are installed. In addition to this, there will
              be some, albeit limited, impacts on water quality due to construction activities. These
              should be minimised in the extent possible. The main mitigation measures here are to
              carry out maintenance and repair work on vehicles and machines in dedicated areas with
              sealed surfaces and water treatment facilities, and to store fuels, lubricants and
              chemicals in safe places away from water (Chapter 7).

              Waste: the most noticeable amount of waste will be generated by the removal of the
              existing jetty. This material will have to be brought to a suitable dumping site. Most of
              the material will be suitable for being reused (the pipelines as piping for different
              purposes or as scrap steel, like the iron reinforcement of the jetty structure, and the
              concrete material and bricks form the jetty itself as filling material in road construction
              or similar). It is recommended to use this material in this way, if the jetty is demolished.
              The other relevant amount of waste is water contaminated with oil products, stemming
              from flushing the pipeline used for white products. This effect will persist with the new
              jetty, it could however be eliminated by having dedicated pipelines for the white
              products (Chapter 8).

              Coast and sea bed dynamics: The situation at the project site is described. Due to its
              location in the bay, which is in addition shielded by a number of islands, wind and wave
              action are generally very weak. The currents are weak as well, sediment transport,
              erosion and accumulation processes are minimal. Given this situation, the project will
              not have any noticeable effect on wave action, currents and sediment transport. Changes
              in sedimentation and erosion will be very small and very localised, if any at all. Specific
              mitigation measures in this respect are not required (Chapter 9).

              Oil spill and fire risks: an Oil Spill Risk Assessment and Contingency Plan and a Fire
              Risk Assessment and Fire Training Plan had to be prepared as part of the assignment.
              These aspects are dealt with in this Report only very briefly (Chapters 10 and 11); the
              plans are provided as separate documents (Vol. 2 and Vol. 3) of the ESIA Study.

              Health: health risks will arise, in the amount to be expected at construction sites of this
              size, due to risks of accidents and the risk of transmitting of communicable diseases in

Petroleum Jetty ESIA                                                            Date March 25, 2008
ESIA Final Report                                                               Page E


              the work force. The contractor will have to take the usual precaution measures (safety
              equipment, training of workers, health checks, information and health services) in order
              to minimise risks and to deal with accidents and illnesses that might occur. The one
              overall public health risk presented by the project is the one which might be caused by a
              major oil spill. The risk of this happening will be greatly reduced by the new jetty
              (Chapter 12).

              Biodiversity: the impacts on biodiversity (mangroves, sea grasses and sea weeds, coral
              reefs, marine fauna and birds) are caused mainly (i) by building the rock bund for the
              new jetty (permanent destruction of habitat, temporary impact on surrounding habitats
              through mobilised sediments), (ii) by general construction activities (presence of work
              force; noise; risk for water contamination; fishing), and (iii) by all activities related to
              demolishing the old jetty (construction and removal of platform, removal of jetty as
              such). The latter impact is likely to be more important than the one caused by the new
              jetty. Although overall determined as rather small impacts, and some of them (like
              sediment mobilisation) of a temporary nature, mitigation measures are recommended
              for minimising the impacts to the strict minimum (Chapter 13).

              Socio-economy: the project effects, overall, are positive. Given the site and its
              characteristics, the project does not cause any resettlement, there is no need for
              expropriation, and no limitation of access to resources. The effect on local fisheries will
              be negligible, if any (small indirect impact possible through impacting fish populations
              due to sediment mobilisation, but reduction in risk of much larger impact that would be
              caused by a major oil spill). On the other hand, there is some potential for jobs being
              created on the construction site (although on a temporary basis), and it is expected that
              the regional economy as a whole will benefit from the project (Chapter 14).

              Given its potential impacts, the entire Chapter 15 is dedicated to the question of removal
              of the existing jetty. According to the feasibility report, demolishing the old jetty will
              require the construction of a "platform" (similar to the rock bund for the new jetty)
              along the old one over its entire length of about 760 m, and a crown width of about 10
              m, to allow the use of cranes and other heavy machines for the work. After the removal
              of the old jetty, this platform will in turn also have to be removed again. This procedure
              will have a considerably larger negative effect on sea bed habitats than the construction
              of the new jetty, by directly destroying a seabed surface similar to the one needed for
              the new jetty, destroying the habitat which has formed, over the 70 years of its
              existence, on the submerged parts of the jetty and the rubble mound supporting it, and
              by damaging additional habitat through sediment mobilisation by building the platform,
              demolishing the jetty and then removing the platform again. Since there is no need,
              whether from environmental, aesthetic, land use or economic reason, for actually
              removing the existing jetty, it is recommended to remove the pipelines (including the
              submarine parts) and the dolphin, possibly remove the part of the jetty close to and
              accessible from land in order to make it less accessible for unauthorised persons, but to
              leave the remainder of it untouched. This would not only save costs, it would also
              reduce the impact on the marine environment.

              Finally, Chapter 16 provides a synopsis of the main impacts and the recommended
              mitigation measures. The main conclusions are the following:

Petroleum Jetty ESIA                                                            Date March 25, 2008
ESIA Final Report                                                               Page F


                  · The overall major environmental benefit of the project consists in the fact that
                     the environmental risk presented by the danger of a major oil spill caused by the
                     decaying structure of the existing jetty will be, not completely eliminated, but
                     reduced to acceptable standards.

                  · The construction of the selected alternative of the new jetty at the chosen site
                     will cause some impacts, all of which, however, are small and of no further
                     relevance. Furthermore, some of them can be reduced by applying suitable
                     mitigation measures. Overall, the advantage resulting from abandoning the
                     exiting jetty prevails.

                  · The demolition of the existing jetty causes impacts which are at least of the same
                     magnitude, but probably considerably larger, than those caused by the new jetty.
                     Given this, and in the absence of a stringent reason for removing this structure, it
                     is recommended not to demolish it.

              The recommended mitigation measures are described to some more detail in the EMP
              (Vol. 4 of the ESIA Study).

1             INTRODUCTION


1.1           Scope of the Study

              The scope of the study was defined in the TOR prepared by the Client; the full text of
              the TOR is provided in Annex A1 for reference.


1.2           Contractual Framework

              Following reception of the RFP dated April 9, 2007, the Consultant proceeded to
              prepare his Proposal, which was submitted to the Client before the deadline of May 11,
              2007, as stated in the RFP.

              On September 3, 2007, the Consultant received an invitation for contract negotiation
              (dated August 31), to be held in Asmara on September 14, 2007. Travel arrangements
              were made immediately and the representative of the Consultant arrived in Asmara on
              September 12. Contract negotiations were held in MPA's Project Coordination Office in
              Asmara, and the Draft Contract was signed on September 15, 2007.

              On October 16, 2007, the Consultant was informed by MPA that the No Objection to
              the Contract had been received from World Bank.


1.3           Study Development

              The work on the study officially started on October 23, 2007, with the arrival of the
              ESIA Team Leader in Asmara, and was carried out according to the revised work plan
              as given in the Inception Report (see Annex A1.3).


1.4           The ESIA Team

              The Consultant's ESIA Team consisted of the experts who were originally presented in
              the Consultant's Proposal and accepted by the Client. Annex A1.4 provides some
              additional information on the organisation of the team.


1.5           Structure of the Report

              The ESIA Report is structured as follows:

              After the Introduction follow a number of Chapters giving some kind of background
              information: Chapter 2 describes the institutional and legal framework for the present
              study. Chapter 3 describes the project and, shortly, the project area; project description
              is based on the technical documents, mainly the Feasibility Study and Preliminary
              Design Report (RH 2006).

              A comparative analysis of the 7 alternatives is done in Chapter 4. The preferred
              alternative, the only one which is then analysed further, is described in some detail in
              Chapter 5, again based on the technical documents and information received from the
              Design Consultant.

              Chapter 6 describes the way of involvement of the stakeholders. This includes all the
              stakeholders who were listed as such in the TOR, but it includes also a number that have
              been identified by the Consultant.

              The following Chapters are then devoted to the impact assessment of this preferred
              alternative. Chapter 7 deals with project impacts on the physical (abiotic) environment,
              i.e. with aspects of land use, air quality, water quality and noise. Waste management is
              described in Chapter 8. Chapter 9 deals with the coastal environment and sea bed
              dynamics, and potential effects of the Project on them, mainly concerning currents,
              erosion and sedimentation. Chapters 10 and 11 contain short summaries of the Oil Spill
              Risk Assessment and Contingency Plan, and the Fire Risk Assessment and Fire
              Training Plan; these two subjects, given their bulk, are presented as separate volumes,
              Vol. 2 and Vol. 3, respectively. Chapter 12 deals with public health issues related to the
              project, which in this case are mainly issues concerning the construction phase. Chapter
              13 describes the situation concerning biodiversity and potential project effects,
              focussing on marine biodiversity. The socio-economic situation in the project area and
              its surroundings as well as project impacts on socio-economy are the subject of Chapter
              14. Given its potential impacts, the entire Chapter 15 is dedicated to the question of
              removal of the existing jetty. Finally, Chapter 16 gives a synopsis of expected impacts,
              their importance and proposed mitigation measures; this chapter forms the basis for the
              EMP, which again is a separate document (Vol. 4).

              The Annex is structured in the same way as the main text of the Report, meaning that
              there is an Annex for each chapter of the report, numbered A1 to A16, for easy
              reference. Some of these Annexes are empty; in this case "No entry on this page" is
              mentioned. There are two additional Annexes, A17 (Photos) and A18 (List of
              References).

2             ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK


2.1           Eritrean Environmental Legislation


2.1.1         Background

              The environment and natural resources of Eritrea have been subjected to a considerable
              degree of degradation arising from the thirty years of war, prolonged periods of drought
              and resource constraints and an inappropriate and often inadequate policy and legal
              framework. In order to redress this situation, the Government of Eritrea, in cooperation
              with its development partners, has highlighted the management of the environment and
              natural resources as a priority area.

              The Government's determination to tackle the environmental and natural resources
              degradation can be seen in various key policy documents, efforts at legislative reform
              and development partner programmes, which are either ongoing or proposed, in the
              field of environmental and natural resources management. The concern for the
              environment and its proper management can be traced to the period immediately
              following the independence of Eritrea in 1993.

              In 1997, Eritrea adopted a new Constitution, which was ratified by the Constituent
              Assembly on 23rd of May 1997. Article 8(3) stipulates that the State "shall be
              responsible for managing all land, water, air and natural resources and for ensuring their
              management in a balanced and sustainable manner, and for creating the right conditions
              to secure the participation of the people in safeguarding the environment". This is the
              basic legal text for environmental protection in the country.


2.1.2         Key Legal Texts

              The main key policy documents and draft laws so far in place include

                  · The Government Statement on Macro-Policy (1994).

                  · National Environmental Management Plan (1995).

                  · Eritrean Constitution (1997) ­ provides the basis for sustainable development, in
                     particular in its Article 8, Paragraph 2, and Article 21, Paragraphs 1 and 2.

                  · National Environmental Assessment Procedures and Guidelines (1999).

                  · National Biodiversity Strategy Action Plan (NBSAP) (2000).

                  · National Action Programme to Combat Desertification and Mitigate the Effects
                     of Drought (NAP) (2001).

                  · Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (2003).

2.1.3         EIA Regulation

              In 1999, the Ministry of Land, Water and Environment (MOLWE) issued the National
              Environmental Assessment Procedure and Guidelines (NEPAG), a system of EIA
              procedures and guidelines, which is the most important legal document in the context of
              the present study. Through a process of project screening, the NEPAG divides projects
              into three levels of environmental analysis, depending on the expected environmental
              impact of the project, applying similar categories as the Work Bank in its EIA
              guidelines:

                  · Projects hat do not involve major physical changes to the natural environment
                     will be approved without any delay for EIA (Category C).

                  · Larger projects which are likely to have known impacts on the environment, but
                     for which well understood and cost effective mitigation measures to reduce these
                     impacts are available, have to undergo an environmental evaluation by means of
                     a questionnaire, to ensure that the project design and operation will be
                     appropriate to Eritrean conditions (Category B).

                  · For large-scale projects which are likely to significantly impact upon the
                     environment a full EIA has to be carried out, co-ordinated by the DOE. All
                     environmental issues must be considered and approved before permission can be
                     granted (Category A).

              The Ministry of Land, Water and Environment (MOLWE), and particularly its
              Department of Environment (DOE) is the authority responsible for determining the type
              of development that requires an environmental appraisal and the level of detail at which
              the study should be conducted. According to the criteria defined in the NEPAG, a
              project like the Petroleum Jetty Project in Massawa falls within the category "A",
              meaning that a full ESIA ha to be carried out and submitted to the Port Authority, the
              Department of Environment and other competent administrative authorities. The
              Environmental and Social Impact Assessment has to follow standards set by the World
              Bank's Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook (1998), in addition to the World
              Bank's Operational Policies.


2.1.4         Other Relevant Texts

              In November, 1994 the Government published its statement on Macro-Policy. The
              document stated that the Government's overriding national development objective is the
              creation "of a modern, technologically advanced and internationally competitive
              economy". But it also listed, among the national development objectives, "an upgraded
              and safeguarded environment that is free from pollution".

              Subsequently, in 1995 the Government published the National Environmental
              Management Plan (NEMP) for Eritrea. This was described as "the blueprint for
              coordinating the protection and enhancement of Eritrea's natural resources, so that
              optimal social and economic development can be achieved in consonance with the
              rational and sustainable use of these resources, for the current as well as future
              generations".

Petroleum Jetty ESIA                                                             Date March 25, 2008
ESIA Final Report                                                                Page 5


              The National Environmental Management Plan comprises four parts. Part A considers
              the environmental and developmental prospects for Eritrea, and examines the
              connection between population, resources and the environment. Part B addresses the
              major environmental and development issues confronting Eritrea under diverse
              headings as follows: public health, human settlements, coastal and marine resources,
              industry, waste management, water resources, land and soils, rangeland and livestock,
              forest resources, natural heritage and biological diversity, energy, and mining. With
              respect to each item it puts forward proposals for action. Part C of the Plan defines
              major steps and responses involved in an integrated environmental and development
              planning process, while Part D examines the requirements for implementation of the
              Plan.

              There are also specific areas which are known as Environmentally Sensitive Areas
              (ESA) which require greater attention. ESAs are areas which are noted for their natural
              and socio-cultural characteristics or areas which would pose significant risk to normal
              operating activities (e.g. seismic activities). In Massawa, the sensitive areas include the
              old town area (cultural heritage), Green Island (coral reef and biodiversity) Khor
              Dakliyat Bay (mangroves and mud flats) and Hirgigo Bay (mangroves and coral).

              In 2000 the Government published the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan
              for Eritrea. This sought to build upon the Government's previous commitment to
              broader environmental protection, as contained in the 1995 National Environmental
              Management Plan. It identified the niche for biodiversity related activities as lying
              within the policy framework for sustainable economic development. Consequently, as
              environmental activities already formed a prominent part of the Government
              development policy, the Plan would seek to integrate and coordinate the activities to
              increase their effectiveness for biodiversity conservation, rather than to replace or add to
              them.

              In 2002 the Government published the National Action Programme for Eritrea to
              Combat Desertification and Mitigate the Effects of Drought (NAP). This noted that land
              degradation is probably the most critical problem facing Eritrea. NAP is intended to be
              the country's co-ordinating mechanism for arresting land degradation. It incorporates
              long term strategies to combat desertification, which should be integrated with national
              policies for sustainable development. The actions identified entail both policy and
              institutional measures to facilitate the establishment of an enabling environment at
              national level for sustainable resource use, as well as local level development activities
              to preserve and restore the resource base and improve the livelihood security of affected
              populations.

              Most recently, in March 2002, the Government published the Country Assessment
              Report on Sustainable Development: Rio + 10. This identified the challenges of
              sustainable development facing Eritrea as being lack of human resources, limited
              physical infrastructure, limited institutional capacity and shortage of capital to finance
              development programmes. The policy document also identified "national critical
              issues", namely, land degradation; environment; poverty reduction; the marine
              environment; and education and awareness creation.

              Taking the cue from the Government's policy position with regard to environmental
              management, the Government and its development partners have prioritised

Petroleum Jetty ESIA                                                            Date March 25, 2008
ESIA Final Report                                                               Page 6


              environmental and natural resources management as a critical area of development
              support for Eritrea in the 2002 to 2006 period.

              On the basis of this in 2002, the UNDP financed Common Country Assessment (CCA)
              identified human resource deficiency, a financial and foreign exchange gap, physical
              infrastructure, institutional capacity and inadequate information as the most critical
              constraints affecting Eritrea's socio-economic recovery. The CCA identified eight
              thematic areas of focus in dealing with the constraints identified, namely, governance;
              economic growth and development; food security; education; health; water; shelter and
              sanitation; environment and energy; and emergency recovery, reintegration and
              rehabilitation. Within the theme of environment and energy, issues relating to land,
              biodiversity, water and institutional strengthening were highlighted.

              From these policy documents, it is clear that the Government has put a lot of efforts to
              facilitate the effective management of Eritrea's environment and natural resources. It has
              also been focusing on the legal and institutional framework for environmental
              regulation. In this regard, there is an attempt to establish a strong institutional
              framework that provides effective management of the critical environmental and natural
              resource as well as development planning; land degradation; biodiversity conservation;
              and the marine environment.


2.1.5         Institutional Framework

              The legal and administrative authority for environmental regulation is the Ministry of
              Land, Environment, and Water (MOLEW), and particularly its Department of
              Environment (DOE). The main objective of the Department of Environment is to ensure
              proper protection and judicious use of the environment through effective harmonization
              of policies, objectives, strategies and activities aimed at achieving a sustainable socio-
              economic development of the country.

              In its effort to promote sound environmental management, the DOE has attempted at
              developing appropriate legislative reform, namely by issuing

                  · First draft Environmental Proclamation (1996);

                  · Revised Draft Environmental Proclamation (2000).

              In order to effectively implement the above stated policies and objectives the DOE is
              continuously trying

                  · to promote the active participation of government institutions, civil society and
                      the general public in the proper conservation and wise use of the environment;

                  · to introduce appropriate environmental enforcement laws at national and
                      sectoral levels to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of the
                      environment; and

                  · to strengthen its institutional capacity.

Petroleum Jetty ESIA                                                             Date March 25, 2008
ESIA Final Report                                                                Page 7


              On the basis of these policies and stated objectives, the DOE, with its development
              partners, continues to work to improve draft environmental laws and regulations.
              However, the DOE recognizes that due to its complex nature and vast scope, proper
              conservation and utilization of environmental resources can not be achieved by the
              activities of one government institution alone. Thus, in addition to the efforts of the
              Department of Environment, the different sector ministries are supposed to address
              environmental management issues within their portfolios. Government agencies,
              particularly those with a mandate touching on the regulation of the environment in close
              cooperation with DOE are expected to develop policies and regulations based on the
              overall government policy on environment and at the same time create the necessary
              administrative framework for their implementation.


2.1.6         Sectoral Arrangements

              In this regard a few sectors, namely fisheries, mining and land have already proclaimed
              the laws and regulations formally. For example, a proclamation to promote the
              Development of Mineral Resources No. 68/1995, in association with the Regulation of
              Mining Operations (Legal Notice 19/1995), has made several provisions to
              environmental protection and sustainable use, including bio-diversity conservation and
              sustainable use, protection of the environmental and archaeological sites, which may be
              affected in the course of mining operations. The regulations on Petroleum Operations,
              Legal Notice No. 24/1995, has also made provisions to environmental damage that may
              arise during the development of the petroleum industry in Eritrea. This Legal Notice
              pays special attention to the requirements for Environmental Impact Studies in order to
              ensure environmental protection, pollution control and safety measures. Fines are also
              stipulated for environmental damage caused by contractors.

              The fishery sector, however, is the most advanced one in terms of its specific legal and
              administrative framework. In order to safeguard marine resources and protect the
              country's marine and coastal biodiversity, the Government has adopted two
              proclamations and thirteen legal notices: These fisheries legislation are:

                  · The Fisheries Proclamation: Proclamation No. 104/1998

                  · The Fishery Product Proclamation No 105/1998

                  · The Foreign Fishing Vessel Regulation: Legal Notice No. 38/1998

              These laws provide comprehensive coverage about the development and management of
              the marine sector in Eritrea and contain a numbers of Articles relevant to the protection
              and conservation of marine resources, including the establishment of marine protected
              areas.


2.1.7         Ongoing Activities

              Relevant ongoing and proposed programmes in the field of environmental and natural
              resources management are the following:

                  · Natural resource management ­ (a) Biodiversity Stocktaking Assessment has
                      been done and a report titled "To improve the management of Eritrea's
                      biodiversity resources" has been produced in 1999; (b) a National Biodiversity
                      Strategy and Action Plan have also been prepared in 2000.

                  · Climate Change Studies ­ (a) a rainfall database has been established for the
                      period 1885 to date; (b) vulnerability and adaptation assessment studies have
                      been carried out in five sectors, namely, agriculture, forestry, water resources,
                      coastal zone and human health; (c) inventory of the major greenhouse gases
                      (CO2, CH4 and N2O) have been prepared, as well as Eritrea's Initial National
                      Communication to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change
                      (UNFCCC).

                  · Assessment of Pollution Management Issues ­ the DoE has carried out several
                      assessment studies on pollution management issues. This was done to gain an
                      understanding of the current status and to make recommendations for the better
                      management of such pollutants as pesticides, solid and liquid waste, and
                      chemicals.

              The Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (IPRSP), produced by the government of
              Eritrea with the financial and technical assistance of UNDP, strongly emphasises the
              need to prevent further deterioration of natural resources of the country, while
              maintaining macro-economic stability; the following modalities of implementation of
              the strategy are identified:

Petroleum Jetty ESIA                                                            Date March 25, 2008

                  · Putting in place an improved forest and wildlife policy and legal framework.

                  · Protecting and enhancing water, soil and biodiversity conservation.

                  · Undertaking full forest resources inventory.

                  · Undertaking an accelerated and sustainable afforestation program with
                      participation of the communities.

              Moreover the IPRSP points out the importance of many of the environment related
              national documents, action plans, and the urgency to react on environmental problems
              in the country.


2.1.8         Constraints

              However, there are some points of concern that need to be addressed regarding the legal
              and administrative framework. These include the following points:

                  · The scope of the mandate for environmental regulation in the country needs to
                      be refined. There is an acceptance that the Department of Environment has the
                      mandate for environmental regulation, and that the other departments have only
                      sector specific mandates. However, there is no clarity on what this means in
                      practice: that is, on the nature and extent of the mandate of the Department of
                      Environment (i.e., where the mandates begins and where it ends) and how its
                      mandate relates to the sector specific mandates of the other departments.

                  · Secondly, the issue of cross-sectoral coordination. It is true that consultations
                      take place between sector ministries and DOE with regard to the development of
                      proposals for laws and projects. Sectors such as fishery have established
                      coordination mechanisms through proclamation; on the whole, however,
                      coordination is not formalized, and tends to be ad hoc, and based on good will.

                  · Thirdly, there is a widespread practice of combining development and regulatory
                      functions within sector ministries and even departments. Thus, the Ministry of
                      Fisheries both promotes and regulates fishing; the Department of Mines both
                      promotes and regulates mining and so on.

                  · Fourthly, the DOE has limited monitoring and enforcement capacity. In a
                      number of instances, there are no monitoring and enforcement systems in place.
                      An example of this is the Ministry of Trade and Industry, where there is no
                      Factories Inspections Department or Unit. Furthermore, there is also limited
                      information on the capacity needs for implementing the several environmental
                      laws, existing and proposed.

                  · Finally, the Department of Environment has not sufficient capacity to carry out
                      its present mandate, and has not yet developed systems for implementing its
                      mandate.

2.1.9         Conclusions

              From the indicated overall government documents on environmental guidelines, it can
              be stated that the relevant environmental policy for the Petroleum Jetty Project
              comprises the following:

              Requirement to conduct an ESIA to accompany the development of the jetty.

              Regional development planning of the area, which must be addressed in the
              construction of the new jetty and should include land use planning and control; siting;
              protection of environmentally sensitive areas; and protection of endangered species.

              Environmental standards, which must be considered in the design, layout, construction
              and operation of the jetty project, including generation and disposal of liquid effluents,
              generation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, ambient environmental quality,
              and health and safety.


2.2           MPA Environmental Regulations

              MPA has an Oil Spill Response Plan prepared by David Newby Associates (DNA,
              2006a) as well as a Waste Management Plan (DNA, 2006b). These documents were
              handed over to the Consultant by the Client.


2.3           International Standards

              The ESIA has to be made according to Eritrean and World Bank standards. The relevant
              WB standards are the Operational Polices of the Bank (OPs). The following Table
              provides a list of these OPs and comments on their applicability and relevance for the
              present Project.

4.01     Environmental Assessment     Jan. 1999  Applicable; main international standard to be followed for this
                                                 study. The Project is classified as Category A project (i.e. likely to
                                                 have significant environmental effects for which adequate
                                                 mitigation will be required).

4.04     Natural Habitats             Jun. 2001  Applicable: possible effects of the project on mangroves and
                                                 coastal marine habitats, mainly corals.

4.09     Pest Management              Dec. 1998  Not applicable: no agriculture involved, no public health risk due
                                                 to pests.

4.10     Indigenous Peoples           Jan. 2005  Not applicable: no population affected that would qualify as
                                                 indigenous or ethnic minority group.

4.12     Involuntary Resettlement     Dec. 2001  Applicable, but of minor relevance in this case: no inhabitants in
                                                 the area affected, therefore no physical displacement; all land to
                                                 be used or otherwise affected by the Project in possession of the
                                                 Ministry of Energy, no use of parts of this land (whether legally or
                                                 illicitly) by inhabitants of the area, therefore no economic
                                                 displacement; no fishing activities allowed in the affected coastal
                                                 area, therefore no limitation in access to resources caused by the

3.1           The Project Area


3.1.1         Location in the Country

              The Project is located on the Red Sea coast in the immediate vicinity of Massawa,
              which is the most important port of the country (see map in Annex A3.1).


3.1.2         The Project Site

              The Project is located a short distance south of Massawa, in Hirgigo bay. The following
              Figure shows the project site (centre of the picture), with existing oil jetty as well as
              cooling water intake and outlet channel of the power plant, and Massawa with the port
              (upper part of picture).

              The project for a new oil jetty at Hirgigo Bay - Massawa (the Project), which is the
              objective of this ESIA, consists in replacing the existing jetty with a new structure, and
              this also includes the construction process of the new jetty and the demolition and
              removal of the existing one. The pipelines will also have to be replaced (on the jetty and
              on land up to the point, outside of the tank farm, where they will be connected to the
              existing lines. There are plans, or at least intentions for the time being, to increase

              storage capacity of the tank farm by erecting additional tanks. This, however, is not part
              of the Project, which assumes no change and continued use of the existing tanks.


3.2           The Existing Jetty

              The existing jetty (in this Report alternatively also addressed as "old jetty" or "southern
              jetty", this last denomination for distinguishing it from the "northern jetty", which is the
              second petroleum jetty of the country, located next to Massawa Harbour itself, a few
              kilometres to the north) is the structure which is presently used for discharging oil
              products and LPG in Hirgigo Bay.

              The following description of the existing jetty is given in the Feasibility Report (RH
              2006, Executive Summary, p. i, and Report p. 95):

              "There is a petroleum jetty at Hirgigo Bay-Massawa, which is serving the Hirgigo
              Power Plant, the Shell Petroleum depot and the Erigas depot. The existing petroleum
              jetty is understood to have been constructed by Italians in the 1930's and is in very poor
              condition and its urgent replacement is required. It is of great strategic value to the State
              of Eritrea and it must be kept in use during the construction of a replacement facility.

              The Approach Jetty is approximately 4.3 m wide by 760 m long. A typical
              arrangement of the Approach Jetty is shown in the "Inspection of the Existing Jetty and
              Interventions Report". It is supported by 284 pairs of concrete columns (believed to be
              un-reinforced), at approximately 2.7 m centres longitudinally, founded on a rock rubble
              mound placed on the sea bed. Some of the pairs of columns are surrounded by concrete
              plinths at their bases. Transverse reinforced concrete beams are supported on pairs of
              columns. They are cantilevered beyond the outer face of the columns and longitudinal
              edge beams, which stiffen the deck edge, are provided at the end of these cantilevers.
              The reinforced concrete deck is about 250 mm thick and spans between the transverse
              beams.

              The concrete columns appear to be in reasonable condition and have sound foundations.
              However, the reinforced concrete superstructure (comprising the transverse beams, deck
              and edge beams) is generally in a very poor condition.

              Extensive spalling of the concrete has occurred and reinforcement is exposed over large
              areas. In some places, loss of the edge of the deck and the transverse beam cantilevers
              has already occurred.

              The Jetty Head is located at the outer end of the Approach Jetty. This structure has
              concrete walls founded on a rock rubble mound. The Jetty Head is about 65 m long,
              increasing from 6 m wide at the landward end to approximately 36 m wide at the outer
              end. The deck of the Jetty Head is also formed in concrete and may be cast on top of
              rock or other imported soil filling, placed between the walls.

              The concrete in the Jetty Head is suffering some deterioration, spalling and cracking but
              it appears to be in a reasonable condition.

              Beyond the Jetty Head is an isolated Dolphin located approximately 250 m seaward of
              the Jetty Head. The form of construction for the dolphin is not certain but, from a

              The Environmental Consultant has visited the existing structures several times, in
              varying group composition:

                    ·   September 18, 2007 (after signature of Draft Contract), visit made by ESIA
                        Team Leader.

                    ·   October 25, 2007, by the Team Leader and the Socio-economic Expert.

                    ·   October 31, 2007, by the entire expert group.

                    ·   November 2, 2007, by the Coastal Engineering Expert.

                    ·   November 7, 2007, by the Team Leader and the Biodiversity Expert (diving in
                        the surroundings of the jetty and the location selected for the new jetty).

              On all occasions, the experts of the Consultant were accompanied by counterpart staff
              members (of Massawa Port Authority and on one occasion also by a representative of
              the Eritrean Oil Corporation).

              The bad condition of the jetty can be confirmed from the visits undertaken (see Photos
              1-3 in Annex 17). The conclusions from the inspections are the following:

                    ·   The bad condition of the jetty as such, and to some extent also the condition
                        of the pipelines, require a replacement (or at least a considerable
                        refurbishment) of the existing structure.

                    ·   From an environmental point of view, the condition presents a rather high and
                        increasing risk of a major accident to happen any time.

                    ·   The existing jetty does not have any fire fighting equipment, and no oil
                        containing equipment is on site; such equipment is available at Massawa Port,
                        from where it would have to be brought in case of an emergency. This would
                        mean a loss of time e.g. for containing a major oil spill and therefore increase
                        the risk of considerable environmental damage.

                    ·   On the other hand, it is obvious that the existing jetty needs to be maintained
                        in operation until the new structure is available and working, since the oil
                        supply of the country to a large extend depends on it. It is understood by the
                        Consultant that there is one other oil jetty in Massawa Port, a few kilometres
                        to the north of the Hirgigo Jetty, which supplies Mobil and Total (and is of
                        about the same age as Hirgigo Jetty). However, fuel for the power plant and
                        LPG are being supplied from Hirgigo Jetty, and so is Tamoil.

              The replacement of the existing facility by a new jetty, equipped with the required
              protection devices, will reduce the risks or major accidents and will improve the basis
              for a safe energy supply of the country. It seems important to carry out this project as
              fast as possible.

ESIA Final Report                                                                Page 15


3.3           The Project of a New Jetty

              A Feasibility and Preliminary Design Study was carried out by Royal Haskonning (the
              Design Consultant, the report being cited here as RH 2006). This included an analysis of
              the existing situation (status of the existing jetty, petroleum import and likely
              development in the future, logistic, technical and safety requirements for a new jetty,
              conditions for removal of the existing jetty, preliminary evaluation of environmental
              impacts, economic analysis) as well as the development of a number of alternatives for
              a new jetty in different locations, however, all of them in the vicinity of the existing
              structure, since the existing storage facilities will have to be used. A total number of 7
              alternatives were developed and compared technically and economically. These
              alternatives are described shortly and then compared for their likely effect on the
              environment in the following Chapter.

              It has to be pointed out that all the technical details mentioned in the present Report
              have been taken from the Feasibility Study (RH 2006) or, in a few cases, were obtained
              directly from the Design Consultant. Technical details not provided here can be found in
              this Feasibility and Preliminary Design Report.

              The comparison carried out by the Design Consultant first led to choosing Alternative 7
              as the preferred alternative technically and economically. However, due to potential
              problems with the cooling water intake of the Hirgigo Power Plant, this was then
              abandoned in favour of Alternative 3. It is understood that detailed design of this
              alternative is going on in parallel to this ESIA study. Nevertheless, the TOR for the
              ESIA, in Task 2, clearly state what follows: "Design alternatives (layouts 1-6) shall be
              evaluated for their respective environmental and social costs and benefits, including a
              non-action scenario to confirm initial findings in the Hirgigo Bay Petroleum Jetty Phase
              1B Report -- Feasibility and Preliminary Design (January '06)".


3.4           Environmental Classification of the Project

              The project for a new petroleum jetty (the Project) is a Category A project according to
              the Eritrean Procedures And Guidelines For Environmental Clearance of Projects
              enacted in March 1999. This means that for this Project, a full EIA is required, as the
              TOR for the study requested. This coincides with the classification of the Project
              according to WB OP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment).


3.5           The Study Area

              For most practical purposes of this ESIA, the study area is the industrial area south of
              Massawa, as indicated in the MAP in Figure 7-1 (Master Plan Study) and the adjacent
              part of the sea, where the existing jetty and the site for the new jetty are located. Only
              for a few specific purposes (namely traffic caused by the project; wind and wave
              situation and coastal currents; social effects) this area was widened according to the
              requirements of the specific subjects.

4             ANALYSIS OF PROJECT ALTERNATIVES


4.1           The Alternatives for the New Jetty

              Three locations for the new jetty were investigated originally, namely

                    ·    Location 1: north of the existing jetty (Alternatives 1,2 and 4);

                    ·    Location 2: south of the existing jetty (Alternatives 3, 5, and 6); and

                    ·    Location 3: southern tip of Taulud Island, with submarine pipelines
                         connecting it to the tank farm.

              It is understood from the Feasibility Study that the originally evaluated Location 3,
              comprising a short jetty located on the southernmost tip of Taulud Island, with
              submarine pipelines connecting it to the tank farm, was abandoned at an early stage of
              alternatives evaluation; this alternative, therefore, will not be included in the evaluation
              to be made for the ESIA.

              A fourth location was added at a later stage, namely, south of the existing jetty, but
              closer to it than Location 2 mentioned above. This then resulted in Alternative 7.

              Figure 3-2 shows the 7 Alternatives investigated. Note that there is no map indicating
              location of Alternative 6 in the Feasibility Report. However, according to the Feasibility
              Report and confirmed by the Design Consultant, this alternative would have been at
              Location 2 (south), a the same site as Alternative 3. It has to be pointed out that
              Alternative 6 is unique in the sense that it did not foresee a jetty, but submarine
              pipelines from the shore to the mooring point of the tankers.

                          The Feasibility Report does not provide a map
                          for Alternative 6, but it would be sited at
                          location 2, south of the existing jetty, i.e. at the
                          same location as Alternative 3. However, this
                          alternative consists in submarine pipelines, and
                          would not require a jetty.

              Note concerning Alternative 7: all information refers to "original" version; in the Addendum to the Feasibility Study, three options for
              Alternative 7 (7A to C) are described which take into account the necessity to make provisions for the cooling water intake of the
              power plant; this is likely to increase the price of this "economic" alternative.

4.2           Analysis Framework

              A first comparative analysis is being done based on expected environmental impacts of
              the various alternatives described in the previous section. This multi-criteria analysis of
              alternatives is being done according to the following steps:

                         1. Definition of indicators.

                         2. Definition of a scale to be used for comparative evaluation (see below).

                         3. Evaluation of all alternatives for each indicator.

                         4. Synthesis: compilation of results from individual indicators.

              For the evaluation, the following scale was used:

                    ·       -3: strong negative effect

                    ·       -2: medium negative effect

                    ·       -1: small negative effect

                    ·       0: no effect (= no change as compared to existing situation)

                    ·       +1: small positive effect

                    ·       +2: medium positive effect

                    ·       +3: strong positive effect

              In this scale, -3 (strong negative impact) would mean a very serious adverse effect on
              the environment (or a risk for a serious negative effect), which would be difficult or
              even impossible to mitigate. -2 (medium) means a considerable effect, which requires
              mitigation, and where mitigation is usually feasible, while -1 (small) would mean an
              effect of low intensity, and/or limited duration, and/or on an aspect of the environment
              which is of low value (as e.g. an already strongly degraded habitat); still, even in such a
              case mitigation might be necessary or at lest recommended in order to minimise the
              effect.

              The following Table contains the list of indicators which were used for the comparative
              analysis of alternatives, arranged according to main topics.

Table 4.3-1:  Air Quality

No. 1.1        Indicator: Air Quality

Description    Air pollution (mainly emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter) will result from all
               construction activities related to the project. The three main sources are (i) emissions related to the
               construction activities of the new jetty, (ii) emissions resulting from transport of material and personnel
               from/to the construction sites, and (iii) emissions caused by the demolition of the existing jetty.

               During jetty operation the main sources of air pollution are the diesel engines of tankers at the unloading
               sites.


Alternative    Effect                                                                                     Value        Rank

1              As the preferred construction methods and the material balances for rock bund                 -1           3
               and trestle are not defined yet, only a raw estimation of the emissions based on
               length of rock bund and trestle and of dredging/no dredging is used for
               comparison. As it is known from previous projects, construction activities of that
               scale and type may cause visible dust emissions but not a detectable influence
               and ambient air quality values.

2              As Alternative 1.                                                                             -1           3




3              Slightly less emissions than Alternative 1 as the rock bund as well as the trestle            -1           2
               is about 20% shorter than those of Alternative 1, so that less construction
               activities and transport will occur. Furthermore no dredging with equipment using
               diesel fuel is required.


4              As Alternative 1.                                                                             -1           3




5              This alternative will probably cause more emissions of air pollutants than any of             -1           5
               the others as the rock bund as well as the trestle is the longest and will require
               more construction activities and more transports of material than the other
               alternatives.


6              This alternative is the most favourable in view of the extent of construction                 -1           1
               activities and transportation of material required as the installation of a
               submarine pipeline and hoses needs less construction activities than
               construction of rock bund and trestle.


7              Slightly more emissions than Alternative 1 as the long rock bund requires more                -1           4
               shifting/transfer of weighty material.




Conclusions:   The extent of air pollution resulting from construction activities is proportional to the number and the
               duration of use of construction equipment and to the number of transports by utility vehicles. As the
               extent of construction activities is limited (no excavations, small amount of dredging if any and the
               amount of material to be transported is relatively small, the impact on the air quality is insignificant.

               The air pollution resulting from demolition of the existing jetty does not differ for the various alternatives.

               The air pollution resulting from unloading ships is restricted to an acceptable degree if the engines are
               maintained properly.

Table 4.3-2:  Noise

No. 1.2        Indicator: Noise

Description    Increase of environmental noise will mainly result from construction activities related to the project. The
               three main sources are (i) noise related to the construction activities for the new jetty, (ii) heavy duty
               traffic noise along roads crossing inhabited areas, generated by transport of material from/to the
               construction sites, and (iii) noise related to the demolition of the existing jetty.

               Due to the large distance between the location of any jetty alternative and the identified areas sensitive
               to environmental noise the location of the alternatives is not taken into consideration. Instead the
               comparison and ranking of the alternatives is mainly based on the noise resulting from road transport
               and therefore on the amount of material that has to be transported

               During operation no significant noise sources have been identified.

Alternative    Effect                                                                                    Value        Rank

1              As the preferred construction methods and the material balances for rock bund                 -1          3
               and trestle are not defined yet, only a raw estimation of the amount of round trips
               for transportation is used for comparison. As it is known from previous projects,
               noise generated by road transport for construction activities of that scale and
               type remain well within the acceptable limits.

2              As Alternative 1                                                                              -1          3




3              Less noise generated than Alternative 1 as the rock bund as well as the trestle is            -1          2
               about 20% shorter than those of Alternative 1, so that less road transport will be
               needed.



4              As Alternative 1                                                                              -1          3




5              This alternative will probably cause more noise than any of the others as the                 -1          5
               rock bund as well as the trestle is the longest and will require more transports of
               material than the other alternatives



6              This alternative is the most favourable in view of the need for road transportation           -1          1
               as the installation of a submarine pipeline and hoses needs less material for
               construction than of rock bund and trestle.



7              Slightly more noise generated than Alternative 1 as the long rock bund requires               -1          4
               more transportation of weighty material to the site.




Conclusions:   Considering the distance between the locations of the jetty project alternatives and the areas sensitive to
               environmental noise neither the noise generated at the different jetty alternative locations (i) nor the
               noise generated while demolition of the existing jetty (iii) will consist a nuisance.

               Transport of material (rock material, concrete, steel, waste from demolition work) over roads crossing
               inhabited areas will add too the 'normal' traffic noise and may be noticeable. However, the amount of
               transports is not excessive so that the noise generated by these transports will remain well within the
               acceptable limits.

Table 4.3-3:  Water quality

No. 1.3        Indicator: Water quality

Description    There are no surface water bodies in the area which could be affected by the project. Therefore, this
               indicator refers to water quality in the nearshore sea area, where oil losses from the jetty would have an
               impact. Such oil losses can be (i) losses from unloading activities, (ii) from leakage of pipelines, (iii)
               water contamination due to flushing of pipelines, and (iv) oil spills from ruptured pipelines. While the
               latter would lead to a potentially major oil pest in the bay, losses from small leakages, when undetected
               over longer periods, could potentially cause a considerable damage as well.



Alternative    Effect                                                                                    Value         Rank

1              Pipelines on jetty, therefore little risk of undetected leakages. Offloading arms,          -1            2
               but longer jetty as Alternative 3. Impact small, but worse than Alternative 3.




2              As Alternative 1                                                                            -1            2

               shortest jetty; overall impact small, considered better as other alternatives




4              As Alternative 1, but slightly higher risk due to offloading hoses instead of arms.         -1            3




5              As Alternative 4, but slightly higher risk due to offloading hoses instead of arms          -1            4
               and about 100 m of submarine pipelines.




6              No jetty, submarine pipelines, therefore highest risk of undetected leakages and            -2            5
               potentially larger amount of oil lost in case of a major event.




7              As Alternative 1.                                                                           -1            2




Conclusions:   Alternative 3 is the preferred option, which presents the lowest risk of water contamination.

Table 4.3-4:  Waste

No. 2.1        Indicator: Amount of waste generated

Description    Waste management aspects are mainly limited to the construction phase with special attention on the
               demolition of the existing jetty. Construction and demolition activities of that type and extent do always
               generate a considerable but manageable amount of different waste categories. If the contractors will be
               under obligation to follow good practice standards for handling the resulting waste from all construction
               and demolition activities, the impact on the environment will remain small.

               Preliminary Design Report (RH 2006) demonstrate that the bulk of waste that

Conclusions:   Construction and demolition activities of that type and extent do always generate a considerable but
               manageable amount of different waste categories. It is important to oblige the contractors to maintain
               good practice standards. Special attention has to be paid on the carrying out of demolition works for the
               existing jetty in order to guarantee a proper separation and treatment of the resulting waste.

Table 4.3-5:  Waves

No.3.1         Indicator: Waves

Description    The wave conditions in the Hirgigo Bay are rather mild due to protection from various islands and shoals
               fronting the Massawa area in the Red Sea. The swell waves are reduced to insignificant proportions due
               to attenuation caused by various islands and shoals. The sea waves approach from a predominantly SE
               direction during winter period and NW direction during summer period. The local wave conditions in the
               project area depend on the influence of reefs within the bay. The waves will attenuate when transmitted
               over the reefs. On the other hand waves propagating through gaps in the reefs will reach the project
               area unattenuated.

Table 4.3-6:  Currents

No.3.2         Indicator: Currents

Description    The currents in the project area are generated due to combined influence of tides, wind and waves. The
               tidal currents in the shallow nearshore area are insignificant in magnitude. Even in deeper areas tidal
               currents cannot be expected to be more than 5-10 cm/s. Strong winds could at times produce surface
               currents in excess of tidal currents. Wave driven currents are produced due to breaking of waves in
               shallow water. Due to moderate wave conditions prevailing within Hirgigo Bay these currents will also be
               small in magnitude.

Table 4.3-7:  Sedimentation/Erosion

No.3.3         Indicator: Sedimentation/Erosion

Description    Sediment movement due to currents generally takes place in shallow water. The waves cause stirring of
               sediment due to turbulence. The breaking waves also create longshore currents which are primarily
               responsible for sediment transport. Sedimentation takes place when sediment in transport reaches an
               area where transport capacity of currents is below the quantity of sediment in movement. Sedimentation
               can also take place when sediment flow is interrupted by coastal structures. Erosion of bed sediment will
               occur when sediment transport capacity exceeds in quantity of sediment in movement. This is typical in
               down-drift side of coastal structures.

               ascertain this impact more detailed study would be required.




Conclusions:   Apart from Alternative 7 none of the other alternatives will have major negative or positive impact. As it
               does not cause a negative impact (and could possibly even reduce somewhat the risk of intake of heated
               water) Alternative 3 is the preferred solution (with Alternative 5, which has the same effect).

Table 4.3-10: Occupational Health

No. 4.1        Indicator: Occupational Health

Description    Occupational health effects are mainly limited to the construction of the new jetty and the demolition of
               the existing jetty. The workforce required for construction activities, for all kind of transportation, guarding
               etc. of a big construction site is inevitably exposed to health risks (accidents, hazardous materials,
               contagious diseases). If the contractors will be under obligation to maintain good practice standards for
               all construction activities, the impact on the occupational health will remain small.

               Occupational health effects during operation are not considered as these can be neglected if the
               appropriate precautions for the employees involved in the operation and maintenance activities are
               taken.

Alternative    Effect                                                                                      Value        Rank

1              Will require a comparatively large workforce including unskilled labour for a long            -1           3
               rock bund and a long jetty including moving a rather big quantity of heavy
               material (rock ,concrete, steel)



2              As Alternative 1                                                                              -1           3




3              Less impact than Alternative 1 as the rock bund as well as the trestle is about               -1           2
               20% shorter than those of Alternative 1




4              As Alternative 1                                                                              -1           3




5              As Alternative 1, but to a somewhat larger extent given the greater length of the             -1           4
               rock bund.




6              Since there is no jetty to be built (no need of quarrying, very little transport,             -1           1
               minimum amount of construction work on site), this alternative would consist the
               smallest risk on occupational health



7              As Alternative 1                                                                              -1           3




Conclusions:   Construction activities of that type and extent do always comprise certain, but controllable risks for the
               occupational health. It is important to oblige the contractors to maintain good practice standards. Special
               attention has to be paid on the preparation of demolition works for the existing jetty and on all strenuous
               and potentially dangerous activities carried out by unskilled workers.

Table 4.3-11: Public Health

No. 4.2        Indicator: Public Health

Description    Public health effects during construction are not considered as the bulk of construction activities take
               place far away from the residential areas of Hirgigo and Massawa. Furthermore the main construction
               activities consist in placing rocks for the rock bunds and erecting concrete or steel trestles in the bay;
               both are types of work that are quite common and will not have any negative impact on public health.

               The mere fact, that an old jetty and pipe work system of only reasonable to poor condition at the end of
               its life cycle will be replaced by an optimized modern ship unloading facility, is considered to have a
               (small) positive impact on public health as the risk of leakages, fire and other accidents or damages with
               potential health hazards on the nearby population is clearly reduced.

Alternative    Effect                                                                                   Value         Rank

               the risk of leakages, fire and other accidents or damages during ship unloading
               compared to the existing situation.

Conclusions:   The potentially positive impact on public health merely caused by the replacement of the old jetty by a
               new and modern ship unloading system isn't depending on the selected alternative as all are considered
               as state of the art in view of avoiding malfunction of any kind.

Table 4.3-12: Mangroves

No. 5.1        Indicator: Mangroves

Description    Mangroves grow along the shoreline in the project area, in a thin line near the location of the existing
               jetty, stretching to the intake channel of the power plant, and then again near the outlet channel, the area
               covered by mangroves getting wider south of this channel (see Figure 4.3-1). Mangroves in general are
               an important habitat, often threatened by human activities.

               The existing jetty interrupts the mangrove belt; removing it will lead to a quick closure of this gap, a small
               positive effect common to all alternatives.


Alternative    Effect                                                                                   Value         Rank

               the site of the existing jetty, whereby the positive effect of removing the old jetty
               will be neutralised. Small negative impact due to destruction of a few mangrove
               trees.


2              as Alternative 1                                                                            -1           2




3              The mangrove belt is already interrupted at the site where this Alternative is             +1            1
               located (whether due to natural reasons or as a consequence of human
               intervention, like construction of the power plant) is not know. No negative effect,
               small positive effect through removal of existing jetty.

5              Alternative 5 has the same location as Alternative 3, it won't have a negative              -1           1
               Impact and it will have a small positive effect through removal of the existing
               jetty.



6              Alternative 6 has the same location as Alternative 3, it won't have a negative              -1           3
               Impact due to construction and it will have a small positive effect through
               removal of the existing jetty.

               In this solution there will be a continuous risk of undetected leakages from the
               submarine pipelines which could harm the biodiversity on the whole coastline.

7              as Alternative 1                                                                            -1           2




Conclusions:   None of the Alternatives will have a major negative impact on mangroves. However, given the fact this
               one causes no negative impact, Alternatives 3 and 5 are the preferred solution.

Table 4.3-13: Coral reef, seaweeds and sea grasses

No. 5.2        Indicator: Coral reefs, sea weeds and sea grasses

Description    Corals grow in a distance of about 600 m along the shoreline of Hirgigo bay. The reef starts 500 m to the
               north of the existing jetty (see Figure 4.3-1) the first stretch of about 350 m is moribund and sargassum
               (sea weed) and/or dysidea (sponges) are growing on the dying corals. Some living solitaire corals are in-
               between the sponges and seaweeds. The reef is continuing, for the next 150 m until the existing jetty, as
               a discontinuous reef with life corals, it has a width of more ore less 200 m to the north-east. The next
               340 m of the seabed consists of mud, silt, silty sand, shell and corals. Following that area an about
               900 m long stretch of a discontinuous and continuous porites fringing reef is growing between the
               cooling water intake and outlet.

               Sediment mobilised and suspended by construction work will have a negative impact on all reefs in that
               area. If dredging is additionally required this would mean an additional negative impact on the coral
               reefs, the seaweed and sea grasses due to the continuous disturbance of the seabed and to the creation
               of sediment trails.

Alternative    Effect                                                                                      Value       Rank

1              Will interrupt the coral reef on the northern side of the existing jetty, due to the          -2           2
               construction and the destruction of corals will cause a negative impact.
               26'250 m2 of marine habitat will be lost.

               The demolishment of the existing jetty will cause a negative impact since the
               jetty head is already part of the coral reef, the construction of the new one is
               damaging the same reef section as the demolishment.

               Dredging is required and has a long time negative impact.

2              as Alternative 1                                                                              -2           2

3              Will interrupt the coral reef on the southern side of the existing jetty; due to the          -1           1
               construction and the destruction of corals it will cause a negative impact.
               18'750 m2 of marine habitat will be lost.

               The demolishment of the existing jetty will also cause a negative impact since
               the jetty head is already part of the coral reef. This alternative is damaging two
               reef sections through demolishment of the old jetty and construction of the new
               jetty. However, no dredging will be required.

4              as Alternative 1                                                                              -2           2

5              Basically as Alternative 3; however, given its greater length its impact of marine            -2           2
               bottom biota is certainly more important. 36'000 m2 of marine habitat will be lost.

6              As Alternative 3, but due to the absence of a jetty (only submarine pipelines) it will        -2           3
               cause less destruction of corals than Alternatives 3 and 5.

               Alternative 6 will have a continuous risk of undetected leakages from the
               submarine pipelines, which could harm the biodiversity on the whole coastline.

7              Will interrupt the coral reef on the southern side of the existing jetty; due to the          -2           2
               construction and the destruction of corals it will cause a negative impact.
               34'500 m2 of marine habitat will be lost. Dredging may be required and has a
               long time negative impact.

               Demolishing the existing jetty will also cause a negative impact since the jetty
               head is already part of the coral reef. This alternative is damaging two reef
               sections through demolishment of the old jetty and construction of the new jetty.

Conclusions:   Every alternative will have a medium negative impact on corals. However, in Alternatives 1, 2 and 4 the
               construction impact and the impact from the demolishment of the jetty is on one reef. In Alternatives 3, 5,
               6 and 7 the direct impact will affect two reefs, the one near the jetty head from the demolishment of the
               jetty and the one along the coastline in front of the cooling water intake and outlet. Alternatives 1, 2, 4
               and 7 will need dredging, which will cause a long time impact, if the dredging has to be done in
               continuous intervals. Alternative 6 has a permanent risk of undetected leakages. Since the destruction of
               corals due to the construction is limited in time the probability is very high that the corals will regenerate
               in an adequate time. Dredging is not required in Alternatives 3 and 5 and the risk of undetected leakages
               is lower than in solution 6. Alternative 3 is the preferred solution since the risk is the lowest and the loss

Table 4.3-14: Marine life

No. 5.3        Indicator: marine life

Description    Marine life here means the marine megafauna (turtles, dolphins, dugongs) including fishes. These
               animals occur more or less along the whole coastline of Eritrea. The beach at the construction site is
               covered by muddy sand. It is very flat, and occasionally the flood reaches rather far inland. A
               considerable part of the land seawards of the power plant was covered by excavation material from the
               power plant construction site. Given this situation, the probability that turtles are using that strip of beach
               as nesting area is very low.

               The main negative impacts for the marine life will be due to sediment trails during construction which can
               block the gills of fish; construction noise which will be stress for all animals nearby and destruction of
               corals, sea grasses, seaweed and mangroves, since these habitats are very important as feeding and
               spawning areas for marine life.

Alternative    Effect                                                                                     Value         Rank

1              Due to dredging the negative impact is higher than in solutions without dredging             -2            2
               since the creation of sediment trails will occur not only during construction.

               This alternative will interrupt the mangrove belt. The destruction of mangroves
               and corals has a negative impact, even if it is a small Impact due to the small
               area which will be affected.

               Construction noise will have a negative effect on the distribution of marine life
               near the site. This impact is limited in time and is therefore considered as a small
               negative impact.

2              as Alternative 1                                                                             -2            2




3              Sediment trails will be created during the construction time                                 -1            1

               This alternative will harm the southern coral reef; the destruction of the corals is
               evaluated as a small negative impact, since the area of concern is small.
               Mangroves will not be affected by this solution.

               Construction noise will have a negative effect on the distribution of marine life
               near the site. This impact is limited in time and is therefore considered as a small
               negative impact.

4              as Alternative 1                                                                             -2            2




5              as Alternative 3; Alternatives 3 and 5 have the same impact but the rock bund                -1            2
               length of the jetty is 575 m longer in Alternative 5 than in 3, so it will have a
               bigger impact due to a longer construction period and due to a bigger seabed
               disturbance.

6              This alternative will have less impacts concerning sediment trails, noise and                -2            3
               destruction of habitats than the others but the continuous risk of undetected
               leakages at the submarine pipelines has to be counted as potentially high impact
               since could harm the biodiversity on the whole coastline.

7              as Alternative 1                                                                             -2            2




Conclusions:   None of the alternatives will have a major negative impact on the megafauna including fish. The risk of
               alternative 6 can not be readily assessed but the impact of an undetected leakage or a pipeline break
               would have a devastating effect. However, given the fact that Alternative 3 has indeed a negative impact
               on corals but no negative impact on the mangroves the impact on spawning areas will be smaller than in
               Alternatives 1, 2, 4 and 7. The preferred solution is Alternative 3.

Table 4.3-15: Birds

No. 5.4        Indicator: Birds

Description    Birds use the mangroves as nesting, resting and feeding areas, whereby some species also use reef
               areas, known for a high diversity and amount of fish, as feeding areas. Therefore destruction or
               disturbance of these habitats causes a negative impact on birds.

               Furthermore, construction activities and noise will have a negative impact and will lead to an
               instantaneous movement of birds out of that area. However, the affected area is small and the duration
               of the impact is limited in time. The impact is evaluated as small.

               Noise and construction movements will be the same for all alternatives and therefore does not contribute
               to a ranking of the alternatives.

Alternative    Effect                                                                                 Value       Rank

1              Through destruction of mangroves it has a negative impact, although a small one          -1          2
               due to the small area which will be affected.




2              as Alternative 1                                                                         -1          2




3              Since noise effects will be the same for all alternatives, and since mangroves are        0          1
               not destroyed in this alternative it is evaluated as "no impact".




4              as Alternative 1                                                                         -1          2




5              as Alternative 3, but considered as having a stronger negative impact due to its         -1          2
               being much longer.




6              This alternative will have less impact concerning sediment trails, noise and             -1          3
               destruction of habitats than the others but the continuous risk of undetected
               leakages from the submarine pipelines has to be counted as high impact since it
               could harm the biodiversity along the entire coastline.


7              as Alternative 1                                                                         -1          2




Conclusions:   None of the Alternatives will have a major negative impact on the bird. However, given the fact this one
               causes a smaller negative impact, Alternative 3 is the preferred solution.

Table 4.3-16: Local Fisheries

No. 6.1        Indicator: Local Fisheries

Description    Fishing in the project area in the vicinity of the old jetty is said to be "non-existent", albeit lack of
               demarcation indicating the area as a security zone. The same applies to all the new jetty alternative
               sites. It is the small-scale fishermen who are involved in the project area, as the area is rich in both fish
               and coral, the latter extending to Green Island. In as far as an area where mangrove grows is tampered
               with, these could have some effect on fish quantity, in as far as possible breeding grounds in the
               mangroves are present. In addition, the nutrients (organic matter) from mangroves that fish enjoy may
               also be interfered with. Further south approaching the shores and coastline of Hirgigo village, mangroves
               have been planted to augment economic activities e.g. attract fish, be harvested as supplementary
               fodder for livestock, used as firewood and construction material and for medicinal purposes. The
               mangroves, therefore, are an important habitat for fish.

               The existing jetty is said to be off limits for fishing and therefore has minimal effect on local fisheries.

Alternative    Effect                                                                                       Value       Rank

1              Will interrupt the existing habitat in as far as dredging is carried out, no matter             -1         2
               how minimal. Small negative impact due to destruction of possible breeding and
               feeding ground for fish.



2              as Alternative 1                                                                                -1         2




3              No known fishing activity carried out in the area, but this does not imply that fish            0          1
               not present. Indication of fish presence sighted through presence of fishing birds.
               Minimal effect on local fishing as area already a security zone.



4              as Alternative 1                                                                                -1         2




5              Same effect as Alternative 3. However, the jetty is much longer and the risk of oil             -1         1
               leakage is greater due to submarine pipelines and hoses for connecting to
               tankers. This could affect both fishing and feeding grounds.



6              Comparable to Alternative 3, but less disturbance of sea bed as no jetty                        -2         3
               construction. However, the risk of leakage in pipelines present and detection
               could be difficult, thus affecting fish and marine life



7              Similar to Alternative 1. Dredging might not be required, but rock bund is longer.              -1         2




Conclusions:   None of the Alternatives will have a major negative impact on fisheries, where existing breeding and
               feeding grounds exist, quantity of fish may dwindle. Alternative 3 seems to have the least negative
               impact. The absence of dredging confirms the least disturbance of any habitat already established. Any
               disturbance of the seabed during construction will have a short-term effect, in the long-term
               normalisation of the seabed will occur, outweighing the short-term negative impact, i.e. disturbance of
               habitat and effect on quantity of fish

Table 4.3-17: Job opportunities

No. 6.2        Indicator: Job opportunities

Description    Fishing as an economic activity is not a full time, year round affair. Due to government policy, for 3-4
               months fishermen do not engage in the activity. Job opportunities in the project would be an additional
               earning possibility for both fishermen during non-fishing season and all able-bodied workers without
               employment. The nearby village of Hirgigo has such people. No matter which alternative is chosen,
               workforce will be required in construction, guarding, transporting materials, feeding the workforce, etc.
               The engagement of the workforce will vary according to duration of construction and demolition.
               Stringent supervision will be called for during the whole process. In as far as possible, capacity building
               on site before main work takes off should be encouraged. This would augment awareness and safety of
               workforce.

Alternative    Effect                                                                                      Value       Rank

1              Will require additional workforce for construction. Long jetty and long rock bund             +2         2
               will require a comparatively large work force, hence high number of job
               opportunities, including unskilled labour.



2              as Alternative 1                                                                              +2         2




3              Will require additional workforce for construction; however to some lesser degree             +1         3
               as the other alternatives given the considerably shorter jetty the positive effect
               would be somewhat smaller.



4              as Alternative 1                                                                              +2         2




5              As Alternative 1, but to a somewhat larger extent given the greater length of the             +2         1
               jetty.




6              Since there is no jetty (no need for quarrying, very little transport, minimum                0          4
               amount of construction work on site), this alternative would generate only a very
               small number of jobs for unskilled labour and therefore the least positive effect.



7              as Alternative 1                                                                              +2         2




Conclusions:   Only positive impacts are foreseen for whatever alternative is chosen, as economic earnings will be
               added to extra workforce engaged in the project. Additional skills will be imparted the workforce making
               them eligible for future work should more construction be foreseen in Massawa. From field visits
               Massawa is a growing town/port and new constructions were ongoing. The workforce could also
               encompass women who have the possibility of setting up feeding units for the construction workers.
               Alternative 3 remains the most preferable one, as it does not include dredging, hence offering minimum
               disturbance of the existing habitat for marine life. In addition, Alternative 3's cost is estimated at USD

ESIA Final Report                                                                Page 40


              The evaluation by means of these sheets shows the following:

                  · Environmental impacts are small and the categories made (strong, medium and
                     small effects) often do not allow making a distinction, since most fall into the
                     category small or no effect.

                  · None of the alternatives, and for none of the indicators, is considered to have a
                     strong effect.

              In a next step, a comparative overall evaluation of the alternatives was attempted. The
              Table on the following page shows this: it summarises the results of the impact
              evaluation of the alternatives by compiling the values attributed to the alternatives in the
              indicator sheets. For the groups of indicators, the sum of the values and an average
              value is calculated. These average values are again summed up and an overall average is
              calculated. Finally, an overall ranking is done based on this last average.

              The overall ranking can be characterised in the following way:

                  · Rank 1: Alternative 3. This is mainly due to the shorter length of the jetty (less
                     sea bed habitat occupied, less material required and therefore also less
                     transports, less mobilisation of sediments), no disturbance of the mangrove belt,
                     no interference with the operation of the old jetty during construction, no risk to
                     it from demolition of the old jetty, no dredging.

                  · Rank 2: Alternative 5. Basically the same evaluation as Alternative 3, but due to
                     its greater length it is less favourable in indicators concerning damage to seabed
                     biota and required amount of material.

                  · Rank 3: occupied jointly by Alternatives 1, 2 and 4, i.e. all alternatives located to
                     the north of the existing jetty. Negative points are greater length than Alt. 3,
                     additional disturbance of mangrove belt, smaller distance to Taulud Island
                     (noise), higher risk of interference with existing jetty, and need for dredging.

                  · Rank 4: Alternative 7. This alternative is similar to Alternatives 1,2 and 4 in
                     most respects. The one negative point is the risk of interference with the cooling
                     water intake of the power plant (mainly risk of higher sediment input during the
                     construction period, and risk of interference with local currents which could lead
                     to undesirable sedimentation near the intake channel, thus making water intake
                     less efficient.

                  · Rank 5: Alternative 6. This alternative is similar to Alternative 1 in several
                     respects and has certain additional advantages due to the fact that no jetty would
                     be required (hence no rock material transport, less loss of seabed habitat, less
                     sediment mobilisation). However, the risk from undetected oil leakages, and the
                     probability of a much higher impact in case of a major oil spill from the
                     submarine pipelines is considered as a major disadvantage from an
                     environmental point of view. This risk also increases the probability of adverse
                     effects on all indicators related to biodiversity.

              This evaluation results in a preference for Alternative 3.

4.4           Ranking of Alternatives

              The weak point of this evaluation lies in the fact that the impacts, as mentioned, are in
              general very small and often do not really provide a good distinction between the
              alternatives. Therefore, in a second evaluation process, the alternatives were ranked.
              The basis for this ranking is the fact that even if the impacts caused by the alternatives
              are small and the resulting value figure is the same for several or all alternatives; it is
              still possible to rank them with the arguments like "x is somewhat better than y".

              Such a ranking has been made for a slightly different set of indicators and is shown in
              the Table on the following page. The main reason for the differences in the set of
              indicators is that e.g. oil spill risk and dredging, while not "environmental parameters"
              as such, are considered as important effects and have a secondary effect on a number of
              the environmental indicators (especially biodiversity). Furthermore, the risk of
              interference of the construction of the new jetty with the operation of the existing jetty
              was included, as well as the risk presented by the demolition of the old jetty to operation
              of the new one.

              The ranking scale goes basically from 1 (best) to 7 (worst). However, when several
              alternatives were considered as equal, they got the same rank, and the next in the row
              then got the following rank; for this reason, not the entire scale was normally used.

              Ranks were attributed, as explained above, on an argumentative basis. Where the same
              indicators were used as in the previous section, the ranks are also shown in the indicator
              sheets, and explanations for individual ranks can be found there.

Table 4.4-1:     Ranking of alternatives

No.    Effect                        Comments

                                                                                                                                                      1  2    3    4     5  6  7

1      Impact on sea bed             As shown in the indicator sheets, overall impact of the alternatives on sea bed dynamics (shore                  3  3    2    3     2  1  4
       dynamics                      exposition to wave action, currents, erosion and sedimentation, turbidity, and cooling water use) are small
                                     or negligible, and the differences between the alternatives are minimal. These indicators therefore are
                                     grouped here in one rank.

2      Impact on mangroves           Removal of the old jetty has a small positive effect (all alternatives). Alt. 1, 2, 4 and 7 cross mangrove belt  2  2    1    2     1  3  2
                                     and have therefore a negative effect; Alt. 3, 5 and 6 do not have this, but 6 presents higher risk of
                                     negative effect through oil spills.

3      Impact on coral reefs and     Coral reefs are present along the coastline at the margin of the shallow coastal flat area. All alternatives     2  2    1    2     2  3  2
       associated biota              have the identical negative effect due to the demolition of the existing jetty. All alternatives have an
                                     impact on coral reefs (non of which, however, is in a very good shape), the impact of 1, 2, 4 and 7 are
                                     considered to be somewhat more serious due to the location, the one of 5 due to its much more important
                                     length as compared to 3. 6 has the least impact from construction, but presents a significant risk of
                                     damage due to oil spills.

4      Dredging                      This is listed as a separate item here, since its effects are considered as potentially serious since (i)        2  2    1    2     1  1  2
                                     dredging destroys marine life and especially all sessile organisms where it is carried out, (ii) it mobilises a
                                     large quantity of fine sediment, which in turn can have adverse effects on such organisms in a wider area,
                                     and (iii) it is likely that dredging will have to be carried out repeatedly, thus not allowing a regeneration in
                                     affected areas. Alternatives 1, 2, 4 and possibly 7 require dredging, 3, 5 and 6 don't.

5      Oil spill risk                Two types of impacts caused by oil spills need to be considered, namely (i) small losses of oil trough           2  2    1    2     3  4  1
                                     leaking pipelines (small quantities, but potentially over a long time span if not readily detected), and (ii)
                                     massive spills through breaking of a pipeline during unloading (where potentially large quantities of oil
                                     could be lost before adequate measures are being taken. In all solutions involving a jetty (all except 6),
                                     even very small leakages can be detected easily, and adequate measures are easily taken; this also
                                     reduces the risk of a pipeline rupture. Therefore, although the probability for a major oil spill to occur
                                     seems low, Alternative 6 is by far the least preferred option in this respect, given that the damage if it
                                     happened would be potentially very high. For Alternatives 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7, the risk, while being much
                                     lower as for 6, is assumed to be proportional to the length of the pipelines (i.e. lowest for 3, the alternative
                                     with the shortest jetty).

No.    Effect                      Comments

                                                                                                                                                      1  2    3    4     5  6  7

6      Fisheries                   In the zone of the project (including locations of old jetty as well as of alternatives) fishing is not allowed    2  2    1    2     1  3  2
                                   for safety reasons. Therefore, there is no direct impact on fisheries caused by the project. A small indirect
                                   impact can be caused by affecting fish breeding and feeding habitats, which can have an effect on fish
                                   numbers in a wider area. This means that generally alternatives affecting mangroves (1, 2, 4, 7) would be
                                   less favourable as those that do not (3, 5 and 6). 6 is considered as potentially more dangerous due to
                                   the higher risk of oil spills.

7      Job opportunities           A big construction site of the type of the one for the new jetty generates a number of jobs, including jobs        2  2    3    2     1  4  2
                                   for unskilled labour. Although this will be only for a limited time (about 2 years), this still is a considerable
                                   positive effect for the region, from which also the nearby Hirgigo village should benefit. The number of
                                   jobs created will depend on the amount of work to be done, a longer jetty basically meaning more work
                                   than a shorter one. The least number of jobs would be crated by Alternative 6, since there is no jetty.

8      Interference with           The existing jetty must remain in operation throughout the construction period until such a time when the          3  3    1    3     1  1  2
       operation of existing jetty new jetty will be operable. Therefore, construction work must not interfere with the operation (i.e.
                                   unloading of tankers) at the old jetty. This risk of interference seems to be highest in alternatives closest
                                   to the existing jetty (i.e. 1, 2 and 4) and lowest in alternatives most distant from it (3, 5 and 6), with 7 in an
                                   intermediate position.

9      Demolition of old jetty     This activity can be seen similar to the construction of the new jetty: it must not interfere with the             3  3    1    3     1  1  2
                                   operation of the new jetty. Again, risk of interference decreases with increasing distance, therefore the
                                   same ranking applies.

10     Noise                       Some noise will result from the construction activity related to the project. There are three main sources of      3  3    2    3     5  1  4
                                   noise, namely (i) noise related to the construction of the new jetty as such, (ii) noise from traffic generated
                                   (transport of material to the construction site), and (iii) noise related to the demolition of the existing jetty,
                                   including transport of waste material to disposal areas. In comparing the alternatives it can be stated that
                                   (i) is of less importance the further away the site is from inhabited areas, meaning that 1, 2 and 4 have
                                   the most impact, 7 is intermediate and 3 and 5 have less impact, with 6 being the best since there is no
                                   jetty to be built; (ii) is the most significant noise source, with more impact for longer jetties (3 being better,
                                   5 worst), again with 6 as best solution; (iii) would be identical for all alternatives. Given the location of any
                                   alternative, overall noise is not a very decisive issue.

11     Air quality                 Air pollution is again largely restricted to the construction period. The works at the construction site are       3  3    2    3     5  1  4
                                   not significant enough to cause an impact on regional air quality, which makes material transport through
                                   inhabited areas the only (although still quite small) source of relevant air pollution. Like noise, the impact
                                   (and therefore the rank) is proportional to jetty length and amount of material required.

12     Water quality          Water quality, understood here as the water quality in the near shore sea area, is influenced by the          2   2    1    3     4  5   2
                              project mainly through oil spills (comprising both small losses due to leakage over longer periods and oil
                              spills due to accidents. Here, Alternative 3 is considered as presenting the smallest risk (shortest jetty,
                              marine offloading arms). Alternatives 1,2 and 7 rank second (offloading arms, but longer jetty than 3), Alt.
                              4 is similar, but with hoses instead of arms, therefore rank 3. Alt. 5 has a stretch of submarine pipelines
                              and hoses, therefore a greater risk, ranking 4. The last rank (5) is attributed to Alternative 6 (entirely
                              submarine pipelines).

13     Occupational health    This indicator measures risk to worker's health. Assuming good practice regarding health protection and       3   3    2    3     4  1   3
                              accident prevention procedures, the risk can be seen as roughly proportional to the amount of work to be
                              carried out, which again is related mainly to the amount of material required for the various alternatives.

14     Public health          The main gain in public health is the reduction of the risk of a major oil spill through replacement of the   1   1    1    1     1  1   1
                              old jetty. This effect is the same for all alternatives, therefore all are considered as being equally good.

ESIA Final Report                                                                  Page 46



              The result of this analysis is the following:

                  · Alternative 3 is still ranked as No. 1, with a considerable margin.

                  · However, Alternative 6 is on rank 2. This is due to the fact that this list of
                      indicators attributes rather a high importance to construction related activities,
                      where this alternative, not requiring a jetty, is consistently ranking as first.

                  · The other alternatives follow behind at a rather close distance.

              This result, therefore, while showing some difference in ranking, does not contradict the
              main conclusion of the one done on the basis of impact values: Alternative 3 results as
              the preferred option.

              This analysis, from a methodological point of view, raises the question whether all the
              indicators chosen are of the same importance, and what the result would be if different
              weights (or levels of importance) would be attributed to different indicators. It could be
              argued e.g., that in the light of the more detailed impact analysis (see Chapters 7 to 14)
              biodiversity should be considered as of much more importance than sea bed dynamics,
              or if socio-economic factors should be given a higher importance.

              These questions can be answered by means of a sensitivity analysis. For doing this,
              overall ranks are again calculated with the same ranking as shown in Table 4.4-1, but
              this time using various scenarios, each one attributing a different weight to certain
              indicators. If such differences in weight show a similar result, then the result can be
              considered as stable and therefore conclusive. If however the overall ranking of
              alternatives changes drastically by applying only slightly different weights, this would
              indicate an unstable and therefore not very conclusive result.

              For doing this, calculations have been made for the following five scenarios:

                  1. All equal: all indicators have the same importance, indicated by a weight of 1 for
                      each of them; this, obviously, is just a repetition of what is shown in Table 4.4-1.

                  2. Biodiversity: in this scenario, biodiversity is considered as more important,
                      expressed by a weight of 2 to these indicators; because of a potential high impact
                      on biodiversity, this same importance is also given to indicators related to
                      operation and demolition of the old jetty.

                  3. Biodiversity and oil spill risk: largely the same as case 2, but in addition oil spill
                      risk gets a high importance, given its potential impact on biodiversity.

                  4. Socio-economy: in this case, higher importance is attributed to socio-economic
                      and health related indicators.

                  5. Oil spill risk: finally, one case was calculated which attributes a very high
                      importance (6) to oil spill risk, given its potentially very serious impact if it
                      should happen, while all the other indicators are considered as of comparatively
                      minor importance (weight 1).

              The main results of this analysis are the following:

                  · Alternative 3 is consistently ranking as No. 1.

                  · Depending on indicator weights, the rank of the other alternatives changes to
                      some degree.

                  · Overall, Alternative 5 is on rank 2, Alternative 7 on rank 3, while the others (i.e.
                      all on site 1, north of the existing jetty, together with Alternative 6, submarine
                      pipelines, are ranked as least preferred options.

              Overall, the result of the ranking analysis can be characterised as rather stable and
              therefore conclusive.


4.5           Conclusions and Recommendations

              The following main conclusions can be drawn from the comparative analysis of the 7
              alternatives:

                  · The expected impacts of all the alternatives are all rather small. This means that
                      none of the alternatives could be ruled out based on one or several specific major
                      impacts. Applying the required cautions, each of the alternatives could be
                      implemented.

                  · Nevertheless, there are two alternatives which are not recommended due to one
                      single issue. These are:

                  · Alternative 6, due to the considerably higher risk of oil spills resulting from the
                      submarine pipelines, and

                  · Alternative 7, due to the risk of interference with the cooling water intake of
                      Hirgigo power plant.

                  · Overall and very consistently, Alternative 3 is on rank 1. It is definitely the
                      alternative with the least negative impacts.

              The question remains of a comparison with "Alternative 0", which would mean not to
              build a new jetty but rather to maintain the existing one. This option has already been
              ruled out by the feasibility study (RH 2006), given the bad condition of the existing
              structure and the associated high risk of a major accident. This view is entirely
              supported by the environmental impact assessment: the fact that the risk of a major
              accident happening at the existing oil jetty, with the risk of an oil spill that would affect
              the environment in Hirgigo Bay in a major way, is eliminated by building a new jetty, is
              a very considerable advantage not only from a point of view of oil supply for the
              country, but also from an environmental point of view. Each of the 7 alternatives would
              be better than the existing situation.

              Therefore, the decision to go ahead with Alternative 3, already taken by MPA based on
              technical and economic considerations, is supported also from an environmental point
              of view.

5             THE PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE


5.1           Selection of Alternative

              As already mentioned, Alternative 3 was selected as the preferred alternative resulting
              from technical and economic evaluations. This alternative is also the one which is being
              developed further by the Design Consultant.

              As the comparative evaluation in the previous chapter shows, from an environmental
              and social point of view there is no reason to give preference to another alternative. On
              the contrary, Alternative 3 is the one which shows, in the comparative analysis, the least
              adverse impacts and the largest environmental benefits of all the alternatives compared.

              For this reason, Alternative 3 is also the preferred alternative environmentally and
              socially. Therefore, the detailed impact assessment described in the following chapters
              focuses on Alternative 3; the other alternatives are not dealt with any longer.

              This Chapter, which is almost entirely based on the Feasibility and Preliminary Design
              Report (RH 2006), provides a comprehensive description of this alternative (Alternative
              3, the Project), including information on construction and operation as well as on the
              demolition of the existing jetty (which is an integral part of the Project as defined for the
              present ESIA Report). All impact assessments made in the following Chapters are based
              on this description. Further technical details can be found in the original RH Report.


5.2           Main Features

              The following description summarising main features of Alternative 3 was received
              from the Design Consultant:

              "Alternative 3 has been selected as the preferred design option. Our understanding of
              the features of this alternative, to be incorporated in the detail design, are summarised
              below:

                  · The indicative layout for Alternative 3 is as shown on Drawing M7320/22
                      (Figure 3-3 in the present Report).

                  · Depth of water at the berth is 13.5m ­ 15m.

                  · The largest vessel to be accommodated is a 50,000 DWT tanker. The smallest
                      vessel to be accommodated is the existing LPG tanker "Mereb Gas", 2,266
                      DWT with a length of 71.2 m.

                  · The jetty will comprise a rock bund in shallow water and a piled structure in
                      deep water.

                  · The berth at the end of the jetty shall comprise a jetty head, with space to turn
                      vehicles/small mobile crane, berthing dolphins, mooring dolphins and
                      interconnecting walkways.

                  · The tender documentation shall be based on placing three pipelines (fuel oil ­
                      estimated at 16" diameter, common line white products ­ estimated at 16"
                      diameter and LPG ­ estimated at 8" diameter). In addition, a further two
                      pipelines (jet A1/kero ­ estimated at 12" diameter and dedicated gasoline ­
                      estimated at 12" diameter) will be included in tender documentation as
                      "provisional items". Pipe diameters will be confirmed as part of the detail
                      design. The jetty shall be designed to accommodate these five pipelines and
                      provision for a future bitumen pipe with a diameter of 16".

                  · Ship to shore transfer of products will be by marine loading arms.

                  · Fire fighting equipment shall be provided as detailed in Section 5.6.4 of the
                      Preliminary Design Report, including a 12" diameter fire fighting salt water line
                      and a 6" spray and personnel protection line.

                  · A one-way access road is required on the rock bund/jetty to accommodate vans/
                      small mobile crane for maintenance purposes. The roadway will be at the same
                      level as the supporting surface for the pipelines (not above it as shown on the
                      preliminary design drawings). Pipelines will be located on either side of the
                      access road and/or on a pipe rack (not side-by-side on one side of the access
                      road as shown on the preliminary design drawings).

                  · The tender documents will be prepared on the basis of a single construction
                      contract including civil and M&E works, as recommended in the Preliminary
                      Design Report."

              Alternative 3 is located south of the existing facility. This location allows a shorter route
              to deep water for the jetty and also provides the opportunity to construct the jetty
              directly for vessels of 50'000 DWT, without a need for dredging. The pipelines will be
              supported by a combination of a rock bund of 625 m long and a 500 m long concrete
              trestle resulting in a total length of the jetty of 1'125 m. This alternative is based on 3
              product pipelines with one 8" for LPG, one 16" for black products (fuel oil) and one 16"
              line for white products, i.e. gasoline, gas oil and kerosene. Offloading operations will be
              carried out by use of marine loading arms, of which three will be installed at the jetty
              head. The mooring facilities will comprise 2 breasting dolphins and 4 mooring dolphins.
              Fenders will also be attached to the jetty head, which will function as breasting dolphin
              for the smallest vessels. The root of the jetty is approximately 850 m from the boundary
              of the existing Tamoil tank farm (source: RH 2006, p. 67).

              The assessment in the present ESIA Report is based on this description. Table 5-1
              summarises the main characteristics , while Fig. 5-1 shows the layout of Alternative 3.

              Note: in the Preliminary Design Report (RH 2006: 51), the dimensions of the alternative
              at Location 2 (South) are indicated as total length of 1'185 m, rock bund length 810 m,
              and trestle length 375 m. We assume that the figures given on p. 67 of the design report,
              where Alternative 3 is being described, are correct; however, even if in the final design
              there should be a slight modification of these dimensions, this would not affect the
              statements made in the ESIA Report in any major way.

                 One main point of discussion in the layout of the new jetty is the number of pipelines.
                 The project as described in the feasibility report foresees 1 pipeline for white products,
                 with enough space for adding 2 more instead at a later stage. Obviously, having 3
                 dedicated pipelines for white products would not only be an advantage from an
                 operational point of view (shorter offloading time), but also from an environmental one
                 (no need for flushing the pipeline with water, therefore considerable reduction in wasgte
                 water contaminated with oil). This point was discussed on Thursday, Feb. 7, 2008, in
                 MPA's Project Coordination Office, in a meeting with the Design Consultant. However,
                 on February 9 the Consultant was informed by MPA that at the present stage of the
                 Project, the design as given in the feasibility study still applied, and this not in the least
                 for budgetary reasons. Therefore, the description as provided above is the basis for the
                 following impact assessment.

5.3           Construction


5.3.1         Works

              It is important that during the construction of the new jetty, the old one can still be used,
              and that there is no disturbance of unloading operations caused by the construction of
              the new structure. The location of Alternative 3 is at a sufficient distance from the
              existing jetty so that no significant difficulties will be caused (RH 2006: 51; Figure 5-1).

              There are no rock outcrops on the alignment of the new jetty at the chosen location. The
              water depth at the location foreseen for the jetty head is typically around 15.0 m.
              Therefore, it is possible to accommodate 50'000 DWT without the need for dredging.

              With 850 m, this location is a considerable distance from the existing tank farm and
              there will be a need for the onshore pipes to cross behind the power station's water
              intake structure (Photos 4 to 6). To reach the jetty, the pipelines will have to cross the
              access road to the pumping station and then, behind this station, the underground
              cooling water intake pipes. This will complicate the construction, increase the cost of
              piping and present potential difficulties associated with accessing the facility and/or
              onshore pipelines through the power station site. It is important that for the design as
              well as for operation and maintenance purposes an agreement with the power station is
              reached, which takes into consideration the interests of both of these important
              structures, power plant as well as petroleum jetty.

              The first part of the jetty, in the shallow area near the coast (Photos 7 and 8), will be
              built as a rock bund with a length of 625 m. It will be designed to withstand a storm
              with a return period of 100 years, with only limited damage. It has been assumed that
              the subsoil will have sufficient bearing capacity to carry the load of the rock bund and
              the superimposed loading. This assumption is considered to be reasonable as the
              foundation of the existing jetty, which appears to be stable after more than 50 years,
              exerts a higher pressure under its concrete piers. It is intended that information on
              ground conditions beneath the bund will be obtained by the main contractor. According
              to information received from the Design Consultant, it will not be necessary to remove
              the sediment before construction of the bund. It will be built by tipping quarry run or
              small rock with dump trucks or lorries. This layer will then be covered by a double layer
              of armour units of 400-1500 kg, placed by a crane.

              The remaining part of the jetty, with a length of 500 m, will be built as a concrete jetty
              structure. This structure comprises a cross beam supporting a roadway and the pipelines.
              The cross beam is supported by a main girder, which is supported by tubular steel piles
              every 12 m. Figure A5-1 (Drawing M7320/08 of the Preliminary Design Report)
              presents a cross-section of the structure. Due to the expected presence of coral rock, it
              will not be feasible to use driven concrete piles as they would be damaged when trying
              to drive them through the coral rock. Steel piles will therefore be adopted for all piled
              alternatives. The contractor will be free to propose alternative pile types, including
              bored piles, if he wishes.

              The jetty head comprises a concrete deck to support the equipment for offloading the
              vessel. The deck will be supported by tubular steel piles. Dolphins will be used for

              mooring. Fenders will be attached to both the jetty head and the breasting dolphins, see
              Figure A5-1. Catwalks (personnel walkways) are provided between the platforms, the
              mooring dolphins and the breasting dolphins. The catwalks will be a horizontal steel
              tubular section or truss with a deck and handrails.


5.3.2         Construction Materials

              The Preliminary Design Report provides some information on construction material
              (RH 2006: 70). According to this, for the economic assessment it is important whether
              materials need to be imported or whether they can be produced in the country. This will
              also have some effects on environmental impacts.

              The materials for construction of the jetty can be roughly divided into the following
              groups:

                  · Rock: will be used for the rock bund and as aggregate for concrete and road
                      works. Based on the information in the Port Master Plan and the site visits it has
                      been believed that rock and aggregates will be available, in sufficient quantities
                      and of sufficient quality, in the neighbourhood of the project site. For the time
                      being, the quarry to be used for this purpose has not been identified as yet.

                  · Concrete: is produced in Eritrea using local materials. There is a cement plant in
                      Massawa, but there may be a need to import additional cement.

                  · Steel: there is no steel industry in Eritrea. Although limited amounts of scrap
                      steel might be available it has been assumed that all steel elements for
                      construction of the jetty must be imported.

                  · Equipment: it has been assumed that all equipment for the jetty must be
                      imported.


5.3.3         Construction Site

              Although for the feasibility study no topographic survey has been conducted, it is
              apparent that there is sufficient space available to set up a construction site for the
              contractor (RH 2006: 71).

              The camp which was used by the Korean contractor (see Photo 4) for the construction
              of the power plant is still in place, suitably located between the tank farm and the power
              plant, and according to the power plant superintendent, Mr. Muhammed Idris, it is being
              used occasionally to house contractor staff doing maintenance work in the power plant.
              An agreement should be reached between the contractor for building the new jetty and
              the power plant for using this existing infrastructure to the extent possible. This would
              not only save costs, but also prevent the occupation of additional land for the
              construction of a new camp.


5.3.4         Access Routes

              There are two main access routes for road traffic to the project site, as shown in the
              following Figure.

Massawa Port Authority                                                           PÖYRY ENERGY LTD.

ESIA Final Report                                                                Page 55




Figure 5-2:   Road network in the project area
              Source: RH 2006: 71

              According to the Feasibility Study (RH 2006: 71), "Trucks can either reach the site via a
              Northern route via Massawa or via a Southern route via Hargigo. In both cases the
              trucks will have to pass through the outskirts of these cities. Although it would be
              preferable if trucks could access the construction site without passing residential areas,
              it is considered that this would be acceptable. The access routes for trucks with rock will
              depend on the origin of the rock. The access for trucks carrying steel and concrete will
              be via the city of Massawa. Depending on the method of the contractor steel piles could
              be transported to the site by barges, which would significantly reduce the inconvenience
              for people along the access route."

              Several points have to be made in this respect:

                   · The southern road does not actually pass through the village of Hirgigo (which
                      is a small village, and can certainly not be termed a city, between this road and
                      the sea, called "Hargigo" or "Hirghigo" on some maps). Traffic on this road
                      therefore would not pass through inhabited areas.

                   · However, a short stretch south of the jetty location, the metalled surface ends
                      and from there on the road is a dirt road. This leads to the suspension of a lot of
                      dust due to traffic. However, even so the village would not be affected in any
                      major way since all the houses are at a distance of at least about 100 m from the
                      road, and during the day wind coming from the sea prevails.

                   · This southern road, however, could be used in any case only for the transport of
                      rock material in case a quarry south of the site would be used. All other
                      transports would have to come from north.

                   · If a quarry more to the north of the site would be used, then transport of this
                      material would cross the outskirts of Massawa. There are several sites where
                      rock or gravel is being obtained from along the road leading from Massawa to
                      Ghinda, and quite close to Massawa, and it would seem likely that one of these
                      sites would be used for obtaining rock and gravel for the new jetty (provided of
                      course, that the material proves to be suitable for the purpose).

Petroleum Jetty ESIA                                                             Date March 25, 2008
ESIA Final Report                                                                Page 56


                  · All other transports (cement from the cement factory and all imported goods
                      being brought to the site from Massawa Port) would actually have to pass
                      through Massawa city. In this sense, barging of steel to the construction site
                      could actually reduce traffic impact on residential areas.


5.4           Pipelines

              The plan for the new jetty is to have three pipelines for products (1 for LPG, one for
              black products, i.e. fuel oil, and one for white products, i.e. gasoline, gas oil and
              kerosene; see Section 5.2). This is the same situation as on the existing jetty, requiring a
              flushing out of the pipeline for white products when changing from one product to the
              next, with the corresponding problem of a considerable amount of water contaminated
              with oil products, which have to be treated before being released back to the sea. The
              jetty is dimensioned with enough space for putting an additional two pipelines in order
              to have dedicated pipelines for white products; several of the stakeholders had already
              expressed their wish for such dedicated pipelines, which would not only reduce the
              amount of waste water, but would also permit offloading tankers in a shorter time
              (which in turn saves costs).

              In the ongoing detailed design there is still a discussion on whether to have 5 pipelines
              for products instead of two, i.e. a dedicated pipeline for each of the white products (RH
              and MPA, oral communication, Feb. 7, 2008). This would be a considerable
              improvement of the design not only from an operational, but also from an
              environmental point of view. However, as mentioned above, at this point in time the
              assumption is that there will be only one pipeline for white products.

              In addition to these 3 pipelines for products, there will be 2 pipelines for water for fire
              fighting purposes.


5.5           Operation and Maintenance

              From a maintenance point of view, a jetty is the most attractive option (as opposed to a
              solution with submarine pipelines, as was Alternative 6). All the equipment will be
              placed on the jetty structure, which eases inspection and testing of the equipment. It also
              presents the least risk of (undetected) oil spillage. The Design Contractor was of the
              opinion, however, that the construction of a jetty would have greater environmental
              impacts than laying a pipeline directly on the seabed. Although the jetty is fixed in its
              position, it can handle a wide range of products. Should the need arise to handle other
              liquid bulk products, such as vegetable oil, molasses etc., the required pipelines and
              manifolds can be simply added to the jetty, which would be more difficult in a solution
              with submarine pipelines (RH 2006: 44).

              From a jetty, it is simple to carry out visual inspections of the equipment and operations
              at all times. Corrosion of a sub-sea pipeline may not be noticed until the line breaks
              during cargo handling operations; this would not only lead to a major oil spill, but it
              would also mean a loss of oil, and therefore water contamination, over a prolonged
              period. Although the quantities seeping out would be rather small, it could still mean a
              considerable impact on the marine environment, depending mainly on how long such a
              situation might go undetected. Therefore, with a jetty, the environmental impact of an
              accident is lower and mitigation is easier. However, according to the Design Contractor,

Petroleum Jetty ESIA                                                            Date March 25, 2008

              the construction of a supporting jetty will have greater adverse environmental effects
              than installation of a sub-sea pipeline, which in his opinion offsets the operational
              benefits of a jetty (RH 2006: 47); this issue has been addressed in the previous Chapter,
              where environmental impacts of the different alternatives were discussed.

              Corrosion protection of the steel works: The design will have to take into account that
              all the areas above the water level will have to be coated and that maintenance of the
              coating should be considered. Alternatively, piles could be provided with an internal pile
              plug at the top or sleeved in concrete at the top for corrosion protection (RH 2006: 56).
              According to the ongoing development in design of the new jetty, it is planned to place
              steel pipes on the ground and drill through these pipes into the ground for the foundation
              of the piles. The steel pipes and drill holes will then be filled with concrete as the
              supporting structure of the trestle, while the outer steel cases will no longer have any
              function and will be eroded away over time (RH, oral comm., February 7, 2008).


5.6           Demolition of the Old Jetty


5.6.1         Description of the Structure

              It is important that the existing jetty will have to remain in operation until the new one
              can be used. This is also one reason why the new structure can not be immediately
              adjacent to the existing one, since interference between construction activities for the
              new jetty and normal operations of the old one have to be avoided. Once the new jetty is
              in operating conditions, the old one will have to be removed.

              According to the Preliminary Design Report (RH 2006: 95), the existing jetty is
              approximately 4.3 m wide by 760 m long. It is supported by 284 pairs of concrete
              columns (believed to be un-reinforced), at approximately 2.7 m centres longitudinally,
              founded on a rock rubble mound placed on the sea bed. Some of the pairs of columns
              are surrounded by concrete plinths at their bases. Transverse reinforced concrete beams
              are supported on pairs of columns. They are cantilevered beyond the outer face of the
              columns and longitudinal edge beams, which stiffen the deck edge, are provided at the
              end of these cantilevers. The reinforced concrete deck is about 250 mm thick and spans
              between the transverse beams. The concrete columns appear to be in reasonable
              condition and have sound foundations. However, the reinforced concrete superstructure
              (comprising the transverse beams, deck and edge beams) is generally in a very poor
              condition. Extensive spalling of the concrete has occurred and reinforcement is exposed
              over large areas. In some places, loss of the edge of the deck and the transverse beam
              cantilevers has already occurred.

              The jetty head has concrete walls founded on a rock rubble mound. It is about 65 m
              long, increasing from 6 m wide at the landward end to approximately 36 m wide at the
              outer end. The deck of the jetty head is also formed in concrete and may be cast on top
              of rock or other imported soil filling, placed between the walls. The concrete in the jetty
              head is suffering some deterioration, spalling and cracking but it appears to be in a
              reasonable condition.

              Beyond the jetty head is an isolated dolphin located approximately 250 m seaward of
              the jetty head. The form of construction for the dolphin is not certain, but it would
              appear to be a gravity structure.

ESIA Final Report                                                               Page 58


              There are three rigid pipelines running the full length of the jetty; a 10" fuel oil pipe, a
              10" white products pipe, for the import of gasoline, gas oil and jet fuel/kerosene and a
              6" LPG pipe. From the end of the jetty, the pipes run along the seabed to the dolphin.
              The white products pipe and the LPG pipes terminate in fixed manifold connections on
              the dolphin. The fuel oil pipe is connected to an 8" flexible submarine hose, the end of
              which is hoisted to a vessel at a marker buoy, located beyond the dolphin. All pipes are
              located on roller type or wye-type shoe supports. The pipework and fittings are
              generally in reasonable condition but pipe supports are in poor condition.


5.6.2         Maintenance Work

              The report on jetty inspection and interventions (RH 2005) identified the structural
              weaknesses of the existing jetty and recommends interventions to assure its use until the
              new jetty will be operating. This report compared and evaluated 6 options for such
              interventions as follows:

                  · Option 1: extend the existing rock rubble mound to one side of the jetty,
                     disconnect the pipes at each end of the jetty, relay the existing pipes or place
                     new (possibly flexible) pipes on the rubble mound, reconnect the ends of the
                     pipes.

                  · Option 2: disconnect the pipes at each end of the jetty, relay the pipes on new
                     supports on the existing jetty (at c. 8m centres) located directly over the existing
                     columns, reconnect the ends of the pipes.

                  · Option 3: extend the existing rock rubble mound on both sides of the jetty,
                     install new concrete or brickwork piers (at c. 8m centres), jack up the pipes
                     directly over the new piers (where necessary) and install new pipe supports.

                  · Option 4: install extendable steel props between the existing column plinths or
                     the existing rock rubble mound and the underside of the deck/transverse beams
                     immediately below the existing supports, replace the existing pipe supports,
                     where necessary.

                  · Option 5: Fabricate approximately 95 steel frames and transport them to site,
                     erect steel frames (at c. 8m centres) located directly over the existing columns,
                     install steel U-bars to support the pipes.

                  · Option 6: Transport approximately 95 steel sections (probably square hollow
                     sections) approximately 4 meters long to site, place steel sections beneath the
                     pipes (at c. 8m centres) at locations directly over the existing columns, provide
                     new pipe supports on top of the beams.

              The options were compared regarding advantages and disadvantages, including cost and
              time needed for implementation, and finally Option 6 was recommended for being
              carried out.

              Concerning the implementation of this work, the report says (RH 2005: 16):

ESIA Final Report                                                                 Page 59


              "It is further recommended that the existing Approach Jetty superstructure should not be
              used for construction traffic during the implementation of the interventions. It may be
              possible to carry small steel sections on to the structure by hand. However, even this
              approach involves some risk to the integrity of the jetty and to the safety of the
              labourers.

              An alternative and safer approach would be to construct a temporary crushed rock
              platform (adjacent to the jetty) and use this for construction traffic. It may be possible to
              operate the construction equipment on the seabed with a platform, but as the depth of
              the soft mud is unknown, no guarantee can be given in this respect."

              According to information received (MPA, Feb. 1, 2008: oral communication), a tender
              was put out for this work and a contract was granted to a local company for carrying out
              the work, however, work had not yet started at that time. A discussion with the
              contractor (Massawa, Feb. 5, 2008) revealed that Option 6 as described above, i.e.
              transverse steel supports for the pipelines, will be implemented. The material will be
              carried out to the jetty by manpower, no vehicles will be used on the jetty, and no lateral
              platform will be built. This work is planned to be carried out over approximately the
              next two months (i.e. March and April 2008), and the intention is just to minimise the
              risk of an accident happening on the jetty during the construction period, until the new
              jetty will be functional.


5.6.3         Preparation for Demolition

              It is foreseen to demolish the existing structure once the new facility is commissioned.
              However, before demolition can start, it will be necessary to purge the products from
              the pipes. The pipes then will need to be flushed and, possibly, pigged. The purged
              product will need to be stored and separated. For the LPG pipe, this process may
              involve the need for a specialised vessel.

              It will be important to treat the waste water resulting from purging the existing pipelines
              before releasing it to the sea.

              In an e-mail communication received from RH (Jan. 28, 2008), the following
              explanation was given as to how the demolition work is planned to be carried out:

              "As explained in the Report, it is envisaged to construct a temporary crushed rock
              platform in order to carry out the demolition works. This platform will be located
              adjacent to the jetty and it will have approximately the same length of the jetty in order
              to provide access to the cranes / plant needed for the demolition works. The width of the
              platform should be enough to provide access to cranes / plant (approximately 8 to 10m).
              The platform will sit on the sea bed.

              Please note that the remedial works of the existing jetty are currently under way. If such
              a platform has been constructed, it is likely that it will be used for the demolition works.
              If that is the case, the characteristics of the platform will have to be provided by the
              contractor in charge of the remedial works."

              Concerning this last remark, refer to what was said in Section 5.6.2: the work as
              foreseen now will not imply the construction of a platform.

5.6.4         Demolition Work

              The sea adjacent to the jetty approach is too shallow to allow the use of marine craft for
              the demolition work. In addition, given the poor condition of the existing jetty
              superstructure, this does not seem safe for being used for demolition equipment.

              The only practical approach to carrying out the demolition works is to construct a
              temporary crushed rock platform (adjacent to the jetty) and to use this for cranes and
              other demolition plant. Demolition of the dolphin and the removal of the submarine
              pipes and the buoys will need to be carried out using marine craft and divers.

              According to the Feasibility Report, the final decision on how to demolish the jetty will
              be the main contractor's, however, it is assumed that the demolition will take place in
              the following way (RH 2006: 97-98):

                  · "The demolition should be undertaken according to a defined sequence, starting
                      with the removal of the existing pipework and fittings, followed by the removal
                      of the intervention works before the structure is demolished.

                  · The pipe will need to be broken down into manageable sections and removed.
                      Dismantling the underwater section of the pipe will require the use of divers.

                  · The removal of the intervention works should be carried out carefully and the
                      steel sections handed over to the Client for possible re-use.

                  · Where possible, the contractor should aim to break the elements of the structure
                      into large pieces to minimise the amount of small pieces of debris that fall on to
                      the sea bed.

                  · The superstructure of the jetty approach, deck and transverse beams and edge
                      beams, should be removed together. Due to its poor condition, the superstructure
                      will need to be broken down into relatively small pieces (probably with a length
                      not greater than a single span of approximately 2.7 metres) and carefully lifted
                      off of the columns. Any attempt to lift large sections of the superstructure is
                      likely to result in the failure of the section. Some littering of the sea bed is
                      inevitable during the demolition but this will not be a major issue, since there is
                      already a considerable amount of debris on the bed where significant spalling of
                      concrete has occurred and parts of the structure have previously failed.

                  · The individual columns on the jetty approach can be lifted from the sea bed in
                      one piece. Where there are plinths around pairs of columns, it may be necessary
                      to break the plinth into two pieces prior to lifting. Each column can then be
                      removed with half of the plinth.

                  · The deck of the jetty head can be broken into manageable pieces and removed.
                      If, as expected, the infill between the walls of the jetty head comprises rock or
                      other imported soil filling, the material can be removed by excavator. The
                      concrete walls of the jetty head can then be removed in sections.

                  · It would be preferable to remove the existing dolphin in one piece because
                      removing it in pieces would involve the need for specialist equipment capable of

                      breaking the structure underwater and will result in some debris falling on to the
                      sea bed. However, depending on the plant readily available to the contractor, this
                      may not be possible due the weight of the structure.

                  ·   Once the demolition is substantially complete, there will be a need to remove the
                      temporary works rubble mound bund and the worst of the debris from the sea
                      bed. It will not to fully remove this material and there is little merit in attempting
                      to do so. Indeed, such an attempt is likely to result in environmental damage."


5.6.5         Disposal of Demolition Waste

              The Feasibility Report assumes that it may be possible to find some use for the existing
              pipework, although it does not recommend that it be used on the new jetty. Otherwise, it
              could be used as scrap steel.

              The concrete could be crushed and used as general fill material (e.g. in road
              construction). However, it is pointed out that it would not be suitable for use as a
              concrete aggregate, due to the likely high chloride content.

              Steel reinforcement recovered from the crushed concrete can be used as scrap steel.


5.7           Construction Schedule

              The Feasibility Study estimated that the construction works including mobilisation and
              commissioning will take 19 months. The project would be completed by the demolition
              of the existing jetty, which is estimated to take a further 3 months bringing the entire
              duration of construction activities to a total of 22 months (see following Figure).

              Environmental management measures, to be defined below, will have to be integrated in
              this overall schedule. The way in which this will have to be done is shown in the EMP
              (Vol. 4) of this study.

                    · Those that are actively involved in the project, e.g. MPA, MOPW, Tamoil, PCE,
                           Ministry of Energy and Mines.

                    · Those that have an official say in the project, e.g. DOE, DOF, Massawa
                           Municipality, and Northern Red Sea Zone.

                    · Those that could possibly be affected by the project, e.g. population at Massawa
                           and Hirgigo, ECMIB and Manzanar Project.

6.2.1         Actively Involved

              Stakeholder involvement for the first group hinges on three issues: (i) Construction of
              the new jetty, (ii) Oil spillage and contingency plan, and (iii) Demolition and disposal of
              the old jetty.

              Views on Construction of the New Jetty

              MPA is the Client and as such is the owner of the project. It will oversee the
              implementation of the project. The new jetty will start with 3 pipelines but there will be
              ample space left for future installation of other pipelines to cater for each product

              All those actively involved in the project would like to have dedicated pipelines for the
              5 products, if the budget allows this. The present jetty uses 3 pipelines to discharge the 5
              products ­ one for fuel oil, one for white products (kerosene, gasoil and gasoline) and
              one for LPG.

              Tamoil expressed that it would like to have three things in the project.

                  · Input in the design of the jetty.

                  · Tamoil would also like dedicated pipelines.

                  · Fire fighting mechanism should be included in the new jetty

              PCE prefers a pipeline for each product received, thus they can discharge products at
              the same time. Otherwise with the present 3 pipelines they use up to sixty hours
              discharging time, in comparison with the standard number of hours for discharging
              which is 36 hours, had each product its own pipeline.

              Views on the Oil Spillage and Contingency Plan

              According to MPA, there is a contingency plan for fires, accidents and oil spill for the
              Port, and it has been there for 10 years. There is also a committee for safety and
              environment. The plan is, however, not institutional/not constitutional. Fire fighting and
              spill is the responsibility of the corporation, i.e. MPA. The lines are the joint
              responsibility of all users, for example, in case of fire. Whereas lines for oil companies
              like Tamoil, are under the specific responsibility of the company. In addition MPA
              stressed that in the case of spillage, all are responsible i.e. MPA, PCE, ships. The
              equipment for handling spills is relatively new, from 2006. Emphasis is on MPA as the
              owner of the project and is responsible for administering it.

              Tamoil has no contingency plan in the case of oil spillage, fires or accidents. Tamoil
              should have such a plan and it should comply with international standards. The
              company contends that any spill should be contained within the depot. Tamoil has
              employed someone responsible for emergency situations. At present an Emergency
              Response Plan is being worked out.

              Tamoil has to have environmental audits regularly, but just one has been done in 2004
              by a firm from Kenya and it was found that no soil or oil underground had high contents
              of carbon. It is of interest, whether the person checking for environmental
              contamination works together with the Department of Environment personnel. An
              officer from the department has checked once whether there was any environmental
              non-compliance. It is recommended that at least once a year, soil samples should be
              taken and checked for contamination.

Petroleum Jetty ESIA                                                             Date March 25, 2008
ESIA Final Report                                                                Page 65


              According to PCE, there has not been any big scale spillage. A contingency plan on
              how to deal with large spillages was drafted and discussed with stakeholders during a
              workshop. The Plan has not yet been completed, the MPA is finalising it.

              The Consultant found that the query on "who took responsibility was there to be an oil
              spill" was not really answered. It is difficult to pinpoint which stakeholder will take the
              lead. It can be concluded that the important issue is to have a clear-cut contingency plan
              that spells out the roles and responsibility of actively involved stakeholders in the case
              of oil spillage. The overall responsibility of who takes charge and what is done must be
              clearly stated. With regard to environment safety, there must be an institution that takes
              the lead. The Consultant has drawn up contingency plan for the new jetty (see Vol. 2). It
              recommends that MPA take the lead.

              Views on Old Jetty Demolition and Disposal of Debris

              MPA held that it was imperative to demolish the old jetty, at some point in time, once
              the new jetty was up and operating. However, the Consultant holds that if possible it
              could be an alternative to let the old jetty stay so as not to disturb habitat in the sea,
              marine life has already been established at the base of the jetty. Cutting off just the top
              part of the jetty to preserve the part in the sea could be an option, thereby creating least
              disturbance to both marine life and established habitat. The jetty will eventually
              crumble gradually on its own.

              MPA is of the view on disposal of debris from the old jetty that "Approval of
              stakeholders will be sought; this includes the municipality and environment department
              being involved". The municipality is involved as it collects rubble; metal scraps are
              collected, sorted and if usable can be sold.

              Tamoil does not see any negative impacts ­ they would like to be allowed to operate in
              a safe way, hence their emphasis that maintenance and repair of the old jetty while the
              new one is being constructed should be carried out. However, as the jetty now stands
              Tamoil contends that it does not own it, but just uses it to offload their products. Tamoil
              further underlines that it is not companies that are going to be responsible for the old
              jetty, and this should be clear, it is the Petroleum Corporation of Eritrea that has the
              responsibility of jetty maintenance. This has been confirmed by the Consultant and
              intervention works on the old jetty will start soon. The Consultant has met the
              contractor going to carry out the works. This calls for immediate identification of jetty
              owner and responsibility placed where it should be. There is a high risk that should an
              accident occur it would have adverse effects of great magnitude.

              PCE holds that the concrete of the old jetty should be crushed and used as ballast (fill-in
              material). The pipelines can be cut after being flashed out with water. The pipelines can
              be reused.


6.2.2         Actively Involved Stakeholders with an Official Say in the Project:

              MOPW's Department of Infrastructure has a role to play in as far as the structure is
              on land. Since the new jetty will be a structure out at sea, the DOE's Guidelines on the
              Environment will be applied. In addition, DOE has the responsibility to verify that
              construction complies with set standards.

Petroleum Jetty ESIA                                                            Date March 25, 2008
ESIA Final Report                                                               Page 66


              On disposal of materials from the old jetty the MOPW was of the opinion that normally
              the employer is responsible; in this case, it is Massawa Port Authority. The site that will
              be chosen is done so following the Environmental Guidelines and the site is not paid for
              as all land belongs to the Government. Environmental issues and the public works are
              intertwined and the project has to go hand-in-hand.

              Ministry of Energy (MOE) possesses land where the new jetty will be constructed.
              There is ample land in the vicinity of Hirgigo power plant to accommodate the project.
              MOE's involvement is tied to land contribution. Through construction of the new jetty,
              Hirgigo would be ensured ample supply of oil and a continuous supply of electricity to
              the consumers.

              MOF Regulatory Department's concern is the disturbance of the biological setting,
              during construction of the new jetty and demolition of the old jetty: Within the project
              area are habitats of high value for the biodiversity (corals and mangroves). The main
              concern is the destruction of the corals due to the mobilisation of sediments.

              Department of Environment (DOE) within the Ministry of Land, Water and
              Environment, made it clear that the project should not affect the biodiversity of the
              coastal zone. Emphasis was on the clear formulation of the specific mitigation measures
              and specific actions to be taken by whom, when and how.

              Massawa Municipality: Massawa City Administration holds the view that with regard
              to disposal, the corporation or individual that wants to dispose scrap material normally
              pays a fee for the where the scraps will be dumped. Disposal site is at Mukulu, around
              11 km from Massawa. The responsible persons within the Environment Department and
              the Municipality work together to determine the type of waste and the method of
              disposal of the waste. They follow the set guidelines.

              Massaw City administration gets paid for services rendered (disposal of waste).
              Massawa Municipality being part of the local government takes into account its
              generation of income for services offered, in this case the land for waste disposal, which
              could otherwise have been developed for other income generating purposes. On the
              other hand, the principal issue with regard to land identified as disposal site must fall
              within the environmental policy and guidelines framework, exercised by the state.

              North Red Sea Zone is the regional Administration. The Administrator was informed
              of the project since it is within the region.

              TOR stakeholders' preferences are included in the Table below:

               Client                       prefer dedicated pipelines for each product.

               Ministry of Public Works     Dept. of Environment guidelines will be applied with regard to new jetty,
                                            as it is out at sea.

               Ministry of Fisheries, North There is concern for refilling; soil used is poisoning the coral. When the
               Red Sea Zone                 jetty is built, make sure not to disturb the biological setting.

                                            The bay is important; mangroves are for fish ensuring they get organic
                                            matter.

               City                         project can affect village, etc.

               Petroleum Corporation of     PCE prefers a pipeline for each product received (dedicated pipelines),
               Eritrea                      budget allowing, thus they can discharge products at the same time. With
                                            the increased consumption of bitumen in both Asmara and Massawa, the
                                            product needs its own pipe.

               Department of Environment    A step-by-step process in the mitigation of all negative impacts and how
                                            the management plan is to be implemented.

               Tamoil Eritrea Limited       Would like to rehabilitate their depot to acceptable standards. With
                                            regard to oil jetty, Tamoil would like input into the design. Would also
                                            prefer to have dedicated pipelines for each product. Fire fighting
                                            mechanism should be included in the new jetty.




              Summarily, all stakeholders in TOR advocate for dedicated pipelines, budget allowing.
              Of crucial importance is the need to streamline responsibility where oil spillage is
              concerned. A step-by-step approach of what happens, who does what and who takes the
              lead must be spelt out, should such an accident occur. The demolition and disposal of
              the old jetty's scraps will be based on set Environmental Guidelines, though these are
              yet to be decreed. It is clear that all land belongs to the Government and land to be used
              as a dumping site for the jetty scraps is identified by the Massawa City Administration
              and the DOE after type of waste and method of disposal have been worked out. For the
              Fisheries Ministry, maintaining the biodiversity takes precedence in this project.


6.2.3         Stakeholders Possibly Affected by the Project

              This group of stakeholders includes the populations at Hirgigo village and Massawa,
              Ministry of Tourism (MOT) the Eritrea Free Zone and the projects carried in the
              surrounding areas such as ECMIB and Manzanar.

              Concerning the populations of Massawa and Hirgigo, there will be:

                   · No physical no physical displacement as such, as none of the land they are on
                       will be taken over by the project.

                   · No economic displacement, again none of their land or property will be
                       expropriated.

                   · No limitation of access to resources. Although a number of the people are
                       engaged in fishing, this is not done in the part of Hirgigo Bay around the project

Massawa Port Authority                                                          PÖYRY ENERGY LTD.

                      site, as this is a secured area. Most fishing is done around Green Island and in
                      the far waters for those with big boats.

                  · Job opportunities, however these will be limited in time and it is not known how
                      many will be employed.

              For the above reasons, a Resettlement Action Plan outline will not be prepared by the
              Consultant, as no compensation issues arise.

              The socio-economist at ECMIB stressed the involvement of villages, as all have
              fishermen who fish around Green Island and even in and around the project area, albeit
              it being a restricted area. Small fishermen and villagers' livelihoods become an
              important issue, which justifies villagers' involvement in the project. The mangrove
              project that also involves Hirgigo village might be affected, minimally, in so far as
              disturbance of the seabed occurs. Involvement of villagers and the population of
              Massawa, here defined as the project population (PP) is first and foremost on providing
              labour force to the project. Secondly, the project could demonstrate its social
              responsibility and provide funds to extend the mangrove project to other coastlines or
              villages.

              All other possibly affected stakeholders identify the project as positive. The project may
              have a direct influence on employment of villagers and the Massawa population;
              furthermore the project could have an influence on the economic activities (bars,
              restaurants, shops, etc.).

              Manzanar project: is a poverty-reduction project. It distributes mangrove seedlings to
              villagers and trains them in maintaining the mangrove plantations for fodder,
              construction material, fuel wood and medicine. Besides the mangroves create a diverse
              habitat for fish, birds, etc. and prevent the erosion of the coastline. Hirgigo village
              wishes to have the ongoing Manzanar project, which at the moment covers a stretch of
              the coastline of Hirgigo Bay, to be extended. That would improve the village's present
              situation.

              The Eritrea Free Zone (EFZ) sees the new jetty as having a positive impact. They are
              of the opinion that it is an avenue for more investors, who were also interested in using
              the new jetty for oil products, e.g. edible crude oil. This would be an opportunity that
              the investors who would like to have pipelines could assist with additional funds.

              The Ministry of Tourism (MOT) does not see major negative impacts, as tourism
              activities are quite distant from the project site. However, MOT welcomes the
              Integrated Coastal Management System. It will be the country's binding regulation on
              ensuring that activities at sea and along the coast comply with the set-guidelines on
              environment.

                                        and later constructing a refinery for the oil to be refined.

               Ministry of Tourism,     With regard to the new jetty project, there is nothing that can be affected by
               Massawa Branch           the project on tourism.

               Ministry of Tourism,     The Integrated Coastal Management System will be introduced in the

               Asmara                   country to ensure activities comply with environment set guidelines. At this
                                        point in time, there are no negative impacts from the project that can be
                                        identified/are foreseen, as the tourism area is quite distant from the project
                                        area.

               Manzanar Project         If affected would like project to assist in expanding mangrove area
                                        coverage along the coastline.

              In summary, opportunities in employment, expanding the mangrove project and
              attracting new investors are of importance to identified stakeholders. MOT sees the
              project as an opportunity to apply and reinforce the Integrated Coastal Management
              System.


6.3           Stakeholder Workshops

              At the request of the Consultant, two stakeholder workshops were held, one in Asmara
              on February 4, and one in Massawa on February 5, 2008, where the main results of the
              ESIA Study were presented and the participants were given the opportunity to clarify
              certain points or to discuss and give their first comments on the report. The list of
              participants as well as the slides presented at the workshop are given in Annex A6-2.

7             PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT


7.1           Land Use


7.1.1         Existing Situation

              Massawa Municipality has a zoning plan which defines the dedication of the areas for
              specific uses within the municipality (see Figure 7.1-1).

              To the south-west of the city as such, i.e. of the residential and commercial area, there is
              a large industrial zone, separated from the residential area by a buffer zone of a width of
              almost a kilometre. Within this zone, in the part between the road leading from
              Massawa south towards Higigo, for the time being there is only the tank farm with the
              existing jetty and the Hirgigo Power Plant with its appurtenant structures (intake and
              outlet channel). This part of the industrial zone is fenced off and guarded, only
              authorised personnel of the companies and authorities involved in the two plants are
              allowed to access it. Guards are located at the entrance gates, but also on the seaward
              site of the area to prevent illicit entrance from this side.

              All the project alternatives, including the preferred Alternative 3, lie within this
              industrial zone. The land within this area is not used for any other purpose than for these
              two plants. The soil is sandy, with very sparse vegetation (see Photo 4). There are no
              inhabitants, whether authorised or illicit.

              Between the tank farm and the power plant, there is the camp which was originally built
              by the Korean contractor for housing the workers involved in power plant construction
              (Photo 4). This infrastructure is still being used by the power plant to house
              maintenance workers. A rather vast area to the west (inland) of the power plant is being
              used as storage area. The major part of the land between power plant and the coastline,
              i.e. the area where the new jetty will be built, was used for depositing excavation
              material from power plant construction. Here, the terrain was heightened by about one
              metre, thus reducing the area covered with water at exceptionally high tides behind the
              coastal dune. The value of this land as habitat for any species is very small, if any (see
              Photos 5-7).

              The distance form the project site to any sensitive areas is rather large. The nearest
              residential area, on the southernmost tip of Taulud Island, is at a distance of about
              1.5 km from the jetty head. The tourist zones on Taulud and Massawa Islands (mixed
              with residential and commercial uses) are at even larger distances, with no direct view
              to the jetty. Green Island, which is a tourist zone entirely for recreational purposes,
              without any housing facilities, is almost 3 km away.

              Given this spatial arrangement of land use, with clear demarcation of use types and long
              distances between sensitive areas and the industrial zone (project site), there in no
              disturbance of sensitive areas cause by the existing jetty. The project area, as this entire
              industrial zone, is also not of any tourist interest (Ministry of Tourism, Massawa branch,
              oral communication, Nov. 2, 2007).

7.1.2         Project Impacts

              The Project will affect the following areas:

                  · Pipelines on land: from the tank farm to the access road to the cooling water
                      pumping station, crossing this road and the subterranean cooling water pipelines
                      leading to the power plant, then the land between pumping station and power
                      plant to the starting point of the jetty itself.

                  · On land part of the new jetty, about 100 m long, in the area in front of the power
                      plant between intake and outlet channels.

                  · Jetty in the shallow part of the bay in front of the power plant.

              As described above, this land is part of a dedicated industrial zone. The impacts on any
              form of land use can be described as follows:

                  · There is no type of use of this land for residential and agricultural purposes,
                      therefore no impact on such uses (see also Chapter 6).

                  · The area is of no tourist interest, and it is too far away from tourist areas as to
                      have any negative effect on those; therefore there is no impact on tourism.

                  · There is no indication of any physical cultural property in the project area. The
                      important cultural site in this region is the old Massawa town on the southern
                      half of Massawa Island, far away from the project site and not affected by it in
                      any way. Therefore there is no impact of the project on cultural heritage.


7.2           Air Quality


7.2.1         Existing Situation

              At present there are only a few relevant sources of air pollution caused by human
              activities in the Massawa region. They can be divided into (i) industrial sources
              (Hirgigo Thermal Power Plant, Eritrean Cement Factory, the harbour, two oil terminal
              and storage facilities, a ship breaking yard, Erifish fish processing) (ii) transport related
              sources (road traffic and ship traffic) and (iii) small-scale industries including
              construction activities, workshops and households. These three different source groups
              are influencing both the air quality in Massawa City as well as the air quality in the
              study area around the location of the old and new jetty.

              No results of ambient air quality monitoring at Massawa are available so far. So the
              description of the existing situation has to focus mainly on generic information about
              the amount and type of air pollutants from existing sources.

              The general air quality in Massawa City (Massawa Island; Taulud Island, Mainland) is
              predominantly characterized by the air pollution resulting from the harbour and naval
              base activities, from road and ship traffic and from small-scale industries. The main
              health concern in Massawa City is particulate matter (soot) originating from badly

Petroleum Jetty ESIA                                                              Date March 25, 2008
ESIA Final Report                                                                 Page 73


              maintained diesel engines (stationary and mobile) of any kind while other pollutants
              such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) are of
              minor importance. Due to the fact, that the road traffic as well as harbour activities and
              ship traffic are all still small compared to other harbours of this size, the concentration
              of particulate matter smaller than 10 micrometers (PM10) in Massawa City is actually
              most probably still meeting the according standards of the WHO.

              In addition, the air quality in the North of Massawa City (Gherar Peninsula, Abd El
              Kader Peninsula, proclaimed Massawa Free Zone) is actually also influenced by the on-
              going industrial activities (cement plant, fish processing, shipyard) in this area. There is
              not much information available on the amount and type of air pollutants released at
              present, but if the harbour activities as well as the industrial activities in the proclaimed
              Free Zone will considerably develop in future, air quality will become an issue.

              The main source of air pollution for Hirgigo Bay is the Hirgigo Thermal Power Plant
              while all other sources such as the adjacent fuel storage installations and some other
              minor industrial sites in this area as well as the small amount of road traffic do not
              contribute much to the local level of air pollution.

              An estimation of the air pollution resulting from Hirgigo TPP is presented in the
              "Environmental Sustainability Appraisal" for this project (ENEA 1997). This estimation
              is based on dispersion modelling based on full load operation of the power plant (4 20    x

              MW, diesel fuel with a sulfur content of 3.5%) and regional meteorological data
              (prevailing North-Eastern winds, only few calms). Several different meteorological
              situations have been calculated and analyzed. As a result of the dispersion modelling it
              was concluded that under worst case assumptions the short and long term standards for
              SO2 and NO2 will be exceeded with a significant probability near the plant in case of
              continuing calms and in downwind direction in case of persistent constant wind (ENEA
              1997). Using more realistic assumptions instead of the only theoretically existing worst
              case scenario allows assessing, that the ambient air concentrations for S02 and NO2 at
              Hirgigo bay are to be considered when further extensions of the thermal power plant or
              other major developments in the industrial zone will arise, but that the actual pollution
              is still within the standards.


7.2.2         Project Impacts

              Air pollution (mainly emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter) will
              result from all construction activities related to the project. The three main sources are
              (i) emissions related to the construction activities of the new jetty, (ii) emissions
              resulting from transport of material and personnel from/to the construction sites, and
              (iii) emissions caused by the demolition of the existing jetty.

              Although it is evident that the construction activities for the new jetty (i) as well as the
              demolition of the old jetty (iii) will generate a considerable amount of air pollutants
              resulting form construction machinery in the vicinity of these activities, no major
              negative impact on the air quality has to be expected. As it is well known from projects
              of the same type and magnitude, the construction activities may temporary cause visible
              dust emissions but not a detectable influence on ambient air quality values.

Petroleum Jetty ESIA                                                              Date March 25, 2008
ESIA Final Report                                                                 Page 74


              According to section 5.3 transport of the material would most likely come from the
              North and cross the outskirts of Massawa. From the information on construction
              materials and on the construction schedule given in the Preliminary Design Report (RH
              2006) it follows that the number of daily transports will always be less than 100 round
              trips a day. This amount of additional traffic will give rise of some more road traffic
              emission along the road from the North, but not to an extent that would be noticeable.

              Attention has to be paid for the short unpaved stretch of the road close to the jetty
              location. Traffic on dirt roads during dry and windy weather as it prevails most of the
              time leads to the suspension of a lot of fine dust. This would also be the case if rock
              material for the bund would be brought from the South, near Hirgigo village.

              During jetty operation the main sources of air pollution are the diesel engines of tankers
              at the unloading sites. As the new jetty allows the accommodation of larger tankers, the
              number of vessels will still remain relatively low even if the predicted increase of
              delivered products will take place. So no significant impact on air quality from the ships
              at the jetty heads has to be expected.


7.2.3         Proposed Mitigation Measures

              Even though the air pollution resulting from construction activities is not a real concern,
              some general precautionary mitigation measures should be applied

                 ·      Use only adequate and well maintained construction and transportation
                        equipment including diesel fuel of good quality. The reduction of particulate
                        (soot) emitted by diesel engines is by far the most efficient measure for keeping
                        the air pollution low.

                 ·      Organize the sequence of construction activities in a way, that the use of
                        construction equipment powered by diesel fuel is optimized and the duration of
                        use is minimized.

                 ·      Take appropriate measures for dust suppression; this includes among other
                        good housekeeping and water sprinkling especially on unpaved access roads.

                 ·      Optimise storage on-site of materials that are known to be raised by wind.

                 ·      Avoid burning of inopportune or hazardous combustible material.

                 ·      Instruct the workforce on the appropriate measures to minimize air pollutants
                        and dust.


7.2.4         Conclusions

              The impact of the project on the ambient air quality will be limited in time to the
              construction and transportation activities including demolition of the old jetty. If the
              appropriate precautionary mitigation measures for construction activities according to
              the previous Section are applied, there will be no relevant impact on the air quality.

7.3           Water Quality


7.3.1 Existing Situation

              Sea Water

              Results of sea water quality analysis collected between March 2000 and March 2001 at
              17 locations in Massawa coastal waters (5 locations within Hirgigo bay) are presented
              in the report of the DOE (DOE 2001). The main findings of this study are summarized
              as follows:

              Salinity
              There is no definite seasonal variation and no unusual distribution pattern in salinity
              along the Massawa coastline. The Eritrean Red Sea coastal region is not influenced by
              many freshwater inputs and is also not subject to strong current regime. Coupled with
              the high levels of evaporation in the semi-enclosed Red Sea, the high salinity levels of
              37.5 to 57.8  are easily understandable.

              Dissolved Oxygen (DO)
              The measured dissolved oxygen levels (range: 5.4 to 9.4 mg/l in surface waters) do not
              show significant seasonal variation and are comparable to other coasts with fair to good
              water quality.

              pH
              The range of pH along the Massawa coastline varies between 7.6 to 8.0. The lack of
              significant freshwater input and the high water output, due to evaporation, leads to the
              relatively high pH levels in coastal waters.

              Suspended Solids
              Suspended solids range between 173 and 519 mg/l with fairly large fluctuations from
              site to site and over time. But even at the measured maximum of 519 mg/l, the
              suspended solids level in Massawa waters is much lower than at most other coastal
              zones. Small amount of freshwater input, little or no heavy wave action and a weak
              current are the main reasons for keeping suspended sediment levels low. As the
              sediment in the water column is mainly composed of sand and silt, which are not good
              organic matter receptors, it does not contribute much to the suspended solid levels.

              Nitrite
              The level of nitrites varies from 2.0 to 12.8 µg/l. The measurements are showing wide
              unpredictable fluctuations and no discernible trends. The relatively high levels of nitrite
              in Massawa coastal waters are mainly due to various sewage outfalls, shipping activities
              in and around the harbour and re-distribution from sediment to the water column,
              facilitated by bacterial breakdown.

              Nitrate
              Nitrate levels cover a range from about 3 to 10 µg/l). Inside the harbour, nitrate tends to
              increase steadily, unrelated to levels recorded in the coastal waters. Nitrate
              concentration decrease with the distance offshore. However Massawa nitrate levels are
              lower than those recorded for many other coasts. Highest nitrate levels are recorded in
              the footprint of the power plant cooling water inlet channel and mangrove area. Sewage
              input is probably the main contributor to the current nitrate levels recorded for Massawa
              as a whole.

              Phosphorous
              Measured Phosphorous levels are low (range: 0-23 µg/l) in comparison to eutrophic
              coastal waters and are therefore not considered to be a problem in Massawa region.

              Oily Wastes
              Oily wastes from different sources discharged into the coastal waters are actually the
              main concern for the water quality at Massawa. The port and all other vessel reception
              facilities (i.e. fishing piers), oil jetties, power station, ship repair yard, ship breaking
              yard are all a cause of the actual oil pollution (see Vol. 2 for a discussion of oil
              contamination risks and Photo 10).

              Coastal Water Quality Index
              With the exception of the oily residues the coastal water quality at Massawa is rated
              'mesotrophic - good' according to the coastal water quality index developed to classify
              European coastal regions.

              Ground water

              The ground water table at Hirgigo Thermal Power site is located 0.2 to 1.7 m below
              ground level, depending on the distance from the sea (ENEA 1997). The level of the
              groundwater changes with the tidal variation. This variability rapidly decreases with the
              distance to the sea. The ground waters have a high salt content: chlorides 44 to 68 g/l
              (Red Sea water value is about 17 g/l), sulphate 6.7 to 10.0 g/l (Red Sea water value is
              2.9 g/l), and a temperature of 35 C. These characteristics show a possible presence of
              hydrothermal water. The permeability and conductivity of the aquifer is very low,
              implying an insufficient ground water flow and a poor lateral feeding of the aquifer.
              Due to the high salt content the ground water can not be used for irrigating or drinking
              purposes.


7.3.2 Project Impacts

              The potential environmental implications of construction activities on coastal water
              quality include:

                 ·      Effects on general water quality through onshore construction activities such as
                        painting, grouting, concreting, drilling, use of lubricants and grease etc.; and

                 ·      Effects on general water quality though water based activities such as
                        placement of rock, piling, dredging and reclamation.

              During operation the main sources to have an adverse effect on coastal water quality are

                 ·      The release of ship's waste into the waters of the jetty area. Ship waste includes
                        bilge water, oily sludge, used lubricants, sewage waste, litter and waste
                        materials;

                 ·      Discharge of poorly treated waste water from fuel pumping and storage
                        activities; and

                 ·      Maintenance activities for jetty and piping such as anti-corrosion treatment,
                        anti-fouling treatment, painting, greasing, sealing of joints, etc.

7.3.3 Proposed Mitigation Measures

              Any activity that uses oily or otherwise water quality endangering liquids should
              endeavour to avoid, minimise or reduce the potential impact of pollutants (i.e. after
              release) upon the environment.

              Oil is a common form of pollution that could cause a lot of damage in areas of noted
              sensitivity. As such, steps should be taken to ensure that it is not released into the sea or
              allowed to seep into the ground. These measures include the bunding of stored oils, the
              use of biodegradable oils and the provision of waste oil reception facilities (or oil
              banks).

              It is important that where water quality endangering liquids are handled for any purpose,
              the methods employed meet accepted standards for health, safety and the environment.
              A continuous regimen of maintenance and technical monitoring of processes is highly
              recommended to ensure that problems are identified early on, thus minimising the risk
              of oil accidentally entering the sea or ground. Adequate training for appropriate site
              personnel is imperative, both during construction/demolition and operation.

              To help prevent the transport of spilt pollutants to the sea, suitable collection facilities
              should be provided. Where chemicals or other toxic materials are stored, adequate
              containment of the storage area has to be established (including an impervious base) to
              isolate them from near-by drains.

              Sewage effluent should not be discharged into coastal waters, again due to the effects on
              the natural and human environment, meaning that suitable facilities have to be provided
              for the reception of all sewage waste resulting from the construction site. In addition,
              disposal of strong cleaning agents, cooking oils and general litter/waste to proper
              reception facilities has to be implemented.

              Precautions have also to been taken during construction/demolition as well as during
              operation for preventing accidental seeping of hazardous liquids into the sand and
              subsequently into the ground water. Small spills on land can be effectively dealt with if
              adequate supplies of sand, earth, straw bales and/or rags are on hand. If such absorbent
              material is used, it should be removed and treated in a safe manner so that it can be
              brought to an adequate disposal


7.3.4 Conclusions

              With the exception of the oily residues the coastal water quality at Massawa is actually
              rated 'mesotrophic - good' according to the coastal water quality index. The operation of
              the new jetty will improve the situation regarding the oily wastes due to the cleaner
              unloading technology without changing the other water quality parameters.

              Construction of new jetty as well as demolition the old jetty will temporary and locally
              deteriorate the water quality as a part of the works will have to take place in the water
              environment. If the above mitigation measures to prevent/minimize the input of oily and
              otherwise harmful liquids into the coastal water bed are enforced, the construction will
              only have a minor adverse impact.

              Still, the main effect of the new jetty will be to eliminate the high oil spill risk presented
              by the existing facility. A major oil spill would be the most adverse impact on water
              quality, and reducing it to acceptable levels is urgently needed.

7.4           Noise


7.4.1         Existing Situation

              At present there are only a few relevant sources of noise caused by human activities
              located in the study area around the project site. The main source of industrial noise is
              the Hirgigo Thermal Power Plant while all other industrial sources such as the adjacent
              fuel storage installations and some minor industrial sites in the North do not produce
              any significant noise during normal operation.

              Another identified source of noise is the road traffic on the main road Massawa-Hirgigo
              and on the access roads to the power station and the fuel storage site. However, the
              traffic volume is actually still very small so that this source is not really relevant for the
              local noise level so far.

              No results of noise measurements around Hirgigo Power Plant are available. On the
              occasion of the site visit an approximate value for the existing noise levels was obtained
              by using a basic sound pressure meter, showing that the noise level in a distance of
              about 200 m from the power plant is already below the standard of 55 dB(A). This also
              includes the camp between the tank farm and the power plant that has been used for
              power plant construction.


7.4.2         Project Impacts

              The significant impact of the project on the noise environment will be limited in time to
              the construction and transportation activities. The three main sources are (i) noise
              related to the construction activities for the new jetty, (ii) heavy duty traffic noise along
              roads crossing inhabited areas, generated by transport of material from/to the
              construction sites, and (iii) noise related to the demolition of the existing jetty.

              Although it has to be expected that some of the construction activities for the new jetty
              (i) as well as the demolition of the old jetty (iii) will generate a considerable amount of
              noise in the vicinity of these activities, no major negative impact on noise sensitive
              areas has to be expected because of the more than sufficient distance between
              construction/demolition site and noise sensitive areas (permanent or temporary housing,
              recreation area). This remains true as long as a sufficient distance between noise sources
              and temporary housing areas is also being kept for the work force needed to erect the
              new jetty.

              The most important transports will be rock material for the rock bund (625 m long),
              cement/concrete for the trestle (500 m long) and steel/piping (trestle, jetty head,
              pipelines, mooring facilities).

              According to section 5.3 transport of this material would most likely come from the
              North and cross the outskirts of Massawa. There are several sites where rock or gravel is
              being obtained from along the road leading from Massawa to Ghinda, and quite close to
              Massawa, and it would seem likely that one of these sites would be used for obtaining
              rock and gravel for the new jetty (provided that the material proves to be suitable for the
              purpose). The transports needed to bring material resulting from demolition of the old

Petroleum Jetty ESIA                                                              Date March 25, 2008

              jetty to the scrap metal facility and to final disposal site will also have to use the same
              road.

              All other transports (cement from the cement factory and all imported goods being
              brought to the site from Massawa Port) would actually have to pass through Massawa
              city.

              From the information on construction materials and on the construction schedule given
              in the Preliminary Design Report (RH 2006) it follows that the number of daily
              transports will always be less than 100 round trips a day. This amount of trucks using
              well maintained asphalt roads during day time will not violate any internationally
              recognized noise standards for inhabited areas. As it is also known from previous
              projects, noise generated by road transport for construction activities of that scale and
              type remain well within the acceptable limits.

              The operation of the new jetty will not produce any significant noise.


7.4.3         Proposed Mitigation Measures

              Even though the noise resulting from construction activities is not a real concern, some
              general precautionary mitigation measures should be applied

                 ·      Use only well maintained construction and transportation equipment including
                        state-of-the-art built in systems to reduce the noise.

                 ·      Workers exposed to excessive noise have to wear ear protectors.

                 ·      Separate installation areas, mechanical workshops etc. well from areas that are
                        used by people for temporary housing and recreation. In this respect it is
                        recommended to use the existing infrastructure of the still existing camp
                        between power plant and tank farm to the extent possible.

                 ·      Avoid any noise-intensive works such as piling, demolition, metalworking etc.
                        during night time.

                 ·      Avoid transports of material (rock, concrete, steel, machinery) during night
                        time.

                 ·      Instruct the workforce to avoid unnecessary noise.


7.4.4         Conclusions

              The impact of the project on the noise environment will be limited in time to the
              construction and transportation activities including demolition of the old jetty. If the
              appropriate precautionary mitigation measures for construction activities as mentioned
              above are applied, there will be no relevant impact on noise.

8             WASTE MANAGEMENT


8.1   Existing Situation

              Operation and maintenance of the existing jetty and of the oil and gas storage facilities
              do produce only small quantities of solid waste. This solid waste is collected and
              disposed of, but it seems that the handling of the emerging solid waste is actually not
              always done in an ideal manner.

              Operation of the existing jetty and fuel storage generate also a considerable amount of
              liquid waste, mainly in form of oil-contaminated sea water resulting from flushing the
              pipes and of settling water accumulating at the bottom of the oil tanks. These waste
              waters are undergoing a simple water/oil separation before they are discharged to the
              sea.

              Operation and maintenance of Hirgigo thermal power plant also cause solid and liquid
              wastes of different categories. This new plant is equipped with all auxiliary facilities
              including a wastewater treatment plant needed to handle and manage solid and liquid
              waste. Standard procedures and practices are established based on operation manuals,
              and no significant negative impacts from the power plant wastes have been reported.


8.2   Project Impacts

              Construction and demolition waste covers a wide range of materials. The most obvious
              are (i) waste arising from total or partial demolition of the existing jetty and other civil
              infrastructure; (ii) waste arising from construction of civil infrastructure and road
              maintenance activities including damaged materials, excess materials left over at the
              end of the job, packaging waste; and (iii) soil, rocks, etc. arising from land levelling,
              civil works and/or general foundations. Some of the produced waste requires special
              attention and handling as the waste is of hazardous or potentially hazardous character.
              This includes solvent-based concrete additives, damp roofing chemicals, adhesives, tar-
              based emulsions, asbestos-based materials, mineral fibres, some paints and coatings,
              treated timber, resins, empty or part empty gas bottles from cutting/welding, etc.

              The operation of the new jetty will produce waste of the same type, and presumably
              similar amount, as the operation of the old jetty. The most important waste category will
              be oil contaminated water from flushing the pipeline for white products. This water has
              to be collected in a suitable tank and cleaned before being restituted to the sea. In this
              respect, having dedicated pipelines for the three white products would bring about a
              considerable improvement of the situation. It is therefore recommended to study this
              alternative carefully and, budget allowing, install dedicated pipelines as soon as
              possible.


8.3   Proposed Mitigation Measures

              All proposed mitigation measures for the management of construction and demolition
              waste can be summed up in the usually used hierarchy of waste management

                         (i)    prevention or reduction;

                         (ii)   re-use;

                         (iii) recycling or materials recovery;

                         (iv) disposal in a safe manner.

              During construction mainly organizational measures by the contractors on site have to
              be taken for prevention and reduction of waste, for recovery of materials and for
              potential re-use. Facilities which allow separation and intermediate storage of different
              types of waste have to be provide and the workforce need to be instructed accordingly.

              When it comes to demolition of the existing jetty, selective demolition is the state-of-
              the-art procedure which should be encouraged and possibly even required. The elements
              of selective demolition are (generally organized in the order shown):

                         (i)    Selective removal of accessible materials with obvious sales value.
                                The Feasibility Report assumes that it may be possible to find some
                                use for the existing pipe work, although it does not recommend that it
                                be used on the new jetty. Otherwise, it could be used as scrap steel.

                         (ii)   Selective removal of accessible materials which, if not removed, will
                                cause the demolition waste to be treated as hazardous. This requires to
                                carefully watch out for waste that belongs to the list of hazardous or
                                potentially hazardous wastes presented in section 8.2.

                         (iii)  Selective removal of materials which, if not removed, will depress the
                                'value' of the remaining waste when crushed. The concrete could be
                                crushed and used as general fill material (e.g. in road construction).
                                However, it is pointed out that it would not be suitable for use as a
                                concrete aggregate, due to the likely high chloride content. Steel
                                reinforcement recovered from the crushed concrete can be sold as
                                scrap steel.

                         (iv)   Keep inert material inert. For the sake of a much larger inert fraction,
                                some other waste materials present in relatively small amounts (such
                                as paint and plastics, treated timber, cleaning things) should be kept
                                separate from the inert fraction if at all possible. If they are not, it may
                                not possible to treat the main bulk of the materials as inert.

              Selective demolition will among other considerable reduce the proportion of waste that
              has to go to hazardous or non-inert disposal sites.


8.4   Conclusions

              Appropriate organizational measures by the contractors during construction and the
              selective demolition method for the old jetty are the recipe of success to effectively
              prevent, reduce, re-use or recycle as much of the construction and demolition waste as
              reasonably possible.

              All waste that cannot be re-used or recycled has to be disposed at suitable and safe sites.
              The DOE is in charge of deciding on the waste categories. Massawa municipality and
              port authority will agree on the procedures to apply and on the sites that will finally be
              used. Massawa already has dedicated disposal sites with enough capacity for receiving
              the type and amount of waste that has to be expected from jetty construction.

9             COASTAL ENVIRONMENT AND SEA BED DYNAMICS


9.1           Existing Situation

              The existing situation of coastal environment and sea bed dynamics is assessed based on
              data collected during past field investigations and field reconnaissance surveys
              conducted under ESIA. A summary presentation of available data is given in Table
              A9.1-1 of Annex A9.


9.1.1         Bathymetry and Sea Bed Condition

              The project area is located in the Hirigigo Bay, facing the Red Sea towards a north-
              easterly direction. The average water depth at the entrance to the bay is around 32 m.
              The bathymetry in the project area within the bay is highly irregular, with a very mild
              sloping sea bottom up to about 5 m water depth and thereafter rapidly declining to 15 m
              water depth within a short distance. The site observations revealed the presence of a
              sandy shore within the swash zone, fronted immediately seaward by sea bed with sand
              mixed with stiff silt and clay. A generally muddy appearance of nearshore water up to
              about 40 m from the coastline indicated high concentration of fine sediments in
              suspension.

              The borehole investigations conducted during Master Plan Study of Massawa Port has
              indicated the presence of a hard coral upper layer in the nearshore area up to about 2 m
              water depth. This fact is also confirmed by site observations from the existing jetty. The
              presence of broken shell fragments of varying sizes and shapes was very evident on the
              shore.


9.1.2         Shore Features

              On the shore line along the project site there is a narrow strip of mangroves, which is
              interrupted between intake and outlet channels of the power plant, whereby it is not
              clear weather this is due to natural causes or due to human inference. This low lying
              area is intermittently inundated when the sea water level rises above the beach berm
              level. This generally happens during high tide under spring tidal conditions. In the area
              which is without vegetation, the periodic inundation due to rising water level is evident
              by the presence of traces of salt left behind by the evaporation of sea water. This tidal
              flat area may extend out to few hundred meters from the shore face.


9.1.3         Waves

              The wave conditions in the Hirgigo Bay are rather mild due to protection from various
              islands and shoals fronting the Massawa area in the Red Sea. The waves from east to
              north-east are almost completely shielded by Dhalak Archipelago and Norah Island. The
              presence of Di Buri peninsula to the south provides natural protection from southerly
              waves. Several islands and shoals to the north-east of Hirgigo Bay cause attenuation of
              offshore waves due to shoaling, refraction and diffraction. The subsequent growth of
              these attenuated waves while propagating towards Massawa area is not significant due
              to available limited fetch and low wind speeds. The mean wind speeds are known to

Petroleum Jetty ESIA                                                             Date March 25, 2008
ESIA Final Report                                                                Page 83


              vary between 3 and 7 knots. Although waves approaching along North Massawa
              Channel will reach Massawa area unattenuated, they will have negligible impact on
              wave conditions within Hirigigo Bay due to their direction of approach. In addition to
              above mentioned protection afforded by land masses well outside the bay, the project
              area is internally protected by Taulud Island and Massawa Island to the north east of
              Hirgigo Bay and Sheikh Said Island (Green Island) to the east.

              In the assessment of wave conditions conducted by Delft Hydraulics (Delft 1998), in
              connection with studies for Hirgigo Power Plant seawater intake and outfall, the wave
              climate just outside the Hirgigo Bay was determined. The swell wave contribution was
              neglected in this study as these waves are attenuated by various offshore islands and
              reefs. The wave climate was thus determined using offshore wind conditions obtained
              from British Meteorological Office (BMO) and the local fetch between the
              representative location outside the Hirgigo Bay and different offshore islands. The
              resulting wave height roses for the winter period (October to March), the summer period
              (April to September) and for the yearly average are shown in Figures A9.1-1 to A9.1-3.
              These presentations indicate that waves approach from a predominantly SE direction in
              the winter period but in the summer period predominant wave direction is in the NW
              direction.

              The extreme significant wave heights for different directional sectors were determined
              by fitting Weibull probability distribution to higher wave height classes. These extreme
              wave heights are given in Table A9.1-2.

              The local wave conditions in the project area depend on the extent and depth of the
              reefs. In general, the waves may reach the project area either by transmission over the
              reefs, by wave propagation through areas of deep water between the reefs, or due to
              local wave generation. In the study by Delft Hydraulics wave conditions within the bay
              was determined through the application of SWAN model. These wave propagation
              results indicated relatively calm wave conditions in the project area.


9.1.4         Tides and Tidal Currents

              The tidal variation in the Red Sea is not influenced by the tide in the Indian Ocean. A
              local oscillatory semi-diurnal tide is developed with a relatively small oscillation. The
              main tidal information at Massawa is given in Table A9.1-3. It is seen that mean tidal
              range at spring tide is 0.9 m while the mean tidal range at neap tide is 0.4 m.

              The tidal currents in the Red Sea set north while the tide is rising, and south while the
              tide is falling. The tidal currents are very weak in this area. These weak north-south
              tidal currents will hardly affect the velocities in the bay.


9.1.5         Wind

              The wind roses for the winter period, summer period and yearly average are presented
              in Figures A9.1-4 to A9.1-6. These wind roses were developed by Deft Hydraulics in
              connection with studies for Hirgigo Power Plant seawater intake and outfall. These
              wind roses clearly indicate the dominance of south-eastern winds during winter and
              north-western winds during summer. The yearly average wind direction is seen to be

Petroleum Jetty ESIA                                                            Date March 25, 2008

              roughly parallel to the long axis of the Red Sea. The wind speeds are observed to rarely
              exceed 20 m/s.

              The extreme wind speeds for different direction classes had also been determined by
              extrapolating high wind speeds. The results are presented in Table A9.1-4.


9.1.6         Sediment Transport

              The field surveys conducted in the area have found that the average bottom sediment is
              sand of size d50 = 0.15 mm. The observations of the shoreline position has concluded
              that around the existing jetty, the net sediment transport is northward directed while
              further south in the bay it is southward directed. The zero net transport point was found
              to be south of the Hirgigo power plant intake location.

              The longshore sediment transport capacity in the project area was assessed in the study
              conducted by Delft Hydraulics in connection with Hirgigo Power Plant seawater intake
              and outfall. The results showed that net longshore sediment transport capacities across
              two transects north of and south of outfall were 1'000 m3/year and 500 m3/year,
              respectively. In consideration of various uncertainties involved in calculations, these
              results are consistent with the estimated northward bound transport rate based on
              shoreline development at the existing jetty. In general the shoreline in the area has
              remained stable, which can be attributed to low currents and calm wave conditions
              within the bay.


9.1.7         Water Quality

              The seawater temperature measurements carried out within the bay showed a weak
              thermal stratification. The salinity was about 39, conductivity 69 mS/cm and the
              density 1024 kg/m3. There do not seem to be any short term effects on the sea water
              quality. However, low wave energy, small tidal range and limited water movement
              make it a fragile ecosystem highly sensitive to environmental pollution. So far cooling
              water intake and outfall system have functioned without any detected thermal pollution.


9.1.8         Sea Water Intake and Cooling Water Outlet

              The cooling sea water intake of the power plant is a lined open channel with its seaward
              end located around 2 m water depth. It is directed with its axis inclined at about 30º
              eastward of north. Two pumps at rated capacity 1'850 m3/h are used to draw up sea
              water through this channel. The heated water upon passing through the cooling water
              system is discharged into the sea through another lined channel. The heated water upon
              entering the cooling water discharge open channel is said to be at a temperature 10ºC
              above the intake sea water. However, till reaching the point of discharge to sea the
              temperature declines to be only about 1ºC above the ambient sea water. This is due to
              the large contact area between water and ambient air in the wide discharge channel, and
              to some extent due to mixing of heated water and fresh sea water intruding into the
              cooling water discharge channel. The sea water intake and cooling water outlet channel
              entrances are so oriented that the outward cooling water plume is directed away from
              the sea water intake open channel entrance.

9.2           Project Impacts

              In order to assess coastal engineering impacts of the project, it is important to determine
              the nearshore wave climate in the project area. In the mathematical model studies
              conducted by Delft Hydraulics in connection with Hirgigo Power Plant seawater intake
              and outfall, wave climate at 10 m water depth was established. The resulting directional
              wave height rose is presented in Figure A9.2-1. It is seen that waves approach from a
              predominantly south-easterly direction.

              In connection with cooling water intake and heated water outfall for Hirgigo Power
              Plant, extensive numerical modelling on hydrodynamics, wave propagation and
              sediment transport was carried out by Delft Hydraulics. These model studies had been
              able to determine conditions within the coastal environment in the vicinity of
              intake/outfall system with existing oil jetty in place. The findings of numerical
              modelling by Delft Hydraulics had been made use of in the assessment of coastal
              impacts of the implementation of the new oil jetty in the present ESIA. No additional
              numerical model studies had been performed in this respect.

              The results show that coastal impacts of the new oil jetty will be minimal and that there
              will be no significant adverse effects on the environment. The hydrodynamic modelling
              as well as field observations have confirmed that sea currents under differing influences
              of tide, wind and waves are very low in magnitude. The preferred alternative for the
              proposed jetty comprises a rock bund up to about 5 m below CD and a trestle structure
              supported on piles beyond that. Therefore, the current pattern beyond 5 m water depth
              will be only marginally affected. The currents in the very shallow region are already
              very weak and interference on these currents by a rock bund structure will have virtually
              no impact.

              The wave climate just outside the Hirgigo Bay and at around 10 m water depth at the
              project site had been established during mathematical model studies conducted by Delft
              Hydraulics. It is apparent from these results that wave conditions at the project site are
              rather moderate. Therefore, the effect on these waves by a new construction which is
              partly an open structure would be minimal.

              The numerical model studies by Delft Hydraulics established that sediment transport
              capacities at the site are very low, being around 1000 m3/year. Such low sediment
              transport rates are unlikely to result in any marked sedimentation or erosion as a result
              of interference of sediment movement by a new structure. The observations have
              indicated a very moderate rate of change in shoreline development as a result of
              implementation of the existing jetty in 1930s. All these facts clearly point out to the
              conclusion that sedimentation/erosion impacts of the new oil jetty would be minimal.

              Based on above discussion it is apparent that coastal impacts of the new jetty would not
              be significant and also can be predicted based on findings of previous mathematical
              model studies and field observations. Therefore, very little advantage will be gained by
              conducting further numerical model studies.

              The new jetty will provide some shielding from south-easterly waves to the area north
              of it. The area north of the old jetty will be exposed to wave action once it is removed.
              However, due to generally very moderate wave conditions prevailing in the bay this will
              not be a significant negative effect.

Petroleum Jetty ESIA                                                             Date March 25, 2008
ESIA Final Report                                                                Page 86


              Some, although very localised, change in current pattern at the new jetty location will be
              created. This will have no significant positive or negative impact within an environment
              where currents are already very low in magnitude. The impact on flow hydraulics at the
              cooling water intake or outfall will be insignificant. As such, there will be no
              interference with intake/outfall operation.

              Evidence from the existing jetty shows that the mangrove belt on the southern (seaward)
              side is rather broad, while it ix very narrow on its northern side (see Photo 11). The part
              of the mudflat which is exposed during low tide is wider on the southern side than on
              the northern. This could be the effect of a slightly higher accumulation of sediments
              seaward from the existing jetty, the effect of 70 years of its presence. A similar effect,
              with some additional sedimentation on the southern side and slight erosion (or less
              accumulation) on the northern side between the jetty and the intake channel, could be
              expected as an effect of the new jetty. However, due to low sediment transport
              capacities of the nearshore currents this will not be significant. The coastline changes
              resulting from the construction of the new jetty are likely to attain a new equilibrium
              state over the years.

              An increase in turbidity during construction period will reduce the amount of light
              penetrating into the water, thus reducing primary productivity of phytoplankton. This
              will have some impact on the ecosystem, as the amount of food produced will be
              reduced. However, this impact will be very moderate, and limited in time to the
              construction period, and the affected area will be very small. The preferred project
              alternative will not involve dredging and as a result increase in turbidity during
              construction period would be minimal. As such there will be minimal impact on the eco
              system including the coral habitats.

              The demolition of the existing jetty is likely to cause pollution of sea bed due to falling
              of debris on the sea bed and the mobilisation of additional sediment. However, this will
              be confined to a small area.


9.3           Proposed Mitigation Measures

              The project will not have significant adverse impacts, particularly in the absence of
              dredging. The change in nearshore hydrodynamic conditions will be moderate and will
              be confined locally to the project area. There will not be any significant change in
              shoreline development. In a discussion with the Design Consultant on Feb. 7, 2008, the
              possibility of shortening the rock bund to some extent (and having a longer trestle) was
              mentioned. This would further reduce any effect on local currents.


9.4           Conclusions

              The preferred project alternative will result in minimal disturbance to sea bed dynamics
              and coastal environment. The possibility of sea bed pollution will result mainly from the
              demolition of the existing jetty (see Chapter 15 for a discussion of this issue).

10            OIL SPILL RISK

              An Oil Spill Risk Assessment and Contingency Plan has been prepared as a part of the
              ESIA for the project of a new oil jetty in Hirgigo Bay. Given the size of this Plan, it is
              provided as a separate, stand alone document (ESIA Vol. 2).

              Central to the Oil Spill Risk Assessment and Contingency Plan are the identification of
              release locations along the new jetty and the release types that can occur due to the
              products being offloaded at Massawa.

              This oil spill risk assessment is based upon the release locations provided in the original
              base data and the fact that LPG and a range of white products and black products are to
              be offloaded.

              Statistical release sizes during product offloading operations have been obtained from
              international data based upon vessel sizes which will offload at Massawa. This data may
              be seen in Appendix A.

              The physical properties of the products to be offloaded (in particular the toxicity data
              and recommended clean-up methods for small, large and huge releases) at Massawa
              have been obtained from representative Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), which are
              given in Appendix B.

              The causes, consequences and a coarse risk assessment for these release types, sizes and
              locations has been documented in the Hazard Register given in Appendix G. Also on
              this register is documented the design and operational safeguards that have been
              detailed in the FEED documents. The impact of the safeguards on the raw risk levels is
              seen by the resulting level of residual risk. The recommended actions for the Massawa
              Oil Spill Response Team to respond to the spills are then documented. This semi-
              quantitative risk assessment has been the result of table top exercises at EPConsult's
              London offices, and it is recommended that operations personnel become familiar with
              the register and participate in keeping the document up to date so as to become familiar
              with the process of control of major accident hazards to the environment.

              Huge spills are associated with product storage on the vessel entering the harbour and
              not jetty operations per se. A matrix is produced in the document, which give for spills
              at the locations identified for the harbour and jetty, the relevant oil spill response
              approach, equipment, skimmers and sorbent media.

              Thus the resulting FEED level oil spill contingency plan is seen to be hazard based and
              proportionate. This document also details typical training needs, manning requirements,
              job descriptions for key positions in the emergency response structure, and emergency
              response plans. The regulatory framework is also discussed.

              This FEED level oil spill risk assessment and contingency plan raises the following
              design issues, which may be in consideration:

                  · Windsocks are provided for the new jetty for LPG releases.

                  · Leak detection devices are considered for offloading product.

                  · Water sprays, including for personnel protection should be considered for
                      confirmed gas release.

                  · Clearly flanges should be minimized along the jetty and bunding should be kept
                      clear.

                  · Oil spill response equipment should be placed in fire proof cabinets on the Jetty,
                      and the work boat should be tethered and provided with a purpose built landing
                      with life saving equipment.

                  · A small laboratory should be provided for sample analysis and monitoring of
                      harbour waters, sediments and groundwater.

                  · A freezer should be provided for preserving any wildlife or plants impacted by a
                      spill for further analysis.

              It is recognized that many of these measures cannot be considered without cost benefit
              analyses, and thus it is recommended that this document is revised in the next
              engineering phase so as to provide the basis for doing this.

11            FIRE FIGHTING ARRANGEMENTS

              A Fire Risk Assessment and Training Plan has been prepared as a part of the ESIA for
              the project of a new oil jetty in Hirgigo Bay. Given the size of this Plan, it is provided as
              a separate, stand alone document (ESIA Vol. 3).

              Central to the Fire Risk Assessment and Fire Training Plan are the identification of fire
              locations along the new jetty and the fire types that can occur due to the products being
              offloaded at Massawa.

              This fire risk assessment is based upon the fire locations provided in the original base
              data and the fact that LPG and a range of white products and black products are to be
              offloaded.

              Statistical release sizes during product offloading operations have been obtained from
              international data based upon vessel sizes which will offload at Massawa. This data may
              be seen in Appendix A.

              The physical properties of the products to be offloaded (in particular the flammability
              data and recommended firefighting methods for small, large and huge fires) at Massawa
              have been obtained from representative Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), which are
              given in Appendix B.

              The causes, consequences and a coarse risk assessment for these fire types, sizes and
              locations has been documented in the Hazard Register given in Appendix D. Also on
              this register is documented the design and operational safeguards that have been
              detailed in the FEED documents. The impact of the safeguards on the raw risk levels is
              seen by the resulting level of residual risk. The recommended actions for the Massawa
              Jetty Fire Team to tackle the fires are then documented. This semi-quantitative risk
              assessment has been the result of table top exercises at EPConsult's London offices, and
              it is recommended that operations personnel become familiar with the register and
              participate in keeping the document up to date so as to become familiar with the process
              of control of major accident hazards.

              Given that huge fires are associated with product storage and not jetty operations per se,
              two matrices are produced in the document, which give for small and large fires at the
              locations identified for the jetty, the relevant firefighting approach, equipment, media
              and personal protective equipment.

              Thus the resulting FEED level firefighting training plan is seen to be hazard based and
              proportionate. It is then a short step to design the training segments and refreshers and
              the manning requirements of the fire team for the new jetty.

              This FEED level fire risk assessment and fire training plan raises the following design
              issues, which may be in consideration:

                  · Windsocks are provided for the new jetty for LPG releases.

                  · Leak detection devices are considered for offloading product.

                  · The possibility of providing passive fire protection for the slops tank should be
                      considered if this does not constitute corrosion under insulation risk.

                  · Passive fire protection should be considered for critical shutdown valves and
                      ESD initiation stations.

                  · Strict no smoking and speed restrictions should be in force on the jetty.

                      including electrical.

                      and the firewater pump house. Consideration should be given to providing
                      passive fire protection to the roof of this building.

                  · Consideration should be given to locating each fire water pump in a separate
                      pump house on the jetty.

                  · Clearly flanges should be minimized in this area.

12            HEALTH ASPECTS


12.1          Existing Situation

              The existing jetty as such, and its operation, have no direct implication on public health
              other than workforce health and safety (risk of accidents) and the risks related to the
              possibility of a major oil spill. Risk of accidents increasingly includes risks stemming
              from the bad condition of the existing jetty.


12.2          Project Impacts

              The new jetty will considerably reduce the risk of a major oil spill, due to its better
              condition, and the fact that it will be equipped with adequate oil spill prevention and
              contingency measures as well as fire fighting equipment (see Vol. 2 and 3 for details in
              this respect).

              The public health issues to be considered will be during the construction period, which
              will present the same type of risks as can be found on any construction site of a similar
              size and duration. The main risks are usually the following:

                  · Accidents with vehicles, construction machines etc., and accidents related to
                      general construction site activities.

                  · Accidents from handling hazardous substances.

                  · Water borne and water related diseases (like malaria, dengue, diarrheic diseases,
                      etc.).

                  · Risk of communicable diseases like TBC, HIV/AIDS and other STDs, especially
                      if a large work force is on the construction site for a longer period.

              Accordingly, the health and safety measures normally to be taken on such construction
              sites will have to be observed. These measures are outlined shortly in the following
              section.


12.3          Proposed Mitigation Measures


12.3.1        Occupational Health and Safety Standards

              The building contractor's contract should include some of the health issues making it
              mandatory for him to be responsible for health issues of all those he hires during the
              construction of the new jetty and/or demolition of the old jetty. The impacts will be seen
              as accidents and injuries of workers, contracted diseases by workers while on the job,
              contact of hazardous materials by workers, etc.

              The Contractor's contract should specifically state that:

                  · the contractor will be responsible for the safety and health of his workers;

                  · the contractor is obliged to follow the set official health and safety guidelines
                     and regulations of country, and generally best practice as applied in this field.


12.3.2        Prevention of Accidents

              The contractor shall:

                  · Provide protective clothing and accessory such as overalls, welding goggles,
                     helmets, protective boots/shoes, gloves, hearing protecting devices, lifesaving
                     vests, etc. for workers at the construction or demolition sites.

                  · Ensure that workers can swim and that lifesaving rings are available at the
                     worksite, near water.

                  · Ensure that the protective material is being used wherever it is required.

                  · Ensure that especially sensitive or dangerous areas (like areas exposed to high
                     noise levels, areas for especially hazardous work etc.) are clearly designated.

                  · Ensure that all maintenance work necessary for keeping machines and other
                     equipment in a good state will be regularly carried out.

                  · Ensure that the workers (and especially those doing hazardous work or
                     otherwise exposed to risks) are qualified, well trained and instructed in handling
                     their equipment, including health protection equipment.


12.3.3        Hazardous Substances

              For hazardous substances (including lubricants, solvents, explosives etc.) , the
              contractor shall:

                  · Ensure that such substances are being kept in suitable, safe, adequately marked
                     and locked storing places.

                  · Ensure that containers of such substances are clearly marked, and that material
                     safety data sheets are available.

                  · Ensure that all workers dealing with such substances are adequately informed
                     about the risks, trained in handling those materials, and trained in first aid
                     measures to be taken in the case of an accident.

                  · Set aside an area where disposal of contaminated materials and hazardous waste
                     can be collected stored for proper disposal according to the environment
                     guidelines.


12.3.4        Waterborne and Water Related Diseases

              The contractor shall:

                  · Generally adopt good housekeeping practices for ensuring hygiene on site.

                  · Eliminate pools of stagnant water (including empty tons, discarded tires and
                     other recipients that can be filled with water), which could serve as breeding
                     places for mosquitoes.

                  · Provide the workers living on site with bednets; ideally, these nets should be
                     treated with an insecticide.

                  · Eliminate waste of all types, including waste water, properly.


12.3.5        Communicable Diseases Prevention

              Main risks are presented by highly contagious diseases like TBC, and by HIV/AIDS and
              other STDs. To minimise this risk, the contractor shall:

                  · Ensure that a health screening of workers is being carried out, in the measure of
                     legally accepted standards.

                  · Provide information on disease prevention. Prevention measures for HIV/AIDS
                     & STDs should consist in (i) dissemination of information, (ii) voluntary
                     counselling and testing, (iii) provision of condoms at the workplace.


12.3.6        Health Services

              In addition to prevention measures as listed above, the contractor will also have to
              ensure adequate health services. This must include medical services for sick workers as
              well as emergency services in case of an accident. In this respect, the contractor shall:

                  · Establish a health unit, which will have to be adequately equipped, specially for
                     providing first aid. There should be at least two persons trained in first aid. One
                     person should be there at all times to deal immediately with serious injuries.

                  · Ensure that a medically trained person will run the unit.

                  · Ensure that there is a referral and evacuation plan. An agreement must be made
                     with a referral hospital (in Massawa) for cases in which medical treatment is
                     required which can not be given by the medical staff on site. This plan must also
                     ensure the availability of an ambulance for speedy evacuation of accident
                     victims. The hospital must be informed on the type of works to be carried out on
                     the construction site and on the potential risks.

                  · Ensure that records are kept on all medical interventions (diseases as well as
                     accidents).

                  · Ensure there is a medicine inventory book for recording type of medicine and
                     quantity. Stock taking of medicine and medical accessories shall be done every
                     fortnight.

                  · Ensure that medication for neutralising dangerous effects on workers who have
                     accidentally contacted hazardous materials are at all times available on site at the
                     designated health unit.

                  · Ensure that all workers receive appropriate information on: (i) how to recognise
                     various symptoms of diseases such malaria, dengue, cholera, etc., (ii) what to do
                     in case of illness or accidents, (iii) the prevention measures to be taken.

                  · Ensure migrant workers have had relevant immunisation (according to legal
                     requirements and good practice) upon hire, to avoid the introduction of
                     communicable diseases to the work force and the population of surrounding
                     areas (Massawa town and environs).


12.4          Conclusions

              The Project as such will not present a health risk and will not have any negative impact
              on the health of the population of adjacent areas. The health and safety measures listed
              in the previous section are considered as standard requirements for good practice on
              construction sites of that size.

13            BIODIVERSITY

              Eritrea covers a total land area of about 117'600 km2. The area of the continental shelf is
              47'469 km2 and 39'241 km2 are counted to the terrestrial sea (up to 12 nautical miles).
              The coastline of Eritrea has a length of about 3'400 km, 1'400 km at the continent line
              and about 2'000 km around the islands.

              The country contains four eco-geographical zones: the south-western lowlands, the
              north-western zone, the central and northern highlands and the coastal zone. Eritrea is
              the habitat for 112 mammals including 12 threatened species. Furthermore, it contains
              571 bird species, of which 138 are breeding birds including 7 threatened species; in
              addition, there are 87 species of reptiles, 5 amphibians and a total number of 102 known
              fish species (IUCN 2002).

              There is no indication of any kind of the occurrence on one of those species within or
              anywhere near the project area, with the exception of very rare sightings of a dugong in
              Hirgigo bay; however, the bay is not a habitat used on a regular basis by this species.

              The Red Sea of Eritrea is the habitat of five turtle species, all these species are
              threatened, two of them, the Leatherback Turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) and the
              Hawksbill Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) are critically endangered according to IUCN
              while the other three, the Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas), Olive Ridley Turtle
              (Lepidochelys olivacea) and Loggerhead Turtle (Caretta caretta) are endangered.

              The mangrove belt at the Eritrean coastline is the habitat for three mangrove species,
              Rhizophora mucronata (Thai Mangrove), Ceriops tagal (Yellow Mangrove) and the
              most widely distributed Avicennia marina (Grey Mangrove).

13.1          Existing Situation

              The existing situation of terrestrial and marine environment is assessed based on data
              collected during past field investigations and field reconnaissance surveys conducted
              under the ESIA. The most recent data concerning biodiversity were received from
              ECMIB. This project started in 1999, funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF)
              and implemented by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP); it came to an
              end by the end of 2007.

              The project area is located in the costal zone in the south of the Northern Red Sea Zone
              of Eritrea south of Massawa city, in the Hirgigo bay. The construction area for the new
              oil jetty is located between the cooling water intake and outlet of the existing Hirgigo
              power plant, which was built in 2003. The terrestrial area for the construction of the
              jetty is degraded partly through the construction of the power plant. A considerable part
              of the land seawards of the power plant was covered by excavation material. The beach
              has a mild slope and is forming a small dune between the sea and a low lying area
              inland of it. This low lying area is intermittently inundated in conditions of high tide,
              and traces of salt can be seen left behind. This tidal flat area is some hundred meters
              long.

              The coastline of Hirgigo bay is lined with a mangrove belt, consisting of Avicennia
              marina (Grey Mangrove). The mangroves grow on both sites of the existing jetty. At the
              proposed construction area the mangrove belt is interrupted for about 300 m (Photo 7).
              It is not known if this is through the earlier construction activities or if it is a natural gap
              of the Mangrove belt. To the right and the left of the construction area the species,
              Avicennia marina, forms a narrow mangrove belt, which is getting wider to the south of
              the project area. Further south of Hirgigo bay the mangrove belt is composed of two
              species Avicennia marina and Ceriops tagal (Yellow Mangrove).

              Due to its age the old jetty is a part of the seabed. Barnacles and mussels are growing on
              the tidal part of the pillars from the old jetty and the walls of the jetty head (Photo 18).
              Around the jetty clusters of sea grasses and sea weeds are clearly visible. Some solitaire
              corals were found on the rocks around the old jetty. A small coral reef is growing on the
              north side and in front of the jetty head, covering an area of about 150 m to the north
              and about 200 m seawards (Photos 14 to 16). To the south of the old jetty, in front of the
              cooling water intake channel, there is a stretch of about 300 to 400 m of mud, silt and

              sand. Northwards of this area there are sea grass and seaweed habitats and a porites
              coral reef.

              The sea bed between the cooling water intake and outlet channels is very shallow, with
              a very gentle slope towards the sea. Near the shore it consists of muddy sand. After
              about 200 m sea grass is growing in big patches. This is a habitat for several species of
              fish, crabs and mussels. Known sea grass species for Hirgigo bay are Syringodium
              isoetifolium, Halophila ovalis and Thalassia hemprichii. Outward of the sea grass
              patches there is a discontinuous coral reef which gradually changes into a continuous
              reef. From north to south this coral reef has a length of about 900 m, whose width varies
              between 100 and 200 m. Parts of the coral reef are moribund, and seaweeds (Sargassum
              sp.) are growing on the dead or dying corals (Photos 19 and 20). Farther out the seabed
              consists again of silty sand.

              Two species of turtles, the Hawksbill Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) and the Green
              Turtle (Chelonia mydas), have been seen in Hirgigo bay. Both species are listed as
              endangered Species by IUCN. Given the situation that the beach at the project site is
              degraded through excavation material from the power plant construction, that it consists
              of muddy sand and that parts of it are susceptible to occasional submersion at high tides,
              the probability that the turtles could use that beach as nesting area is very small.
              Occasional observations of the Dugong (Dugong dugong), an endangered species, and
              of the Bottle-nosed Dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) are reported from Hirgigo bay.

              Several Birds are using the mangroves, the beach and other objects in and around the
              project area as resting, nesting and feeding areas (see Table A13-1).


13.2          Project Impacts


13.2.1        New Jetty

              Construction Phase

              The first main impact of the jetty construction (Alternative 3) will be on the seabed and
              on the marine habitats. The offshore part of the jetty will run through 200 to 250 m of a
              muddy, silty and sandy seabed, which changes gradually into a sea grass and seaweed
              habitat. This habitat, after another 200 m, changes into a discontinuous porites (stony
              coral) reef, which then turns into a continuous coral reef. The section of the coral reef
              which will be affected will have a length of about 100 to 200 m depending on the exact
              location of the jetty.

              Approximately 18'750 m2 of undisturbed seabed including the different types of habitats
              (sea grass, seaweed patches and coral reef) will be lost. It should be mentioned that the
              part underneath the trestle, which is 625 m long, is not counted as lost habitat. The
              disturbance under the trestle, with two piles approximately every 15 m, will be much
              less pronounced than under the rock bund, and regeneration here will be rather quick.
              The submerged part of the rock bund as well will be integrated in the sea bed habitat,
              however, this process will take longer, probably a few years. The buried part of the
              seabed will be lost permanently as habitat, this (after all still small) impact can not be
              mitigated.

              The second major impact during construction will be the mobilisation of sediments in
              the seabed during construction. The amount of mobilised sediment, the size and the
              effective reach of the sediment trails will depend strongly on the construction technique
              to be used. Larger particles will sink to the ground nearby; they are usually not of a
              major concern. However the small particles can block the gills of fish, and coral polyps
              can die of suffocation, which would lead to the destruction of the corals in the
              surrounding of the construction site. Sediment trails of fine particles can be transported
              with the currents over considerable distances. However, since Hirgigo bay is shallow
              and the currents are very week (see Chapter 9), in this case there will be no long range
              transport. Sediment mobilisation also occurs under natural conditions due to storms or
              waves; organisms living under these conditions are adapted to an occasionally rather
              high content of sediments in the water. The negative impact due to the Project will be
              of short duration and limited to a small area.

              Since dredging is not required for Alternative 3, there are no further major impacts on
              the sea bed of long duration.

              Construction movements, the presence of a considerable work force in the site and the
              noise will have a negative impact on birds, which will move out of that area. However,
              since the affected area is small, the disturbance is of short duration, and since there is
              ample undisturbed space available nearby, this will not have a noticeable impact. After
              the end of the construction work, the birds will come back to use this area just as they
              are suing the exiting jetty and its surroundings.

              Construction workers may be prone to fish in the bay, though this is illegal. This
              activity does not necessarily have to be forbidden, but it should be controlled; only
              hooks should be used for fishing, and the use of net or and especially the use of
              explosives must be striclty prohibited.

              Concerning the construction site on land there will not be any major negative impacts
              on biodiversity. The access roads to the construction site already exist. The connecting
              pipelines between tank farm and jetty are going through a degraded area without any
              value as natural habitat. The new jetty will be built on a part of the shoreline where the
              mangrove belt is already interrupted; so no mangroves have to be destroyed (Photos 4 to
              8).

              Operation Phase

              As has been said, the surface covered by rock bund material will be permanently lost as
              a natural habitat. The submerged parts of this bund, however, over time will be
              colonised by a variety of marine animals, sessile as well as mobile ones, as can be
              observed on the rubble foundation of the existing jetty. This process will take a few
              years, but eventually the rock bund and the submerged parts of the concrete pillars, after
              the steel casing will have corroded away, will be integrated again in the sea bed habitat.

              Impacts during the operation phase will be related to the activities on the jetty, the most
              important being the possibility of water contamination with products leaking out of the
              pipelines.

13.2.2        Existing Jetty

              The impact of the demolition of the old jetty depends on the demolishing method to be
              applied. According to the feasibility study it is envisaged to construct a temporary
              crushed rock platform in order to carry out the demolition works. This platform will be
              located adjacent to the jetty and it will have approximately the same length as the jetty
              in order to provide access to the cranes and other heavy machines needed for the
              demolition works. The width of the platform should be enough to provide access for this
              equipment (approximately 8 to 10 m). The platform will sit on the sea bed.

              The construction of the temporary crushed rock platform will mobilise a lot of sediment.
              Since the upper part of the platform will be 8 to 10 m and it will have approximately the
              length of the old jetty, approximately 15'000 m2 of seabed habitat of different types will
              be covered by the structure. After finalising the dismantling of the old jetty, the platform
              will have to be removed, and this will lead again to sediment mobilisation. This process
              is a main impact of the Project.

              The surroundings of the existing jetty, and the submerged parts of the jetty itself, have
              become integrated into the sea bed habitat and exhibit a fauna which is very similar to
              that of the neighbouring reef (Photos 14 to 16). This habitat would be destroyed by the
              removal of the old jetty.

              Furthermore a stretch of probably about 20 m of the mangrove belt will have to be
              cleared for the construction of the platform and the access of the construction machines.
              This disturbance of the valuable mangrove habitat again constitutes a considerable
              negative impact.

              The removing of the existing dolphin will have just a small impact; it should be
              removed in one piece as described in the feasibility study.


13.3          Proposed Mitigation Measures

              Overall, the construction of the new jetty will not have significant adverse impacts, the
              loss of habitat being small and therefore without consequences for the marine
              biodiversity in the surroundings. This loss of habitat can not be mitigated. The only
              possibility is to reduce the rock bund length to the extent possible, in order to minimise
              the impact. Once the structure is in place the marine habitat will recover and the
              submerged part of the rock bund will become a part of it.

              The mobilisation of sediment can be reduced by choosing appropriate construction and
              precautionary measures as follows:

                  · Bringing in material for the construction of the rock bund jetty during low tide;
                      when the water level is lower and parts of the seabed are exposed, the first part
                      of the jetty could be built without creation of sediment trails.

                  · The height from which the stones are dropped onto the seabed for the rock bund
                      should be as low as possible, and unnecessary falling of debris onto the seabed
                      should be prevented.

                  · The material brought in should be clean, i.e. without a high proportion of very
                      fine material, which would immediately become suspended in the water and in
                      this way would add to the sediment load.

                  · A solution for the deeper water could be to have a floating screen, suspended on
                      a boon, around the construction area and moving out as the work on the bund
                      progresses. Given the absence of important currents in the project area, a fine
                      mesh net should be sufficient for keeping the bulk of the suspended sediment
                      confined.

              Concerning the removal of the old jetty, refer to Chapter 15 for a discussion of the
              issues at hand.


13.4          Conclusions

              The construction of the new jetty will cover marine habitats and will have an impact on
              the coral reefs near by. Due to the low currents in Hirgigo Bay impacts on the coral reef
              around Green Island (Photo 21) can be ruled out. The construction site is rather small
              and the construction period in which a lot of sediment will be mobilised is of rather
              short duration. For these reasons, the construction of the new jetty is not seen as a major
              negative impact for the biodiversity. Nevertheless, the mitigation measures discussed
              briefly in the previous Section should be taken for reducing this impact to the extent
              possible.

              The main risk for the biodiversity in the area is the one presented by a major oil spill
              due to a rupture of a pipeline. This risk is clearly given by the existing jetty due to its
              poor condition and the increasing risk of such an event to happen. The reduction of this
              risk by replacing the existing structure with a new one, which will not only be more
              reliable, but also equipped with modern oil spill containment material, by far offsets the
              impact on biodiversity caused by its construction.

              On the other hand, the negative impact due to the construction of the platform and the
              demolition of the old jetty is considered as a not really required and overall more
              important, impact than the one caused by the construction of the new jetty; see Chapter
              15 for a discussion of this issue.

14.1              Basic Indicators

                  The socio-economic indicators from the latest UNDP Human Development Report
                  (HDR), 2007/2008 show an improvement in some sectors from the 2006 indicators for
                  Eritrea in general. According to the HDR Eritrea is ranked 157 on the Human
                  Development Index (HDI), thus falling in the Low Human Development category. For
                  the Human Poverty Index, Eritrea is ranked 70. Population has grown, and with it the
                  number of people living below the national poverty line has decreased. However, the
                  health indicators show a deteriorating situation with an increase of people with
                  infectious diseases and government spending on health as a percentage of GDP also
                  going down. Government spending on the education sector has increased, albeit the
                  constant percentage of student enrolment at the different levels of education. The HDI
                  index trend for Eritrea has been 0.453 in 1995, 0.459 in 2000 to the present 0.483.

              The Fishery sector is one of the most important sectors in Eritrea, in terms of nutritional
              value for the population and as an export-earning component, and as an income earning
              source for those employed in the sector. In general, data for Eritrea on fish consumption
              and trade were as follows for the year 2000:

14.2          Existing Situation

              In order to place the project site in the context of Massawa, a description of Massawa
              town and its environs is necessary to show its link to the project (see following section).
              A description of the Hirgigo Village is also given in order to show the situation existing
              outside the project site, but that could still be possibly linked to the project, from a
              social perspective.


14.3          Project Impacts

              Massawa is the principal port of Eritrea and lies on Massawa Island. The port is
              connected, through a causeway to Taulud Island, which again is linked to the mainland
              via another causeway. Massawa is linked to the capital, Asmara, by a good tarmac road.
              To the northwest of the exiting port are the peninsulas of Gherar and Abd el Kader.

              Port Massawa has both the old and new sections, the former expanding in the northern
              direction, comprising mainly of the Eritrea Free Zone, while in the south-western
              direction on Taulud Island, the modern government offices of, e.g. Port Authority
              represent the new section. Within the old sections, mainly on Massawa Island, are
              historical buildings, museums, churches, and residential and commercial buildings.
              Figure 7-1 shows Massawa's different areas.

              The town houses the municipality administration, various government departments and
              ministries' branches e.g. fisheries, environment, tourism. The port has various facilities,
              which include naval, yachting marina, the Port Authority, fishing docks and jetties, etc.
              The town is well served with good roads and modern administrative buildings,
              restaurants, bars and hotels, shops and a shopping mall, churches and mosques, and new
              building constructions and renovations are ongoing.

              Massawa is also a tourist attraction. Tourists come for diving on coral reefs, shipwrecks
              and around the Islands of Dhalak and Green. Tourists also come to see the historical
              buildings, and to the south there are historical places such as Adulis and the ancient port
              that also attract interest.

              Massawa is divided into areas, e.g. port, industrial, residential and commercial, beach,
              and hotels and recreational (see Figure 7-1).

              Massawa may be seen as housing the following:

              Administration and Government offices: Herein are the various ministries' and
              government departments, such as fisheries, environment, public works, tourism and
              energy and mines.

              Commercial Centre: The Department of Fisheries is located in this area. The area also
              has many shops, restaurants and bars along the main road. Note that this is in the old
              town, which harbours many tourist attractions, i.e. historical buildings. In addition,
              hotels and residential areas are also within this area. While further on the mainland, just
              directly after the Taulud causeway, moving southwest are the modern residential and
              municipality complexes.

              Residential: These are scattered within the old town and on the mainland as described
              above, additional residential area is within the commercial area.

              Industrial: This is concentrated on the mainland at Hirgigo Power Plant, and Tamoil
              Depot and Southern Jetty. The project is situated within this area (on the southern
              margin of the map given in Fig. 7-1).


14.3.1        Project Site

              The existing situation on the project site is that there are a few structures on site. These
              include the Hirgigo power plant, the southern jetty (in this report usually mentioned as
              existing or old jetty), Tamoil depot (tank farm), and Hirgigo workers' camp. The two
              structures (thermal power plant and the existing jetty) have empty land surrounding
              them on the landward side and on the other side is the sea. There are no other economic
              activities taking place here, apart from generation of electricity at the plant and
              receiving oil and other oil products via the jetty, and storing it at the depot. Through the
              jetty, ample supply of oil products help to keep the country's economic and social
              activities (industry, commercial and domestic) continue functioning.

              The project site is fenced off on land, and at sea the area is a security zone due to both
              the jetty and the power plant utilities (pipelines, dolphins, water intake structure,
              cooling outlet structure, etc.). How far out at sea the security zone stretches is not
              demarcated.

14.3.2        Hirgigo Village

              Further south of the project area is Hirgigo Village (Photo 22). Hirgigo Village falls
              under the North Red Sea administrative region, and is within the sub-zone of Massawa.
              The present village is smaller today, having been burned down in 1975/76. The ethnic
              make-up of the village population comprises: Afar, Arabic, Saho, and Tigre. The ethnic
              Arab are nomadic, commonly known as Rashaida. A small number of households
              migrate during the hot season.

              The dominating religion is Islam. The village is a complete administrative unit with
              facilities for education, health, water, and judicial and religious matters. A depiction of
              the village's administrative unit is shown in Annex A14.1. Electricity is just being
              installed and three telephone lines exist. The education facilities cater for children up to
              Grade 8; higher education is then continued at the facility in Massawa town. A health
              centre with 30 beds exists and other health facilities. The most common health problems
              are diarrhoea, respiratory problems and malaria. Prenatal care is good and where
              complicated cases in delivery occur, Massawa is contacted to send an ambulance and
              transfer the patient to the hospital for examination.

              Being located on the Red Sea shore, the main economic activity is fishing, however, the
              number of vessels used for this activity are few, three canoes and three sambuks. There
              are only 20 fishermen in Hirgigo village, and fishing grounds have been identified to be
              at Dhalak archipelagos and Hirgigo Bay. Fish products and fish are sold at Massawa
              and Hirgigo markets.

              Secondary economic activities encompass agriculture and labourers at Massawa.

              One important factor in Hirgigo village is the Manzanar Project. This poverty
              alleviation project is based mainly on the protection and propagation of mangroves.
              This has an indirect effect on the livelihood of the population through improving
              fisheries in the area, and it has a very direct effect through the production of fodder for
              livestock. To prevent damage to the mangroves, the mangrove belt is fenced off to
              prevent animals, and mainly camels, to browse directly on the trees. Twigs are cut and
              fruit collected, which then are used as fodder for livestock (Photos 23 and 24). This
              selective use of the resource prevents damaging the trees, and especially allows young
              trees to grow. See Annex 14 for some background information on this project.

              For Hirgigo Village, the available socio-economic data stems from ECMIB, Massawa.

              From visits and observations at the Hirgigo village, the following data and information
              were collected during discussions with the village administration and village elders, the
              National Social Scientist at Massawa Administration supplied additional data.

14.4          Project Impacts

              The impacts seen from a socio-economic perspective are positive. There is the
              possibility of:

                   · Employing people from both Massawa and Hirgigo. The number to be employed
                        and the duration of their employment are not known, but it will be limited.

                   · Housing the employed/contracted labourers at the workers' housing complex at
                        Hirgigo Power Plant complex.

                   · Improved business for the commercial entities in Massawa, due to increased
                        construction activity in the area.

              Impacts on people in surrounding area

                   · There are no major negative impacts, as people do not live on the project site.

                   · None of people's land will be expropriated, and the project does not require any
                        resettlement.

                   · None of the accesses to resources will be affected or blocked. The area around
                        the existing jetty and the site for the new one is not a fishing ground, since
                        access to this area is prohibited for safety and security reasons.

                  · Should building materials be excavated from quarries near Hirgigo village, noise
                     becomes an issue.


14.5          Proposed Mitigation Measures

              There are no mitigation measures apart from that for noise. The building contractor
              should:

                  · Ensure use of heavy machinery during normal working hours if construction
                     materials have to be collected from the quarry near Hirgigo Village. Do not
                     excavate rocks, stones during the night hours and before dawn when villagers
                     are asleep.

                  · Avoid transporting heavy materials using roads very close to old historical,
                     cultural buildings or monuments, thus avoiding causing more damage to tourist
                     attractions. Alternative routes should be identified even if it takes longer.


14.6          Conclusions
                  · There are no major negative impacts on the populations of Massawa and
                     Hirgigo.

                  · The major positive impact is the possibility of employment, though it is not
                     known how many will be employed and for how long.

                  · At this point in time, it is not known where the quarry is situated where the
                     building contractor will collect building material. Should it be near Hirgigo
                     village, then use of heavy machines should be at normal working hours so as not
                     to disrupt villagers' routine.

15            REMOVAL OF THE EXISTING JETTY


15.1          Prevailing situation

              The situation of the sea bed around the existing jetty is described shortly in Chapter 13
              In summarising this, the following can be said:

                  · The sea bed has fully recovered from the impact caused over 70 years ago
                      through the construction of the jetty.

                  · The parts of the jetty which are submerged (rubble bund, foundations of piles
                      and plinths, including submerged parts of the jetty head) by now can be
                      considered as a marine habitat, largely overgrown by various sessile marine
                      organisms (aufwuchs).

                  · Disturbance through jetty operation is minimal. The fact that the surroundings of
                      the jetty are banned for fishing activities might have a positive effect on the fish
                      population of this area.

              This is not meaning to say that the jetty is a marine habitat comparable to, e.g., an intact
              coral reef along one of the outer islands. The water here is rather turbid, certainly caused
              by wave and tidal effects on the muddy coastal flat, and this has an effect especially on
              sessile organisms. Still the jetty and its surroundings can be considered as a habitat in its
              own right (Photos 14-18).


15.2          Impact

              The demolition process as described in Section 5.5.3 and 5.5.4 is likely have to a
              considerable impact on the environment. It should be carefully checked what options
              there are to minimise these effects.

              As described in other sections of this Report, the main environmental impact of the
              Project will occur during the construction period and is due mainly to (i) direct
              destruction of marine life on the seabed surface occupied by rock bund and trestle, and
              (ii) mobilisation of sediments which will be transported by currents (only over short
              distances given the prevailing situation) and will have an additional impact mainly on
              sessile organisms (corals, sea weeds and sea grasses etc.) in the vicinity of the
              construction site. Overall, the impact is considered as small, since it does not affect any
              very valuable habitats (like e.g. coral reefs in good condition), and is limited in extent as
              well as in time. The disturbed sea bed area will recover rather quickly and return to its
              original state. Nevertheless, efforts should be made to minimise these undesirable, albeit
              small impacts (see Section 13.4).

              The effect of the demolition of the existing jetty on the environment, if carried out as
              described in Sections 5.5.3 and 5.5.4, will be the following:

                  · Sea bed fauna and flora will be destroyed by the construction of the "platform"
                      (rubble mound) adjacent to the jetty. Since this will have to be strong enough for
                      supporting heavy machinery and presumably high enough not to be submerged

                      at high tide, and since it will have a useful width of about 10 m, it will destroy a
                      seabed area of about 15'000 m²; this is in the same order of magnitude as the
                      area occupied by the rock bund of Alternative 3.

                  · Bringing in the material for the platform will mobilise sediment, again in the
                      same order of magnitude as expected from the construction of the new jetty.

                  · Removal of the existing jetty will cause some sediment movement, mainly from
                      debris falling into the water (while the debris itself, basically pieces of concrete,
                      will be of very minor concern). In addition, removal of the submerged parts of
                      the jetty (lower parts of pillars and plinths) will destroy the sessile marine
                      organisms (aufwuchs) which have grown there. Inspection of the site has shown
                      that these parts of the jetty have become a part of the sea bed and serve as
                      habitat to a number of sessile organisms and their accompanying fauna.

                  · Later on, removal of the platform itself will cause another disturbance of the sea
                      bed. Most of all, this process is likely to mobilise much more sediment than any
                      other work carried out in the context of the project for a new oil jetty.

                  · Overall, this disturbance will last longer than that caused by the construction of
                      the new jetty, thus delaying recovery of the sea bed fauna and flora.

                  · Finally, building the platform will have to cut through the mangrove belt.
                      Although at this place the mangrove belt is narrow and already interrupted by
                      the existing jetty, it is still an undesirable effect, and it will offset the (small)
                      benefit of removing the old jetty, which would result from closing the gap in the
                      mangrove belt at this place.

              In conclusion, it can be said that the direct environmental impact resulting from the
              demolition of the old jetty would be more important than the entire impact caused by
              the construction of the new jetty.

              In addition, this work will cause very considerable costs.

              Given this situation, is seems appropriate to check whether there are any alternatives.


15.3          Mitigation


15.3.1        Necessity for Removing the Existing Jetty

              It has been pointed out that the existing jetty needs to be kept in operation until the new
              jetty can be used. It is well understood that there is no further use foreseen for the old
              jetty once the new structure is in place, and that the its state would also not allow any
              other use of this structure in the future. However, there is still the question of the
              necessity to remove it. The following can be considered:

                  · Tourism: the entire project area (including locations of new as well as old jetty)
                      is of no interest for tourism, therefore there does not seem to be any necessity of
                      removing the old jetty from this point of view. On the other hand, building the
                      platform and removing the entire structure will cause noise, which could have a

ESIA Final Report                                                                Page 111


                     (however small) negative impact on the tourism zone in the southernmost part of
                     Taulud Island.

                  · Landscape: the existing jetty is visible from the southern part of Taulud Island as
                     well as from Green Island, as are the intake channel and the stacks of Hirgigo
                     power plant, and as, to somewhat lesser degree, the new jetty will be. None of
                     these structures is an element which disturbs the appearance of the landscape in
                     any major way.

                  · Conflicts with other uses of the site: the Consultant does not have any
                     information suggesting that there might be any plans for using the site of the
                     existing jetty for any other purpose.

                  · Biodiversity: as has been said at the beginning of this Chapter, the submerged
                     parts of the existing jetty are fully integrated in the sea bed habitat and can no
                     longer be considered as a disturbing or disrupting item. The habitat has fully
                     recovered from the impact which was caused by the construction of the jetty.
                     Removing these parts of the jetty would destroy the organisms which live there
                     and thus cause another negative impact on the sea bed biota.

                  · Risk for people: the RH studies make it quite clear that it is no longer safe for
                     people to use the existing jetty in any way, the main risks being falling debris
                     from the structure or the collapse of a section of it. However, fishing is not
                     allowed in the vicinity of the jetty, and unauthorised persons are not allowed on
                     the jetty or in its immediate surroundings. Since even once the existing jetty will
                     no longer be used, it will still be the seaside of the tank farm, it is assumed that
                     these access restrictions will remain in force. Therefore, the existing jetty can
                     not be considered as being a safety risk.

              As a conclusion, there does not seem to be a requirement for removing the existing
              jetty.


15.3.2        Alternatives

              The following alternatives seem to be available:

                  · Complete removal: removing the existing jetty in the way described in Sections
                     5.5.3 and 5.5.4.

                  · Partial removal: similar approach, but restricting the removal on the
                     superstructure of the jetty and the upper parts of the pillars, leaving rubble
                     mound and pile foundations in place.

                  · No demolition of the existing jetty.

              Whatever solution is being chosen, in any case the structures on the jetty head (shed,
              hose reels) and, most importantly, the pipelines, including their submarine sections, will
              have to be removed, on the one side in order to prevent contamination from oil residues
              still in the pipelines, on the other side for making use of the material. This, therefore, is
              a component for each of the alternatives. It is assumed that this could be done without
              the need for a lateral platform along the jetty. It might be feasible, at least for a part of
              the pipelines, to bring them out to the jetty head and transport them by barges from
              there, while from the part of the jetty closer to the shore it might be preferable to bring
              the pipeline sections on land. Likewise, the dolphin should be removed. Since this
              structure stands in deep water, this can be done by means of a boat equipped with a
              suitable crane.

              Option 1: complete removal.

              The disadvantages of this option would be that the entire range of environmental
              impacts as described in the previous section would arise, and that it would cause
              substantial costs. The main negative impact, apart from the economic one, would be the
              one on marine biodiversity.

              On the other hand, the only advantage of this option would be to have at this place, after
              a recovery period of a number of years, again a sea bed which corresponds more or less
              to the original state of the sea bed as it was before the construction of the old jetty in the
              thirties of last century. This is considered as a small environmental benefit.

              Option 2: partial removal.

              The effect would be largely the same as the one for Option 1, although destruction of
              existing marine life would be somewhat reduced due to the fact that rubble bund and
              submerged parts of the existing jetty, i.e. those parts which presently can be considered
              and part of the marine habitat, would remain in place. However, the main impact would
              stem from building and removing the temporary platform, and given the disturbance this
              would cause locally, mainly the amount of sediment mobilised, it is very likely that
              most of the sessile organisms living there would have been destroyed in the process
              anyway. Therefore, the advantage of this approach seems rather marginal. The costs of
              this option are likely to be almost the same (some savings through less material to
              move) than those of Option 1.

              Option 3: no removal of existing jetty

              This alternative would have the least environmental impacts, and certainly the least on
              marine biodiversity. The habitat created by the jetty as such would remain in place, and
              there would be no impact due to platform construction and removal. Over time, the jetty
              would decay and collapse. The damage to marine life caused by falling debris would be
              too small to be of relevance. A possible negative aspect would be the fact that for a very
              long period the decaying structure would remain visible (in a way comparable to the
              wrecks in the shallow water area around Massawa port). However, this is also
              considered as a minor environmental impact. In addition, except for the removal of the
              pipelines this option would not cause any further costs.

              In order to make the structure inaccessible from the land side, in this option it might still
              be considered to remove the superstructure at the shoreline of the jetty. For this purpose,

ESIA Final Report                                                                Page 113


              cranes could be used without requiring the construction of a platform, since only those
              spans would be removed that could readily be reached by machines standing on land.

              Option 4: removal without the use of heavy machines

              The idea behind this option is that it might be possible to destroy and remove the
              superstructure of the jetty by means of hand held tools instead of heavy machines. The
              foundations of the piles as well as the rubble bund would remain in place. This option
              would probably be considerably cheaper than full removal with heavy machines,
              especially since it would not require a lateral platform. Obviously, it would take a much
              longer time to remove the jetty in this way, but given the situation of the site and the
              absence of a plan for alternative use of the site this should not be an obstacle. The
              amount of debris falling into the sea when using this method might be more important
              than when using heavy machines, but this is considered as being of minor importance
              especially in comparison to the impact which the platform would cause.

              With Option 4, it might be possible also to leave the jetty head in place. In this case, it
              might be preferable just to remove the concrete surface of the jetty head and leave the
              remaining part (which according to the feasibility study is filled with sand or gravel) as
              a small island. This would certainly be used by sea birds as a resting place and
              potentially even, by some species, for breeding.

              If this option should be considered, its feasibility, mainly with respect to safety of the
              workers involved, would have to be assessed carefully by a specialist with experience in
              demolition work.


15.4          Conclusions and Recommendations

              Given the situation described above, and especially the very considerable environmental
              impact caused by the demolition of the old jetty as well as the costs involved, it is
              recommended that Options 3 and 4 should be considered. A substantial environmental
              impact could be prevented just by letting the existing jetty stand, and there are no strong
              aesthetic or other consideration which would recommend against this option.

              Obviously, if the lateral platform would already have been built for maintenance work
              on the existing jetty, then the main impact would have been caused already anyway, and
              in this case Options 3 and 4 would probably not be taken into consideration. This,
              however, according to information received from MPA and the contractor in charge of
              the intervention work, is not the case.

              It might be wise to consider saving the (probably quite high) costs for removing the
              existing jetty and to use this money for installing dedicated pipelines instead (whereby it
              has to be said that at this time no direct comparison of the costs of these two items can
              be made; see the following Table for a rough estimate). If this could be done, it would
              prevent the impact on local biodiversity which removal of the old jetty will invariably
              have, and it will improve the environmental performance of the new jetty.

               This comparison is based on the following assumptions:

                    · Cost for platform: based on unit costs for rock bund construction according to
                        feasibility study (RH 2006: 76), given as 3400 USD/m; the construction of the
                        platform will presumably be cheaper, since it will not be made for lasting for a
                        long period. On the other hand, as the material will again have to be removed,
                        and given its length which is comparable with (or even somewhat longer than)
                        the rock bund of the new jetty, overall it will probably not cost less.

                    · Cost for pipeline given as 600 USD/m (RH 2006: 76), two pipelines required
                        over the entire length from the tank farm to the jetty head.

               This comparison shows that the two cost items might be quite similar in magnitude.
               What is missing here are the costs of two additional loading arms versus the costs of
               demolishing the old jetty. Even if this can therefore not be taken as a reliable cost
               estimate, it shows at least that it is a possibility well worth considering.

16            SYNOPSIS OF IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES

              In the previous chapters, environmental risks and impacts likely to emanate from project
              parts or project related activities were described. This chapter provides a synopsis of the
              impacts, points out their importance and lists the required or proposed mitigation
              measures, where such measures seem necessary for minimising the impact as far as
              possible or reducing the risk to an acceptable level.

              The matrix overleaf provides a summarising overview of all expected impacts and risks
              of the project of a new oil jetty in Hirgigo Bay, to replace the existing structure.

              The one major risk identified is the risk of an oil spill caused by a structural failure of
              the existing jetty. An oil spill of some magnitude would have strong negative impacts
              on the water quality in the bay, and on all marine life in this area, including the reefs
              and the mangrove belt. Given the weak currents and wave action in the bay, it is not
              expected that oil would be dispersed over a very large area in a short time. Nevertheless,
              and obviously depending on the amount of oil spilled and the specific weather
              conditions at the time of the accident, it can not be excluded that the touristically
              important Green Island or the surroundings of Taulud Island with its tourist
              infrastructure and residential areas would be affected. Such an oil spill would be made
              more serious by the fact that oil containment material is not available at the jetty itself,
              but would have to be brought from the port.

              The new jetty will considerably improve this situation, mainly through the following
              points:

                  · New structure, not presenting a risk of collapsing.

                  · Oil spill containment material available at the jetty itself.

              In addition, the new jetty will also reduce the risk of small, undetected oil losses over
              longer periods, by (i) placing the pipelines on a jetty, which makes control and, if
              required, repair, easy (like the existing jetty, but unlike Alternative 6); (ii) new structure
              replacing the old one, higher reliability; (iii) marine unloading arms, no underwater
              pipelines and hoses like at the existing jetty.

              To this last point it should be noted that marine arms are listed in the feasibility study as
              a component of the project. In a discussion with the Design Consultant there was an
              indication that these might be replaced by hoses for cost reasons. This would lead to a
              somewhat less favourable assessment of the new jetty, although of course it would still
              be much preferable to the prevailing situation.

              Another point seen as negative is the (still required) flushing of the pipeline for white
              products. This could be considerably improved, or virtually eliminated, by installing
              dedicated pipelines.

Petroleum Jetty ESIA                                                               Date March 25, 2008
ESIA Final Report                                                                  Page 117



              All other impacts are considered as small, if any. The most important are discussed
              shortly below.

              Land use: no impacts will be noted in this respect, since there is no alternative land use
              there now, nor is there any real possibility for using this land alternatively. It is a
              designated industrial area, of no tourist or cultural and historical interest whatsoever.

              Air Quality and noise: impacts will occur due to the construction activities, the most
              important of which will be due to transport of material through residential areas of
              Massawa town. However, given the volume and duration of these activities, effects will
              still be within accepted air quality and noise standards. Nevertheless, it is recommended
              to do the necessary for keeping the impact as low as possible. This can best be done by
              a good maintenance of the vehicles (mainly to prevent unnecessary air pollution) and a
              careful planning of transports (to prevent unnecessary driving of lorries and heavy
              equipment).

              Water quality: as mentioned above, the main risk in this respect stems from the oil
              spill risk, which is considerably larger now as it is expected to be with the new jetty.
              The second most important source is the flushing of pipelines, which will remain the
              same as it is now unless dedicated pipelines are installed. In addition to this, there will
              be some, albeit limited, impacts on water quality due to construction activities. These
              should be minimised in the extent possible. The main mitigation measures here are to
              carry out maintenance and repair work on vehicles and machines in dedicated areas with
              sealed surfaces and water treatment facilities, and to store fuels, lubricants and
              chemicals in safe places away from water.

              Coast and sea bed dynamics: given the situation in the bay, the project will not have
              any noticeable effect on wave action, currents and sediment transport. Changes in
              sedimentation and erosion will be very small and very localised, if any at all. Specific
              mitigation measures in this respect are not required.

              Health: health risks will arise, in the amount to be expected at construction sites of this
              size, due to risks of accidents and the risk of transmitting of communicable diseases in
              the work force. The contractor will have to take the usual precaution measures (safety
              equipment, training of workers, health checks, information and health services) in order
              to minimise risks and to deal with accidents and illnesses that might occur. The one
              overall public health risk presented by the project is the one which might be caused by a
              major oil spill. The risk of this happening will be greatly reduced by the new jetty.

              Biodiversity: the impacts on biodiversity (mangroves, sea grasses and sea weeds, coral
              reefs, marine fauna and birds) are caused mainly (i) by building the rock bund for the
              new jetty (permanent destruction of habitat, temporary impact on surrounding habitats
              through mobilised sediments), (ii) by general construction activities (presence of work
              force; noise; risk for water contamination; fishing), and (iii) by all activities related to
              demolishing the old jetty (construction and removal of platform, removal of jetty as
              such). The latter impact is likely to be more important than the one caused by the new
              jetty.

              Socio-economy: the project effects, overall, are positive. Given the site and its
              characteristics, the project does not cause any resettlement, there is no need for

              expropriation, and no limitation of access to resources. The effect on local fisheries will
              be negligible, if any (small indirect impact possible through impacting fish populations
              due to sediment mobilisation, but reduction in risk of much larger impact that would be
              caused by a major oil spill). On the other hand, there is some potential for jobs being
              created on the construction site (although on a temporary basis), and it is expected that
              the regional economy as a whole will benefit from the project.

              Looking at the matrix the other way, i.e. with a focus on project components, the
              following conclusions are reached:

                  · The overall major environmental benefit of the project consists in the fact that
                     the environmental risk presented by the danger of a major oil spill caused by the
                     decaying structure of the existing jetty will be, not completely eliminated, but
                     reduced to acceptable standards.

                  · The construction of the selected alternative of the new jetty at the chosen site
                     will cause some impacts, all of which, however, are small and of no further
                     relevance. Furthermore, some of them can be reduced by applying suitable
                     mitigation measures. Overall, the advantage resulting from abandoning the
                     exiting jetty prevails.

                  · The demolition of the existing jetty causes impacts which are at least of the same
                     magnitude, but probably considerably larger, than those caused by the new jetty.
                     Given this, and in the absence of a stringent reason for removing this structure, it
                     is recommended not to demolish it.

              The recommended mitigation measures are described to some more detail in the EMP
              (Vol. 4 of the ESIA Study).

A1            INTRODUCTION


A1.1          Scope of the Study: TOR


A1.1.1        Background

              The State of Eritrea is proposing a new petroleum jetty at Hirgigo Bay - Massawa, to
              replace the current jetty serving the Hirgigo Power Plant, the Tamoil depot and the Eri-
              gas depot. The existing petroleum jetty was constructed by Italians in 1935 and is in
              very poor condition. However, as it is of great strategic value to the State of Eritrea it
              must be kept in use during the replacement of the old jetty.

              The new jetty will form the main route for the import of petroleum products into Eritrea.
              Demolition of old jetty and the construction of new jetty require the preparation of an
              Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and the implementation of a
              mitigation/management Plan, (the Plan) to fully satisfy the World Bank requirements
              for Category 'A' projects. The client is the Massawa Port Authority (MPA) to whom the
              consultant will be responsible.


A1.1.2        Objectives

              The main objective of this assignment is to ensure that the proposed Environmental and
              Social Impact Assessment and associated Plan provide environmentally sound and
              sustainable management practices during the construction and operation of the project.
              The study will assess and evaluate the positive and the negative impacts and propose
              mitigation measures for the construction and operation and maintenance of the new jetty
              and demolition and disposal of the old jetty. The Environmental and Social Impact
              Assessment and Plan will review each development alternative 1 to 6(layout
              alternatives) and clearly assess and evaluate their environmental and social costs and
              benefits. The alternatives were given a preliminary evaluation in the Hirgigo Bay
              Petroleum Jetty Phase 1B Report _ Feasibility and Preliminary Design (January '06)
              and should be reviewed by the consultant to confirm the evaluation and elaborate
              appropriate mitigation measures.

              The Consultant will also advise on all environmental and social mitigation measures
              necessary to maintain the existing oil jetty in an operational condition until the new jetty
              starts functioning. The Consultant will further advise and formulate the required
              environmental planning and management actions that will be implemented during
              demolition and disposal of the old jetty.

              It should be noted that the ESIA consultancy assignment has to be carried out parallel
              with the on-going Detail Design and that consultations will be conducted regularly with
              the design team

              International requirements in general and IMP requirements in particular (such as the
              Oil Spill Response Convention (OPRC) and London Convention should be observed.

A1.1.3        Scope of Services

              The Consultant will carry out all the studies necessary to fully meet the objectives
              described above and in doing so, shall conduct all the activities, tasks, and directives
              prescribed by the World Bank's Operational Policy on Environmental Assessment (OP
              4.01) and the National Environmental Assessment Procedures and Guidelines of the
              State of Eritrea. The Consultant will work closely with the client, the Department of
              Environment within the Ministry of Land, Water and Environment (MOLWE), the
              Ministry of Public Works (MOPW), the Petroleum Corporation of Eritrea, Tamoil,
              Ministry of Energy and Mines, Ministry of Fisheries, Northern Red Sea Zone, and the
              Municipality of Massawa City. The Consultant shall identify the key environmental and
              social issues and include mitigation of predicted adverse environmental impacts during
              construction, monitoring the implementation of mitigation measures during operations
              particularly those that might be needed for the long-term.

              The Department of Environment (MOLWE), which is the responsible authority in
              Eritrea for coordinating all efforts of monitoring mitigation activities will review the
              ESIA report for its adequacy and also monitor the jetty project activities during its
              implementation and operation according to the mitigation and monitoring plan included
              in the ESIA.

              The Consultant shall carry out all the activities/ tasks described below:

              1. Review the Hirgigo Bay Petroleum Jetty Phase 1B Report -- Feasibility and
                  Preliminary Design (January '06), especially initial review of development options
                  1-6; option 7 has been dropped from further consideration.

              2. Conduct and Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) with detailed
                  consultation and data collection to establish the existing (baseline) environmental
                  and social conditions at the old and the new jetty sites in connection with demolition
                  impacts of the old jetty and the construction impacts anticipated with the
                  development of new jetty and its operation. Any long-term effects on the
                  environment shall be assessed in the ESIA report. Design alternatives (layouts 1-6)
                  shall be evaluated for their respective environmental and social costs and benefits,
                  including a non-action scenario to confirm initial findings in the Hirgigo Bay
                  Petroleum Jetty Phase 1B Report -- Feasibility and Preliminary Design (January
                  '06).

              3. Undertake consultations with the potential users and other stakeholders regarding
                  the adverse environmental impacts related with the demolition of the old jetty and
                  construction of the new jetty and solicit their views on mitigation and management
                  of anticipated adverse impacts.

              4. Provide guidance on the implementation of legal/regulatory requirements to be
                  followed during the development and functioning of the new jetty and demolition
                  and disposal of the old jetty including the preparation of the Environmental and
                  Social Impact Assessment to meet current Eritrean regulations.

              5. Assess on-shore land use implications of the construction of new jetty and the extent
                  and impact of waste (debris) generated as a result of demolition of the existing jetty
                  and the mechanism for its handling and disposal.

              6. Assess the ecological impacts of the new jetty including: the endangerment, or
                  further endangering of any species of flora and fauna, disturbance/destruction of
                  mangroves or coral reefs, disruption/destruction of fishery resources, tourism loss
                  and diminution of the aesthetic, scientific or any other environmental quality or
                  value of the area, or any hazard/s/risks. Propose ways to deal with impacts on
                  ground and surface water resources (if any).

              7. Identify clearly any adverse and beneficial impacts upon local communities and the
                  region , in general.

              8. Assess air quality and human health conditions and / or requirements of the new
                  jetty area and its surroundings and assess potential long-term environmental impacts
                  due to the construction and operation of the new jetty, in terms of accidental
                  discharge of petroleum/oils, or petroleum/oil spills, fires, or any other hazard or
                  adverse environmental impact during project implementation and / or other negative
                  impacts related to the demolition and disposal of the old oil jetty.

              9. The jetty premises shall be secured against firefighting arrangements, which shall
                  include fire prevention, fire suppression, fire fighting and emergency evacuating
                  and/ or response in the affected area. The Consultant shall recommend training to
                  the staff of the Petroleum Corporation of Eritrea or any other authority decided by
                  the Client. The Consultant, in consultation with the Petroleum Corporation of
                  Eritrea, shall decide the number of trainees, duration of training and other details.
                  The training shall be in consonance with the specific firefighting requirements for
                  the oil jetty and ancillary requirements.

              10. Address the issue of the working environment with the objective of eliminating
                  occupational health hazards such as air borne contaminants, toxic chemicals, and
                  other health hazards or reducing them to levels of acceptable as not to be harmful to
                  health

              11. Identify the risk of oil spills and develop an Oil Spill Contingency Plan, with
                  recommendations regarding equipment to be procured, staffing, training and,
                  possibly, follow-up Technical Assistance (TA). This shall be done in regular
                  consultation with the MPA, the municipality and relevant stakeholders. Following
                  consultation with stakeholders, the Consultant shall arrange to impart on the job
                  training to the staff of the stakeholders, deciding on the number to be trained, extent
                  and duration. The strategy will include mitigation measures to combat pollution of
                  the sea and related environmental aspects covering construction and operations.
                  Note: the Consultant should consult the Oil Spill Response Plan (April 06) produced
                  under the Environmental Protection Review for Massawa Port for the Ministry of
                  Transport and Communications and the MPA concerning their experience in oil
                  spill containment, including equipment and use.

              12. Relevant wind, wave and sedimentation data t shall be provided to assess potential
                  impacts of alternative jetty alignments for definition of environmental mitigation
                  and management measures. Note the 1996 Lahmeyer International study on the
                  power plant effluent outfall provides such data and should be consulted by the
                  consultant.

A1.1.4        Methodology

              The Consultant shall carry out Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) of
              the jetty project and shall produce Environmental and Social Impact Mitigation/
              Management Plan, to fully satisfy the specific requirements of the World Bank policy
              and procedures applicable for Category 'A' projects. As the ESIA is closely integrated
              with the economic, financial, social, and technical development of the country, the
              Consultant will ensure that the ESIA is appropriate to the scale of the impacts associated
              with the development options,, the site, and planned execution of the project. The ESIA
              shall include particular reference to the continued operation, maintenance,
              decommissioning, demolition and disposal of the existing jetty, as well as, the
              construction, operation and maintenance aspects associated with the proposed new jetty.
              The extent and effects on the environmental and social dimensions of all the proposed
              construction activities shall be closely evaluated, including the dismantling and disposal
              of old jetty. Possible impacts on the nearby vegetation/ mangroves, fish nursery areas
              and/ or any other sensitive habitats shall be evaluated, along with social issues if found
              to be relevant If any other investigation, exploration and/ or sampling requirements are
              deemed necessary, the same shall be carried out by the Consultant as part of the ESIA
              report following discussion and agreement with the client.

A4.1.1           Alternative 1, Basic Jetty with Concrete Trestle

                 The jetty for Alternative 1 is proposed to be located as close to the existing jetty as
                 possible, somewhat to the north of position proposed in the Master Plan. Due to the fact
                 that the operations at the existing facility must continue during construction of the new
                 jetty, the new jetty must be constructed outside the safety zone of the existing jetty.

                 Pipeline support structure: In alternative 1, the pipeline will be supported by a
                 combination of a rock bund and a concrete trestle as described in Section 5.5.4 and
                 Section 5.5.5. The rock bund will have a length of 875 m and the trestle will have a
                 length of 625 m.

                 Number of pipelines: This alternative is based on 3 product pipelines with one 8" for
                 LPG, one 16" for black products (fuel oil) and one 16" for white products, i.e. gasoline,
                 gas oil and kerosene. In addition pipelines are required for:

                      · Fire fighting, a 12" salt water line

                      · Pipe spray and personnel protection, a 6" line

                 Connection: Offloading operations will be carried out by use of marine loading arms,
                 of which three will be installed at the jetty head.

                 Mooring: The mooring facilities will comprise 2 breasting dolphins and 4 mooring
                 dolphins. Fenders will also be attached to the jetty head, which will function as
                 breasting dolphin for the smallest vessels.

              Cost estimate: The CAPEX for the alternative are estimated at USD 25.2 million, see
              Appendix E for a detailed cost estimate.


A4.1.2        Alternative 2, Jetty with Steel Trestle

              The jetty in Alternative 2 is located at the same position as Alternative 1 and the main
              difference with Alternative 1 is the fact that this jetty is proposed to be constructed in
              steel.

              Pipeline support structure: The pipeline will be supported by a steel trestle and a rock
              bund. Similar to alternative 1, the rock bund will extend some 875 m and the trestle will
              have a length of 625 m.

              Number of pipelines: This alternative is based on 3 product pipelines with one 8" for
              LPG, one 16" for black products (fuel oil) and one 16" line for white products, i.e.
              gasoline, gas oil and kerosene. In addition pipelines are required for:

                  · Fire fighting, a 12" salt water line

                  · Pipe spray and personnel protection, a 6" line

              Connection: Offloading operations will be carried out by use of offloading arms, of
              which three will be installed at the jetty head.

              Mooring: The mooring facilities will comprise 2 breasting dolphins and 4 mooring
              dolphins. Fenders will also be attached to the jetty head, which will function as
              breasting dolphin for the smallest vessels.

              Cost estimate: The CAPEX for the alternative are estimated at USD 26.5 million, see
              Appendix E.


A4.1.3        Alternative 3, Jetty South of the Existing Jetty

              In this alternative a jetty similar to the proposed jetty for Alternative 1 is proposed, but
              then located South of the existing facility. This location allows a shorter route to deep
              water for the jetty and also provides the opportunity to construct the jetty directly for
              vessels of 50,000 DWT, without a need for dredging.

              Pipeline support structure: The pipelines will be supported by a combination of a rock
              bund of 625 m long and a concrete trestle, similar to alternative 1, but then only 500 m
              long.

              Number of pipelines: This alternative is based on 3 product pipelines with one 8" for
              LPG, one 16" for black products (fuel oil) and one 16" line for white products, i.e.
              gasoline, gas oil and kerosene. In addition pipelines are required for:

                  · Fire fighting, a 12" salt water line

                  · Pipe spray and personnel protection, a 6" line

              Connection: Offloading operations will be carried out by use of marine loading arms,
              of which three will be installed at the jetty head.

              Mooring: Similar to the alternatives described above, the mooring facilities will
              comprise 2 breasting dolphins and 4 mooring dolphins. Fenders will also be attached to
              the jetty head, which will function as breasting dolphin for the smallest vessels.

              Cost estimate: The CAPEX for the alternative are estimated at USD 23.1 million.


A4.1.4        Alternative 4, Jetty with Hose Connection

              This alternative is identical to alternative 1 except there are no loading arms provided,
              instead it is proposed to use the cheaper option of offloading hoses. This alternative
              provides for sufficient space at the jetty head to install offloading arms in a later stage,
              when larger volumes justify the investment in offloading arms.

              Connection: For offloading the vessel, flexible hoses will be connected from the
              pipelines to the vessel. The hose flange will be bolted to the jetty head manifold at one
              end, the other end will have a rubber lined butterfly valve and manual coupler installed.
              The hose will be manoeuvred into place using the tanker's crane/derrick and a spreader
              beam to ensure the hoses minimum bend radius is not exceeded.

              Cost estimate: The CAPEX for the alternative are estimated at USD 23.5 million.


A4.1.5        Alternative 5, CBM with Trestle

              Alternative 5 is most similar to the existing facility. Due to water depth requirements, it
              is not possible to locate this alternative on the North side of the existing jetty.

              Pipeline support structure: In this alternative the pipelines will be supported for some
              1200 m by a rock bund and some 700 m by a trestle. The last 100 m the pipelines will
              be submarine pipelines to a pipeline end manifold (PLEM).

              Number of pipelines: This alternative will have three submarine pipelines only. On the
              trestle and rock bund, there will be additional pipelines for fire fighting and a slops tank.
              The slops tank will be based on the end of the trestle.

              Connection: For offloading the vessels' manifold will be connected to the PLEM by
              means of a hose. Three submarine hoses will be permanently connected to the PLEM
              and will be marked by pick-up buoys. When a vessel is moored in the conventional
              buoy mooring the hoses will be picked up using the marker buoys and connected to the
              manifold. Valves at the PLEM will have to be opened either by divers or by a control
              vessel. The submarine hoses will incorporate a rubber lined butterfly valve and manual
              coupler to connect to the ships manifold.

              Mooring: The vessel will be moored in a Conventional Buoy Mooring (CBM)
              configuration of 4 buoys. Based on the fact that the area in the bay is indicated as
              anchor ground, the buoys will be fixed in position by permanent anchors.

              Cost estimate: The CAPEX for the alternative are estimated at USD 30.9 million.

A4.1.6        Alternative 6, CBM with Submarine Pipelines

              Alternative 6 is the most modern version of the existing system. Should one decide to
              invest in a Conventional Buoy Mooring (CBM), then it is sensible.

              Pipeline support structure: In this alternative the pipelines will be laid on the seabed
              from the shore up to the PLEM. It has been assumed that the pipelines can be welded on
              shore and pulled out by an installation vessel. Special consideration would need to be
              given to the sudden increase in water depth after the shoal if this alternative progressed.

              Number of pipelines: Three pipelines will be installed in this alternative. It is
              envisaged that the three pipelines will be connected to the PLEM, which will be
              purposely designed for three pipelines. This implies that it will not be possible to
              expand the number of pipelines in the future, without installing a new PLEM.

              Connection: Similar to alternative 5, a hose connection between the PLEM and the
              ship's manifold will be used for discharging the vessel. From an operational point of
              view not attractive to have more submarine hoses for different products, as they may get
              entangled in operations, leading to damage to the system.

              Mooring: The vessel will be moored in a Conventional Buoy Mooring configuration of
              4 buoys. Based on the fact that the area in the bay is indicated as anchor ground, the
              buoys will be fixed in position by permanent anchors.

              Cost estimate: The CAPEX for the alternative are estimated at USD 21.5 million.


A4.1.7        Alternative 7

              This alternative was developed at a later stage and described in an Addendum to the
              Feasibility and Preliminary Design Report dated June 2006 (RH 2006a). The following
              description is taken out of this Addendum. There were three sub-alternatives; the
              following description is Sub-option 7B, which was the preferred solution.

              The proposed location for Alternative 7 is south of the existing jetty, but at a sorte
              distance to it than Location 2 (south), where Alternatives 3,5 and 6 are located. It has
              the following characteristics:

                  · The proposed route of the facility starts on land at a point approximately 100m
                      south of the existing jetty.

                  · The proposed route of the facility has been chosen such that the sea is as shallow
                      as practicable. This will reduce cost of the works by minimising the volumes of
                      rock fill required for the bund and minimising the required length of piled
                      structure. To achieve this, the route generally follows a submerged reef to the
                      east of the mouth of the power station intake.

                  · Initially, the structure is in the form of a rock bund.

                  · A length of open piled jetty is provided across the width of the Power Station
                      intake to allow water to pass freely between the piles and ensure there is a flow
                      of water to the intake at all tidal states.

                  · Beyond the Power Station intake, the structure reverts to a rock bund.

                  · When the bed level reaches approximately -5.0 chart datum, a further length of

A14.1         Hirgigo Village Administrative Set-up and Organisation

              The village has a parliament whose members are elected. The parliament has the
              executive arm and a judiciary one, the community court. The parliament chooses the
              Chairman, who is the administrator. Parliament has six women and 8 men as Members
              of Parliament (MPs).

              The administrative set-up in Eritrea starts with the zone; below the zone is the sub-zone of
              which Massawa is one. Massawa sub-zone has 5 villages; Hirgigo village is one of them.
              At the village level, there are the village elders who are the spokespersons for the
              community. (The elders supplied the Consultant with most of the information about how
              the village is organised). The village administrative set-up includes the administration,
              community court, education, health, water and sanitation, sports & culture, and other
              social or economic sectors. Within the administration there are several committees which
              cater for the villagers' interests, e.g. women's, men's, youths' committees, etc. Thus a
              village is a complete administrative unit, as illustrated in Figure A14-1

A.14.2        Manzanar Project

              This is a low-tech solution to hunger and poverty project (poverty reduction and
              sustainability). Hirgigo Village participates in this project. The project's aim is to plant
              mangroves in the under-utilised inter-tidal zones and adjoining coastal deserts, so as to
              raise livestock and to increase fish yield in the area, these being the main sources of
              food.

              Mangrove forests have global environmental benefits, such as reducing green house
              gases in the atmosphere, fighting global warming, preventing sea-level rises, among
              others. In tropical coastal zones, mangrove forests are seen as one of the productive
              ecosystems; the mangroves provide a habitat for development of up to 70% of all fish
              caught in tropical and sub-tropical waters. Mangroves act as both breeding and nursery
              grounds for a variety of sedentary and migratory species of fish, mammals, birds,
              amphibians and invertebrates. They also have the capability of binding sediments,
              promoting coastal stability and provide protection against effects of coastal storms
              (Manzanar Project, p.2-4).

              In Hirgigo Village, seedlings were planted to replace the damaged natural mangrove
              forests. Up to 1 million seedlings were distributed to households and planted. These
              gave rise to a forest along the village's west coastline, near Sigalet Hirgigo Jetty. To
              protect the forest, a fence has been erected to prevent livestock, especially camels from
              feeding excessively on the foliage. Instead, foliage is fed to the livestock by the
              villagers at specific times. For the villagers of Hirgigo the mangrove forest provides
              medicinal plants, wood for construction of houses and boats, fuel wood and charcoal,
              and fodder for their livestock.

              The villagers now have sufficient fodder for their livestock during the dry season. Any
              excess fodder can be sold. With plenty of fodder mixed with fish feed, households can
              increase their livestock or sell the excess animals, thus improving their lives from the
              proceeds. The villagers, who mostly fish, also have enough fish as mangroves produce
              organic matter which is good for the fish. Manzanar Project has encouraged women to
              actively participate in the project, each representing a family and in this way benefit
              from the proceeds and have food security. Hirgigo women normally do the planting.
              This being a community project, it has helped in changing some of the villagers from
              their nomadic life to become sedentary. The proceeds from the project have also helped
              the administration in ensuring that a health centre and school are now present in the
              village. The project has benefited the whole village.

                          The mangrove belt to the south of
                          the site for the new jetty was
                          interrupted by the construction of
                          the cooling water outlet channel.
                          Mangroves grow on both sides of
                          the channel, the important stand
                          being south of it. Regrowth of
                          mangroves can be seen inside the
                          channel.

                          Some of the vessels are in a rather
                          bad shape, and might be a source of
                          oil contamination.

                          The old jetty interrupts the
                          mangrove belt. On the seaward side
                          (south, right in the picture) of it, the
                          mangrove belt is much wider that on
                          the northern (left) side. This could
                          be due to a slightly higher
                          accumulation of sediment on the
                          southern side, which in turn could
                          be the effect of the jetty over the
                          period of 70 years. A similar
                          development could result from the
                          new jetty, over a similar period.

                          A variety of sea birds (here a
                          pelican, sea gulls and a tern) use the
                          existing jetty as resting place.

                          A mudskipper (Periophthalmus sp.),
                          a small amphibious fish living in
                          mangroves, has built its nest in the
                          immediate vicinity of the old jetty.

                          material of the jetty foundation,
                          along with a high number of other
                          organisms. They are animals of rock
                          shores or coral reefs and have found
                          here a suitable, although "artificial"
                          habitat.

                          overgrown by various sessile
                          organisms ("aufwuchs") and has
                          formed, over the 70 years of its
                          existence, a reef-like habitat.

                          The jetty head is located in a reef
                          area. Corals are growing next to it,
                          forming a habitat for the
                          accompanying fauna.

                          The new jetty will cut trough a reef
                          which is very similar to the one
                          found near the old jetty head.

                          Green Island is generally in a better
                          condition and shows a higher
                          diversity than those closer to the
                          coast. However, here as well corals
                          are partly damaged.
