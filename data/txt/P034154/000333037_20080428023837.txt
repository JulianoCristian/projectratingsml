Executive Summary

An Oil Spill Risk Assessment and Contingency Plan has been prepared for the Front End
Engineering Design (FEED) Phase of the new jetty project for Massawa, Eritrea. This document will
then be updated during the system definition phase of the project.

Central to the Oil Spill Risk Assessment and Contingency Plan are the identification of release
locations along the new jetty and the release types that can occur due to the products being
offloaded at Massawa.

This oil spill risk assessment is based upon the release locations provided in the original base data
and the fact that LPG and a range of white products and black products are to be offloaded.

Statistical release sizes during product offloading operations have been obtained from international
data based upon vessel sizes which will offload at Massawa. This data may be seen in Appendix A.

The physical properties of the products to be offloaded (in particular the toxicity data and
recommended clean-up methods for small, large and huge releases) at Massawa have been
obtained from representative Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), which are given in Appendix B.

The causes, consequences and a coarse risk assessment for these release types, sizes and
locations has been documented in the Hazard Register given in Appendix G. Also on this register is
documented the design and operational safeguards that have been detailed in the FEED documents.
The impact of the safeguards on the raw risk levels is seen by the resulting level of residual risk. The
recommended actions for the Massawa Oil Spill Response Team to respond to the spills are then
documented. This semi-quantitative risk assessment has been the result of table top exercises at
EPConsult's London offices, and it is recommended that operations personnel become familiar with
the register and participate in keeping the document up to date so as to become familiar with the
process of control of major accident hazards to the environment.

Huge spills are associated with product storage on the vessel entering the harbour and not jetty
operations per se. A matrix is produced in the document, which give for spills at the locations
identified for the harbour and jetty, the relevant oil spill response approach, equipment, skimmers
and sorbent media.

Thus the resulting FEED level oil spill contingency plan is seen to be hazard based and
proportionate. This document also details typical training needs, manning requirements, job
descriptions for key positions in the emergency response structure, and emergency response plans.
The regulatory framework is also discussed.

This FEED level oil spill risk assessment and contingency plan raises the following design issues,
which may be in consideration:

     · Windsocks are provided for the new jetty for LPG releases.
     · Leak detection devices are considered for offloading product.
     · Water sprays, including for personnel protection should be considered for confirmed gas
           release.

     · Clearly flanges should be minimized along the jetty and bunding should be kept clear.
     · Oil spill response equipment should be placed in fire proof cabinets on the Jetty, and the
           work boat should be tethered and provided with a purpose built landing with life saving
           equipment.

     · A small laboratory should be provided for sample analysis and monitoring of harbour waters,
           sediments and groundwater.

     · A freezer should be provided for preserving any wildlife or plants impacted by a spill for
           further analysis.

It is recognized that many of these measures cannot be considered without cost benefit analyses,
and thus it is recommended that this document is revised in the next engineering phase so as to
provide the basis for doing this.

This document should be read in conjunction with the companion Fire Risk Assessment and Fire
Training Plan.

1              Introduction


1.1            General
               A new oil Jetty project at Hirgigo Bay - Massawa will be the replacement of an aged existing Jetty
               with a new structure. This includes the construction process of the new Jetty and demolition and
               removal of the old one. The pipelines also have to be replaced on the Jetty and on land up to the
               point outside the tank farm, where they will be connected to the existing old lines. There are future
               plans to increase storage capacity of the tank farm by erecting additional tanks. This however, is
               not part of the Project, which assumes no change and continued use of the existing tanks as shown
               in figures 1-1 to 1-3.

               The old Jetty is petroleum Jetty which serves the Hirgigo Power Plant, the Shell Petroleum depot
               and the Erigas depot. The old petroleum Jetty was constructed by Italians in the 1930's and is in
               very poor condition now which requires urgent replacement. It is of great strategic value asset to
               the State of Eritrea and it must be kept in use during the construction of the replacement facility.
