The changes are as follows:\n            (i) modifying the project development objective (PDO) and\n            its associated outcome/intermediate indicators, by dropping\n            activities pertaining to the rehabilitation and upgrading of\n            Port Assab due to the effects of the 1999-2001 war between\n            Ethiopia and the Recipient during which time no Project\n            activity could be undertaken on the Port; (ii) introducing\n            new Project activities on constructing a new oil jetty and\n            undertaking emergency repairs on the existing aged oil\n            jetty, both at Port Massawa; (iii) reallocating funds among\n            the disbursement categories; and (iv) extending the current\n            closing date of the project from September 30, 2008 to\n            December 31, 2011. The changes will advance the attainment\n            of the Project objectives by increasing the Recipient's\n            Port productivity and capacity needs as well as addressing\n            possible disruption of oil supply to the Recipient and\n            averting the potential environmental hazard posed if the\n            existing oil jetty collapses. In addition, the changes\n            support the Bank's interim strategy note\n            recommendations of focusing on improving the implementation\n            of the existing interventions through restructuring rather\n            than financing new operations which are currently limited to\n            humanitarian and social vulnerability support in the\n            Recipient's rural areas. The changes are a response to\n            the effects of the intermittent war between Ethiopia and the\n            Recipient during 1999-2001 period and continued border\n            tension between the two countries. This situation has\n            necessitated the change in the PDO and project design,\n            including dropping some project activities and introducing\n            new ones, some of which have their preparation,\n            implementation, and completion dates extending beyond the\n            current credit closing date."}, "docdt": "2008-09-16T00:00:00Z"}
