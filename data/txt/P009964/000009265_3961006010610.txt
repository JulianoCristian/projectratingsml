MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON THE PROPOSED CREDIT TO INDIA
FOR THE HARYANA WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on the proposed Development
Credit of SDR 187.3 million (US$258 million equivalent) to India is submitted
for approval. The IDA Credit would be on standard terms, with 35 years
maturity, to help £!nance the Haryana Water Resources Consolidation Project.
2.    Background.  Water is an increasingly scarce resource in India, and its
management in terms of physical, economic and environmental needs is critical
to overall economic development. India's limited water resources are 4istri-
buted unequally, both spatially and temporally. Development of groundwater
and surface water is reaching physical limits in many states, particularly in
the northwest, and is complicated further by the interlinked nature of surface
and groundwater and by riparian rights of neighboring states and countries.
Irrigation is the largest user of water in India (about 93% of present gross
water use). However, the National Water Policy of India (Ministry of Water
Resources, 1987) gives the first priority to the provision of domestic water
supplies for urban and rural populations and assuring water supplies for
livestock. Competing demands also arise from industry, thermal and hydro-
power, fisheries and navigation. In addition, minimum flows on rivers for
flushing pollutants, dilution of waste water, and other environmental concerns
limit the operation of facilities. In future, competing uses are likely to
limit the water available for agriculture and irrigation, particularly near
major metropolises and in dry regions.
3.    The potential of irrigation has been constrained in India by inadequate
attention to comprehensive planning and system needs, and significant issues
must be addressed to maintain and surpass past contributions to agricultural
growth. Agriculture is a key sector in India's economy, contributing about
35% of GDP and employing 65% of its adult population. About 75% of India's
population lives in rural areas. One-third of the agricultural labor force
are women, and agriculture is the main source of employment for women in rural
areas. An estimated 280 million (33% of total population) live below the
poverty line. While per capita income has increased by about 2% per annum to
an average of about US$300, there has been little improvement in the standard
of living of the poor or in redi,cing under-employment. GOI's long-term
strategy is to stimulate agricultural growth and promote rural development
through improved water and land management, enhanced efficiency of irrigation
and drainage networks, strengthened research services, increased attention to
environmental protection, and improved rural infrastructure. Investment
programs to address these elements and to reestablish growth are of high
priority in the Eighth Five Year Plan (1992-97) of GOI and state governments.
Equitable distribution of the benefits of growth and sustainability of the
resource base is also emphasized. The performance of agriculture, and
irrigation, is intrinsically linked to poverty alleviation in India.
4.    The State of Haryana.  Situated in north-west India, Haryana is one of
the smallest states in the Union. The state has a population of about 12.8
million, and 78% of the population is employed in the rural sector.
Agriculture is the dominant sector of the economy and its share of State
Dome,tic Product (SDP) is about 43.8% (1984/85-1986/87). Along with Punjab,
Haryana led India's Green Revolution, the two states together contributing
almost 70% of the total foodgrain procurement of GOI. Yields of most major



- 2 -
crops are high, and average foodgrain yields are 30-40% higher than the all-
India average. The cropping intensity in Haryana is about 149% (1980-83) and
is limited by water supplies for irrigation.
5.    Haryana is mostly arid or semi-arid, with limited rainfall ranging from
300 mm in the south-west to 1100 mm in the north-east. The available surface
and sub-surface water resources in the state have been almost fully developed,
and in future, the demands on the state's water resources will far exceed any
possible increases in water supply. There are no perennial rivers running
through the state, and two thirds of the area is underlain with brackish water
with rising water tables and inadequate natural drainage, resulting in severe
problems of waterlogging, salinization, and flooding. The public irrigation
and drainage network has not been maintained effectively. Agricultural users
receive large power cost subsidies, resulting in inefficient use of power and
overdrafting of groundwater. Present surface water irrigation intensity
averages about 60%, reflecting the limited availability of water supplies for
the system. Improved management and planning of the state's water resources
is constrained by the existing institutional framework of the Haryana Irriga-
tion Department (HID), which is the main organization responsible for managing
water resources and providing essential services in the sector. Further
specialization and organizational clarity in the institution is essential.
The state is reaching its limits of agricultural expansion and future growth
must derive from improving the management, planning and efficiency of water
resource use, intensifying production on irrigated and rainfed land,
diversifying to higher-value crops, and improving farming systems.
6.    Bank Supported Projents in India.  The Bank/IDA has supported 130
agricultura'l projects in India with financing of US$10.2 billion equivalent
(81% IDA and 19% Bank), the majority of which has been for irrigation.
Projects have also included: agricultural support services (credit, research
and extension); commercial agriculture (seeds, fisheries and agro-industry);
forestry, watershed and resource conservation; livestock development and
drought assistance. Common problems in agricultural projects have been: (a)
delays in project mobilization and procurement; (b) poor quality civil works;
(c) institutional weaknesses; and (d) insufficient local funding.
7.    Bank Supported Projects in Harvana.  Two irrigation projects have been
funded: the Haryana Irrigation Project (Credit 843-IN, 1978-83), and the
Haryana Irrigation II Project (Credit 1319-IN, 1983-92). More recently,
Haryana has been included in the National Water Management Project (NWMP).
Past implementation experience is fairly satisfactory: both projects were
successful in meeting their primary objectives, and major components were
executed to good engineering standards. However, the PCR noted the growing
burden of O&M in relation to an inadequate budget, and highlighted the
following main "issues for the future": (a) the difficulty of inducing change
(technical or organizational) into the department; (b) the impact of competing
water demands on agricultural availability; (c) lack of continuity in key
posts within the department; and (d) the interstate drainage problem, and
measures for its solution. These lessons, together with GOH's proposals to
improve planning and management of water resources in Haryana, are central to
the proposed Haryana Water Resources Consolidation Project (WRCP).
8.    Rationale for Bank Involvement and Country Assistance Strategy.  The
Bank's new strategy for water resources management (Water Resources Manage-
ment, September 1993), proposes an agenda of policies and institutional



reforms that will utilize market forces and strengthen the capacity of
governments to carry out their essential roles in resouirce use and planning.
The need for the adoption of a comprehensive framework for analyzing policies
and management options regarding water scarcity, efficiency of service,
allocction of water and environmental damage is highlighted. The proposed
project represents a significant first step towards this new strategy. The
Bank is one of the few institutions that could provide the necessary conti-
nuity of support required to pursue the state's long-term strategy in water
resource development. The Bank also has a strong interest in supporting
initiatives that would promote similar policies across states for developing
water resources, as this would lead to mcre rational use and allocation of
water in the national context. Consistent with the most recent Country
Assistance Strategy for India (discussed at the Board on December 17, 1992 and
presented in the President's Report on a Sector Adjustment Credit for the
Social Safety Net Sector Adjustment Program dated November 30, 1992, IDA/R94-
160), WRCPs would be the main vehicle for Bank support in water development
and irrigation, which is planned and implemented at the state level, requiring
a state-by-state app.-oach.
9.    Under the WRCP, GOH proposes a shift in emphasis from new investments
towards improved water management, institution building and policy change,
investing in an economically viable, environmentally sustainable, and socially
equitable manner. The India Irrigation Sector Review identified four priority
areas of action to meet these concerns: (i) institutional development to
upgrade management capability through improved functional responsibilities,
institutional accountability, and participation of farmers and the private
sector; (ii) redefined public expenditure priorities -- emphasizing the
performance of existing schemes, enhanced operation and maintenance, and
completion of viable incomplete projects, rational cost recovery policies, and
prioritized allocation of budgetary resources; (ii') multisectoral water
resources policy and planning using river basins as planning units; and (iv)
improved technical performance of water service delivery for water management
(including irrigation), system operations and maintenance, and environmental
management. These priority actions form the basis of the proposed project.
10.   Project Objectives and Design. The primary objectives of the proposed
project would be to: (a) introduce water resource planning (including
contingency planning for droughts) and management which addresses current and
future inter-sectoral needs; (b) enhance agricultural productivity and
diversification, and improve equity; (c) assure sustainability of the
environment; and (e) improve HID's capabilities in all water related
functional areas. Taking into account lessons learnt from past Bank projects
in the state, the proposed project is designed to contribute to these
objectives by helping GOH put in place a comprehensive, sustainable, water
resource development program for the state. The state's capacity to implement
such a program would be based on three closely interlocking and interdependent
elements: an organizational structure designed and staffed to address the
activities to be taken up in the near and longer term, a water resource
development plan which provides the general framework within which future
water development in all sectors must be analyzed, and a program &%d budgeting
process which reflects the schedule and balance of fu`ure investments to fit
the available funds. The state's public expenditures in the water resources
sector would be reoriented towards sustaining past developmental efforts, and
promoting growth enhancing investments for the future. These objectives would
be supported by specific investments and related policy reforms.



31. Project Invyestments. The project would be a sector investment loan,
financing an agreed state-wide program (to be implemented over six years)
covering the following investments under the areas of the Bhakra Canal system
and Western Yamuna Canal system (including Gurgaon canal) of the state: (a)
Rehabilitation (US$80.6 million) involving repairs and rehabilitation of
existing main canals, drainage systems and watercourses, silt clearance and
bank strengthening, replacement and/or repairs to masonry structures and
buildings, rehabilitation of viable Augmentation Tubewells (ATWs) and Direct
Irrigation Tubewells (DITs) managed by the public sector; (b) Modernization
(US$164.4 million) including lining of selected channels, constructing a link
channel (about 24 km) of Augmentation Canal to feed Kheri, Budha Khera, Old
Nardak and Karnal Distributaries, remodelling the existing channels, lining of
unlined water-courses, construction of Hathnikund Barrage te replace the
Tajewala Headworks on the Yamuna riverl, and a Link Channel, and
construction/extension of minors; (c) upgraded operation and Maintenanne W&MI
(US$181.8 million) for canal and drainage systems, embankments, structures,
and pump houses, maintenance of groundwater pumping installations of ATWs and
watercourses, and maintenance of the Haryana Irrigation Research and Training
Institute, Kurukshetra; and (d) Institutional Support (US$32.9 million)
financing technical assistance, training, civil works and equipment for
institutional and administrative reform, data collection, groundwater
regulation, environmental management, planning, design, beneficiary
participation, management information systera and computer capacity upgrade,
research and training.
12.   Policy Reforms.  During project preparation, GOH initiated major policy
reforms to provide the necessary framework to achieve project cbjectives. The
policy reforms, which are included in a Policy Reform Program, would address
sector issues surrounding the institutional and administrative framework,
improved water services through enhanced O&M, water resources management and
planning, beneficiary participation and power sector reform. The reforms
include: (a) reorganization of HID, and selected activities of Command Area
Development Authority and Haryana State Minor Irrigation Tubewells Corporation
into a unified agency with specialist functions; (b) annual programming and
budgeting, with an agreed prioritization for allocation of funds; (c) full
budgeting and funding of O&M expenditures; (d) full recovery of O&M costs from
beneficiaries of services provided by HID; (e) preparation of a State Water
Plan and implementation of its recommendations; (f) improving beneficiary
participation and formation of Water User Associations (WUAs); (g) rigid
groundwater management and a water rights/licensing system for all water
supplies; (h) staff specialization and continuity, and increased delegation of
authority; and (i) raising of agricultural power tariffs in the public
sector. As part of HID's organizational changes, specialist Staff Offices
were established to support the Engineer-in-Chief (EIC), with regulatory and
advisory functions for sectoral management: a Programming and Budgeting
Committee, Chief Engineer Coordination, Environmental Affairs, Water Services
Policy and Support and Quality Assurance. Line Units with operational
responsibilities were established for Administration, Data Collection and
Water Resource Planning, Design and Research, Construction, and regional Water
Services. At negotiations, GOI submitted its detailed Policy Reform Program
under a Letter of Development Policy, and confirmed its committment to
carrying out the Reform Program.
1     Riparian states on the Yamuna are Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh,
Rajasthan and Delhi.



- 5 -
13.   Progect Imnlementation.  The proposed project would be implemented by
HID under its reorganized structure, and managed by the EIC, supported by the
3taff offices. Project guidance responsibility would rest with the Secretary,
Irrigation and Power, who would coordinate with the State Water Resources
Committee, the Water Regulation Unit and the EIC.
14.   The total cost of the project is estimated at US$483.4 million, with a
foreign exchange component of US$22.5 million. The IDA Credit would be for
US$258.0 million, or 55% of total project cost net of taxes and duties. To
expedite project startup, IDA would finance retroactively project expenditures
incurred after March 1, 1994 to the date of Credit signing, up to a limit of
SDR 7.3 million (US$10 million equivalent). The project Completion Date would
be June 30, 2000, and Closing Date would be December 31, 2000.
15.   Monitoring and Evaluation.  HID would be responsible for the internal
reporting requirements of the State and GOI. HID would prepare Annual Action
Plana to assist project planning and implementation, and supervision by IDA.
The action plans would review for each project _omponent and responsible unit
the past year's achievements in terms of physical and expenditure targets, by
quarter, and include a work procram, and revenue and expenditure budget for
the following year. The Annual Action Plan would also provide details of when
and how the policy reforms to be implemented the following year would be
carried out. The Office cf Environmental Affairs would review each Annual
Action Plan from environmental points of view. Data on key project
indicators, would be collected and analyzed regularly to assess progress,
exercise control and identify possible problems. These would include:
implementation of HID reorganization and effectiveness of operation within the
new structure, preparation and updating of SWP and implementation of its
recommendations, agricultural growth and crop diversification, delivery of
water and improved services, cost recovery from users, water savings,
formation of viable WTJAs, water-logging and salinity, project planning, and
programming and budgeting.
16.   Progect Sustainability.  The project is designed to improve the
institutional capabilities of the state's water resources depertment, and to
ensure the financial sustainability of its services. The water resource
planning and management improvements and expanded beneficiary participation in
the management of the water distribution system would lead to long-term
optimal usage of the state's most scarce resource. Full O&M cost recovery for
all water related services would introduce principles and mechanisms for
continued funding of HID's activities and services, during the project period
and beyond. With a restructured and improved irrigation department, Haryana
would be better placed to plan and manage its water resources in response to
the state's short-, medium- and long-term needs.
17.   Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, the following main assurances were
obtained:
Conditions of disbursement: Disbursement for funds for the construction
of Hathnikund Barrage would depend on: (i) the interstate agreement on the
Yamuna river between the riparian states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal
Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi being signed; and (ii) the required land
acquisition was done following procedures acceptable to IDA.



- 6 -
Other Assurances from GOH that: (a) beginning April 1, 1994, and every
April 1 thereafter, HID would fully budget for the works portion (in current
prices) of the following year's O&M expenditure, which is based on the
detailed work program of HID; (b) full recovery of O&M cost from beneficia-
ries, with exception of lift commands, would be phased in as follows: 30% by
April 1, 1995; 50% by April 1, 1996; 60% by April 1, 1997; 80% by April 1,
1998; and 100% by April 1, 1999; (c) it shall:  (i) under TOR agreed with IDA,
carry out not later than January 31, 1995, a baseline survey for various
aspects of water resource use, management and delivery services; (ii) furnish
the findings of such survey to IDA for its review and comments; and (iii) use
such results to monitor project progress; (d) selection of the ATWs and DITs
for rehabilitation would be in accordance with criteria agreed with IDA; (e)
any NGOs contracted under the project would be selected according to criteria
agreed with IDA; (f) by March 31 each year, starting 1995, GOH would provide
to IDA for its review and comments a copy of its approved Annual Action Plan,
including work program and revenue and expenditure budget for the following
year, and thereafter implement such Action Plan; (g) not later than June 30,
1997, GOH would carry out, jointly with GOI and IDA, a detailed mid-term
review of project progress and thereafter implement its recommendations; (h)
GOH would implement a program satisfactory to IDA for acquisition of land
required for the project; and (i) HID shall select water courses for
rehabilitation only after beneficiaries have been organized in WUAs.
18.   Environmental Aspects.  A Category A - Sectoral Environmental Assessment
has been completed for the project (August 1993) which concludes that the WRCP
sub-projects and activities would have no adverse environmental impacts. The
project, through improved water planning, water distribution, drainage and
better capabilities for measuring environmental inputs, would have a benefi-
cial impact on the environment. The Office of Environmental Affairs would
help develop expertise in environmental planning and management, and environ-
mental assessment. The Office would also oversee water quality monitoring,
data collection and processing, and maintain an environmental action plan.
There are no on-going or anticipated future R&R issues related to project
activities. Limited land acquisition would be necessary, usually as a small
proportion of land holding. No instances where an individual's entire holding
would be acquired are anticipated. Field interviews suggest that farmers are
willing to allow land acquisition for construction of channels and minors
alongside their lands, due to the improved agricultural benefits that project
activities would allow. Land acquisition procedures would have the following
elements: (i) all land acquisition under the project would take place under
the Land Acquisition Act of 1894, amended in Haryana in 1984; (ii) the rate
for the different classes of land (irrigated, cultivable, non-cultivable)
would be determined according to the prevalent market rate plus an additional
amount (at present 30%) for compulsory acquisition; (iii) compensation would
be paid prior to possession; (iv) landowners would be compensated for any
other loss such as standing crop, buildings and trees; and (v) land
acquisition shall be completed prior to award of works contracts.
19.   Project Benefits.  The project would generate substantial monetary and
non-monetary benefits in the short- and long runs. The project would achieve
an increase in surface water supplies by reducing seepage losses and
increasing the carrying capacity of major canals. At full development in year
2000, project investments would directly increase foodgrain production by
184,000 tons per year. The project would also improve flood control by
rehabilitating and augmenting maintenance and management of the existing



- 7 -
drainage structures and river control works. The project would increase labor
productivity and incomes of a large number of small and marginal farm families
who previously had no (or limited) access to irrigation. Lining of water
courses would also increase the equity of water distribution within the water
course between farmers at the head- and tail-ends of the field channel.
Project investments would lead to relieving water shortages to agriculture due
to breaches in canals, thereby resulting improvements in yields. Improvements
in water supplies to municipalities and rural areas for drinking water would
also be achieved, with concurrent health and sanitation benefits, particularly
for poor communities. Domestic usage of water is almost entirely governed by
women, and the project would benefit women through increased availability of
water for domestic use. Wastewater discharge is accepted currently into the
canals which is often the source of drinking water, causing health hazards:
under the project, the comprehensive water quality monitoring network would
enhance water quality management. Water deliveries for industrial purposes
would also improve. Modernization of canals and water courses would limit the
rise of the water table, reducing waterlogginq and soil salinization which can
reduce crop production and yields up to 13%. Finally, the project supports
regulation and enforcement to protect and sustain groundwater levels. The
overall Economic-Rate of Return (ERR) of the project is estimated at 18% and
the Net Present Value (NPV) discounted at '2% (to 1993) is Rs. 4062 million.
The project would generate a net financial benefit to GOH in terms of reducing
HID's budget deficit by about Rs. 3600 million over the next six years.
20.   Proiect Risks.  There are three main risks to the project.  The first
risk relates to implementation of the large investment program in a timely
manner. In its past two projects, HID has demonstrated the ability to
implement large, complex projects to high standards. To help maintain the
past high standards, during project implementation an internal project quality
assurance unit, supported by an external consultant, would be established in
HID. The second risk is associated with HID's capabilities to sustain the
proposed higher standards of O&M of the canal and drainage system. Throughout
the preparation process, HID's commitment to focus on O&M has been strong.
HID's reorganization will bring the presently fragmented O&M functions under
one line of management and the existing O&M units will be strengthened at all
levels. Moreover, annual disbursement of project funds will be linked to O&M
expenditures and performance of each previous year. The third risk is related
to GOH's capabilities to implement and sustain the proposed changes in O&M
funding, and cost recovery of water services under the project. This risk
would be minimized by GOH's commitment to emphasize pricing policies and
financial accountability in the water sector. The cost recovery program is
linked to an administrative reform within HID which would be completed prior
to the commencement of the project. A new unit in charge of programming and
budgeting, program tracking, cost accounting and service cost allocation would
be created. Annual disbursements would also be linked to cost recovery.
25.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
