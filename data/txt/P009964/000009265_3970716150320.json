The following potential negative impacts are\n            identified:  1) soil erosion mitigated by the proper design\n            and layout of furrows, hillside terraces, and sprinkler\n            systems; 2) waterlogging, leaching and salinization of soils\n            mitigated by: a) water application regulation; b) an\n            adequate drainage system c) use of lined canals or pipes; d)\n            sprinkler or drip irrigation; e) periodic soil flushing; f)\n            special crop cultivation; and g) nutrient replacement; 3)\n            scouring of canals mitigated by system design; 4) clogging\n            of canals by sediments and weeds mitigated by the design and\n            management of canals, access provisions, and nutrient\n            release reduction; 5) downstream impacts (water quality and\n            quantity deterioration, sea water intrusion, and ground\n            water contamination) mitigated by: a) improved water\n            management, agricultural practices, and input controls; b)\n            imposition of water quality criteria; c) reduction of\n            takeoff; and c) recharge of coastal aquifers through\n            injection wells; 6) wildlife and ecosystem effects\n            (encroachment on sensitive areas, habitat alteration or\n            destruction and impediments to wildlife movement) mitigated\n            by project location, compensatory area establishment,\n            animal rescue and relocation, and movement corridor\n            provision; 7) dislocation of population mitigated by project\n            location and a resettlement scheme; 8) water-related disease\n            prevented by: a) the use of lined canals or pipes; b)\n            avoidance of stagnant water; c) use of straight or slightly\n            curving canals; d) gate installation; e) filling or draining\n            of borrow pits; f) disease prophylaxis and treatment; g)\n            wastewater treatment; and h) enforcement of waste water use\n            standards; and 9) over-pumping of ground water mitigated by\n            withdrawal limitations.  The report concludes that while\n            direct environmental impacts from Haryana Irrigation\n            Department activities are minor and can be dealt with\n            through simple mitigation measures, there is a justifiable\n            scope for regional environmental planning for water\n            resources development using a multisector approach."}, "docdt": "1992-11-23T00:00:00Z"}
