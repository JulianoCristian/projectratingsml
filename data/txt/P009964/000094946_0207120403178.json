sustainability likely, though institutional\n            development impacts are only modest. Through the following\n            lessons, it is suggested that the policy framework - macro\n            and sectoral - conducive to reforms, should be in place\n            prior to implementing a major institutional reform program,\n            including a firm borrower commitment for institutional\n            changes. Additionally, efficient, and effective water user\n            associations - key to sustainable irrigation and\n            agricultural development - need to be set at the early\n            stages, involved in planning, design, and implementation\n            levels. It is also suggested that, while projects should\n            have a firmly time-bound program for institutional reform,\n            in advance of a major investment project in capital works,\n            the absence of such, could ideally, prod an initial project,\n            or project phase, supporting institutional reform, and\n            development, to be followed by a second project, or project\n            phase in which the reformed institutions implement an\n            investment works project. Finally, advance action, and\n            readiness on the part of the borrower, or implementing\n            agencies, are required for timely project implementation,\n            and capacity building."}, "docdt": "2002-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
