The lessons learned indicate that although the\n            selection of a Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) as a\n            lending instrument for this project was well-justified and\n            understandable, after completion of the project, it is not\n            clear to what extent this project fulfilled the principles\n            of a LIL. The most beneficial aspect of the pilot approach\n            in education development comes from comparing various models\n            to solve a given problem. This requires that the experiments\n            within the pilot be carefully designed. First-time borrowers\n            always need more and different supervision than experienced\n            partners. This was well-recognized in the project documents\n            and early supervision memoranda. However, despite sufficient\n            time allocated to supervision by the Bank team, this project\n            shows that with more client-oriented and needs-based\n            supervision, some of the delays and other deficits in\n            implementation could have been either avoided or worked out\n            faster. The Monitoring and Evaluation (MOE) saw this project\n            as a potential engine for its own education sector reform\n            strategy. Therefore, one important aspect of this project\n            was to help the MOE, education authorities, principals and\n            teachers to understand educational change."}, "docdt": "2004-09-18T00:00:00Z"}
