general schools in\n            Azerbaijan. There are two main components. The first,\n            supports curriculum reform by providing 1) international and\n            local consultant support on main areas of curriculum\n            development, including syllabus, teaching methods,\n            institutional issues, and assessment (including textbook\n            development) with an overall focus on greater subject\n            integration and on increasing optional courses in the upper\n            grades; 2) training, fellowships, and study tours; 3) civil\n            works, covering the refurbishment of two curriculum\n            development institutions; 4) resource materials, equipment,\n            and supplies; 5) syllabi, textbooks, and supplies; and 6)\n            operating costs. The second component supports capacity\n            building and reorientation of teacher education institutes\n            in pilot regions. It focuses on technical assistance on\n            teacher training and teaching methods, training of trainers,\n            minor rehabilitation, and financing training materials,\n            equipment, materials, and supplies. A select number of pilot\n            schools in pilot districts will be chosen to assess and\n            evaluate new curricula and teaching methods for selected\n            grades. In addition to financing textbooks, this component\n            supports training and outreach activities aimed at\n            strengthening parent and community involvement in school operations."}, "docdt": "1999-05-04T00:00:00Z"}
