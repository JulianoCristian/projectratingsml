marketing\n            facilities, credit for crop production and technical\n            assistance to help project implementation. About 40,000\n            mostly small growers would benefit from the project. The\n            project entails no unusual risks. The development of the\n            managerial capability of the Jammu-Kashmir Horticultural\n            Produce Marketing and Development Corporation (JKHPMC) - a\n            new entity - will be critical for successful project\n            implementation. Appropriate safeguards have been provided in\n            the project to ensure that the management capability of\n            JKHPMC is built up as quickly as possible. It will also be\n            important to formulate proper marketing arrangements for the\n            apple juice concentrate component of the project."}, "docdt": "1978-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
