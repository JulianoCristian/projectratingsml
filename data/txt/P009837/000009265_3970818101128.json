It also aims to improve the average\n            quality of coking coal supplies and thus contribute to\n            greater efficiency in the use of indigenous energy\n            resources.  The project consists of the development of one\n            open-pit mine at Jharia and one underground mine at\n            Pootkie-Bulliary, two coal washeries, and other associated\n            facilities in the Jharia coalfield in the State of Bihar.\n            The project further seeks to support institutional\n            development in the areas of underground mine design and\n            operating practices, shaft sinking and sand transportation,\n            as well as project management. Furthermore, it addresses the\n            sectoral issue of coal quality and facilitates continuation\n            of a dialogue on coal transportation and distribution,\n            producer-consumer linkages, and investment planning."}, "docdt": "1985-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
