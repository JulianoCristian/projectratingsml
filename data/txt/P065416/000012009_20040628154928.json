Project, is to improve the quality\n            of Croatia's Adriatic coastal waters among the\n            participating municipalities, so as to meet the European\n            Union environmental quality standards, in a financially, and\n            operationally sustainable manner. In the area of Biograd na\n            moru, wastewater is currently discharged untreated, or\n            mostly untreated, polluting the sea, endangering human\n            health, and conducive to a reduced biodiverse ecosystem.\n            Construction of a public drainage system, and a wastewater\n            treatment plant in Biograd, will prevent further pollution,\n            and deterioration of sea water quality, allowing treated\n            wastewaters onto a submarine outfall into the Vrgadski\n            channel, diluting wastewaters, to be conveyed to the open\n            sea. Based on geologic and seismology data, and\n            oceanographic studies, this environmental study examines the\n            potential negative impacts from implementation of the\n            project, and proposes the following mitigation measures. The\n            Contractor shall undertake protective measures, and reduce\n            dust emissions, and air pollution, by water spraying\n            construction surfaces, particularly upon material's\n            transport; equipment, and vehicles shall be under\n            supervision as to quantity and quality of exhaust gasses, in\n            compliance with national standards; existing quarries should\n            be utilized, whereas for the outfall excavation, the\n            Contractor shall apply such method of work to reduce water\n            turbidity. Furthermore, a method with minimum negative\n            impacts on biocenosis at sea shall be applied for blasting\n            activities, and, excavated seabed material will be\n            transported to the open sea, in compliance with local\n            regulations, specifically undertaken during the winter\n            months. Vegetation and trees will be avoided as possible, or\n            replanting activities should follow construction, with high\n            corniferous trees, in accordance with the landscape design.\n            To minimize disturbing odors, the following should remain\n            covered: raw water and sludge pumping stations; grates and\n            screens; sludge thickeners, and strainers; and, areas where\n            waste from grates, and strained sludge are being stored. To\n            prevent wastewater contamination, ducts, holes and tanks\n            should contain watertight joints, taking into account the\n            negative impacts of earthquakes. Treated sludge from water\n            surpluses, shall be collected in separate tanks, and\n            transported to selected sites, in compliance with waste\n            management regulations, unless otherwise utilized for\n            agricultural practices. Noise abatement practices should\n            include the regular monitoring of equipment."}, "docdt": "2003-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
