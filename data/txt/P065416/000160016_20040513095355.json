coastal waters to meet European Union ambient\n            quality standards in the participating municipalities, in a\n            financially and operationally sustainable manner. The\n            project has three main components. The first, Coastal\n            Environmental Infrastructure Component, finances investments\n            in the construction  and expansion of sewerage networks,\n            main collectors, pumping stations, wastewater treatment\n            plants, and submarine outfalls. The second component,\n            Institutional Strengthening and Program Management\n            Component, finances equipment, technical assistance,\n            training and studies to: devise and implement an\n            institutional framework for water pollution control;\n            complete engineering designs and environmental and social\n            assessments for investments; ensure the capacity of the\n            Special Purpose Subsidiary Company (SPSC) for Project\n            implementation, evaluation and monitoring, including\n            financial management; and strengthen and bring utilities to\n            reasonable levels of management, operational efficiency,\n            financial viability; and potentially facilitate private\n            sector participation.
