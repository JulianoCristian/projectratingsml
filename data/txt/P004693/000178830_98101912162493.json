would involve: (a)\n            strenghthening and extending the delivery of family planning\n            services and supplies to rural areas; (b) increasing the\n            supply of nurses, auxiliary midwives, and practical\n            nurse/midwives, all of whom are key personnel in providing\n            family planning services; and (c) strenghthening family\n            planning evaluation and research as well as information,\n            education and communication activities. While supporting the\n            nationwide expansion of the Government's ongoing family\n            planning program, the project also concentrates on\n            strenghthening the rural health delivery system in 20\n            relatively disadvantaged provinces, thereby bringing the\n            level of service up to national standards. Specifically, the\n            project includes the construction or expansion of nine\n            training institutions for paramedical personnel and of about\n            550 rural health facilities; the provision of vehicles,\n            equipment, contraceptives and IEC supplies; and the\n            provision of technical assistance and professional services\n            to assist in project implementation. Provision is also made\n            for financing unforseen innovative activities which may be\n            identified during project implementation."}, "docdt": "1978-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
