lessons learned are: 1) In uncertain environments,\n            project design should be based on the economic/institutional\n            work and not over specify project activities. 2) Reform can\n            go awry without properly done studies. 3) All sub-Project\n            Implementing Units need adequate training for in the\n            administrative aspects of implementation. 4) It is important\n            for all implementing agencies to be commited to concerted\n            and prompt implementation. 5) Flexible, stand alone TAs can\n            be a crucial resource in transition economies. 6) The\n            disadvantage of a tight timetable is the increased\n            likelihood of the need for extensions of project closing\n            date in order to accomplish project objectives. This\n            disadvantage is acceptable if the tight timetable helps\n            focus the country on the needed reforms and other\n            commitments at a time when there is economy adversity. 7)\n            Implementation flexibility is important to maximize\n            effectiveness of loan proceeds. 8) Firm stance on extensions\n            often heightens compliance with subsequent agreements. 9)\n            Umbrella TA projects are expensive to supervise because of\n            their many components and activities."}, "docdt": "2000-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
