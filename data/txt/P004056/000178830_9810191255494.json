about 40 ha of\n            mushroom houses would be modernized; (b) modernization of\n            canneries: four canneries presently processing other\n            vegetables would be equipped to process asparagus also;\n            twenty-two canneries processing only mushrooms and twenty\n            integrated canneries processing peaches, mushrooms,\n            chestnuts, etc. would be modernized;

up to seven\n            drying facilities for shiitake would be constructed; and (d)\n            technical assistance: three Korean specialists in asparagus\n            and strawberry production and two in canning operations\n            would be trained abroad; the services of two short-term\n            consultants in strawberry and asparagus cultivation\n            respectively would be financed; an international management\n            consulting firm would review and improve AFDC's\n            accounting and financial systems;
