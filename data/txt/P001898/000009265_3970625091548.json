  efficient export-oriented industries, while gradually\n            phasing out the incentives offered to inefficient import\n            substitution enterprises. Specific measures have already\n            been taken to reduce protection and increase efficiency in\n            import substitution manufacturing. Measures to be\n            implemented under the program include: a) reduction of\n            maximum tariffs on imports from preferential sources, from\n            600 percent to 127 percent before effectiveness, and to 107\n            percent before release of the second tranche. The measures\n            further include b) adoption of a program for the\n            simplification of the tariff schedule; c) discontinuation of\n            the incentive scheme for import substituting enterprises; d)\n            improvements in the design and functioning of the drawback\n            system for exporters; and e) reduction in the number of\n            items under price controls. The foreign exchange provided by\n            the loan would be used to finance the CIF cost of a wide\n            range of imports."}, "docdt": "1987-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
