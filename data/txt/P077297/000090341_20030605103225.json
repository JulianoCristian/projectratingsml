"The objective of the Second Community\n            Works Project (CWP Il) for Albania is to alleviate local\n            bottlenecks hindering development (including infrastructure\n            and services) through processes of participatory local\n            development as a result of (a) improving access to quality\n            social and economic infrastructure and social services\n            through sustainable micro-projects, and (b) promoting\n            institutional development at the local level. There are\n            three components to the project. 1) This component will\n            finance an estimated 200 sub-projects aimed at improving\n            local communities' infrastructure. Sub-projects will\n            cover both rural areas (about 120) and suburban areas (about\n            80). Eligible sub-projects, which will be based on the\n            priorities of communities, will include rural and suburban\n            roads, water supply, sewerage, lighting, pedestrian and\n            rural bridges, market-places, buildings (e.g., health\n            centers, schools, day care facilities, cultural centers),\n            and parks. 2)  This component will finance training and\n            technical assistance to strengthen the capacity of local\n            government, communities, and Albanian Development Fund (ADF)\n            staff. It will include three programs: capacity building for\n            ADF staff; local government and community capacity building,\n            and a participation pilot program. The pilot program will\n            introduce methods of participatory planning and\n            participatory monitoring and evaluation. It is expected that\n            this program would subsequently be rolled out to other parts\n            of the country. 3) This component will support the\n            implementation of the Community Works Project (CWP) by ADF\n            by financing a portion of ADF's operating costs\n            (maintenance and operation of equipment procured or used\n            under the project; salaries paid to ADF staff, other than\n            civil servants' salaries, hired for purposes of the\n            project; and consumable office supplies, communications,\n            fuel, travel and per diem allowances)."}, "docdt": "2003-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
