Some lessons learned included: 1) in\n            projects involving the introduction of community\n            participation in investment planning and development\n            decision making, ensure that the level of participation is\n            appropriate to the local context. In the case of Albania,\n            where all planning and development decision making had been\n            controlled by a socialist national government until 1990s,\n            it was important to take a gradual approach in devolving\n            responsibility for investment planning and implementation.\n            This allowed the project to move in the direction of giving\n            greater responsibility to communities and local governments,\n            build ownership for the investments, and thus encourage\n            communities to support operations and maintenance (O&M)\n            and to sustain a culture of civic engagement; 2) community\n            works projects need to emphasize technical quality and\n            operations and maintenance to ensure sustainability of\n            sub-projects. CWP II addressed the need for improved\n            technical quality through requirements for design,\n            procurement, supervision of works, and O&M. The project\n            also provided technical assistance to the implementing\n            agency to ensure adequate attention to technical quality in\n            supervising the works. Measures also were taken to prepare\n            clear Terms of References (TORs) for designers and\n            supervisors, improve technical specifications and design\n            standards, improve documentation, and provide better\n            training; and 3) managing community works projects requires\n            a well-designed M&E system. The experience of CWP II\n            highlights the need to assign attention to developing robust\n            M&E indictors that are outcome oriented. The project\n            also demonstrates the need for better baseline data that can\n            be compared against ex-post data. The use of Living\n            Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) data should only be\n            considered if there is a specific module for project\n            evaluation and a proper sampling procedure to ensure\n            adequate coverage."}, "docdt": "2009-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
