Design of works to minimize land affected,\n            and design slopes and retaining structures to minimize risk.\n            Provide appropriate drainage and soil stabilization. Store\n            hazardous materials and wastes, and provide suitable\n            wastewater drainage and safe waste disposal. Careful siting,\n            alignment, and design to minimize impacts for any\n            sensitive/rare species. Dust control by water or otherwise\n            ventilation of internal areas both during, and post\n            construction.
