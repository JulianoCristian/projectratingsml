Ratings for\n            the Second Community Works Project for Albania were as\n            follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: a\n            demand-driven approach may not guarantee that the highest\n            community priorities are met unless steps are taken to\n            ensure a robust and inclusive participatory process and to\n            prevent demand distortion that can result from, for example,\n            requests for goods and services that are perceived to be\n            easiest to obtain (e.g., roads in this case) rather than\n            those that may be most wanted. Capacity building cannot be\n            treated as a by-product; explicit mechanisms will generally\n            be needed to build appropriate and lasting capacity. In\n            projects with multiple objectives requiring different staff\n            skills-mixes for their implementation, up-front clarity\n            about the relative emphasis to be placed on the various\n            objectives is critical, especially in capacity-constrained\n            contexts. Trade-offs among objectives need to be watched\n            closely, and addressed. Building capacity in local\n            governments and communities is time- and human\n            resource-intensive, making disbursements potentially slower\n            and less predictable than when infrastructure delivery is\n            the primary focus. The performance incentives, staffing, and\n            skills-mix of the project implementation unit will need to\n            match the project's primary focus. In the case of\n            Albania, Albanian Development Fund (ADF) maintained an\n            engineering orientation in its staffing and processes,\n            building infrastructure much more successfully than building\n            capacity. In projects with multiple objectives, each of\n            which requires a different staff skill mix for its\n            implementation, up-front clarity about the relative emphasis\n            to be placed on the various objectives is critical. The\n            roles and responsibilities of the various institutions that\n            the project will relate to need to be clarified in project\n            design it, and project design also needs to envision and\n            factor in the longer-term role of any autonomous project\n            implementation unit."}, "docdt": "2012-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
