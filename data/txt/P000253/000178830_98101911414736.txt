WEST VOLTA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Amendment to Project Financing
1.        The Appraisal Report No. 1380c-UV does not take into account
the recent decision of the Canadian Government to provide CAN$3.0 million
to finance the project.  This amount will be provided on the same terms
and conditions as the IDA credit including the procurement procedures and
will be disbursed pari passu with the IDA credit, which will be reduced
from US$6.5 million to US$3.6 million, 1/ accordingly.
2.        The corresponding adjustment to the financing plan is shown below.
It replaces the financing plan in paragraph 5.03 of the Appraisal Report:
Total Costs                   Net of Taxes
US$ Million   % of Total      US$ Million   % of Total
IDA                 3.6           19             3.6            21
Canada              2.9           16              2.9            17
ADF                 5.5           29              5.5            32
Swiss Aid           3.6           19             3.6            21
Government          3.3           17              1.6            9
18.9         100             17.2           100
The percentages of expenditures financed by the IDA credit will be reduced
from 38% of project cost net of taxes to 21%. The US$3.6 million will now
cover 18% of foreign exchange costs estimated at US$1.6 million and 20%
of local costs US$2.0 million.
3.        IDA and Canadian funds will be disbursed together pro rata in
the proportion of the respective amounts of the credits. A revised Annex
10, Tables 1 and 2, is attached.
4.        Fulfillment of all conditions precedent to initial disbursement by
the Canadian Government of its loan for the project would be a condition of
credit effectiveness.
1/ Exchange Rate used was taken at the prevailing rate on April 1, 1977:
US$1.00 equals CAN$1.0523.

UPPER VOLTA
WEST VOLTA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Summary and Conclusions
Background
i.        The Government of Upper Volta has requested IDA, the African
Development Fund (ADF) and the Swiss Government to help finance an agricul-
tural development project in the western region of the country. Building
on progress made in an on-going cotton development project (West Volta
Cotton Project; Credit 225-UV), the project would follow a more integrated
approach to development of the country's agriculturally most promising region.
ii.       Upper Volta is classified by the United Nations as one of the 29
least developed countries with a GDP per capita of US$95 (1976). Agriculture
and livestock provide a living for 96% of the population and accounts for
30-35% of GDP and 90% of export earnings. Practically all agriculture is
rainfed: only 0.2% of the total cultivated area is irrigated. Farming is
difficult in the central region (Mossi plateau) which harbours 64% of the
population and has erratic rainfall, a prolonged dry season and poor, shallow
soils. By contrast, in western Upper Volta, soil and rainfall conditions are
more favorable and population densities are lower, and it is in this region
that the major development towards the promotion of agriculture should be
directed.
Performance under the West Volta Cotton Project
iii.      The West Volta Cotton project which became operational in 1972
was designed with the limited objective of promoting cotton production and
after having provided initial advice on use of inputs and timing of field
operations for cotton, the project's extension service has mainly served as an
input supply and seedcotton collection service. This approach has enabled the
project to attain its cotton production targets - production in 1976 exceeded
appraisal estimates by 17% - but it has also impeded extension workers from
giving advice on other crops, or coping with the problems arising from the
large stream of migrants from the Mossi plateau into the project area. To
meet these changing conditions, the extension service will have to carry out
new tasks for which extension services will have to be reorganized and re-
trained.
Project Area
iv.       The project area would be the same as that of the West Volta Cotton
project, covering the two Regional Development Organizations (ORDs) of
Bobo-Dioulasso and Dedougou, or slightly over 20% of the country's total
area. Of the 88,000 farm families living in the two ORDs combined, some
25,500 cultivate cotton and are covered by extension services under the first
project.

Project Description
'v.       The project aims at improving the living conditions of farm
families by promoting more productive farming systems and better cultivation
techniques for the areas' main dryland crops, cereals and cotton, and by
actions to improve the situation of women; it would also help to develop
the irrigation potential through small scale, simple water control schemes.
vi.       The project would be carried out over a five-year period (1977-1981)
and its main components would be:
(a) strengthening the Permanent Secretariat of the Co-
ordinating Committee for Rural Development (CCDR)
with a technical assistant and support staff for the
coordination and planning of agricultural projects,
and through the creation of a Financial and Admini-
strative Unit (FAU) to establish and maintain an
accounting system, and to monitor the project's
progress;
(b) providing the ORDs of Bobo-Dioulasso and Dedougou
with the staff, equipment and transportation
necessary to implement an agricultural development
program;
(c) providing incremental seasonal inputs such as fertil-
izers, pesticides, insecticides and seeds;
(d) constructing small scale irrigation schemes totalling
1,120 ha;
(e) building a 22,000 ton ginnery together with storage;
(f) building some 75 small village grain stores;
(g) creating a training center for project staff and
farmers which would also serve the livestock project
at Samorogoan (Credit 557-UV);
(h)  carrying out studies and surveys, followed by pilot
projects, to help new settlers; and
(i) carrying out a pilot scheme to improve the situation
of women in about 40 villages.
Cost Estimates and Financial Arrangements
vii.      Project costs are estimated at US$17.2 million net of taxes with
a foreign exchange component of US$8.9 million or 51% of project costs net
of taxes. Contingencies including expected price increases amount to 30% of
base cost estimates which are at end 1976 prices.



- iii -
viii.     The proposed IDA credit would be for US$6.5 million and would
finance 38% of total project costs net of taxes. It would cover 30% of for-
eign exchange costs and 38% of local costs. Remaining project costs would
be financed as follows: African Development Fund (ADF), US$5.5 million (32%);
Swiss Aid, US$3.6 million (21%) and Government US$1.6 million (9%) equivalent
to the amount of incremental production inputs for cotton growing. The IDA
credit would be on standard terms. All co-financing would be on a parallel
basis: ADF would contribute to strengthening ORD headquarters, extension
services, and the training program and constructing the ginnery, and Swiss
Aid would finance motorcycles for ORD Bobo-Dioulasso extension agents, pro-
duction inputs for 1120 ha irrigated area, village grain storage, women's
activities, irrigation schemes, and studies and surveys for spontaneous
settlement. Retroactive financing of up to US$400,000 is proposed to bridge
the financing gap between the West Volta Cotton project, funds for which were
fully committed in December 1976, and the proposed project, expected to start
in April 1977. In light of the country's difficult financial position and
Government's commitments for quarterly advances for ongoing IDA-financed
projects, it was agreed during negotiations that immediately after credit
effectiveness IDA would deposit in a special account set up by the Government,
an initial amount not exceeding US$400,000 which would serve as a revolving
fund to finance project expenditures.
Procurement and Disbursement
ix.       Items financed under the IDA credit would be procured as follows:
all contracts over US$50,000 for the procurement of vehicles (US$0.3 million)
would be through international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA
guidelines. Contracts for the construction of houses and offices (US$0.2
million) would be too small to attract international contractors and would be
awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally in accordance
with local procedures acceptable to IDA. Services of consultants would be
obtained in accordance with IDA guidelines. Goods financed by other donors
would be procured in accordance with their procedures but it is not expected
that this would result in higher costs than if all procurement were made under
IDA procedures.
x.        The IDA credit would be disbursed to cover:
(a) 100% of foreign or 90% of local expenditures for
salaries and wages of foreign and local personnel -
US$4.05 million;
(b) 100% of foreign or 90% of local expenditures for
passenger cars and office equipment - US$0.24 million;
(c) 70% of total expenditures for operation and main-
tenance - US$0.54 million;
(d) 70% of total expenditures for civil works (construc-
tion of buildings) - US$0.16 million; and
(e) US$1.51 million would be unallocated.



-iv -
Organization and Management
xi.       Overall responsibility for the project would rest with the Ministry
of Rural Development (MRD).  In the field, five agencies would be responsible
for project implementation: (a) the two ORDs would provide inputs and exten-
sion services for both rainfed and irrigated crops; (b) the Off4ce of irriga-
tion and Dams (ONBI) would carry out all irrigation construction works;
(c) the Rural Roads Agency (SERS) would carry out the road construction pro-
gram financed under the feeder roads project (Credit 579-UV); (d) the women s
activities would be promoted by two regional centers that would report to the
"Equal Access to Education for Women" (EAEW) proJects' main office il the
capital.  To achieve the necessary coordination at field level, local repre-
sentative of the five agencies would regularly meet under the chairmanship of
the ORD directors.
xii.      Each ORD would be strengthened by the appointment of a technical
advisor to assist the director in defining and supervising the work program.
ORD extension services would be reorganized: an ORD extension section would be
established and reinforced with extension specialists; and extension agents
would be gradually withdrawn from their supply and marketing tasks - for which
new staff would be engaged - and would concentrate on extension work proper.
Extension agents would also concentrate more on selected farmers instead of
attempting to cover all farmers, and would emphasize only one extension theme
at any one time. ORD field staff would also be retrained, for which a train-
ing center would be built and training staff engaged. Finally, a Financial
and Administrative Unit (FAU) would be set up to serve the two ORDs by improv-
ing the accounts and monitoring project progress.
Benefits and Justification
xiii.     The impact of the main productive component of the project would
be the additional production of cereals, such as sorghum, millet and rice,
and of seedcotton. Incremental annual production at full development in
1985 is estimated at 41,000 and 26,000 tons respectively. A total of about
46,500 farm families would directly benefit from increased crop production,
while improved roads and women's activities would indirectly benefit some
30% of all project area farmers. No difficulties in marketing project produce
are foreseen. The increase in net disposable income would be highest for
the new settlers from the Mossi plateau, and farmers in the North producing
cereals only; these farmers account for 45% of the project's direct benefici-
aries and are presently among the poorest of the country.
xiv.      Government would also draw important revenue from increased cotton
production, as export prices for cotton lint are well above farmgate prices
and cost to export markets. Although Government also subsidizes inputs at
about 50% of real cost, such subsidies would amount to less than 20% of gross
revenue from the sale of cotton lint. As a result, the Government cash flow
is positive from the start, leading to an annual inflow of CFAF 660 million
(US$2.7 million) at full development.



xv.       The economic rate of return of the project has been calculated
at 30.0% over 15 years. The high rate of return obtained is due to (a) the
fact that the investment represented by the project is small relative to the
value of infrastructure and equipment already available in the project area;
and (b) the early increases in production and benefits resulting from intro-
ducing a highly productive technology for annual crops. Sensitivity tests
show that the rate of return would still be over 10% with a 25% reduction in
benefits, a 33% increase in costs or a combination of both a reduction in
benefits and an increase in costs of between 10 and 15%.
Recommendations
xvi.      The project would be suitable for an IDA credit of US$6.5 million.

UPPER VOLTA
WEST VOLTA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Upper Volta has asked IDA to help finance an
agricultural development project in the western part of the country that
would raise farm incomes through the improvement of cotton and food crop
cultivation. Although the project would cover the same area as the West
Volta Cotton Project for which IDA provided a credit of US$6.2 million
in 1970, it would extend to new crops and other agricultural activities, and
would encompass a larger number of farmers of whom 25% would be migrants from
the Mossi plateau, which is the poorest region of the country.
1.02      The Bank Group has financed six previous agriculture projects in
Upper Volta and three others, one in education and two for rural roads, which
are important to the agricultural sector. Progress of these projects has
been generally good; that of the West Volta Cotton Project is discussed fully
in paragraphs 3.01 - 3.11.
1.03      The project was prepared by consultants Berenschot - Moret -
Bosboom. This report is based on the findings of a pre-appraisal mission
composed of Messrs. Burer, Ali, Reeb (IDA) and Ayalon (Consultant) together
with Messrs. Fudzie and Masumbuko of the African Development Fund in May
1976; Messrs. Burer and Reeb revisited Upper Volta to appraise the project
in October 1976.



-2-
II.  BACKGROUND
A.  General
2.01      Upper Volta has an area of 274,000 km  and a population of nearly
6 million (1975 census), which is estimated to have grown at about 2.2% per
annum over the last decade.  With an average GDP per capita of US$95 (1975),
Upper Volta is classified by the United Nations as one of the 29 "least
developed countries". It has a traditional and overwhelmingly rural economy:
96% of the labor force is composed of self-employed farmers and pastoralists
and their families. Farming is difficult because of erratic rainfall, a pro-
longed dry season and poor shallow soils in the central area (Mossi plateau)
which harbours 64% of the country's population, and because of farming systems
that have generally not evolved beyond shifting cultivation with little use
of cash inputs. Hence, productivity is very low and while agriculture and
livestock provide a living for 96% of the population, they generate less than
35% of GDP (1976).
2.02      Crop farming provides a living for almost 90% of the population,
and accounted for 24% of GDP and 56% of total export earnings in 1976. By
contrast, livestock employs only 6% of the population but produces a rela-
tively high share of GDP (7 - 10%) and provides about a quarter of export
earnings. In normal rainfall years, the country is almost self-sufficient
in the production of its basic foodgrains (sorghum and millet), and only
imports an average of 30,000 tons a year of wheat and wheat flour which are
not grown in Upper Volta. At the height of the Sahelian drought, however,
production was reduced by about 20% and as much as 100,000 tons of grains
were imported in one year.
2.03      Up to 1975, Government had accumulated substantial external reserves
and a high level of deposits with the internal banking system. This reflected
the austerity policy which was introduced in 1968 to correct budget deficits.
It entailed strict expenditure control from which public services concerned
with economic development suffered most: the operating budget for agriculture
and livestock services combined amounted to only 5% of total current expendi-
tures in 1973, while the budgets of the eleven ORDs stagnated over the 1969-73
period and decreased in real terms. Government recognized the need for a
stronger support of rural development when it agreed, under Credit 496-UV, to
set up a development fund for the ORDs to be funded by proceeds from cotton
exports. Since 1975 Government reserves have been drawn upon heavily, however,
mainly as a result of the border conflict with Mali in 1975; the purchase of
majority participations in formerly foreign owned companies in Upper Volta;
and by wage increases in the public sector, varying between 20% and 50% in
1976.



- 3 -
B. Agricultural Sector
2.04      About 8% of the land, or approximately 2.2 million ha, are culti-
vated each year; the basic food crops, sorghum, millet and maize, account
for some 85% of the cultivated area and on average 80% of total production
value, but little is marketed. Rainfed cotton, groundnuts, sesame and
irrigated rice, sugar and vegetables make up most of the remaining cultivated
area and are marketed in greater quantities for local consumption or export.
2.05      Upper Volta is a relatively flat country, and the traditional
system of shifting cultivation is used everywhere. However, there is a
striking regional contrast between the Mossi plateau, where crop farming
is at subsistance level because of high population, poor soils and unre-
liable rainfall, (Maps IBRD 12312 and 12365) and the western and south-western
regions where soil and rainfall conditions are more favorable, population
densities are lower and production is more market oriented. The Sahelian
drought further exacerbated the existing regional disparities, as it virtually
eliminated cotton production and reduced grain production by as much as 35% in
the central region, while it affected production of these two crops very
little in Western Upper Volta. Moreover, although the area now under irriga-
tion in Upper Volta is only 5,400 ha or 0.2% of the total cultivated area,
more than 70% of it (and most of the irrigation potential) is in the western
region. The disparities have increased considerably the movement of people
from the Mossi plateau to the western region, which was already underway in
the 1960's (para. 4.04).
2.06      Cotton was introduced in Upper Volta in the early 1950's.  Seed-
cotton production remained insignificant at about 7,500 tons a year until
1966, then increased rapidly to some 36,000 tons in 1969/70. Although
production stagnated at about 30,000 tons annually during the 1971-75 period
due to drought, it then increased to about 43,000 tons in 1976. It is the
country's most important cash crop, and is a major export. Almost 90% of
the country's total seedcotton production is now concentrated in Western
Upper Volta in the ORDs of Bobo-Dioulasso tl'ORD des Hauts-Bassins) and of
Dedougou (l'ORD de la Boucle de la Volta Noire), the area of the first project.
2.07      Marketing of cotton is fully regulated by Government and producer
prices are announced annually. About 90 - 95% of lint production is exported
(Annex 1) while the remainder is sold to the domestic textile industry;
all the marketable cotton seed is absorbed by a local oil mill producing
mainly for the internal market. Export prices and costs from farmgate to
export for cotton lint are established at the beginning of each season; any
difference between actual and estimated prices and costs accrues to (or is
absorbed by) the Stabilization Fund, a Government agency. The Stabilization
Fund has accumulated large surpluses over the past four years and has been a
major source of government budget revenue.



-4-
2.08      Marketing of other agricultural produce is mainly in the hands of
private traders. The cereals market is characterised by large inter-annual
and seasonal price variations, caused by fluctuating supplies. To improve
cereal marketing and stabilize domestic prices, a National Grain Agency
(OFNACER) was created in 1971, but has mainly been involved with distributing
relief foodgrains. In 1974/75, Government set up an official grain marketing
system but its impact on grain prices has so far been small.
C. Principal Agricultural Institutions
2.09      The country is divided into 11 Regional Development Organizations
(ORDs), each of which is responsible for rural development in its region;
they cover the entire territory except for the valleys of the Volta (para.
2.10). ORDs are public agencies which are supervised by the Ministry of
Rural Development (MRD) but administered by boards of directors representing
local administration and population, with a large degree of autonomy in
planning and implementing development activities. ORDs are in charge of a
wide range of activities, from extension services to the execution of small
rural works, women's activities, cooperatives and community development, and
economic analysis and planning. However, ORDs rely on centralized public
services for certain technical activities, such as construction of feeder
roads, buildings, wells and irrigation works.
2.10      An autonomous Volta Valleys Authority (AVV) was set up in 1973, to
develop the three Volta River Valleys and their main affluents, covering about
7% of the country. The valley lands have been to a large extent abandoned by
the local population because of riverblindness. Since 1973, a riverblindness
campaign managed by the World Health Organization (WHO) has been under way to
eliminate the disease and thereby open up an estimated 600,000 ha suitable
for agriculture. AVV's major effort is to resettle population in these areas;
to date, it has settled about 630 families.
2.11      Agricultural research is carried  out by specialized French insti-
tutions such as "Institut de Recherches du Coton et des Textiles" (IRCT)
for cotton and "Institut de Recherches Agronomiques Tropicales" (IRAT) for
cereals. By and large, research has produced good technology packages for
cotton, groundnuts, rice, vegetables and maize but to a lesser extent for
the traditional staples: millet and sorghum. Sufficient experience, has,
however, been gained with a limited package for millet and sorghum - con-
sisting of improved seed distribution combined with timely seeding and
weeding - to be promoted under the proposed project.
2.12      Agricultural credit is provided by the National Development Bank
(BND) which, through its Agricultural Credit Division, lends to the ORDs
which on-lend in kind to farmers such seasonal inputs as insecticides and
fertilizers on short term, and agricultural equipment on medium term.  In-
terest rates range from 10% for seasonal credit to between 8% and 12% for



- 5 -
medium term credit. BND's agricultural credit activities mostly concern
seasonal credit for cotton growers; lending for farm equipment has been
negligible. Domestic suppliers have not been able to meet even the existing
cash demand for farm equipment because of a shortage of working capital.
Projects funded by bilateral aid are presently under way to increase the
production capacity of domestic suppliers and to train local blacksmiths in
the maintenance of equipment. Medium term credit for farm equipment would
be made available by BND as and when required. Satisfactory arrangements
as to the terms of such credit and the level of down payments required were
obtained under Cr. 496-UV.
2.13      Compagnie Francaise des Fibres Textiles (CFDT) started the develop-
ment of cotton production in Upper Volta in the early 1960's, and was fully
responsible for production, ginning and marketing of cotton until 1970. Since
then, the organizational arrangements are governed by a "participation agree-
ment" (Association en Participation - AP) between the Government and CFDT.
(Annex 2, Appendix 1). Under this agreement, the two parties pool their assets
in an association under which CFDT is responsible under Governnent control for
cotton ginning, marketing, and the development of cotton production through
the ORD structure. The agreement specifies the allocation of costs and the
distribution of profits (or losses) on cotton marketing between the two
parties. The AP has generally worked well, but Government has recently in-
dicated its desire to take a majority participation in a company still to be
created, which would own all assets now held by CFDT in Upper Volta and which
would be responsible for the purchase and ginning of seed cotton and the sale
of cotton lint. Such an arrangement would be similar to that concluded
between CFDT and other countries (Mali, Ivory Coast) where it is working
satisfactorily, but negotiations on it have not yet been finalized. In
accordance with standing agreements (Credit 496-UV) Government intends to
consult IDA on any such change before it is implemented.
D. Rural Development Strategy
2.14      A recent report on the economic situation in Upper Volta 1/ examines
the long term development perspectives. It indicates that the major effort
should be oriented towards the development of rainfed agriculture as (a) Upper
Volta has large areas of good agricultural potential in terms of soils and
rainfall conditions; (b) research has shown that present systems of shifting
cultivation can be replaced by cultivation methods that would not only increase
current yields but also shorten fallow periods; and (c) a potential for
irrigation exists, estimated at about 130,000 ha, but can be developed only
gradually given the high investment cost, the severe lack of competent per-
sonnel and the absence of farmers' experience with irrigation.
1/ Report No. 564-a UV, dated July 1975.



-6-
2.15      The report also suggests that the development effort should be
mainly directed towards the western and southwestern regions. The Mossi
plateau, with population densities exceeding 40 inhabitants per sq km. in
many districts, is too heavily populated to maintain even moderately pro-
ductive systems of agriculture under presently available techniques.
Efforts over the past 15 years to improve living standards have failed,
and only a reduction in population levels could increase land availability
and improve incomes. The rapidly increasing migration from the Mossi plateau
to western Upper Volta, referred to in para. 4.04 could be supported and
guided through settlement projects, integrated rural development projects
and possibly irrigation schemes.
2.16      In sum, emphasis should be placed on developing the west and south-
west where conditions could support reasonably productive farm systems and
so improve the incomes of migrants from the poorer regions as well as of the
existing people. Government generally concurs with these conclusions, and
the proposed project fully responds to this strategy.

III. REVIEW OF THE WEST VOLTA COTTON PROJECT
A. Targets and Project Content
3.01      The West Volta Cotton Project, the Bank Group's first agricultural
project in Upper Volta, was appraised in February 1970, signed in December
1970, and became effective in June 1971. The project's objectives were
limited exclusively to cotton: the project was to increase both the area
grown under cotton and seedcotton yields, thereby raising farmer incomes,
Government revenue, and the country's foreign exchange earnings. It was
assumed that at the end of the project period, revenues to Government accruing
from cotton growing would be adequate to finance support services needed to
sustain production. Provisions were made for: 1) staffing and equipping the
management and extension services of Bobo-Dioulasso and Dedougou ORDs; 2)
establishing a revolving credit fund with BND to provide cotton growers with
credit; 3) building a new ginnery; 4) establishing a road unit to improve the
feeder-road network; and 5) funding studies on a cotton production project in
Diebougou-Gaoua area and on detailed engineering of two secondary roads.
Total project costs were estimated at US$9.40 million and were to be financed
by IDA: US$6.20 million (66%); French bilateral aid: US$1.76 (19%); Government:
US$1.15 (12%); and farmers: US$0.29 (3%). CFDT would provide key personnel
to project management.
B. Project Performance
3.02      The project did not become operational until early 1972, due to
difficulties in (a) fitting it within the ORDs which at that time were just
becoming operational; (b) filling management positions; and (c) familiarizing
project institutions with IDA's procurement procedures. The inital delay
caused lags in project expenditures throughout the implementation period,
as a result of which the project's closing date was postponed from December
1975 to June 1977, and one additional year of project expenditures was
financed out of the IDA credit.
3.03      It was assumed at appraisal that the project would increase the
area under cotton by about 32,500 ha, and raise seedcotton output by some
33,000 tons between 1970/71 and 1975/76, thus more than doubling existing
production. The first project years were drought years, and up to 1974/75
seedcotton production increased considerably less than expected as farmers
were more concerned with growing cereals to meet their subsistence require-
ments. With increased cereal production and the drop in cereal prices due to
good rainfall years, however, cotton area and yields increased substantially
in 1975/76 and are expected to rise further this year. As a result, the total
area under cotton in 1976/77 will be 32,000 ha more than in 1970/71, about in



ha more than in 1970/71, about in line with original estimates, while
seed-cotton output in 1976/77 is expected to be 38,500 tons higher than
that of 1970/71, thus exceeding original estimates of incremental project
production by 17%.
3.04      Progress was also made in other areas: the feeder road network
has been improved and is well maintained, and the planned studies have
been made. Although recruitment problems caused the project to be under-
staffed until recently, ORD field services have been able to function as
planned.
3.05      The revolving fund, set up for credit to project area cotton growers,
has not worked as was expected. The need for IDA disbursements from the
fund did not arise, as credit funds were provided by the existing Central
Bank discount facility to a consortium of Voltaic Banks, including BND,
which in turn channeled these funds to the AP. As sufficient funds for
short term credit would continue to be available from this source in the
future, the proposed project does not include IDA financing therefor.
3.06      Difficulties have also been experienced in preparing accounts
for the project and having them audited; these were aggravated by the
fact that important records up to 1974 were accidentally destroyed, and
that accountancy staff changed several times. To remedy the situation,
an international firm of auditors was appointed in 1975 to review the
accounting records and procedures: their recommendations will be imple-
mented with the technical assistance to be provided under the proposed
project (para. 6.06).
3.07      The implementation delays, the reduced credit fund requirement
and postponement of the new cotton ginnery due to lagging production growth
in the intermediate project years have resulted in lower project expendi-
tures than originally estimated. However, as one additional project year
(1976) is being financed, costs - and disbursements - about reached the
appraisal estimate of US$6.2 million at project completion.
3.08      Government revenue from cotton production has been substantially
higher than originally estimated; the accounts of the Stabilization Fund
for the 1975/76 crop year, for instance, showed a provisional net surplus
from cotton of CFAF 580 million, compared to the appraisal estimate of a
deficit of CFAF 61 million. This was mainly due to the steep increase in
world market prices for cotton lint, which are now more than three times
higher than originally estimated. With the attainment of the project's
quantitative targets and the considerably higher value of cotton, the
project's internal rate of return should largely meet the 31% estimated at
appraisal. Details on performance under the West Volta Cotton project are
provided in Annex 2.



-9-
C. Project Experience
3.09      The project was designed with the limited objective of promoting
cotton production. Therefore, after having provided initial advice on use
of inputs and timing of field operations, the extension service has func-
tioned mainly as a supply and collection service getting seeds, fertilizer
and insecticides to farmers on time, collecting the cotton harvest, and re-
covering short term credit. This approach has enabled the project to attain
its cotton production targets, but it has also proved to have serious short-
comings. Firstly, by promoting only cotton the project was unable to advise
on other crops such as cereals and groundnuts which in the project area are
all grown in the same season and therefore compete with cotton for the far-
mers' land and labor. This weakness was evidenced in particular during the
drought period. Secondly, the emphasis on supply and collection services
tended to divert the project field service from extension work proper so that
many extension workers now have little advice to offer to established cotton
farmers.
3.10      Extension services would have to deal urgently with the problems
arising from the large stream of migrants from the Mossi plateau into the
project area, and from the increasing scarcity of fertile uncultivated soils.
To meet these changing conditions, the extension service will have to carry
out new tasks: not only will it have to give advice to a large number of new
settlers, but it will also have to concern itself with changing farm systems,
i.e. the change from shifting cultivation to crop rotation practised by
sedentarized farmers, a task with which it has not yet coped.
3.11      The assumption at appraisal that Government could finance support
services needed to sustain cotton production from the end of the project
period onwards was in a strict sense valid but irrelevant. Although Govern-
ment income from cotton exports has been higher than expected (para. 3.08)
and has become the second largest source of budget revenue in the country,
funds generated by cotton growing have become essential to finance development
at large and, in particular, to increase Government intervention in develop-
ment of the poorer parts of the country, where alternative sources for sus-
taining such expenditures do not yet exist. To the extent that Government
faces an overall gap to finance agricultural development, it is only natural
that it continues to seek external financing to support programs in areas of
high potential such as West Volta. Thus, continued IDA financing of a follow-
up to the West Volta Cotton project is highly justified.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project Area
General
4.01      The project area (Map IBRD 12311) would overlap that of the West
Volta Cotton Project, covering the two ORDs of Dedougou and Bobo-Dioulasso or
slightly over 20% of the country's total area. It has an estimated population
of 1.0 million (16% of the country total), 88% of which live in rural areas.
Of the 88,000 farm families living in the two ORDs combined, some 25,000
cultivate cotton assisted under the first project.
Physical Characteristics
4.02      The climate of the project area is Sudanian.  Average annual rainfall
varies from about 800 mm. in the north to 1,200 mm. in the south during a single
wet season lasting about six months (May to October). Soils are generally
suitable for cereals and cotton; most are of the leached lateric type but
intersected by alluvial deposits in and around the flood plains that drain
into the Black Volta river. About 1 million ha (almost 20% of total) have
a clay content of 20 - 25%, and are considered to be the best cotton soils
of Upper Volta. The two ORDs can be divided into four soils and rainfall
regions: North, Center North, Center South and South. The North and the South
are essentially cereal areas as they are either too dry or too humid for
Cotton; 95% of all cotton is grown in the Center North and Center South.
Farm Systems and Land Tenure
4.03      The average farm family consists of about 10 persons and cultivates
from 5.0 ha (North) to 5.5 ha (other regions). In the two central regions,
the average cotton area per farm is 1.9 ha, while 3.3 ha of cereals are
cultivated annually and 0.3 ha of other crops (rice, groundnuts, sesame,
vegetables).   In the North and South, 4.3 ha are under cereals and 0.7 ha
mainly in groundnuts. Traditional technology prevails: crops are grown con-
tinuously on one plot until fertility declines, after which the plot is
abandoned and new land is cleared for cultivation. Most cropping is done with
hand tools; draft animals are used on less than 1% of the farms.  Improved
cultivation techniques and cash inputs are used only on cotton, and this is
evidenced on yield: while seedcotton yields are satisfactory (880 kg/ha),
cereal yields are low (500 - 700 kg/ha for millet, 650 - 850 kg/ha for sorghum).
Cultivation is basically done by the family including women. A more detailed
description of agriculture in the project area is given in Annex 3.
4.04      Land is owned by the village community and given to individuals
in usufruct. Thus far, new settlers coming from the Mossi plateau have
usually also obtained these rights from the local village leaders. The



- il -
system works well where good uncultivated land is abundant but with the
accelerated pace of spontaneous migration since the 1971-73 drought (some
100,000 people between 1960 and 1972; between 15,000 and 20,000 people in
1975 alone), most cultivable lands of easy access are now being occupied.
In addition, increased migration is also highlighting differences in tra-
ditions and cultural practices; in particular, the existing population
criticize the slash and burn methods of the Mossi which they consider to
lead to erosion and loss of fertility. Most spontaneous settlement has been
taking place in areas outside the immediate vicinity of the Black Volta river
or its affluents, which is the jurisdiction of AVV. However, AVV intends to
start activities within the area of the two ORDs, and is preparing a five-
year investment program with the help of consultants to be submitted to the
Bank and other agencies in early 1978.
Institutions
4.05      The ORDs of Bobo-Dioulasso and Dedougou are the principal agencies
promoting agriculture and livestock in the project area. Each has a project
director with advisory staff at headquarters, to which the field sector chiefs
are responsible. Each sector chief has sub-sector chiefs, who direct a num-
ber of extension agents. Field coverage is geographical and not functional;
the average extension agent is reponsible for three to eight villages of
80 - 100 families for which he performs a variety of duties. A total of
232 field staff (131 for ORD Dedougou and 101 for ORD Bobo-Dioulasso) are
presently employed.
4.06      A number of other institutions exist in the project area supporting
rural development. Cereals and cotton research is covered by the IRAT and
IRCT station located at Farako-Ba. Training of extension agents is done at
Matourkou training school and the "Centre d'Etudes Economiques et Sociales
d'Afrique Occidentale" (CESAO) near Bobo-Dioulasso. A branch office of
the recently created irrigation department: ONBI, is established at Bobo-
Dioulasso, and a small local factory making animal drawn implements of good
quality (ARCOMA) is also located there.
Communications
4.07      The Ouagadougou - Abidjan railway, providing the main transport
linkage between Upper Volta and the coast, intersects the project area.
Primary roads are well maintained but mostly non-paved. Under a recent
IDA credit (Cr. 653-UV) the major existing road link in southwest Upper
Volta will be paved, thus enabling all-weather transport between the agri-
culturally important areas around Banfora and Hounde, and the city of Bobo-
Dioulasso. The feeder road network in the project area is adequate but
maintenance has not been satisfactory in the past and rehabilitation is
needed (Annex 4). Rehabilitation work was started under the first West
Volta Cotton Project and continues under an IDA-financed Rural Roads Proj-
ect (Cr. 579-UV) covering the entire country. With the rehabilitation work
now under way feeder roads in the project area would be adequate to handle
expected traffic under the proposed project.

B. Project Objectives and Description
Objectives
4.08      The main objective of the project is to improve the living condi-
tions of farm families in the project area by promoting more productive farm-
ing systems and better cultivation techniques for the area's main dryland
crops, cereals and cotton, and by actions to improve the situation of women;
it would also help to develop the irrigation potential through small scale,
simple water control schemes. The dryland farmers and the assistance to be
given to them can be separated into three broad categories:
(a)  25,500 farmers who only received assistance in cotton
growing already covered under the first project and who
would now be assisted in raising cereal production and
reducing fertility decline by treating the farming sys-
tem as a whole; at the same time they would achieve some
marginal increase in cotton production. Of these farmers
only about 3750 would be sufficiently advanced to need
little further assistance, and they would be expected to
serve as an example to other farmers;
(b)  some 11,000 new farmers who have settled recently or
will settle in the project area during the project
period, will be assisted in cereal and cotton produc-
tion: about 35% and 70% respectively of the total in-
cremental cereal and cotton production resulting from
the project is expected to come from these new settlers;
and
(c)  some 10,000 cereal farmers who because of climate are
not able to grow cotton and have not yet been touched
by the extension service will be assisted in improving
their production techniques.
Description
4.09      The project would be carried out over a five-year period (1977-81).
Its main components would be:
(a) strengthening the Permanent Secretariat of the Coor-
dinating Committee for Rural Development (CCDR) with
a technical assistant and support staff for the coor-
dination and planning of agricultural projects, and
through the creation of a Financial and Administrative
Unit (FAU) to establish and maintain an accounting
system, and to monitor the project's progress;



- 13 -
(b) providing the ORDs of Bobo-Dioulasso and Dedougou
with the staff, equipment and transportation necessary
to implement an agricultural development program;
(c)  providing incremental seasonal inputs such as fertil-
izers, pesticides, insecticides and seeds;
(d) constructing small scale irrigation schemes totalling
1,120 ha.;
(e) building a 22,000 ton ginnery together with storage;
(f) building some 75 small village grain stores;
(g) creating a training center for project staff and
farmers, which would also serve the livestock project
at Samorogoan (Cr. 557-UV);
(h) carrying out studies and surveys, followed by pilot
projects to help new settlers; and
(i) carrying out a pilot scheme to improve the situation
of women in about 40 villages.
4.10      In order to reach more farmers under the proposed project than
under the previous one and, at the same time, raise the quality of extension
work a fundamental reorganization of the ORDs and a full retraining of the
extension service is essential. The organizational aspects are therefore
key components of the project and are discussed in detail in Chapter VI.
C. Detailed Features
4.11      Development Program for Dryland Agriculture.  The techniques and
cultivation practices promoted by the project would differ according to the
various groups addressed. For established cotton farmers, the project would
(a) promote correct application rates for cotton fertilizer and insecticides
not yet done by about 65% of them; (b) distribute improved cereal seeds free
of charge, and promote better land preparation, higher seeding densities as
well as more timely planting and weeding of cereals; (c) introduce cultiva-
tion of cereals after cotton to benefit from the residual effect of cotton
fertilization; and (d) promote the use of animal drawn implements. New set-
tlers are expected to be receptive to extension advice only after they are
established and have grown cereals for one or two years to secure their
subsistence food requirements. These farmers would then be taught (a) the
full range of improved cotton growing techniques - land preparation, correct
seeding (in line and at proper densities), ridging, thinning, weeding and
application of fertilizer and insecticides - and (b) better cereal growing



- 14 -
techniques as for the established farmers. The latter techniques would also
be promoted among the farmers in the north who for reasons of climate grow
cereals only.
4.12      The following table shows the expected increase in area under
improved cotton and cereals. Yields and production for the different groups
of farmers are discussed in paras. 7.01 - 7.02.

Improved crops   Year       1976     1977      1978      1979     1980      1981

Cotton                 48,500   50,120   53,630   58,380   64,650   69,400
Cereals               125,150  128,070  133,910  142,010  152,700  160,850
4.13      Seasonal Inputs.  (Annex 5)  Additional requirements for inputs by
cotton growers are estimated to amount over the 1977-81 period to some 220
thousand liters of insecticides and about 2,800 tons of fertilizers. These
would be financed through the existing facilities (para 3.05). In addition,
about four tons of cereal foundation seed would be bought annually from the
IRAT research station over a two-year period and multiplied by some 200
selected farmers; after two years, about 1000 tons of seeds, adequate for
the needs of all participating cereal farmers, would have been produced and
distributed.
4.14      Small Irrigation Schemes.  (Annex 6)  About 1,000 ha of bottomland
development, 100 ha of small vegetable projects and 20 ha of irrigation sys-
tems below existing dams would be built. Bottomlands would be between three
and 20 ha in size and their development would involve construction of longitu-
dinal contour bunds with cross bunds, interconnected through pipe culverts,
along the lines of those now carried out on the Mossi plateau. The results
would be cultivation of rice over a larger area and better yields. Depending
on topography and rainfall, however, works could also include drainage excava-
tion and construction of a small intake regulator and irrigation ditches thus
improving water control and increasing paddy yields.  Vegetable production
schemes would be based on a similar sub-project built near Bobo-Dioulasso
under the Rural Development Fund Project (Cr 317-UV). They would either pro-
vide gravity irrigation from perennial streams during the dry season, or small
pumps to use the groundwater in bottomlands during that period. In addition,
two existing dams have been identified, below which some 20 ha can be irri-
gated by gravity. All irrigation schemes under the project, would be subject
to the normal review procedures of ONBI.
4.15      Ginnery.  (Annex 7)  Project area cotton is presently ginned in
three factories with a total ginning capacity of 56,500 tons, all located in
the southern part of the project area. As total cotton output is expected
to increase to about 70,000 tons, an additional ginnery will have to be built.
To reduce transport distances, the new factory would be located in the Center-
North region of the project area (Dedougou ORD). This ginnery would be owned
by the Government and operated under the AP agreement (para 2.13).



- 15 -
4.16      Village Stores.  Some 75 stores would be built with a grain storage
capacity of about 25 tons each, and a revolving fund would be established to
purchase the grains to be stored. The stored grains would be resold to far-
mers when needed at the purchase price plus storage charges, enabling them
either to acquire foodgrains during the "soudure" period 1/ at lower prices
than in the private trade or, if their own requirements are covered, to sell
foodgrains at higher prices than would be obtainable immediately after har-
vest. Small store construction and management are based on the experience
with a similar project in Upper Volta.
4.17      Training Center.  Two training centers for extension agents exist
near Bobo-Dioulasso, but serve the entire country and would be inadequate
to cover the needs of the two project ORDs. A new training center would
therefore be built at Bobo-Dioulasso with an out-reach facility in Dedougou,
with a capacity for 60 trainees to be trained and housed at one time. Each
year, about 400 persons are expected to use the facilities for at least a
two-week course and numerous short (1-3 days) refresher courses. The facil-
ities would also be used for activities not directly related to extension,
such as community development and rural education.
4.18      Spontaneous Settlement.  Basic data would be gathered to lay a
basis for a general settlement plan, following which pilot projects would be
carried out aimed at finding efficient and sociologically acceptable settle-
ment approaches. 2 Aerial photographs would be made of an area of approxi-
mately 50,000 km on a semi-detailed scale (1:15,000) for detailed planning.
About 36 man-months of consultant services would be needed to produce the
basic maps (topography, soils, hydrology and population density), to work out
alternative lines of action and to select areas for the pilot schemes. These
schemes would be designed following sociological surveys. Mapping surveys
are already under way, financed by the project preparation facilityl suitable
areas have been identified, and the design of the scheme will be completed in
PY1. Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that IDA would be con-
sulted on the terms of reference for the consultant services.
4.19      Women's activities.  Under the "Equal Access to Education for Women"
(EAEW) project, which has been in operation elsewhere in the country since
1967, two regional centers would be established in the project area - one in
each ORD - that would cover some 40 villages in the project period. The cen-
ters would carry out a program consisting of three components: firstly labor
saving devices would be introduced such as grain-grinding mills and carts for
the transport of crops, wood and water; secondly, basic instruction will be
given in nutrition and sanitation; and thirdly, a functional literacy program
will be offered to village inhabitants through the use of simple audio-visual
techniques. The organizational arrangements for women's activities are sum-
marized in Chapter VI and detailed in Annex 8.
1/   The "soudure" period runs approximately from May through September; it
is the period preceding the new harvest, when grain supplies are scarce.

V. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS
A. Cost Estimates
5.01      Project costs, which are detailed in Annex 9 and summarized below,
are estimated at CFAF 4,633.3 million (US$18.9 million) of which the foreign
exchange component would be CFAF 2,191.6 million (US$8.9 million) or 47%

5.02       Base cost estimates are at end-1976 prices.  Cost figures exclude
all import duties on direct imports. Physical contingencies consist of 10%
on buildings and civil works, and 5% on equipment, vehicles and farm inputs.
Estimated price increases amount to about 27% of base cost estimates plus
physical contingencies compounded at the following annual rates: for build-
ings and civil works, 12% for 1977, 1978 and 1979, and 10% for 1980 and 1981;
for vehicles and equipments, 8% for 1977, 1978 and 1979, and 7% for 1980 and
1981; 7% for all other cost items.
B. Proposed Financing
5.03       The financing plan is detailed in Annex 10, Table 1 and summarized
below:
Total Costs                    Net of Taxes
US$ Million   % of Total        US$ Million   % of Total
IDA                 6.5            34               6.5             38
ADF                 5.5             29              5.5             32
Swiss Aid           3.6             19              3.6             21
Government          3.3             18               1.6             9
18.9           100              17.2            100
5.04       The proposed IDA credit of US$6.5 million would finance 38% of
project costs net of taxes. The credit would cover 30% of foreign exchange
costs estimated at US$2.7 million (CFAF 669 million) and 38% of local costs
US $3. 8 million (CFAF 931 million).
5.05       All co-financing would be on a parallel basis.  The IDA credit would
finance (i) technical assistance to MRD; (ii) the Financial and Administrative
Unit (FAU); (iii) the ORD Dedougou headquarters and extension services except
the purchase of motorcycles; (iv) the ORD Bobo-Dioulasso headquarters staff,
vehicles and equipment and operating expenses; and (v) training program except
the cost for purchase and operation of vehicle and office equipment of the
SERS specalist. The African Development Fund (ADF) credit would be on stan-
dard IDA terms and would be utilized for (i) the strengthening of the exten-
sion services in the ORD of Bobo-Dioulasso; (ii) the purchase of motorcycles
in the ORD of Dedougou; (iii) purchase, operation and maintenance of vehicle
and office equipment of a training specialist in the Rural Road Agency (SERS);
and (iv) for the construction of a ginnery. The Swiss contribution would be
provided as a grant and would finance (i) motorcycles in the ORD of Bobo-
Dioulasso; (ii) fertilizers, insecticides and cereal seeds for 1120 ha irri-
gated area; (iii) the 75 village grain storage facilities; (iv) the irrigation
component; (v) the women' s health/education component; and (vi) studies and
surveys for spontaneous settlement. Government's share is equivalent to the
estimated taxes which are US$1.7 million, plus the incremental costs on



- 19 -
fertilizers and insecticides estimated at US$1.6 million. Fulfillment of all
conditions precedent to initial disbursement by the African Development Fund
of its credit for the project would be a condition of credit effectiveness.
5.06      All project funds would be passed on from Government to the ORDs
as grants. The ORDs would reallocate them to other participating agencies.
5.07      As credit 225-UV for the ongoing cotton project was fully committed
at December 31, 1976, and the proposed credit will not be signed before the
end of March 1977, it is recommended that, in order to cover the financing
gap, retroactive financing up to US$400,000 be made available to cover salar-
ies and operating expenditures incurred between January 1, 1977 and signa-
ture of the credit. In spite of conservative financial policies Government
incurred a budgetary deficit for the first time in seven years in 1975. More-
over, the balance of payments problem over the past two years has been aggrav-
ated by adverse weather conditions in 1976 which will necessitate the import
of an additional 84,000 tons of cereals. In order to alleviate the country's
difficult financial position it was agreed during negotiations that immedi-
ately after credit effectiveness IDA would deposit in a special account to be
set up by the Government in an independent bank in Upper Volta on terms and
conditions satisfactory to IDA, an initial amount not exceeding US$400,000
equivalent, which would serve as a revolving fund to finance project expendi-
tures. This procedure would be similar to that adopted for the Drought Relief
Fund (Credit 442-UV). IDA would replenish the revolving fund upon receipt
of satisfactory evidence that such expenditures were eligible for financing
out of the proceeds of the credit. The opening of that special account by
the Government would be a condition to the effectiveness of the credit.
C. Procurement and Disbursement
5.08      All contracts over US$50,000 for the procurement of vehicles (US$0.3
million) would be through international competitive bidding in accordance
with IDA guidelines; the purchase would be grouped in packages of at least
US$50,000 whenever possible. Contracts for the construction of houses and
offices (US$0.2 million) would be too small and often too dispersed to attract
international contractors and would therefore be awarded on the basis of
competitive bidding, advertised locally in accordance with local procedures
acceptable to IDA, as would be contracts under US$50,000. For contracts under
US$10,000, local shopping would be employed. Domestically manufactured goods
would be allowed a preference of 15%, or the level of applicable import duty,
whichever is lower. The services of consultants would be obtained in accord-
ance with IDA guidelines. Goods financed by other donors will be procured
in accordance with their procedures, but it is not expected that this would
result in higher costs than if all procurement were made under IDA procedures.
5.09      The proceeds of the IDA credit would be disbursed to cover the
following:



- 20 -
(a)  100% of foreign or 90% of local expenditures for
salaries and wages of foreign and local personnel -
US$4.05 million;
(b)  100% of foreign or 90% of local expenditures for
passenger cars and office equipment - US$0.24 million;
(c)  70% of total expenditures for operation and maintenance -
US$0.54 million;
(d)  70% of total expenditures for civil works (construction
of buildings) - US$0.16 million;
US$1.51 million would be unallocated. A schedule of estimated disbursement
is at Annex 10, Table 2. Any funds remaining undisbursed upon completion of
the project would be cancelled. Disbursement against a, b, and d would be
fully documented. Disbursement for c would be against certified statements
of expenditures the documentation of which will not be submitted to IDA, but
retained by the Borrower and held available for inspection by supervision
missions.
D. Accounts and Audits
5.10      Both ORDs would prepare their annual budgets in collaboration with
FAU. As described in para. 6.06 FAU would be established to supervise closely
ORD budget accounts and would be adequately staffed for this purpose. Respon-
sibilities and duties of FAU, are described in Annex 11. Proposed budgets
would be submitted by FAU to the Coordinating Committee for Rural Development
(CCDR) for approval and to IDA for information. On the basis of the approved
budgets, Government would determine its budget allocations and would make
the necessary funds available to MRD quarterly in advance. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations to this effect.
5.11       In addition, each ORD would prepare and send to IDA quarterly
progress reports and summaries of project expenditures and use of funds
in such detail as IDA may request. Also, a detailed annual report will be
prepared, in collaboration with FAU, for submission to IDA. Assurances to
this effect have been obtained.
5.12      FAU would, for both ORDs: (i) keep records adequate to reflect,
in accordance with sound accounting practices, their operations and financial
position; (ii) have their accounts audited by a firm of auditors acceptable
to IDA; (iii) submit certified copies of their audited accounts and the
auditors' report to IDA within three months of the end of each project year;
(iv) ensure that the reports of the auditors are of such scope and detail as
IDA may reasonably request; and (v) furnish such other information concerning
its accounts as IDA may reasonably require. Assurances to this effect have
been obtained during negotiations.

VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. General
6.01      Overall responsibility for the project would rest with MRD.  The
existing CCDR, which includes representatives of all ministries involved in
rural development, would coordinate and oversee, through its Permanent Secre-
tary, project activities at the ministerial level. Assurances have been
obtained during negotiations that in order to assist in planning and super-
vising projects, and coordinating related activities with other ministries and
agencies responsible for the preparation or execution of projects of rural
development, a qualified and experienced technical assistant would be em-
ployed in the planning section of the Permanent Secretariat of the CCDR. An
organization chart of MRD is presented in Annex 11, Table 1. In the field,
five agencies would be responsible for project implementation: (a) the two
ORDs would be responsible for providing inputs and extension services for
both rainfed and irrigated crops; (b) ONBI would carry out the irrigation
works; (c) SERS would carry out the road construction program financed under
the Feeder Roads Project (para. 6.08); and (d) the women's activities would
be promoted by two regional centers still to be established - one in each
ORD - that would report to the EAEW project's main office in the capital.
To achieve the necessary coordination at field level, local representatives
of the five agencies would regularly meet under the chairmanship of the ORD
directors.
B. The Regional Development Organizations (ORDs)
ORD Management
6.02      Since 1975, ORDs' tasks have expanded to include the development
of livestock, forest and water conservation and marketing of crops other
than cotton without any reinforcement in headquarter management staff and
performance has begun to suffer. To alleviate this constraint, assurances
have been obtained during negotiations that a technical advisor would be
employed in each ORD, who would assist the ORD director in defining and
supervising the work program (Annex 11, Appendix 3). The organization
chart in Annex 11, Table 2 shows the new ORD management structure after the
reorganization of the extension services discussed below.
Reorganization of Extension Services
6.03      Building on the experience of the first project (paras. 3.09 -
3.11) and to enable extension agents to perform more effectively, the follow-
ing basic changes in task definition would be made:



- 22 -
(a) extension agents would be gradually withdrawn from
their supply and marketing function (distribution
of inputs, seedcotton marketing and debt recovery)
by geographical area as explained in Annex 12, para.
6, and concentrate on extension work proper. A time-
table would be drawn up by which this would be com-
pleted within three years after project commencement
and assurances were obtained to this effect during
negotiations. Assurances were furthermore obtained
that different staff would be recruited and employed
by ORDs to cover the supply of inputs, marketing of
seedcotton and debt collection; no difficulties are
envisaged in locating suitable persons;
(b) extension agents would no longer attempt to cover all
farmers, but concentrate on selected farmers within
the village community; and
(c) extension agents would also limit in the future the
number of themes propagated simultaneously, emphasizing
at any one time only the most important cultivation
practice (i.e., the "impact point system").
6.04      To achieve these goals, assurances have been obtained during nego-
tiations that the extension service would be reorganized. A separate exten-
sion section would be created in the Department of Community Development of
each ORD; this section would be headed by a chief assisted by a well experi-
enced extension specialist. The extension service specialist would be
directly and fully responsible to his chief for the successful start up of
the extension service reorganization and its subsequent operation under the
project. In each extension section, 3 of the more experienced staff would
be selected to be responsible for liaison with the research station on agron-
omy, livestock and horticulture. Another experienced agent would be selected
as extension coordinator; no difficulties are foreseen in finding suitable
personnel out of the present staff of over 200 people. Details on the new
organization of extension services are provided in Annex 12.
Training of Extension Services
6.05      The extension service specialists would be responsible for training
extension agents. The training program would consist of a regular schedule
of courses as well as field training and research station visits, and would
among other activities, contain a three to four week orientation course early
in the project for each extension agent, followed by a two-week course each
autumn and a two-day course each spring. Special courses would be held for
field management staff (sub-sector and sector chiefs, extension coordinators,
subject matter specialists). Assurances have been obtained during negotia-
tions that the extension specialists would be recruited prior to July 1, 1977
to establish a detailed training program prior to November 1, 1977. Prior to



- 23 -
the end of February in each year, the Government would present the work
program for extension services, including details of the utilization of
personnel and of the budget to IDA for an exchange of views; also any sub-
stantial change in the program would be discussed with IDA, prior to its
execution. Details are presented in Annex 12.
Project Accounts and Monitoring
6.06      An international firm of auditors, Coopers and Lybrand, was
appointed in 1975 to audit the accounts of all IDA-financed agricultural
projects. It subsequently carried out a study on a proposal to set up a
Financial and Administrative Unit (FAU), reporting directly to the permanent
Secretary of the CCDR, which would establish and maintain an accounting and
reporting system for the ORDs of Bobo-Dioulasso, Dedougou and Diebougou, and
for the IDA-financed agricultural projects in them. FAU would also monitor
progress of the projects and train local staff, and would eventually cover
all agricultural and livestock projects financed by IDA and being carried out
by any ORD. Government has agreed during negotiations to the establishment
of FAU and has issued a decree ("arrete") to this effect. During negotia-
tions assurances have been obtained that consultants would be engaged under
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association to prepare the FAU pro-
gram prior to November 1, 1977 and to assist in establishing the accounting
and reporting system. Not later than six months following the approval by
IDA of the FAU program, FAU chief and technical advisor would be appointed
(para 6.11).
Grain Storage
6.07      Requests for the construction of village grain stores would be
made by the village cooperatives "Groupements villageois". Requests would be
handled by the ORD's Community Development department, which would approve
them only when it is demonstrated that the village community is willing and
able to manage the stores. The same department would also supervise construc-
tion and operation of the stores.
C. Other Institutions
Rural Roads Agency (SERS)
6.08      The road brigade established under the West Volta Cotton Project has
been transferred to SERS and will carry out the roads program in the project
area with funds provided by the Rural Roads project (Cr. 579-UV). However,
the technical assistant, who headed the road brigade would be retained under
the proposed project in order to effectively train the SERS personnel in the
project area (Annex 4, Appendix 1).



- 24 -
Irrigation Department (ONBI)
6.09      The branch office of ONBI at Bobo-Dioulasso would be responsible
for implementing small irrigation schemes. As ONBI office staff is inadequate
for this task, assurances have been obtained during negotiations that the
branch office would be strengthened with a qualified and experienced irri-
gation engineer and a surveyor, provided under the project, who would also
train local staff to execute the schemes.
Women's Activities (EAEW)
6.10      The two regional centers to be established would be staffed with
a team of three specialists in functional literacy, audio-visual instruction
and community organization, and administer the program in about 20 villages
each. During the first project year, a socio-economic study would be made
to select villages to be included in the project, and local extension agents
(called "monitrices") would be chosen for further training at the centers.
If selected villages agree to the program, they would nominate their repre-
sentatives (called "animatrices") who would organize the women into cooper-
ative associations and assist in the administration of project activities.
Further details of the organization are provided in Annex 8.
D. Personnel Requirements
6.11      Due to the scarcity of local personnel, ten expatriates were
employed under the West Volta Cotton Project. In spite of the projected
reorganization and the new tasks that would be demanded to be carried out
by project staff, it is expected that such staff would be cut down to eight
under the proposed project. The reduction would be made possible through a
shift in positions: while additional staff would be needed in key management
posts, most of the expatriates now filling intermediate management posts in
the field can be replaced by local personnel. Key personnel expected to be
internationally recruited would be: the two technical advisors of the ORDs;
the two extension specialists in the ORDs; the technical advisor of FAU; the
training assistant for SERS; the irrigation engineer and surveyor for ONBI;
and the technical assistant to CCDR after expiry of the period during which
he is financed under Cr. 496-UV. Apart from the irrigation engineer and
surveyor for ONBI, who would be employed with the appropriate qualifica-
tions and experience and under terms of reference acceptable to the Swiss
co-financer, assurances that the remaining positions would be filled by
specialists, whose qualifications, experience and terms of reference are
satisfactory to IDA, have been obtained during negotiations.

VII.  YIELDS AND PRODUCTION; MARKETS, PRICES AND SUBSIDIES;
FARMERS' BENEFITS; GOVERNMENT REVENUES
A.  YIELDS AND PRODUCTION
7.01      In order to arrive at representative yield estimates and taking
into account the various types of farmers, ecological conditions and degrees
of farmers' advancement, several categories of project participants have
been distinguished following the three broad categories of farmers discussed
in para. 4.08 and 4.11, the level of technology, and a geographical distribu-
tion.  However, cereal yields based on actual field measurements do not exist
and present yields are based on data collected by a survey carried out by the
ORDs in 1975, checked against yield estimated by experienced extension agents,
and against information from IRAT research workers. Future yields are mainly
based on experiments carried out by IRAT at farm level. Data on cotton yields
are far more reliable, because they have been collected systematically for
more than five years. Actual and projected yields per category as summarized
in the table below and detailed in Annex 13, are averages representing a
midpoint for a range of yields within each farmers' category.

7.02      On the basis of projected yields (para 7.01) and expected participa-
tion (para 4.08), the incremental output of cotton and cereals at full develop-
ment (PY 9) would be about 26,400 tons and 39,300 tons respectively as summar-
ized in the table below.

In addition, some 2,000 tons of paddy and 1,200 tons of vegetables
would be grown annually on irrigation schemes built under the project.
Production details are given in Annex 14.
B. Markets, Prices and Subsidies
7.03      Demand for cotton lint worldwide is expected to remain generally
firm. Although world consumption declined in 1974 and 1975, the trend was
reversed in 1976 and it is assumed that it will expand at its historical
growth rate of 2% per year between 1977 and 1985. Some 90% of the lint
produced under the project would be exported and as total lint production
in Upper Volta at full project development would be less than 0.5% of world
demand, no marketing difficulties are foreseen.
7.04      Prices for the cotton lint reference standard, the Mexican SM1 -
1/16", fell sharply from US$0.62/lb in 1973 to US$0.42/lb in 1975, in 1973
terms. Although they have since recovered to about US$0.45/lb in constant
1973 terms (US$0.70 in 1976 terms), they are expected to decline slightly
into the 1980's.  The shorter fiber from Upper Volta should keep selling
at a 15% discount from the standard, and on this basis, the economic value
of seedcotton at the farmgate level would decline from CFAF 79.1 per kg
to CFAF 74.4 per kg (Annex 15, table 1).



- 27 -
7.05      The financial price for seedcotton at the farm level presently aver-
ages CFAF 38 per kg which is far below the economic value. This is justified
as cotton is Upper Volta's major source of revenue, as it provides adequate
incentives to cotton growers in relation to other commodities, and as the low
producer price is offset by subsidies on fertilizers and insecticides (para
7.08). These subsidies provide more incentives than a corresponding increase
in producer price, since they are received prior to the crop season and hence
reduce the financial consequences of a crop failure. In the neighbouring
country of Mali, where cotton is also a major export, financial and economic
farmgate prices are at about the same levels (CFAF 37 and CFAF 76 equivalent
respectively).
7.06      While seedcotton prices are set by Government, millet and sorghum
prices are established in the free trade. Demand for millet and sorghum
is limited but fairly stable, at least in normal rainfall years when it
comes mostly from urban consumers. Supplies that come on the market, however,
vary widely both within the year and from one year to another. Consequently,
prices fluctuate considerably, from CFAF 10-25 per kg just prior to a harvest,
to a maximum of CFAF 25-50 per kg at the height of the "soudure" period.
Government attempts to stabilize prices through OFNACER and the ORDs (para
2.08) have not been successful and it is felt that such an undertaking will be
beyond the administration's capacity for some time to come; meanwhile, the-
promotion of grain storage at the village level carried out under the project
would have a limited but more useful price stabilizing influence. Economic
farmgate prices have been based on World Bank forecasts for international
sorghum prices, as presented in Annex 15 table 2. An average price of CFAF 18
per kg has been taken as a basis for calculating farm budgets. Economic
farmgate Drices for paddy are in line with financial prices and are presented
in Annex 15, table 3.
7.07      The center north and center south of the project area are tradi-
tionally surplus areas for millet and sorghum within the country and it
is expected that some 70% of incremental project production in these two
zones, or about 20,000 tons annually at full development, would come on the
market. A recent Bank study on foodgrains forecasts that by 1985 the national
deficit in coarse grains may have reached some 63,000 tons, taking into
account population increases and urbanization rates but assuming constant
per capita consumption. No difficulties are therefore expected in marketing
project produce at these levels. Rowever, if good rainfall years occur
during the project period, farmgate prices for cereals could well be lower
than those assumed in the farm budgets, thus inducing a switch from cereal
to cotton production and a lower cereal tonnage available for marketing.
7.08      Government's present policy is to subsidize cash inputs such as
fertilizers and insecticides. In 1976, the cost to farmers was CFAF 35
per kg of fertilizers and CFAF 430 per liter of insecticides compared with a
farmgate cost of CFAF 70 and CFAF 770, respectively. The full amount of
subsidies related to project inputs, calculated at present subsidy rates,
is presented in Annex 16. Cash inputs are almost entirely consumed in cotton
production and since such production is heavily taxed, these subsidies are
really only nominal. While it could be argued that a more effective long-
run input pol icy would consist of raising the cotton farmgate price to its



- 28 -
eco omic level and simultaneously eli.iinate input subsidies, Government
is -nderstandably reluctant to implement any drastic change in its policy
whith was designed to encourage cotton production and which has worked well.
Nev rtheless, Government appreciates the long-run implications of this policy
and has reconfirmed during negotiations the standing agreements with IDA
(Cr 317-UV and Cr. 496-UV) to exchange views annually on the price of seed
cot :on to be paid to producers, and on subsidies on prices for fertilizers or
pes-:icides with a view to maintaining adequate incentives for the growing of
cot-on. The impact on subsidies on the Government cash flow is explained in
pari 7.11).
C. Farmers' Benefits
7.0)      About 46,500 farmers participating in project activities would
obtiin substantial direct income benefits through using project services and
inputs. About 45% of the project's direct beneficiaries: the cereal farmers
of :he north and the new settlers coming from the Mossi region, are among the
poo-est of the country. In addition, improved roads and women's activities
woukd indirectly benefit some 30% of all project area farmers, while a greater
effictiveness of the ORDs, the main agencies for rural development in the
area, would benefit the region as a whole.
7.10      Direct income benefits have been calculated for nine model farms
(Annex 17) following the distinction in farmers categories explained in para
7.01. The increases in net production value and disposable cash income are
sumnarized in the table below.

D. Government Cash Flow
7.11      Government draws important revenues from cotton production.  Gross
revenue from incremental cotton production resulting from the project is
expected to increase from CFAF 125 million in 1977 to CFAF 956 million from
1985 onwards at present farmgate prices, while gross revenue from cotton
production as a whole in the project area would increase from CFAF 1.8 billion
to CFAF 2.5 billion. Although Government also subsidizes inputs at about 50%
of real cost (para 7.08), such subsidies would amount to less than 20% of
gross revenue from the sale of cotton lint at full development. As a result,
net Government revenue from the project is positive from the start, leading to
an annual inflow of about CFAF 660 million at full development, while net
annual revenue from cotton production as a whole in the project area would be
about CFAF 1.6 billion at full development. Details are given in Annex 18.
VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Benefits
8.01      The project's main direct economic benefits would be an increase
in production of cotton and cereals (Annex 19).  At the farmgate, the eco-
nomic value of incremental production at 1976 constant prices is estimated
for cotton at CFAF 1.4 billion (US$5.7 million) annually, and for cereals
at CFAF 1.9 billion (US$7.8 million) annually at full development. Cotton
is the country's most important source of foreign exchange earnings after
livestock and the project, at full development, would add 9,800 tons of
cotton lint to the present production of 16,000 tons which at 1976 market
values, represents increased net foreign exchange earnings of about CFAF 2.7
billion (US$11.0 million).
8.02      The economic rate of return of the project has been calculated at
30.0% over 15 years (Annex 19, Table 1). The high rate of return obtained
is due to (a) the fact that the investment represented by the project is
small relative to the value of infrastructure and equipment already available
in the project area which is treated as sunk cost; and (b) the early increases
in production and benefits resulting from introducing a highly productive
technology for annual crops. Although the rate of return is quite sensitive
to changes in parameters, sensitivity tests show that the return would still
be over 10% with a 25% reduction in benefits, a 33% increase in costs, or a
combination of both a reduction in benefit and increase in costs of between
10 and 15%. (Annex 19, table 2).
Risks
8.03      As with all projects based on rainfed agriculture in the Sahel
countries, benefits are susceptible to sharp fluctuations due to erratic



- 30 -
rainfall, and reoccurrence of a severe drought would decrease production
of both cereals and cotton. The rate of return would not decrease in pro-
portion to declines in production, however, as with a lower than expected
cereal production, cereal prices would increase above expected levels. The
risks are also reduced by the dry-farming techniques to be promoted under
the project which would lessen the drop in yields which would have taken
place without the project. A sensitivity test (Annex 19, table 2) shows that
the occurrence of a severe drought every six years would lower the project's
rate of return with less than 1%.
8.04      Delayed implementation of the proposed organizational changes,
with consequent delays in project benefits could be another project risk.
A sensitivity test (Annex 19, table 2) shows that a delay of two years
in project benefits would lower the rate of return to 9.5%.

WEST VOLTA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
West Volta Cotton Project
A. Objectives and Project Components
1.        The West Volta Cotton Project (Credit 225-UV), the Bank Group's
first agricultural project in Upper Volta, was appraised in February 1970,
signed in December 1970, and became effective in June 1971. The project's
principal objective was to help finance the final phase of a program to
increase both the area grown under cotton and seed cotton yields, thereby
raising farmer income, Government revenue and the country's foreign exchange
earnings. It was assumed that at the end of the project period, revenues to
Government from cotton growing would be adequate to finance support services
needed to sustain production.
2.        Principal components of the project were:  1) staffing and equipping
the management and extension services of Bobo-Dioulasso and Dedougou ORDs;
2) establishing a revolving credit fund to provide cotton growers with credit;
3) building a new ginnery; 4) establishing a road unit to improve the feeder-
road network; and 5) funding studies on a cotton production project in
Diebougou-Gaoua area and on detailed engineering of two secondary roads.
Total project costs were estimated at US$9.40 million and were to be financed
by IDA: US$6.20 million (66%); French bilateral aid: US$1.76 (19%); Govern-
ment: US$1.15 (12%); and farmers: US$0.29 (3%). CFDT, which was responsible
for cotton production and ginning would provide key personnel to project
management. Since the project had to work through the two ORDs it had only a
small staff. Its main expenditures have been for financing the two ORD's
agriculture extension services, which work almost exclusively on cotton.
B. Project Performance
Management and Extension Service
3.        Over the years the project had to cope with continual organizational
problems, its own as well as in both ORDs. In the relatively short period
of 5 years, the director's post in each ORD has been occupied by 2 to 3
different persons; the project's chief accountant post changed hands three
times with negligible overlap. The project's administrative authority,
vis-a-vis both ORD directions, was never clear and, with growing importance of
the ORDs, the project's role became more and more subordinate. To compound



Annex 2
Page 2
the problems for both ORDs and the Project, the ORDs were assigned to an
increasingly multi-functional task, making the relationship between project
authority and ORD complex and vague.
4.        After the project became effective, it took a full year before
the extension service of the new ORD Bobo-Dioulasso became more or less
organized and operational. Though one of the most important tools for agri-
cultural development, agricultural extension work in Upper Volta is a low
status, low paid activity without fringe benefits. The training of the
extension worker consists of a 9-month theoretical training course in
Matourkou, after which he is considered ready for the field. There is no
in-service training and no well planned and consistently applied recycling
program. With the increasingly multi-functional task of the ORDs, the exten-
sion worker has among other tasks to cope with: distribution of production
inputs, collection of statistical data, organization of cereal marketing
(sometimes even serving as buying agent), recovery of outstanding debts and
promoting village cooperatives: these activities leave him little time for
real extension work.
5.        Initially, expatriates occupied 80% of key positions in ORDs' man-
agement and approximately 50% in the lower cadre.  Through the years, the
number of expatriates in both ORDs has dropped, to the present 4 in management
and 2 in the extension service's lower cadre. The number of available exten-
sion agents was never at adequate strength: although it rose gradually from
about 200 agents in 1971 to 232 in 1975, it remained 15 to 30% lower than
budgeted numbers. At present about 50% of the field agents are young people
without any experience. Understandably, hampered by inadequate technical
knowledge, insufficient financial incentive, and working in a less than effi-
cient organizational structure, the impact of the extension worker on agricul-
tural development is only marginal.
Production
6.        The project also had to deal with major problems in developing
and expanding rainfed cotton cultivation, which is strongly affected by
interrelated factors such as: (i) the rainfall amounts and distribution,
(ii) the need for cereals as a subsistence crop, and (iii) the price ratio
between cotton and other crops, in particular, cereals.
7.        Over the past 7 years, rainfall quantity and distribution for
cotton production could be classified as bad in three years (1970, 1973 and
1976), reasonable in two years (1971 and 1974) and good in the remaining two
years, 1972 and 1975. The particularly bad rainfall in 1973, one of the
great drought years, caused production to fall to 25,000 t against 45,000 t
estimated at appraisal. This set back cotton production at least two years
and rendered construction of the envisaged ginnery unnecessary during the
project period.



Annex 2
Page 3
8.        During the period 1970-75, the producer price for cotton and cereals
was as follows in CFAF/kg:
Year            Cotton         Cereal        Ratio (Cotton:  Cereals)
1970            31.2           13                  2.4
1971            31.2           14                  2.2
1972            31.2           17                  1.8
1973            33.6           23                  1.4
1974            38.6           20                  1.9
1975            38.6           16                  2.4
It has been empirically established that there is a critical point for the
ratio of producer prices for cotton seed and cereals.  When this ratio drops
below the 2.0 level, the farmers find it more profitable to grow cereals.
This happened for three years, beginning in 1972.  Because of the drought and
related shortage of cereals, Government policy stressed the stimulation of
cereal growing. The 1974 price increase for cotton was officially announced
in September after it became clear that the rains were sufficient for a
good cereal production year. 1975 was a good cotton year because of both
well distributed rainfall and an attractive cotton/cereals price ratio.
Farmers Response
9.        Production figures cannot be compared with appraisal report estimates
on a year-by-year basis, since the production of the base year 1970/71 turned
out to be grossly over-estimated (about 20,000 t too high). The increase,
however, between the first and last project year was estimated to be about
32,500 ha in area and 33,000 tons in seed cotton output. In spite of the
setback caused by the drought, the area under cotton in 1976/77 will be
32,000 ha more than inl970/71 and seed cotton production 38,500 tons higher.
There is also evidence that farming practices improved over the years. The
use of fertilizers in the project area increased from 24 kg to 38 kg/ha (63%),
compared to an increase from 10 kg/ha to 14 kg/ha (40%) for the cotton area
outside the project (Table 1). The West Volta Cotton Project also had an
impact on cereal growing in the area, in the sense that the better cotton
farmer is also the better cereal grower.
Other Achievements
10.       Satisfactory progress was also made on other areas:  (a) feeder
road network was improved; (b) studies were made that led to the IDA-
financed Bougouriba Agricultural Development Project (Cr 496-UV); and
(c) a well-functioning distribution system for production inputs and an
assured marketing outlet for cottonseed oil and lint were built up.



Annex 2
Page 4
Farm Credit
il.       With funds provided under the project, a revolving credit fund
was established at the BND to provide seasonal (fertilizers and insecticides)
and medium-term credit to farmers in the project area. In practice, the
ordering and distribution of supplies was done by CFDT, making use of its well
established contacts in France and the Ivory Coast and credit funds were
provided by the existing Central Bank discount facility to a consortium of
Voltaic Banks, including BND, which in turn channeled these funds to the AP.
Subsidies are paid by the Government from a special fund (Fonds Special de
Productivite (FSP)) which receives part of the surpluses on sales of cotton
lint and oil. Extension workers handle the distribution to farmers, who pay
CFAF 35/kg for fertilizers and 340/1 for insecticides; repayment at the time
seed cotton is collected includes the outstanding credit plus interest of CFAF
3/kg and CFAF 20/1, respectively.
12.       Medium-term credit for cotton growers has never been a major BND
activity. As a major reason, most farmers can rent sprayers for CFAF 100
per liter of insecticides used, and this provision satisfies the largest
demand for medium-term credit. The second largest demand is for a cart, and
the available supply is taken up through cash payments rather than credit.
There is also a demand for ox-drawn implements, but since only 0.8% of cotton
growers use animal traction, the amount of credit involved is not large. In
sum, funds of BND's revolving credit fund are estimated to be sufficient to
satisfy present demand for medium-term credit and to meet increases in demand
under the follow-up of the West Volta Cotton Project.
The "Association en participation" (AP)
13.       Under the AP agreement between CFDT and Government, CFDT is re-
sponsible for the development of cotton production and for the ginning and
marketing; it also owns all cotton ginneries. The agreement basically sets
out each party's responsibilities, assets, and division of costs and benefits.
AP income will be proceeds from:  (i) lint sold by CFDT to the local textile
industry, or directly on export markets; or (ii) as requested on CSPP's
account, cotton seed sold ex-factory for local supply, and ex-stock or free
on rail or truck Abidjan for export.
14.       AP's expenditures will comprise:  (i) agricultural extension costs
not covered by other sources; (ii) CFDT's recurrent costs for purchasing,
ginning and marketing, excluding investments in gins and storage; (iii)
financial charges, including the short-term rediscount rate of the Central
Bank plus 1.5% on funds provided either by CFDT or Government for working
capital or financing of investments; (iv) amortization of buildings and in-
stallations (over 20 years for buildings, 10 years for factory equipment, 5
years for motors and electrical equipment, and 3 years for vehicles); and
(v) remuneration to CFDT.



Annex 2
Page 5
15.       Part of the AP's profits are earmarked for the FSP to cover the
subsidies on fertilizers and insecticides for cotton production.  Any losses
are borne by CSPP, which during a losing season would pay CFDT 80% of the
estimated anticipated losses and the remainder after approval of the AP's
annual accounts. After the 1975/76 season, the benefits, some CFAF 580
million, are estimated to be distributed as follows:
FSP               (35%):          CFAF 203.0 million
CSPP             (45.5):          CFAF 263.9 million
ORD              (6.5%):          CFAF  37.7 million
CFDT            (13.0%):          CFAF  75.4 million
The AP agreement covered the period 1970 to 1975, but has been extended
tacitly until October 1978. More details are in Appendix 1.
Project Accounts, Disbursements and Auditing
16.       During the project, accounts were handled by three different
accountants, two of whom left without proper transfer of their activities to
their successors. A further difficulty was caused by project accounts having
to rely a good deal on ORD accounts, since most of the funds are channelled
to the two ORDs. As ORD accounts are consistently 6-8 months late, and allow-
ing for clearances at the project authority level and at the Treasury, it
is not uncommon for 10 months to elapse before reimbursements are made. An
auditing consultant reviewed the accounts in 1975 and concluded that no
proper records existed. Upon agreement with IDA, an international auditing
firm, Coopers and Lybrand, was employed to review the accounts of all IDA
projects in Upper Volta and make recommendations; subsequently, with the
encouragement of supervision missions, Government agreed to establish a
central Financial and Administrative Unit to introduce a uniform accounting
system which will be used eventually in all IDA projects in the country.
This unit is anticipated to become operational in 1977, as part of the follow-
up project now under consideration. Due to the project's late start and
postponement of the ginnery's construction, it was possible to finance addi-
tional activities, such as: (i) consultants work on the follow-up project;
(ii) the auditing services; (iii) US$60,000 for the Samorogoan Ranch project;
and (iv) in addition, to extend the project's completion date through December
1976.
C. Project Experience
17.       From the foregoing, it is clear that, throughout the project period,
the agricultural extension services have been seriously deficient, and have
only aimed at the promotion of one crop: cotton. Moreover, agricultural
extension work under the project is operational for not more than 3 to 4
years, an extremely short time according to agricultural development horizons.
The present outlook is for cotton growing to develop very slowly and possibly
level off in competition with cereal production. A simultaneous development



Annex 2
Page 6
of subsistence and cash crops is imperative for further agricultural develop-
ment. To promote this type of integrated development, extension services have
to be entirely retrained and reorganized. These renovations cannot be done
without further financing. Moreover, without a follow-up project, dis-
tribution of production inputs and marketing of the produce would almost
certainly break down and nullify the progress achieved. In addition to
preventing a destructive impact on the present level of development, a fol-
low-up project would make it possible to explore various other developmental
opportunities in the western region - for agriculture, the most promising area
in Upper Volta.

IEST VOLTA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Agriculture in the Project Area
General Characteristics of the Project Area (Table 1)
1.        The project area is located in two of the western ORDs:  ORD des
Hauts Bassins, headquarters at Bobo-Dioulasso; and ORD de la Volta Noire,
headquart rs at Dedougou. These two ORDs 1/ cover a total surface of
58,000 km or 21% of the total area of the country. The terrain is relatively
flat.  Average monthly temperature is in the 25-300C range throughout the
region. Average rainfall varies from 800 mm, with erratic distribution, in
the north to 1,200 mm in the southwest; the rainfall distribution in the grow-
ing season is shown in Table 2. A severe drought affected the region in 1973
but the 1975, rainfall has been more normal. Based on ecological conditions,
four zones can be distinguished from North to South. The highest potential
for crop production is in the two central regions where both higher and more
regular rainfall and better soil conditions exist. These four zones, the
administrative units they consist of, their principal crops and the per-
centage of cultivated area they occupy are as follows:
-    North:  Tougan, Nouna, Toma; 90% cereals and 10%
various food crops.
-    Center-North:  Solenzo, Dedougou, Boromo; 65% cereals,
20% cotton, and 15% various food crops.
-    Center - South:  Bobo-Dioulasso - North, Hounde,
N'Dorola; 65% cereals, 20% cotton, and 15% of various
food crops.
-    South:  Bobo-Dioulasso - South, Orodara; 70% cereals,
10% groundnuts, and 20% various food crops.
Farm Size
2.        Precise data on farm size, cultivated areas and labor requirements
of the various crops do not exist in Upper Volta. Cotton is the only recorded
crop; for other crops, figures on production, yields and areas cultivated are
1/   Specifically referred to as the ORD of Bobo-Dioulasso and of Dedougou.



Annex 3
Page 2
no more than estimates provided by inexperienced extension workers. Data
from the agricultural census of 1974/75, which is still under review, is
expected to be officially released at the end of 1977. The average area
cultivated per farm is estimated at 5.0 ha in the North and 5.5 ha in the
Central North and Central South. Food crops occupy a little over 4.0 ha in
the North, where cereal growing is the major activity, and about 1 ha less in
the regions where cereals and a cash crop are grown. The average cotton area
per farm is estimated at 1.9 ha; groundnuts, vegetables, sesame and other
crops occupy 0.8 - 0.4 ha per farm.
Crops
3.        The main food crops are sorghum (40%), millet (24%), and maize,
fonio and rice (16%). Groundnuts, sesame and vegetables cover about 20%.
The average yields are 500-700 kg/ha for millet and 650-850 kg/ha for
sorghum. Yields could be improved by better cultivation practices such as
timely weeding, higher population density, and the use of pure seed. IRAT
selects improved local varieties on their seed farm in Farako-Ba near Bobo-
Dioulasso. Grofing sorghum and M 12 are already available for distribution.
yields of 1,000-1,500 kg/ha for sorghum and 1,000-1,300 kg/ha for millet
could be expected at the farm level, if correct cultivation practices were
used under normal climatological conditions.
4.        Maize is mainly grown in the Center-South and is almost non-existent
in the north, because of the dry conditions. IRAT has an improved variety,
"Jaune de FO", with yields of 1,500-2,500 kg/ha under good farming conditions.
Rice, which covers only slightly over 1% of the project area, is most important
in the Center-South region, where 73% of the project's total rice area is
cultivated. An average yield of 3,500 kg/ha under irrigation is attainable.
Presently the rainfed variety Dourado is widely used with average yields of
2,000 kg/ha.
5.        Cotton covers only about 10% of the cultivated area, but is by
far the most important cash crop. Slightly more than 90% of all the cotton
is grown in the two central zones. Cotton seed, compound fertilizer and
pesticides are distributed to farmers on cash or short-term credit except for
cotton seed which is distributed free at a rate of 55 kg/ha; the most widely
used variety is BJA. Applied research and seed multiplication are carried out
by IRCT. Every year 30-40 kg of foundation seed from Mali are sown on the
IRCT research station. The following year about 1,000 kg of registered
seed are multiplied on the Boni station and a few selected farms, producing
30 tons of certified seed for distribution to farmers to maintain appropriate
seed cotton quality.
6.        Other crops are grown primarily for family consumption on small
plots ranging from an average 5% in the center zones where cotton is pre-
dominant to 15% in the Northern and Southern regions. Groundnuts cover
about 5% of the total cultivated area and can be found in all zones; average
yields are in the 600-800 kg/ha range.  Sesame occupies 2-3% of the cultivated



Annex 3
Page 3
area, and yields 200-300 kg/ha. This crop can produce a sizeable extra income
for the family if well taken care of.
Farming Practices
7.        Except for cotton, farmers in the project area in generai use low
level technology and traditional farming practices. This is particularly
true for the far north and south of the project area where cotton is either
non-existent or unimportant.  Based on the level of technology, four groups
of farmers may be distinguished:
(i) Traditional Farmers. The majority grow only cereals. Seeds
used are of inferior quality; weeding is late and often
inadequate. Consequently yields are low. The small number
of cotton growers in this group use neither fertilizers nor
pesticides and, because of poor cultivation practices, these
costly inputs cannot be recommended. The major constraint in
this group of farmers is inappropriate planting and weeding
techniques.
(ii) Intermediate Farmers. This group understands the beneficial
effect of fertilizers and pesticides on cotton and uses either
one of these inputs or both, but at incorrect rates; many of
these farmers benefit from the after-effects of fertilizers
on their cereals. As a group they represent the largest
number of cotton growers, and with improved cultivation
practices a sizeable increase in yields could be obtained.
(iii) Advanced Farmers. A small, rather elite group that uses the
correct amount of seed, fertilizers and spraying techniques
located in the better cotton area (the Center-South and Cen-
ter-North region). A number of these farmers obtain annual
yields of over 2 tons/ ha regularly. Most of these, however,
do not carry out planting and weeding properly.
(iv) New Farmers. This group is mostly composed of Mossi who
have migrated to the project area and, after 2 to 3 years of
cereals growing for subsistence, apply to the extension ser-
vice for assistance in growing cotton as a cash crop. Used
to working under difficult conditions on the Mossi plateau,
they are generally more aggressive in their cultivation
practices, adjust easily to their new environment, and show
easier acceptance of new techniques.  As a group, the level
of farming is comparable to the group of intermediate
farmers.
Labor Requirements
8.        Farming is based on shifting cultivation, and fields are usually
hand cultivated by the family.  About 0.8% farms use animal-drawn implements.



Annex 3
Page 4
Hired labor is used only by a very small number of farmers who grow high value
crops or have a large area under cultivation; hired labor wages vary from
CFAF 150/day to CFAF 1,500/month plus food. The average size of a farmer's
family is about 10 persons, but range from 7.1 for Tougan to 14 for Orodara.
It is generally assume4 that the average farm family has five active workers
and a labor availability of about 125 mandays per month. During the drought
years, the influx of migrants from the Mossi Plateau to the project area
became substantial and will certainly have an impact on present agricultural
practices. Arriving first in rather small family units and cultivating only
cereals, they will bring the rest of their families after some two years when
production for subsistence is adequately guaranteed and the production of
cotton as a cash crop is seriously considered. Labor requirements for the
various crops and type of farmer are in Tables 3, 4 and 5.

Feeder Road Improvement Program
Introduction
1.        The feeder road network requires rehabilitation to assure timely
distribution of inputs (seeds, fertilizers, insecticides) and evacuation of
produce (mainly seed cotton) from the main production areas to the processing
facilities (ginning factories), and local or export markets. Moreover,
annual maintenance is of crucial importance in this area, where heavy point
rainfall may cause damage to the improved dirt roads.
Feeder Road Program
2.        The feeder road program would consist of improvement and subsequent
annual maintenance of 387 km of rural roads, and maintenance of about 800 km/
year of already, improved feeder roads. Road improvement would involve re-
gravelling and construction of drainage and crossing structures. Roads to
be improved have been identified and are listed in Table 1. Under the project,
part of existing equipment would be replaced as indicated in Table 2.
Execution and Costs
3.        Execution of the feeder road program would be the responsibility of
the Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Urban Development (MPW) through
the newly established Special Department of Rural Roads (Service d'Entretien
des Routes Secondaires, SERS). SERS was created in January, 1975 to be
responsible for administration, studies, construction, improvement and main-
tenance of all rural roads.
4.        Estimated total costs of the feeder road improvement program would
amount to approximately US$3.53 million, of which US$2.04 million, or 58%
of total costs, represent foreign exchange component. Taxes are estimated
at US$659,484. Details of cost estimates are shown in Tables 3-5.

Irrigation Projects
Potential and Limitations 1/
1.        Possibilities for development of irrigation schemes are mainly of
three types: (i) bottomland development; (ii) irrigation below existing
earth dams; and (iii) development of the major water basins. The irrigation
potential of Upper Volta, using waters from the major basins, is estimated
to be 130,000 ha: Black Volta Basin - 55,000 ha; White and Red Volta Basins -
47,000 ha; Comoe Basin - 15,000 ha; Plains in Southwest - 13,000 ha. Apart
from these relatively large schemes, there is a potential for about 10,000 ha
in small scale schemes and for the development of 30,000 ha of bottomlands.
There is also an irrigation potential of approximately 10,000 ha below existing
small dams.
2.        However, major constraints for development of irrigation exist,
including: (i) unfavorable climatic and physical conditions such as poor
soils, flat relief and limited water resources; (ii) lack of irrigation
know-how and of qualified staff and institutions; and (iii) limited markets
for high value crops. In turn, these factors coupled with Upper Volta's distance
from the coast and the lack of competition for construction contracts, lead to
high costs.
Proposed Irrigation Projects
3.        Given these constraints the project would focus on simple, small,
low-cost schemes such as bottomland development (1,000 ha), irrigation schemes
(100 ha) mainly for vegetable production, and small irrigation schemes below
dams (20 ha). Except for irrigation below dams, which is still experimental,
bottomland development and pump irrigation have proved successful under the
first Rural Development Fund project (CR 317-UV). To remedy the shortage
of qualified local staff, a unit would be established with internationally
recruited specialists to strengthen the skeleton organization that has
recently been set up by ONBI. The specialists would also provide on-the-
job training for their local counterparts.
1/   For more details, see:  Report of the Upper Volta Irrigation Sector
Study, No. 28/75-UV, dated July 10, 1975, FAO/World Bank Cooperative
Programme.



Annex 6

Bottomlands
4.        Bottomlands are small, flat areas located at the bottom of small
watersheds which exist in many parts of the country. Soils in the bottom-
lands are predominantly clay-like, with low permeability, and suitable for
rice cultivation. Most of the undeveloped bottomlands are presently used
as pastures. Bottomlands ranging from 3 to 20 ha in size have been
identified in the project area.
5.        Bottomland development would involve construction of small, longi-
tudinal contour bunds with cross bunds to limit individual plots to 0.1 - 0.2
ha.  Flood water would flow downstream, filling each consecutive strip of
land between transversal bunds, crossing these through pipe culverts. Project
works would permit limited control and better distribution of water, although
water resources would still be very dependent on natural climatological
conditions.
6.        For implementation and operation of bottomlands, topographical
mapping of the area would be undertaken by ORDs under the supervision of
HAER; and design of the system would be by ORDs. Because of the heavy soils,
initial plowing and construction of bunds would be by tractor, but farmers
would participate in the compaction of fill, and transportation of material
using hand tools to be provided under the project. Bund maintenance and
repairs would be the responsibility of project farmers, under supervision of
ORDs. Estimated investment cost is CFAF 38,900 per hectare as detailed in
Table 1.
Vegetable Production Development
7.        Under RDF I, a small vegetable project covering 25 ha was constructed.
The project obtains its water from the existing Kou main canal. The cropping
pattern for the project includes dry season vegetables and wet season crops of
maize, rice and tomatoes. Plans to develop an additional 50 ha have been pre-
pared by HAER. Other possible project sites have been identified. These
include:
(i) Bomboela, Bouna, Sampopo in the ORD of Dedougou;
and
(iî) Lagema, Desso and Banakeledaga in the ORD of Bobo-
Dioulasso.
This type of project requires more design work for the construction of the
main canal and water regulating devices; moreover, storage facilities have
also to be provided since schemes generally cover larger areas to make the
construction of the main canal justified. Field work is basically the same as
for bottomlands. Cost based on detailed analysis of the 25 ha project con-
structed under RDF I are estimated at CFAF 696,000 per hectare.



Annex 6
Page 3
Irrigation Below Dams
8.        This type of scheme would involve gravity irrigation below existing
dams. Two such dams have been identified: Bangassogo and Guyale. Wet season
rice would be the principal crop with vegetables and a probable second crop
during the dry season, depending on availability of storage water. The limited
experience so far has shown that required design work is principally the same
as for vegetable development, and field structures are similar to bottomland
development, but that maintenance costs on bunds and of structures are much
higher.
Irrigation Unit
9.        Under the project, an irrigation unit would be set up within the
office of ONBI (Bobo-Dioulasso). The unit would be responsible for planning,
investigations, design and construction of all irrigation schemes in the
project area. In addition to the new schemes to be developed, the unit would
also undertake surveys and studies of the Kou project for the purpose of
solving the drainage problem and possible extension of the irrigable area. An
irrigation engineer, a surveyor and a draftsman would start the unit. Costs
of the irrigation unit are in Tables 2 and 3.
10.       In view of the present shortage of qualified and experience local
staff, the two key personnel, irrigation engineer and surveyor, would be
internationally recruited. They would train local counterparts, who would be
expected to take over at the end of their engagement.
Famers' Holdings and Yields
11.       Farmers engaged in cultivating bottomlands and irrigated plots
below existing dams normally cultivate upland cereals. For this reason,
holdings on these schemes would be limited to 0.1 - 0.2 ha. Holdings on
vegetable production development schemes would follow the existing arrangement
in the ORD Dedougou: farmers organized in production cooperatives would be
allocated holdings equal to 0.5 ha irrigation units, on which the irrigation
water application and rotation system is based. Illustrative farm budgets are
in Tables 4 and 5.
Cost of Irrigation Schemes
12.       Labor for maintenance will be provided free of charge by the project
farmers. Maintenance costs are estimated at CFAF 2,000 per hectare. A sum-
marized cost estimate is in Table 6.

UPPER VOLTA
WEST VOLTA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Cotton Collection, Processing and Marketing
Collection
1.        Seed cotton is purchased directly from producers by some 16 pur-
chasing teams at 940 village collection points, roughly spread over 460
villages in ORD Bobo-Dioulasso and 480 in Dedougou; Upper Volta has a total of
1,950 purchasing points. The buying season starts in November and lasts for 5
months. Under the first cotton project the average tonnage purchased by each
team for a normal cropping season was 2,600 tons. Under the proposed project,
production is expected to increase by 1,300 tons in 1977 and by 24,000 tons at
the end of the development period (1981). No additional personnel, equipment
or storage facilities will be needed to handle the additional purchases, since
each team already has the capacity to increase the tonnage purchased and to
move the seed cotton from the field to the factory well ahead of the first
rains.
2.        CFDT has a fleet of 64 trucks, 44 of which have double carriers.
The average capacity of these is Il tons while that of the smaller trucks is
6 tons. CFDT does not rely on private transporters. The trucking needs
projected by CFDT are directly related to the tonnage processed per day. For
example, typical requirements are as follows: at 500 tons/day, 65 trucks; at
650 tons/day, 80 trucks; and at 800 tons/day, 100 trucks. With the increased
production and the new ginning factory to be constructed under the project,
additional trucks will be needed, but these, as well as normal replacements
will be financed by CFDT.
3.        The estimated transportation costs are CFAF 170 per kilometer
travelled, of which:
CFAF
Personnel                              21.6
Fuels and Oils                         26.8
Parts                                  21.4
Tires                                  12.1
Credit                                  0.7
Insurance & taxes                       3.6
Amortization                           36.3
Other garage expenses                  47.5

Fuel, parts and tires constitute approximately 40% of trucking costs.

4.         CFDT has 5 factories, one of which is under construction.  The
actual capacity is as follows:

Average ginning outturn                               37
During the second year of the project, a new factory with capacity to process
22,000 tons of seed cotton will be constructed at a cost of CFAF 785 million
or US$3.49 million. Factory costs exclusive of price and physical contingencies
are shown in Table 1.

Under the project new storage facilities, including silos for seed cotton,
and warehouses for bales of cotton lint and seed will be included when the new
ginnery is constructed. Cotton is sold at the world market price.
7.        In addition there are facilities at Abidjan, the main shipping port,
for 4,500-5,000 tons. The principal foreign markets for Upper Volta's cotton
are France, Italy and Japan which together account for 70% of total sales and
buy at the prevailing world market price. About 10% of the cotton seed is
sold as animal feed, 10% reserved for planting and 10% kept as stocks. The
rest is sold to CITEC for crushing.

WEST VOLTA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
The Women's Health/Education Component
1.        Recognizing the role of women in the economic development of rural
areas, the project would include a women's health/education component based
upon the ongoing activities of the Equal Access to Education for Women
Project, currently sponsored by UNDP. The project, established in 1967, was
originally funded by the Government with the assistance of Unesco; UNDP took
over the financing in 1971. The Equal Access project presently operates in
the zones of Kongousi, Po, and Banfora, and is under the responsibility
("tutelle") of the Ministry of National Education and Culture. The central
headquarters, at Ouagadougou, is staffed with a coordinating team, and spe-
cialists in functional literacy, adult education and community development,
home economics, and audio-visual training. A regional team directs the
activities in each zone with the assistance of salaried village "monitrices",
village "animatrices," and traditional midwives, all of whom are trained by
the project with the assistance of technicians from other departments.
2.        Under the West Volta Agricultural Development Project, the activi-
ties of the program would be expanded into the project ORDs of Bobo-Dioulasso
and Dedougou. The central coordinating headquarters would continue to direct
overall operations; however, two regional centers would be constructed in
Bobo-Dioulasso and Dedougou, and each staffed with a team of specialists in
functional literacy, audio-visual instruction, and community organization.
Each regional center would administer the program in 20 villages (i.e., a
total of 40 villages during the project period); the first year of the project
period would include a socio-economic study of the area to determine the
villages to be included in the program on the basis of receptiveness to the
project, sociological characteristics, and other factors such as economic
level and proximity to roads. The 40 villages chosen for inclusion in the
project would be fairly large (between 600-1,000 population), to facilitate
the administration of the project, and to ensure that a maximum number cf
families are reached. Actual implementation of activities would begin upon
completion of the socio-economic field work.
3.        The women's component has three interrelated goals; the improvement
of the incomes of rural families, the improvement of health conditions in
village areas, and the alleviation of the work load to facilitate the expan-
sion of educational opportunities for rural women. To reach these goals, the
program would consist of the following elements:



Annex 8
Page 2
(a) each village will nominate two unsalaried animatrices
who will receive a one month training course at one of
the regional centers in community organization, and in
the maintenance and operation of the equipment pro-
vided by the project. The role of these Animatrices
would be to organize village women into cooperative
associations, and assist in the administration of proj-
ect activities; they would receive a yearly refresher
course of 2-3 weeks duration.
(b) 20 monitrices with six years of education, would
be recruited and trained by the project; each monitrice
would be responsible for two project villages and will
support the animatrices and regional teams in the
implementation of project activities. These monitrices
receive a salary.
(c) each village would be provided with a basic introduction
in civic and agricultural education and in health,
nutrition and sanitation presented by means of func-
tional literacy and audio-visual methods by mobile
teams of specialists from the regional centers, with
the assistance of the monitrices. For this purpose, a
simple audio-visual program (charts, films, and written
materials) would be developed in the regional centers.
(d) two traditional midwives, from each village will
receive a one month training course at one of the
regional centers, and a kit of basic medical supplies.
Refresher courses of 2-3 weeks duration will be offered
on a yearly basis.
(e) each village association organized by the animatrices
and monitrices will be given a grain grinding mill, and
carts and donkeys for the transportation of crops,
wood, and water. The women utilize the equipment on
their own behalf, but will also have the possibility to
rent it out in order to earn collective revenues for
the cooperative. The revenues in the common fund are
used for activities as determined by the women's
associations, such as to replenish the medical supplies
to the traditional midwives, to replace tires on the
carts, to buy batteries for the association's radios,
to buy gasoline and repair the mills, etc...
(f) each regional center would be provided with a staff
car; monitrices will receive mobylettes for trans-
portation to the villages. In addition, a bicycle
would be given to each village women's association. A



Annex 8
Page 3
stock of spare parts would be stored at each regional
center, and the driver for each center would receive
the CNPAR course in small engine repair, in order to
maintain the equipment provided by the project. If
necessary, the ORD workshop will assist in repairs.
4.        It is intended that as the project becomes established monitrices
would cover more than two villages in order to lower the annual per capita
cost of services and to enlarge the number of families reached by the
program. Cost estimates related to this project component are in Annex 9.

timing of funds required to carry out the activities.
(c) It will ensure the prompt preparation and submission to the
CCDR, with copies to the directors of the ORDs, of quarterly and annual accounts
which will classify expenditures according to the projects and activities on
which they are incurred. Such accounts will allow a ready comparison with
budgets and estimates and will identify variances from the same.
(d)  It will prepare and submit to CCDR quarterly a synthesis of
activity reports furnished by the ORD Directors on each of the IDA-financed
agricultural projects.
(e)  It will prepare and submit to CCDR an annual income and
expenditure statement, cash flow statement and balance sheet for each ORD
and IDA financed agricultural project and shall arrange for their audit by an
independent firm of auditors.
(f) It will ensure:
1. the control of expenditures;
2.  the prompt submission to CCDR of (i) requests for advances
to meet budgeted expenditures; and (ii) claims for
disbursement by external sources of financing.
(g) It will assist the CCDR to establish a monitoring and evaluation
system for the agriculture and livestock projects financed by IDA in the ORDs
which will be adequate to ascertain and evaluate the progress of the projects.
II.       In order to enable it to carry out the above responsibilities,
the Unit will be established initially in Bobo-Dioulasso and will be provided
with the staff, facilities and equipment necessary for this purpose.

Agriculture Extension Service
Introduction
1.        Agricultural extension work in the ORDs of Dedougou and Bobo-
Dioulasso is still in its early stage of development. In neither ORD is there
a defined Extension Service Department and hence no clear line of responsi-
bility exists. Extension work - i.e., information to farmers on improved
farming techniques -- is not really planned and only done if other admini-
strative functions have been carried out. Since working conditions for exten-
sion workers are difficult, salaries low, and basic educational standards for
appointment minimal, it is not surprising that, on average the level of the
agricultural extension work is poor. As is generally acknowledged, efficient
extension service is an important condition to improve the level of agricul-
ture and it is therefore imperative that, if agricultural standards in the
project area are to be improved, government's attitude toward extension work
should change, the extension services be reorganized, and extension agents
and their supervisors be thoroughly trained. Instead of financing indiscrimi-
nately all types of administrative functions in the ORD, the proposed project
will only finance activities directly related to agricultural extension
services.
Organization
2.        Under the present administrative set up of the Ministry of Rural
Development, the ORDs, which are responsible for regional development, have
a number of technical departments to coordinate development activities.
Agricultural activities related to field crops, horticulture, and livestock,
all dependent on extension work, are grouped under Economic Analysis and
Planning in the ORD Dedougou, and under Community Development in the ORD
Bobo-Dioulasso. Extension workers ("encadreurs") carry out the various
development activities, under the technical responsibility of the sector and
sub-sector chiefs. Under the proposed project, a special section of Extension
Services would be established, under the Department of Community Development
and equipped with specialized divisions. The line of responsibility for
extension work would follow the present set up through sectors, sub-sectors
and village centers (Table 1).
3.        The proposed section of Extension Services would be headed by a
chief (a general agriculturalist). An experienced extension service special-
ist would assist and be directly and fully responsible to the chief for the
successful implementation of the extension service reorganization and its
subsequent operation under the project. The section would be supported by



Annex £2
Page 2
(i) an audio-visual and publication unit; (ii) a training center; and (iii)
secretarial services. The section's staff would also comprise 3 subject
matter specialists: an agronomist, a livestock specialist and a horticul-
turist. Under the project, each sector chief would be assisted by an exten-
sion coordinator, who has to coordinate and supervise the extension activities
in 4 to 6 sub-sectors; besides that, he also has to liaise with the various
subject matter specialists on the field results of adaptive research. Each
sub-sector chief is responsible for about 6 extension agents, who together
cover 2,000 to 2,500 farm families.
4.        Though a population survey was carried out in (1974/75), official
data has not been released and the following average figures on the project
financed key personnel in extension service and the number of villages and
farm families it is anticipated to reach, are therefore only indicative.

Method of Operation
5.        The proposed operational approach is based on a systematic training
and visit program. Extension service management has to detail sufficiently
in advance a training program for everybody related to extension work,
from subject matter specialist to extension agent. Since not all farmers
can or should be reached, each agent would concentrate on a limited number



Annex 12
Page 3
of farmers selected from 4 tc 5 viLiages falling under his extension ser-
vice responsibilty. Farmers in these villages would be divided into 6
groups, each comprising 8 to 10 contact farmers, which the agent would visit
regularly, once every 2 weeks (Table 2). The contact farmers would be
selected on the basis of their willingness to cooperate with the extension
service in trying out new cultivation practices to increase their farm
income. By doing this they will serve as demonstrators and teachers for
others. The proposed system enables each extension worker to concentrate
on relatively small groups of farmers, to be visited on a pre-determined
day of the week; these fixed-schedule visits also enable close supervision.
Extension agents, however, should also be available for other farmers, who
seek their advice.
6.        As already mentioned, under the present system, the extension agent
has to deal with a host of non-extension activities such as: distribution
of production inputs, marketing of produce and recovery of outstanding debts.
It is proposed that the extension worker be gradually freed of these non-
extension activities and given the opportunity to devote more time to real
extension work. ORD Management should set a time table, and reorganize
its activities in such a way that for example at the start of the second
project year extension agents of one sector should devote full time to
extension work; at the beginning of the third year two more sectors should
follow, and during the fourth year all extension workers would be relieved
of non-extension activities.  During the fourth and fifth project years the
agent should devote full time to extension work, as the demand for extension
services should increase greatly. In the meantime, to separate regulatory
and input supply duties from extension work, 6 days out of 10 working days
in a two-week period would be fully devoted to extension visits to all
farmer's groups, one to training and the remaining 3 days to other duties.
Each agent should concentrate on no more than 2 to 3 crops in a given
season: one or two subsistence crops (sorghum, millet, or rice) and one
cash crop (cotton, groundnuts, or a vegetable). During each two-week period
he should emphasize only the most important cultivation practice or operation
for each crop (better seed, timely weeding, minimum use of fertilizers, etc.)
Advised and backed by the subject matter specialist, he should introduce
this new technology prudently by proposing to the contact farmer to try it
out only on a part of his field, until he is satisfied of the merits of the
recommendation.
Training
7.        To familiarize top and middle level staff with the new approach
to agricultural extension work, and to assure support for its implementation, an
orientation course of three to four weeks should be held in the early stage of
the project.   If this course could be held during the slack time in the spring,
it would have the additional advantage of planning for the next cropping
season as a training exercise. Subject matter specialists perform a key
function in the interrelation between research and field practice, and are of
crucial importance for the success of the proposed system. Since at present
no such group of specialists exists the department head and his extension



Annex 12
Page 4
specialist in each ORD are responsible for selection of their subject matter
specialists from the more experienced and outstanding sub-sector chiefs and
extension agents, and have them trained at the existing research stations,
such as: IRAT, IRCT and ICRISAT. 1/ These stations should be requested to
design special courses to improve practical knowledge of the various crops.
Since no more than 6 subject matter specialists are required, initial training
for them can be easily arranged at appropriate institutions.
8.        Sector and sub-sector chiefs are multi-functional, but should, in
the future, devote most of their time to guiding, supervising and training
extension agents. They will be involved in extension work planning and
supervision together with the department head and extension specialist and by
doing it they will acquire a more detailed knowledge of the new extension
service approach, the principles upon which it is based, the procedures by
which it operates and the message it is to convey. It is strongly suggested
however, that staff will follow at least one two-week training course per
year, and twice a year a two-day course on specific subjects. Each extension
agent should have followed a basic training of 9 months in the Agricultural
School at Matourkou or equivalent. For those who have not attended this
school, a basic training course should be planned, and carried out in collabo-
ration with Matourkou. In order to be well equipped to convey the message
during their two-weekly visits to contact farmers, all agents should attend,
together with their sub-sector chiefs, a special training day that will be
part of a two-week training and visit program. During these one-day training
sessions, the teachers would be subject matter specialists and specialists
from experimental stations. During the growing season two trips per year
should be planned to research stations and demonstration farms of contact
farmers. An indicative training program is in Table 3.
Training Facilities
9.        Under the project a main training center will be established in
the ORD Bobo-Dioulasso, and office facilities extended in ORD Dedougou.
The center in ORD Bobo-Dioulasso will have a total capacity to train and
lodge 60 trainees at a time. It is estimated that the center will be fully
occupied from December to March by the annual two-week refresher courses and
for the rest of the year about 50% occupied by the short two-day courses, by
monthly meetings and special agricultural activities. Audio-visual means will
complement the general training program and will be used during meetings in
the villages.

WEST VOLTA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Project Area Farm Population, Cropping Patterns and Yields
The Farm Population
1.        The project area is estimated to comprise some 88,000 farm families
or farms (Annex 3). Under the West Volta Cotton Project (CR 225-UV), exten-
sion agents exclusively concentrated on some 25,500 cotton farms located in the
regions most suitable for cotton growing: Center North and Center South.
Under the proposed project, the extension service in both ORDs covering
the project area would be reorganized and trained to cope with a much more
complicated integrated farm system, instead of a "single-crop" technology.
2.        It is assumed that about 66,500 farm families would be reached by
the extension service directly or indirectly (Annex 12), but that only about
70% or some 46,500 farms would adopt extension service activities in increased
yields; in the South, farmers' response is anticipated to be negligible on
the basis of past experience because of self-sufficiency in cereal and
unsuitability for cotton. The number of farms expected to be affected by
the extension service would be as follows:
North     Center North      Center South   TOTAL
Traditional Farmers                   3,000             2,100       5,100
Intermediate Farmers   10,000         9,750             6,800      26,550
Advanced Farmers                      2,250             1,600       3,850
New Farmers                           6,000             5,000      11,000
TOTAL              10,000      21,000            15,500       46,500
3.        The majority of the new farmers are expected to comprise migrant
Mossi, who, after a couple of years of subsistence farming, apply to the
extension service for assistance in cotton growing. New farmers are assumed
to enter the project as follows:

Cropping Patterns
4.        Continuously under the threat of a badly distributed rainfall,
farming in the project area is in the first place aimed at producing suf-
ficient cereals for subsistence. Where cereal production is more secure,
such as in the Center North and Center South, a cash crop with good market-
ing possibilities has, next to cereals, an important place in the cropping
pattern. Understandably, farmers in this drought prone area are reluctant
to change well-established cropping patterns and it is therefore anticipated
that cropping patterns will remain the same during the relatively short
project period. Also, since farm size and/or areas devoted to the various
crops per farm is mainly based on family labor, the use of which is deter-
mined by the peak labor requirements during soil preparation, crop care and
harvest, it is unlikely that these parameters would change during the proj-
ect period. An exception would be the new (migrant) farmers, who, with
additional family labor coming from the Mossi plateau (Annex 3), will add
1.9 ha cotton to their area under food crops. Included is a small area
devoted to other crops such as groundnuts, sesame and/or vegetables and the
general cropping pattern is as follows:
Cotton       Cereal        Others       Total
____________-----ha------------------
North               --          4.25          0.75       5.0
Center North       1.9          3.25         0.4         5.5
Center South       1.9          3.3          0.3         5.5
Yields
5.        Statistical series on cereal yields based on actual yield measure-
ments do not exist. Fortunately, however, Government and various officials
are becoming increasingly convinced of the need for reliable basic data for
planning, and last year the ORD Dedougou started to collect yield data.
These figures, verified against yield estimates by experienced extension
agents and information available from IRAT research workers, are the basis
for the present cereal yield estimates. Extension agents in cotton areas
are the more reliable sources because, as they make their regular yield



Annex 13
Page 3
estimates for cotton, they have gradually gained a better knowledge of cereal
production and consequently of cereal yields on farms where cotton is also grown.
Future yields are mainly based on experiments carried out by IRAT at farm level,
while testing the selected varieties. Since basic data are completely insuf-
ficient to present more detailed breakdowns -- such as percentages of farmers
adopting various yield improving techniques at various stages -- each group of
farmers is presented as one group, representing one average yield. Under the
West Volta cotton project average cotton yields in kg/ha over the project period
are as follows:
PYI    PY2    PY3    PY4    PY5
West Volta Cotton Project           670    557   713      882     820
Increase over PYI               (100)   (83) (106)  (132)    (122)
6.        Yield increases of cereals, mainly a combination of sorghum and millet
are due to a wider use of pure, higher yielding local varieties, more in particular
the sorghum variety: Grofing, and for millet: M12. The use of pure seed together
with the adoption of the correct planting dates (June 5 to 25) and appropriate plant
density, would make yields of 1,000 - 1,300 kg/ha for millet and 1,500 - 1,700 kg/ha
for sorghum well attainable at farm level. Taking into account a 30% reduction for
less favourable weather conditions, expected yield increases are as follows:

Annex 13

7.        Cotton yields are regularly recorded by CFDT over a number of
years and therefore are better known than cereal yields. It is recognized,
however, that recommended inputs such as 55 kg cotton seed per hectare or 100
kg compound fertilizer (NPS: 18, 35, 7, Borax) and 4 sprayings of pesticides
are too global to produce the optimum results under the wide variety of soils,
the capricious weather conditions, and different cultivation practices. The
estimated future yields under the various assumptions as shown below are
therefore indicative only. The assumptions are the following:
(i) Of the two major cotton regions, the Center North has on the
average less favorable soils and rainfall distribution than the
Center South, and therefore most cotton farmers in the Center
South are better off and can afford paying for inputs on the
average of one year earlier than their colleagues in the Center
North.
(ii) Traditional farmers use neither fertilizers, nor insecticides
and are not expected to use them during the project period.
Yield increases are expected to come only in the third project
year when extension service advice with regard to timely seeding
and weeding and appropriate plant density are gradually adopted
by the farmers;
(iii)  Intermediate farmers already familiar with the beneficial effect
of compound fertilizers (50 kg/ha) and insecticides (3.75 1)
will increase their fertilizer and insecticide use to applications
of 100 kg and 7.5 1 per hectare respectively. Extension service
advice concerning better cultivation practices is anticipated to
affect average yields one year earlier than with the traditional
farmers;
(iv)  Advanced farmers already apply the recommended 100 kg compound
fertilizer and 10 i of insecticide (4 sprayings) and, already hav-
ing attained high yield levels of 1630 kg/ha in the Center North
and 1800 kg/ha in the Center South, no more than a modest 6 to
7% yield increase is anticipated over the project period;
(v) Finally, the New Farmers are assumed to enter the project as
soon as they request extension service assistance, which is
anticipated to be for cotton growing since they are already
doing better than average in cereal production. Together with
the seeds (55 kg/ha) they will receive insecticides (3.75 1) for
the minimum 3 sprayings; the use of insecticides is assumed to
increase to 7.50 1/ha in the Center South because of a higher
incidence of insect attacks. Fertilizers at an average rate of
50 kg/ha are assumed to be used in PY2 in the Center South
increasing to 100 kg/ha, whereas in the Center North fertilizer
use is expected to start in PY3 with 50 kg/ha and to remain
at that level for the rest of the project period. Estimated
yield increases are presented below and phasing and quantity
of input use is in Table 1.

ANNEX 19

UPPER-VOLTA
WEST VOLTA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Rage of Return Calculation:
Underlying Assumptions
General
1.            As the proposed project aims at introducing more advanced cotton
production technologies and would encompass cereal production as well as new
farmers, the full administrative and extension cost of the projecthas been
assumed as needed to bring about incremental output, and total costs have
been included in the rate of return calculation. The benefits included are
those stemming from the introduction of such measures, i.e., they are incre-
mental to the present level of output.
Prices
2.            All project produce has bean valued at the farmgate level except
for cotton, which has been valued ex-ginnery. IBRD price forecasts have been
used to calculate the economic value of cotton, dryland cereals and rice pro-
duction (Annex 15), while vegetables have been valued at current producer prices.
Cotton Ginning
3.            Project production would exceed the capacity of the ginnery to
be constructed under the project and hence would be processed partly in
existing ginneries. Project costs therefore include: a) construction costs
for the new ginnery in the years in which these are accrued; b) operating
costs of the new ginnery; and c) operating costs of existing ginneries in-
cluding amortization as far as it concerns produce from the project.
Recurrent Costs
4=            In calculating recurrent costs of all administrative services
(MRD, FAU, ORDs, Training program, Women's activities) after project
completion, i.e., from 1982 onvards, it has been assumed that cost levels
would be basically the same as during the project but without the need for
expatriate assistance, as all expatriates would have been replaced by local
personnel by that time.



ANNEX 19
Page 2
Operation and Maintenance
5.        0 and M costs have been assumed at 10% of construction cost
annually, taking into account that recurrent floods could easily damage
the simple irrigation schemes that would be built, making a high level of
maintenance necessary.
Family Labor
6.        The project would tend to increase the demand for labor at peak
seasons during the year (land preparation, seeding, weeding and harvesting
times). -All family labor needed for project production has therefore
been costed at current average wage rates for farm labor in the project
area, amounting to 150 CFAF per day.
