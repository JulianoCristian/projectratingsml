is to use for irrigation the numerous small rivers\n            located throughout the State where large scale irrigation or\n            groundwater development is not possible, and to modernize\n            existing medium irrigation projects in Gujarat. The project\n            will also improve the data base for planning future\n            irrigation projects in the State. The project consists of:\n            (a) construction, over a five year period, of medium\n            irrigation projects, covering about 63,000 ha throughout the\n            State; (b) modernization of existing medium irrigation\n            projects, covering about 55,000 ha, in order to bring them\n            up to the technical standards agreed for new projects; (c)\n            establishment of a network of automatic discharge measuring\n            stations; (d) carrying out of monitoring and evaluation studies."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
