                         Implementation Status Overview
                          Following the Bank's exit from the pooled fund in July 2009, the Project is managed separately by the Ministry of Basic Education. Disbursements stand at 76% of the initial credit
                         and at 41% of the Additional Fund as of September 2010. In June 2010, the Bank and the Government agreed to cancel US$10 million of the total project budget, because several
                         project activities were not likely to be completed by the end of the project based on estimated time required to adequately complete procurement procedures. Accordingly, the
                         Government prepared a revised action plan. However, the project review during the last supervision mission in October 2010 highlighted that even with the revised action plan; the

                         Government will not be able to complete several activities before the closing date of March 31, 2011 due to weak capacity of the implementing unit. Given that the project has been
                         effective for almost 8 years (since 2002) and disbursement has been slow in the recent past, the Bank is not in favor of another full extension of the closing date. Along with the

                         and the government agreed to continue carrying out activities for which no-objection from IDA is acquired and contracts are already signed.
