The project has been\n            under implementation for over 8 years, but disbursement has\n            been slow in the recent past and several project activities\n            are not likely to be completed before the closing date of\n            June 30, 2011. The Government thus requested the partial\n            cancellation of U$$16.0 million from the original credit and\n            additional credit for reallocation to various projects which\n            are currently under preparation."}, "docdt": "2011-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
