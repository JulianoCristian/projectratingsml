The closing date for the project and its\n            additional financing will be extended from March 31, 2011 to\n            June 30, 2011. In 2006, the project was restructured to\n            participate in a pooled funding mechanism to help MEBA\n            manage and harmonize donor interventions in the education\n            sector and accelerate project implementation. However, slow\n            implementation and issues of misprocurement led to the\n            Bank's decision in 2008 to withdraw from the pooled\n            fund and revert to a stand-alone implementation mode. To\n            offset the rising cost of food and help the government\n            tackle issues of school-based quality improvements and\n            teacher support, an additional financing of Special Drawing\n            Rights (SDR) 9.20 million was processed. Since then,\n            International Development Agency (IDA) has provided\n            intensive support to the government to improve and\n            accelerate implementation, with modest success, so that in\n            June 2010, the Bank and the government drafted a revised\n            implementation plan focused on activities that: (a) can be\n            realistically achieved within the remaining lifetime of the\n            project; (b) will have the greatest impact on achieving the\n            Project Development Objectives (PDO); and (c) can ensure\n            satisfactory project outcomes."}, "docdt": "2011-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
