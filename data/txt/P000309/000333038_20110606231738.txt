            BASIC EDUCATION SECTOR PROJECT (P000309/P110642)

                               RESTRUCTURING PAPER

SUMMARY
This paper seeks approval from the Country Director for a partial cancellation of the credit
of the Burkina Faso Basic Education Sector Project; so as to allow for a re-allocation of the
cancelled IDA amounts to new grants to Burkina Faso (Recipient) that are being presented
to the Executive Directors this FY. The project has been under implementation for over 8
years, but disbursement has been slow in the recent past and several project activities are
not likely to be completed before the closing date of June 30, 2011. The Government thus
requested the partial cancellation of US$16.0 million from the Original Credit and
Additional Credit for reallocation to various projects which are currently under preparation.


PROJECT STATUS
The project development objective is to assist the Recipient in its efforts to implement the
Program, which includes: (i) improving access to, and quality of, basic education; (ii)
strengthening the education sector’s financial sustainability; and (iii) enhancing the
financial management, budgeting, procurement, monitoring, evaluation and donor
coordination of Ministry of Basic Education and Literacy (MEBA). The original credit for
P000309 (Cr. 3597-BUR) is in the amount of SDR 25.6 million (US$32.6 million
equivalent), and the Original Financing Agreement became effective on October 28, 2002.
The original closing date was December 31, 2006, which was first extended to June 30,
2008 and then extended for a second time to June 30, 2011. The additional financing (Cr.
4473-BUR) is in the amount of SDR 9.2 million (US$15 million equivalent) and became
effective on December 17, 2008. As of May 15, 2011, the overall disbursement of Cr.
3597-BUR and Cr. 4473-BUR stands at 75.7 percent and 40.8 percent respectively.

In 2006, the project was restructured to participate in a pooled funding mechanism to help
MEBA manage and harmonize donor interventions in the education sector and accelerate
project implementation. However, slow implementation and issues of misprocurement led
to the Bank’s decision in 2008 to withdraw from the pooled fund and revert to separate
financing. To offset the rising cost of food and help the government tackle issues of school-
based quality improvement and teacher support, the additional financing of SDR 9.20
million was processed. Since then, IDA has provided intensive support to the government
to improve and accelerate implementation, with modest success, so that in June 2010, the
Bank and the government drafted a revised implementation plan focused on activities that:
(i) can be realistically achieved within the remaining lifetime of the project; (ii) will have
the greatest impact on achieving the Project Development Objectives (PDO); and (iii) can
ensure satisfactory project outcomes.



                                              4
However, progress was not sufficient and an assessment confirmed that many of the
identified activities included in the revised action plan of June 2010 could not be completed
by the closing date. The government thus requested an extension of six months, which was
reduced to three months to June 30, 2011 due to a three-year time limit imposed on
Additional Financing by OP 13.20.

Given that the three month extension would only allow for a limited number of activities to
be completed, the Bank’s team and the government agreed on the following actions: (i)
process an extension of three months to allow for an orderly closure of the project; (ii)
complete those activities which can be completed by June 30, 2011; and (iii) cancel part of
the credit for re-commitment to a new operation. The extension of the Project was recently
processed in a separate Restructuring Paper (Report No. 60517-BF). This Restructuring
Paper thus only covers the partial cancellation.

Overall, progress towards the PDO achievement and the IP rating are moderately
satisfactory. The PDO is achieved. Based on 2011 data, all four PDO indicators are
achieved.

The government is committed to wrap up the project in an orderly fashion and has already
completed the reimbursement of the amount of US$2 million declared misprocured. The
government has also confirmed that it is in the process of addressing the previously
identified accountability issues and that it will make every effort to support completion of
ongoing activities within the next three months. There are no outstanding audits for the
project and there are no safeguards issues since no further school construction is planned.

PROPOSED CHANGES
Partial Cancellation: The Government has requested the cancellation of a total equivalent
of US$16.0 million from both the original and additional financings, as these resources will
not be able to be used for Project activities before the closing date. The Government
requested that the amounts cancelled be recommitted to other projects currently under
preparation that may be able to benefit from additional funding. Pursuant to the IDA
General Conditions, the Recipient is entitled at any time to cancel by notice any amount
that remains unwithdrawn of the Credit (subject to any amounts that are subject to special
commitments). The Recipient is, therefore, exercising its right under the General
Conditions, and the Bank is agreeing, by approving this RP, to allow the recommitment of
the funds to new activities that are consistent the CAS instead of returning the funds back
to the general pool of IDA in accordance with the Investment Lending Reform approved by
the Executive Directors on October 22, 2009.

Project Scope: Notwithstanding the cancellations, the Project, which is part of a larger
Government sector program, will continue to be implemented, although some of the Project
activities will not be completed by the closing date. The cancellation will therefore likely
not affect the Project scope or description. Activities which will have been partially
implemented by the closing date but will continue to be implemented consist of school
feeding and school health activities, certain school construction activities; and school
supplies.


                                             5
The task team will assess the impact of this partial cancellation during the project closing
mission in a few weeks and will reconfirm at that time whether there is a need for any
reduction in the scope of the Project or restructuring of the project description.

The partial cancellation of the credit complies with OP 13.50 (Cancellations) and the
recommitment of funds to other projects within the country’s IDA envelope complies with
the new IL Reform rules approved in October 2009.
