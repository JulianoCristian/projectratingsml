7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The proposed project will provide support for the Government’s Basic Education Ten-Year Program which
is designed to be implemented in three phases the first of which covers the period 2001-2005. The main
development objective of Phase I of the Ten Year Program is to lay the foundation for accelerating the
development of basic education, while ensuring adequate quality and financial sustainability. Further, to
prepare for a shift from project to programmatic support, the Bank’s assistance will also aim to build the
capacity of the Ministry of Basic Education (MEBA) with particular attention to the areas of financial
management, budgeting, procurement, monitoring, evaluation and donor coordination. Key performance
indicators are described in Part A, para. 2 of the PAD.
