                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Following IDA financed project exit from the pooled fund in July 2009, the Project has been managed separately by the Ministry of Basic Education. As of May 15, 2011, the overall
                         disbursement of the initial credit and additional credit was 76 percent and 41 percent respectively. The project has been under implementation for over 8 years, but disbursement has
                         been slow since the exit from the pooled fund and several project activities were not likely to be completed by the end of the project. Therefore, the Bank and the Government agreed
                         first to extend the project closing date from March 31, 2011 to June 30, 2011 to allow completion of some activities and for an orderly closure of the project. The Government

                         Although several planned activities such as construction of schools, purchase of food for school feeding activities were not implemented, the PDO has been achieved, according to
                         2011 school year data. This reflects the fact that the project is part of the wider program of government whose implementation compensates for the delay or cancellation of some
                         activities.
