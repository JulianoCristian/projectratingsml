to implement the ten-year program. In\n            addition, the Government of Burkina Faso (GoBF) has\n            requested that the Bank supports the implementation of a\n            targeted safety net program through school feeding program\n            to mitigate dropout risks in a time of food crisis due to\n            rising prices and exogenous shocks. The additional financing\n            will provide the opportunity to target vulnerable areas\n            which have been affected by recent flood and where children\n            are likely to dropout from school and parents less willing\n            to invest in children's schooling. The targeted\n            intervention will support the program's objectives\n            through a school feeding program intended for about 200,000\n            children, which will reduce considerably dropout and\n            repetition rate, as it will increase gross intake rate in\n            first grade in these areas. Additional activities are\n            therefore necessary, and have been planned by Government. At\n            present, the GoBF is unable to provide sufficient funding to\n            finance the proposed activities, particularly school-based\n            quality improvement and teacher support, as well as school\n            feeding programs, whose impact on access and retention of\n            poor children in primary school is high. Hence, additional\n            financing from the Bank is essential to help consolidate and\n            expand gains in order to meet the program development objectives."}, "docdt": "2008-05-06T00:00:00Z"}
