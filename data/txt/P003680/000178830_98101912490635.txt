1. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Setting
1.01      Fiji is a small country comptising about 300 islands in the South
Pacific. Most of them are uninhabited. About 70% of the'total population of
about 600,000 resides on the main island - Viti Levu. Annual per capita
income is estimated at US$1,440./1 Sugar and tourism are the mainstays of the
economy. The country has a good natural and human resource base and political
stability. Economic growth during the next few years is predicted at about
5%.
1.02      The electricity sector is fairly well developed; per capita consump-
tion being about 500 kWh per annum. The development is concentrated in Viti
Levu which accounts for over 95% of the national total. The sector serves
predominantly commercial, small industrial (tourism) and domestic users.
Electricity tariffs are high (F9.4¢ per kWh, 1979 average) and imports of
fuel oil constitute a heavy drain on the country's foreign exchange reserves
(para. 1.03).
Energy Resources and Government Policy
1.03      Fiji has no known indigenous sources of commercial energy other than
its hydroelectric potential (para. 1.04). All commercial energy is derived
from imported fuel. The largest single category of petroleum fuel used at
present is industrial diesel oil used for electricity generation. At late
1979 prices, these purchases amount to F$16.0 million-annually (about 30% of
total net imports). Apart from the high cost, Fiji has also recently begun to
experience shortages of fuel supplies.
Hydroelectric Resources
1.04      Substantial water-power resources exist in the Nandrau plateau of
Viti Levu, a virtually. uninhabited area of about 600 sq km lying at an average
altitude of 1,000m and subject to annual rainfall varying from 2,700 mm to
4,000 mm (see map).  Investigations carried out since 1973 have shown that
the available potential in Viti Levu is about 2,000 GWh (annual) of which
about 80% could be economically developed.  Compared to this the total
electricity production is 300 GWh growing at an average rate of 6-7% per year.
The country's available water-power resources could be depended upqn to
sustain growth of electricity supply until about the end of the century.
Attempts to harness this potential commenced in 1977 (para. 1.05). Systematic
investigations of identified potential sites are being carried out actively
according to their economic priorities.
/1 1979 World Bank Atlas - preliminary estimate for 1978.



-2-
1.05      Based on the recommendations of an Alternative Fuels Technical
Committee in 1973, the Government adopted an energy policy, inter alia, of
utilizing domestic rather than imported energy resources for electricity
generation. Investigations and studies started at that time culminated in
1977 in identification of the 40 MW Monasavu-Wailoa Hydroelectric Project as
the most appropriate first step in implementing this policy. It is now being
constructed with the assistance of Loan 1596-FIJ of 1978. The studies also
outlined a 25-year all hydroelectric development program as most appropriate
for the long-term. Subsequent increases in oil prices have confirmed these
conclusions and emphasized the urgency of replacing diesel generation as early
as possible. Commissioning of Fiji's first hydroelectric station is expected
by end 1981, on schedule. The development program would largely eliminate the
use of diesel oil for electricity generation in Viti Levu as early as 1983.
1.06      The program described in para. 1.05 above requires (a) investment on
an unprecedented scale for Fiji especially during the first five years when
the diesel generation system is being replaced; and (b) a sound institutional
and financial framework. In 1978, the Government reiterated the high priority
it accorded to its energy policy by: (a) approving the Fiji Electricity
Authority (FEA)'s development program in principle; (b) integrating the
electricity sector into a single and more efficient operation under the FEA
(paras. 1.07 and 2.04); and (c) allowing tariffs to be increased about 40X
in the Suva metropolitan area. A number of development finance institutions
apart from the Bank - the Australian Development Assistance Bureau (ADAB), the
European Investment Bank (EIB), the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC)
of the UK, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) indicated their support both
for the Monasavu-Wailoa (Power I) project and the long-term program by joining
in an extensive co-financing operation in 1978. Progress on construction of
the first Bank project has been satisfactory (para. 2.21 and Annex 4). It
augurs well for the success of the entire program.
The Electricity Sector
1.07      Structure.  Until 1978, there were two public supply agencies in
the country - the Suva City Council and the FEA. Integration of these two
agencies had been under consideration for several years and it was brought
about during discussions of the Bank's loan 1596-FIJ (para. 2.04). The PEA
is now the sole public supply authority in Fiji. It has an aggregate
generating capacity of 85 MW and accounts for about 75% of the total elec-
tricity production in the country. The balance is generated by two auto-
generation plants viz. the Tavua Power Company (TPC) - a subsidiary of the
Emperor Gold Mine (EGM) company and the Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC).
1.08      Privately-Owned Systems.  The TPC operates an old 10.5 MW diesel
power station at Vatukoula which supplies the gold mine, company houses and
a sawmill. Half of the generating capacity has already operated well over
100,000 hours. TPC generates about 40 GWh annually.



- 3 -
1.09      FSC has plant installations aggregating 11.8 MW at four separate
mills located at Lautoka, Ba, Raki Raki and Lambassa (Vanua Levu). They
operate mainly on cane waste (bagasse) with back-pressure steam turbines and
some diesel generation to meet out of season requirements. The total annual
generation is about 30 GWh.
1.10      Access to Service.  Out of Viti Levu's population of 425,000, about
half live in urban or suburban areas in some 35,000 households. They are con-
centrated in Suva-Nausori area (65%) and eight other townships around the
island. It is estimated that about half the population has access to
electricity. In most areas of the country which have been electrified, supply
is presently adequate. Reliability of supply is satisfactory. Transmission
and distribution losses are reasonable (about 9%). Early extension of
electricity supply to other islands than Viti Levu and rural areas is an
important sector objective.
1.11      Rural Electrification.  Rural electrification (RE) is being under-
taken both by FEA and by the Public Works Department (PWD) of the Ministry of
Communications, Works and Tourism.
1.12      FEA's role in the field of RE has been to provide electricity to
customers outside its established area of supply through extensions from its
grid and to establish public supplies in new areas only where this is proven
to be economic. The prospective community or customer is required to deposit
40% of the estimated capital cost of the connection initially which FEA
retains for five years. The customer has to guarantee a minimum annual reve-
nue equal to 20% of the total capital cost; if this takes place the deposit is
refunded. If the use is less than the minimum revenue over a five-year period
the deposit is forfeited in full. In the past, FEA's average annual connec-
tion rate of rural customers has been about 350. It increased to about 1,000
last year.
1.13      The PWD RE program tries to reach rural dwellings in remote areas
where connections would be entirely unprofitable for FEA. Supply is arranged
through isolated diesel generating sets. Prospective customers have to pro-
vide one-sixth of the estimated capital cost on a non-refundable basis and the
Government contributes the balance as a grant. The operating charge to the
customer consists of an annual fee of F$100 per dwelling for maintenance plus
the actual cost of fuel. After a slow start in 1974/75, PWD's program has
recently gained some momentum and so far about 600 dwellings have been elec-
trified, but increasing costs of imported fuel seriously limit expansion of
this program.
1.14      Fiji's Seventh Development Plan (1976-80) recognizes the need for
rural electrification and stresses the importance of utilizing local energy
resources including small-scale hydroelectric potential, organic waste, solar
and wind energy. It allocated US$420,000 for research and US$1.1 million for
implementation of rural electrification schemes. Larger amounts are expected



to be allotted for these purposes under the Eighth Development Plan (1981-85).
Implementaton of the Second Power Project will enable further acceleration in
the pace of rural electrification in the country.
Bank's Role and Sector Lending Strategy
1.15      The Bank's role in the sector aims to:  (i) enable Fiji to meet its
electricty requirements from hydro sources thus stabilizing electricity costs
and achieving valuable savings in foreign exchange expenditures; (ii) assist
in building up a sound national entity; and (iii) ensure that the benefits
from these actions are extended as rapidly as possible to rural and other
areas hitherto beyond reach of electricity supply. The proposed Second Power
Project would enable the Bank to support a sound energy policy and continue
its institution-building role, particularly in strengthening FEA',s management
and training, improvement of its financial statements and accounts and
establishing appropriate financial performance targets.
2. THE BORROWEPR
Legislative Background
2.01      The Borrower, FEA, was established as a statutory authority by an
ordinance (No. 20 of 1966) under the Electricity Act in order to ensure
development of electricity supply at reasonable prices. FEA has sole
responsibility for electricity supply in Fiji, which it can discharge either
by setting up and operating its own installations or through issue of licenses
over which it has complete control. The ordinance ensures FEA's autonomy in
all matters including determination of its tariffs, raising financial
resources and employment of staff. The basic weaknesses in the legislation
are that it does not: (a) provide the general manager with any statutory
functions or powers (para. 2.02); and (b) establish the principle of a
rate-of-return objective for its financial operations.
2.02      During discussions of the First Power Project, the Board of the FEA
resolved that the then general manager should exercise administrative control
over the officers, employees and affairs of the Authority, in accordance with
such guidelines as are laid down from time to time by the Board. The chairman
then authorized the general manager to do so. Recent changes in incumbency of
both the posts of the chairman and the general manager have reversed this
arrangement. The Bank informed FEA and the Government that transfer of
adequate powers for day-to-day administration and control of staff by the
present chairman of FEA to the general manager would be crucial for successful
implementation of the project. In the long-term, the situation can be
corrected only by appropriate changes in the Act, which Government had
originally agreed and is expected to make soon as part of more comprehensive
revisions which include incorporation of a financial rate-of-return



-5-
revisions which include incorporation of a financial rate-of-return
requirement. An assurance was obtained that FEA will take appropriate steps
by September 30, 1980 to grant necessary authority to the general manager over
the officers, employees and day-to-day affairs of the FEA.
Facilities
2.03      FEA started its first diesel power station at Lautoka, in 1966,
with a nucleus of staff transferred from the PWD. Later, it took over and
expanded three privately-owned power stations at Singatoka, Nandi and
Lambassa and established some new stations. Addition of a major station at
Vunda in 1977 increased FEA's generating capacity to 32 MW. Its transmission
(33/11 kV) and distribution (11/0.4 kV) systems cover the western areas of
the Viti Levu island (Map IBRD 13266R) and the other smaller islands.
2.04      In 1978, FEA took over the electricity department of the Suva City
Council (SCCED). This Council had introduced electricity supply in Fiji in
1920 and gradually built up a total installed generating capacity of 53 MW
with a compact distribution system in the metropolis and its environs. In
recent years, however, SCCED suffered from bad management, poor maintenance
of equipment, inadequate training, and little forward planning. The
takeover by FEA in mid-1978 was recommended by the Bank (para. 1.07). It was
orderly and swift and most of the deficiencies noted above have since been
substantially remedied reflecting considerable credit on FEA's management.
2.05      FEA's generating facilities are listed in Annex 1.  Its ten diesel
power stations have an aggregate effective capacity of about 85 MW. About
half of these installations will have outlived their normal utility by the
mid-eighties. FEA serves about 35,000 consumers through a fairly extensive
33 kV and 11 kV transmission and distribution system (see map). By mid-
1980, a 132 kV transmission line, currently under construction with finan-
cial assistance of the ADB, will link the eastern and western areas of the
country and it will be the main transmission route conveying hydroelectric
energy to the demand centers.
Organization and Management
The Authority
2.06      The Authority consists of a chairman, a deputy chairman, and five
members, all of whom are appointed by the Minister of Communications, Works
and Tourism to whom FEA reports. The senior partner of a commercial firm in
Fiji presently functions as chairman. The permanent secretary of the
Ministry of Communications, Works and Tourism and the deputy secretary,
Ministry of Finance are the two official members; others are drawn from the
private sector. The chairman and members work on a part-time basis.

The Staff
2.07      Day-to-day manabement iS performed by staff appointed by the FEA
and headed by a general manager. Since the Bank appraised the first power
project, FEA's sta:if has increased from about 500 to 1,350 due to: (a)
takeover of SCCED on July 24, 1978; and (b) the Government's decision in March
1978, agreed to by the Bank to construct the Monasavu Dam and project
infrastructure by force account. The deployment of staff is shown below:
Administration                      38
Engineering - Planning              31
Generation         231
Distribution       432
Power Systems                       71
Finance                            104
Special Project Division          415
Training                            28
2.08      The increase in staff has not been accompanied by any major reorga-
nization of FEA's top management structure although the post of chief engineer
in Suva was abolished in 1978. Management is aware that there is a degree of
overstaffing mainly on generation and distribution in the Suva area. Steps
are being taken to reduce the staff particularly in areas where the develop-
ment of hydroelectric generation will make them redundant.
2.09      There were significant changes in the top management of the FEA
during 1979 due to: (a) the replacement of the former Minister (Finance) as
chairman FEA and (b) localization of the post of general manager on the
termination of the contract of the former general manager. The new general
manager is a former deputy secretary of the Ministry of Communications, Works
and Tourism and has administrative experience. However, in view of his
limited experience in the field of electricity development and utility
practice and the magnitude of the ongoing development program, the Bank felt
that the general manager should be assisted by a director (hydro projects),
experienced in all aspects of implementation of such a program. The FEA Board
and Government agreed and appointed a director acceptable to the Bank.
2.10      The appointment of a chief financial executive which has also been
recently advertised internationally is equally important. It was in fact a
condition of an Asian Development Bank loan that the post would be filled by
about end-1979. The position is urgently required to improve FEA's financial
management and to represent PEA in its approaches to international lenders.
Since negotiations FEA have made an appointment to this position.
2.11      FEA has recently appointed management consultants, Price Waterhouse
and Co. to review its management accounting and reporting systems. The study
is being financed by FEA and is expected to be completed and implemented
before the end of 1981. In addition to the main task, the consultants will



-7-
review the working of the Special Project Division (SPD) of the FEA (paras.
3-5, Annex 4) and make recommendations on the delegation of power to the
general manager on a long-term basis. Finally, they are expected to comment
on the adequacy of the FEA's organization to meet its needs after the first
hydro power station is commissioned. FEA agreed to review the consultants'
recommendations on its management accounting and reporting systems with the
Bank.
PEA Enquiry Committee
2.12      Arising out of criticisms of FEA's training program in April 1979
(para. 2.14) the Government set up an enquiry committee with comprehensive
terms of reference covering FEA's organizational structure and management, its
autonomy and responsiveness to the public, its construction program and its
operations. It is not expected that the committee's enquiry would result in
any radical organizational changes. The Government agreed to review with the
Bank the recommendations of the enquiry committee.
Training
2.13      In 1976, FEA established its own training program, with facilities
for in-house and on-the-job training. It concentrated on the requirements at
subprofessional level up to that of assistant engineer and aimed at training
about 130 technicians and about 25 assistant engineers by 1986. Over the
last three years, FEA has established an excellent training capability for
providing the specialized orientation, retraining and upgrading programs made
necessary by the expansion of the power system and the move from diesel to
hydro generation.
2.14      During 1979, FEA's training program was reviewed at high governmen-
tal level when it was felt that it could be integrated with the Fiji Institute
of Technology's (FIT's) ongoing programs to better utilize the facilities
established at Ba and achieve economies in expenditure. The enquiry committee
appointed by Government (para. 2.12) suggested that FEA's training center be
moved in its entirety to Ba. As this would have been a retrograde develop-
ment, an alternative that was suggested by the Bank was that equipment on
order for FEA's proposed mechanical training workshop be installed at FIT's
center at Ba and that these facilities be used by FEA for this part of its
training program. This has been accepted.
2.15      Although Bank financing has not previously been requested to assist
with FEA's training efforts, the time is now opportune for such support, par-
ticularly as it applies to the foreign exchange requirement associated with
training abroad of Fijian nationals for operating and maintaining the new
Wailoa generating station; upgrading and equipping the FEA's linemen's school
to enable staff to work on the new 132 kV transmission system, and training of
selected staff in FEA in computer programming, simple systems analysis and the



- 8 -
operation of a new accounting system. A sum of US$300,000 is included in the
proposed loan to meet these training requirements. A detailed program was
discussed and finalized during negotiations.
Accounts and Audit
2.16      About November each year, the FEA prepares its annual budget for
the approval of the Board of Directors. It also prepares financial state-
ments at the end of each fiscal year which are subsequently included in its
annual report to the Minister. Under the Act, the FEA is required to present
its audited accounts to the Board as soon as practicable.
2.17      FEA is making good progress in transferring its basic accounting
function to a computer bureau based in Suva. Customer billing, payroll and
job costing are already computerized while plans are in hand to transfer the
general ledger, inventory control and the SPD's functions to the computer.
Although FEA's basic bookkeeping appears to be good, the form of presentation
of its accounts makes it difficult to establish a figure for operating income
(for calculation of FEA's rate of return) for the following reasons:
(a) non-operating income and expenditure is not separated from
operating items;
(b) procedures for allocation of overheads between capital, operations
and work carried out for Government do not appear to be consistently
applied and need to be reviewed;
(c) material adjustments made after calculating the profit for the
year are not apportioned between capital, operations and work
carried out for Government thus further distorting the results for
the year.
2.18      During the appraisal FEA indicated that the above matters would
be reviewed by its consultants Price, Waterhouse and Co. as part of their
study (para. 2.11). This was confirmed during negotiations.
2.19      In the first power loan (Loan 1596-FIJ), FEA agreed to submit its
audit report to the Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year. Its
auditors, Messrs. Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co. have completed the audit
for 1978 but it was not signed until December 1979. The delay was due to
FEA's wish to make adequate provision for any contingency which might
arise out of the dispute over ownership of land on which the Kinoya power
station is located. This dispute was considered by the Privy Council and
a decision favorable to FEA was given in mid-December 1979. While the
auditor's reports have been comprehensive and are generally appropriate, they
do not include an income statement which clearly shows FEA's operating income
and expenditures. In addition, FEA's balance sheets do not show the accumu-
lated depreciation; only net fixed asset values are exhibited therein. At



- 9 -
negotiations, FEA agreed to submit its annual financial statements to the Bank
(including an income statement and in the case of the balance sheet
identifying the provision for depreciation) audited by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell
and Co. or other independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank within six
months of the end of its fiscal year. The undertakings to submit an income
statement and to identify the provision for depreciation are recorded in a
supplemental letter.
Insurance
2.20      FEA has arranged a comprehensive insurance program through Bowring
Burgess an international firm - for which in 1979 it paid F$200,000 to cover
its operating risks and F$157,000 to cover works under construction. The main
coverage is for fire on buildings, plant and stock and for workers' compen-
sation. FEA is presently considering the insurance company's advice that it
should additionally cover fire following earthquakes or caused by riots or
strikes, which are now excluded. FEA is also considering other recommendations
to reduce its risks. FEA will also need to review its coverage on its diesel
power stations which would mostly be shut down after 1982. During negotia-
tions, FEA undertook to take appropriate action on the above by December 31,
1980 and this undertaking was also recorded in a supplemental letter.
Performance on the First Power Prolect
2.21      The Borrower's performance during the period 1977-1979 has been up
to the high expectations at appraisal. On the institution building aspect,
the smooth, efficient, and speedy takeover of the SCCED has been remarkable.
In regard to project implementation FEA management has been sensitive to both
timing of activities and costs. The SPD was built up from scratch to an
organization which all concerned, including the SBC, now feel can accomplish
the original objective of completing the dam by end 1981. This must also be
recognized as a very good effort.
3. THE MARKET AND SUPPLY
Consumption Trends
3.01      Several power market surveys have been carried out and updated since
1973. They were initiated by ENEX of New Zealand Incorporated (ENEX) and
continued during 1977 by Merz and McLellan (M/M) who have been associated with
Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners (Gibb) - the main consulting engineer for
FEA's development program and the hydroelectric projects. The latest update
was carried out during mid-1979.
Past
3.02      During the period 1969 to 1978, the demand for electricity in Viti
Levu grew at an average annual rate of about 10% as seen from the table



- 10 -
below. The growth in domestic consumption and industry (small and medium)
and commerce has been similar, with the latter showing a marginally higher
growth rate:
GROWTH OF CONSUMPTION
Domestic    Commercial and       Total       Total
sales     industrial sales   sales /a  sent out   Losses
-------------------------- (GWh) ---------------------------
1970        20.1             61.6           81.7        88.8   7.1 (8.0%)
1971        23.8             69.9           93.7       101.8   8.1 (8.0%)
1972        28.1             80.3          108.4       117.6   9.2 (7.8%)
1973        32.1             89.7          121.8       132.3  10.5 (7.9%)
1974        32.1             92.7          124.8       135.6  10.8 (8.0%)
1975        35.3            103.7          139.0       150.8  11.8 (7.8%)
1976        38.5            116.6          155.1       168.9  13.8 (9.9%)
1977        41.8            125.6          167.4       182.3  14.9 (8.2%)
1978        43.8            138.6          182.4       198.0  15.6 (7.9%)
/a Average annual sales growth 10.5%.
3.03      The average rate of growth was significantly higher (13%) during the
earlier period (1969-72). It was virtually halted during 1974 when sharply
rising oil prices resulted in corresponding electricity tariff increases but
the growth continued thereafter at a reduced rate of about 8%. The 40% tariff
increase in the metropolitan area (Suva) during 1978 had a similar effect for
a few months but demand growth was restored to normal by early 1979.
3.04      Major industrial consumption has not been included in the above
figures. Presently this demand is met by the self-generating establishments
viz. the EGM and the FSC whose energy production is currently about 70 GWh
annually. FSC has an interchange agreement with FEA and it is unlikely to
require significant supply from FEA in view of the ample availability of cane
waste which it uses as fuel for its plant. The gold mining industry faced a
declining trend until mid-1979 when substantial gold price increases and the
resolution of local labor problems have revived it. The mine is now
expected to continue production for about 15 years and investigations for
expansion are under way. It could be an important customer for FEA in the
future. Fiji also has prospects for copper mining which have been under
investigation for over six years (para. 3.07).



- 11 -
Forecast of Electricity Requirements
3.05      Forecasts of future growth of demand have been made for Viti Levu
both by analyzing historical trends and the current situation and by regres-
sion analysis of economic growth in Fiji and comparisons of trends in
similarly situated countries of the region and elsewhere. Short-term
forecasts for the period 1979-83 have also been made by detailed market
surveys, identifying the major consumers.
3.06      For the period 1979 to 1983 the analysis of historical trends and
the current situation indicates a growth rate of 5%, whereas the detailed
power market survey suggests an average annual increase of 7%. Regression
analysis by relation with a modest (3%) growth of GDP indicates a growth rate
of about 6.3%. During this period factors such as oil supply and prices and
electricity tariffs will have a determining effect on demand growth. FEA and
the consultants have jointly reviewed the situation and adopted an antici-
pated growth trend for generation, which follows the lower growth rate (5%)
during the period up to 1983 (by which time hydroelectric generation would
be adequate) and about 7% thereafter. This forecast is depicted in Annex 3.
A range of high and low projections has also been indicated therein.
3.07      Annex 3 indicates separately the likely additional demand of the
proposed Viti Copper Mine project at Namosi based on tentative plans of the
Viti Copper Company. For some years feasibility studies have been in progress
for exploitation of copper and other ores near Namosi. If this development
goes ahead it would call for a considerable amount of electricity - about 55
MW of demand and 328 GWh of energy. The demand is of the same magnitude as
that expected for the rest of the Viti Levu system by 1988 and it could have
a dramatic effect on FEA sales if it is met by that system. FEA's current
construction program does not assume that this demand would actually
materialize, but its program of investigations of alternative schemes of
expansion of electricity generation is based on ensuring preparedness to
meet this possibility. A decision on the development of this mining project
is expected within the next year or two.
3.08      The anticipated growth curve also does not assume that the EGM
demand would be transferred to the FEA system. With prevailing oil price
trends this is likely by 1985. The anticipated growth projection is
considered the minimum rate of growth of FEA's sales, with the high rate of
growth a clear possibility, even without the Viti Copper Project.
Load Factors
3.09      The prevailing annual load factor is of the order of 65%.  There
are no marked seasonal variations. This is representative of the tropical
environment. The annual load factor could decline slightly in the future if
the proportion of domestic consumption (now about 20%) should increase due
to the strong demand for more low-cost housing. By 1983 the proportion is
expected to increase to about 25%; the corresponding load factor would then
be about 62%.



- 12 -
Supply
3.10      FEA's aggregate effective installed capacity would be about 120 MW
by end-1981 when the Wailoa power station is commissioned. From the stand-
point of meeting the peak demand, the effective generating capacity available
in the FEA system (allowing for retirement of old diesel generating instal-
lations) would be adequate until about 1985 on the basis of anticipated demand
growth. However, the firm hydro energy potential of the Monasavu-Wailoa
scheme being only 159 GWh, there would be need for substantial diesel energy
generation varying from about 75 GWh in 1982 to 150 GWh in 1985. Valued at
October 1979 oil prices, this would cost F$3.75 million and F$7.5 million
respectively. The justification for expediting construction of the project
earlier than 1985 when additional capacity would be required arises from the
economic advantage of increasing the output of hydroelectric generation as
early as is physically possible for fuel saving purposes (para. 6.02).
4.  THE PROJECT AND THE PROGRAM
4.01      Description.  The project comprises:
(a) heightening Monasavu dam by 15 m to double its storage; the
original dam (70 m high) is a part of the First Power Project
(For details see Annex 4);
(b) construction of two small diversion weirs and about 4.0 km of
concrete-lined tunnels of 2.75 m diameter to divert the flow of
two neighboring streams, Wainambua and Wainaka;
(c) extension of civil works of the Wailoa power station (also part of
the First Power Project) to its ultimate capacity (80 M4W);
(d) installation of the third and fourth generating sets, 20 MW each,
and associated electrical equipment at Wailoa power station; and
(e) a provision for overseas training of operators and extension of
training facilities.
4.02      A description of the ongoing First Power Project, special
arrangements for its construction, and the present status of construction are
covered in Annex 4. The Second Power Project will increase the firm energy
potential of Wailoa power station by 88 GWh annually.
Project Formulation and Status
4.03      Investigations carried out during 1973-78, initially by ENEX and
later by Gibb, identified the 40 (2x20) MW Monasavu-Wailoa scheme utilizing
the waters of the Nanuku river as the first step in the least cost development



- 13 -
program (para. 1.05). Preliminary studies indicated that development of the
potential of the neighboring Wainisavulevu river at two power stations located
in that valley would be the next step in the sequence. However, detailed
field surveys, hydrological observations, geological investigations and
studies carried out by Gibb during 1978 and 1979 led to the conclusion that
the cost of the development program could be greatly reduced by the
alternative of diverting flows of the Wainisavulevu (and other high-lying
intermediate streams draining the Nandrau plateau) on a run-of-the-river basis
into an enlarged Monasavu reservoir and increasing the generating capacity at
Wailoa power station. It was possible to make the necessary changes in
features and design of the Monasavu-Wailoa scheme without changing the target
of conmissioning of the power station by end-1981 (Annex 6).
4.04      No significant changes were involved in the design of the water
conductor system and power station arrangements of the Monasavu-Wailoa scheme
as they had been designed for an ultimate capacity of 80 MW. The changes were
mainly in the features of the Monasavu dam. The basic design of the dam has
remained unchanged but the quantity of fill has increased to more than double
the original (1.65 m cu m). This required a detailed review of the construc-
tion program. The modifications in design and the revised stage-construction
program of the Monasavu Dam (Annex 4), with regard to the mode of construction
and safety aspects (para. 4.18), have been reviewed and approved by the
Special Board of Consultants (SBC), appointed to oversee the engineering of
the First Power Project.
4.05      Considering the possibility of staged development which the scheme
of river diversions described in para. 4.03 affords, and the need to keep
borrowing commitments at this stage to a minimum, FEA and Government decided
to divide the river diversions scheme into two stages, which will enable the
first phase (the Second Power Project) to be committed now and completed by
May 1983, and the second phase will be committed in FY82 for completion by
about the end of 1984. This phase will comprise construction of four
diversion weirs and 7.0 km of lined tunnels varying in diameter from 2.25 m to
2.5 m and will increase the firm energy generation at Wailoa power station by
152 GWh. Engineering and construction of access roads will be carried out so
as to achieve the above targets. The Bank agrees with this approach.
4.06      The scheme has been investigated in detail.  Preparation of detailed
designs and specifications of the diversion weirs and tunnels is under way.
The critical step in project implementation is the construction of a 5 km
access road from Monasavu dam to Wainambua weir site to enable start of con-
struction of the two tunnels by October 1980. Construction on this roadwork
will start in May 1980 to ensure its timely completion. The rest are exten-
sions of the ongoing First Power Project and present no particular
difficulties.

4.08      Cost estimates have been prepared separately for the additional
works (including modifications) to be carried out at the Monasavu-Wailoa and
the Wainisavulevu diversion sites reflecting the arrangements made for their
construction.
4.09      Provisions have been made under the item "land and related costs"
(Annex 5) for purchase of additional land, royalties and clearing costs based
on recent experience of FEA and government forestry officers.  The cost of
extensions to the diversion tunnel have been estimated from rates under the
ongoing tunnelling contract. The additional cost of raising the Monasavu
embankment dam have been estimated by calculating the total cost for the dam
as heightened and deducting the cost for the original dam height. The
estimating procedures adopted by the SPD have been followed for direct costs
and allocation of overheads. For estimating the direct costs of the spillway
a revised total bill of quantities was prepared. Substantial reductions in
rock excavation and some increase in concrete work resulted in a lower base



- 15 -
cost estimate. The cost estimate for the power station extension civil works
has been projected from the estimate for similar works under the First
Power Project.
4.10      Recent experience of road construction for the First Power Project
has been used for estimating the cost of roads for the diversion works. Road
routes have been selected and preliminary grade lines and bills of quantities
prepared. The rates are based on contract rates applicable for the poor soil
and difficult weather conditions expected. Tenders for the Monasavu tunnels
constitute the principal basis for the estimates of cost of the diversion
tunnels. Indirect costs, e.g., of accommodation, are based on experience with
SPD camp costs at Monasavu.
4.11      The cost estimate for generating plant is based on option prices
on the third 20 MW generating set at Wailoa, offered by the successful bidder
for the supply and installation of the first and second 20 MW sets through
international competitive bidding under the First Power project. FEA has
negotiated the same price for the fourth generating set, as for the third set,
on the basis of concurrent supply and erection of both sets. This is the most
economic procedure under these circumstances for this kind of equipment (which
has to be specially designed for each application) and it has been accepted by
the Bank. The total cost of engineering services for the works of the project
including design, procurement and construction supervision is estimated at
US$4.89 million for a total input of about 550 man-months over the period
1979-83. The average base man-month cost is US$8,890. This includes
salaries, costs, fees, international and local travel and subsistence. About
75% of these costs are for foreign expenditures on expatriate staff and
overseas disbursements.
4.12      Physical contingencies have been allowed for.  These vary for dif-
ferent items from 5% for the dam, where quantities involved have been estab-
lished with unusual accuracy because of good foundation conditions (as
expected during appraisal of the First Power Project), to 20% for the tunnel.
Base prices are at late 1979 levels. Reflecting the arrangements made for
construction of the project and purchase of major equipment, and the rela-
tively low rate of inflation expected in Fiji during the construction period,
price contingencies have been allowed for at 8% per year on both foreign and
local costs. FEA is exempt from duties and taxes.
Unit Costs
4.13      The base cost per kW installed under this project works out to
about US$1,000; including physical contingencies and price escalation it
would be $1,214.



- 16 -
Project Financing
4.14       The project is proposed to be financed as follows:
US$ million
IBRD                                              15.50
EIB                                               16.60
CDC                                                4.80
Government contributions                          11.16
Tokai Bank                                         1.94
Total                                     50.00
4.15       The financing plan envisages similar arrangements to those made
under the first power loan (Loan 1596-FIJ) with the Bank, the European
Investment Bank (EIB) and the Comonwealth Development Corporation (CDC)
participating in a cofinancing package. In addition, a foreign commercial
Bank syndicate will be lending to FEA for the first time. The proposed Bank
loan of US$15.5 million will finance about 30% of the cost of the project,
and provide for all the foreign costs of training (US$300,000). It will cover
66% of the total costs of contracts for: (a) tunnels and weirs; and (b) gener-
ating plant and associated equipment. The loan would be for 15 years with a
3 -ear period of grace. FEA would bear the foreign exchange risk of the Bank
loan and finance interest during construction of about US$5.75 million from
its own sources of funds.
4.16       The EIB loan of US$16.6 million equivalent (11.5 million units of
account) would, under a joint cofinancing arrangement with the Bank, meet the
balance of the costs (i.e. 34%) of items (a) and (b) financed by the Bank
(para. 4.15). It will also cover part of the costs of heightening the
Monasavu dam and roads.  The EIB loan would be repayable over 11-1/2 years,
after a 3-1/2 year period of grace, at an interest rate of about 8%. It was
negotiated with FEA and Government in March 1979. The signing of the EIB loan
would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan. Since the
Bank and EIB are jointly financing the total costs of (a) and (b) above, they
are considered to be financing both the local and foreign costs of these items
in proportion to their respective contributions. In view of the very
considerable demands of this project on Fiji's limited resources, its good
overall performance in the mobilization of resources (which finance about 70%
of public development expenditures) and the crucial importance of replacing
existing diesel generation which will produce expected annual foreign exchange
savings at the rate of at least US$16 million from 1982 at existing oil
prices, local cost financing is considered to be fully justified.



- 17 -
4.17      With respect to the equity contributions, Government has agreed to
contribute F$9.3 million (US$11.16 million equivalent) as equity on a specific
timetable to be agreed with FEA and the Bank as it did for the first power
loan. The CDC would participate in the financing of the additional work on
the dam by providing about US$4.8 million of a total loan to FEA of about
STG t 5 million. The CDC loan would be repayable over 16 years after a
4-year period of grace with interest at 8.75%.  It is expected to be approved
in May 1980. In addition, a syndicated commercial loan of US$5.0 million
which has been arranged by FEA from the Tokai Bank of Japan primarily to meet
the costs of the ongoing First Power Project would be used to provide the
balance of funds required. The Tokai Bank and CDC have requested that their
loans be incorporated in the co-financing package so as to include the usual
protective cross-default provisions. The CDC and Tokai Bank co-financing
arrangements will be completed after the proposed Bank loan is signed. In the
event of a cost overrun, the Government has agreed to make arrangements to
provide any additional funds required to complete the project.
Engineering and Construction
4.18      Gibb, in association with M/M of Australia, is the consulting engi-
neer for engineering and supervision of construction of the First Power
Project and will continue to be responsible for implementation of the proposed
project. Initially its construction supervision was weak, but this defect has
been remedied (para. 4.20). Gibb's performance so far has been generally
satisfactory. Continued employment of consultants for the project under terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank is required under the proposed loan.
4.19      The SBC (para. 4.04) comprises Mr. I.S. Pinkerton of Australia;
Dr. P.R. Vaughan of the UK, Dr. Meuller of Austria, and Mr. S. Balasubramanian
of India/Zambia. This Board has functioned satisfactorily and has made
valuable contributions to the work of preconstruction investigations, designs
and construction supervision. It will continue with the same members and
responsibilities on the proposed project.
4.20      Heightening of Monasavu dam and powerhouse extensions will be
carried out by force account by FEA's SPD, under Gibb's supervision (Annex 4).
Gibb has a resident engineer at Monasavu dam (Mr. N. Worner) who has wide
experience of dam construction in Australia and is providing the leadership
which SPD requires. SPD itself is headed by a competent group of enthusiastic
engineers selected by FEA and Gibb during 1978, who have already given a good
account of themselves under extremely difficult conditions of work at site
during the past two years.
4.21      Construction of the roads, tunnels, shafts and diversion weirs of
the project will be carried out by a contract let after ICB. The modifi-
cations to the tunnel works and steel lining (extensions) will be carried out
by the contractor for these works under the First Power Project as an
extension of the contract. Supply and erection of the third and fourth
generating sets will be arranged on the lines explained in para. 4.11. The
implementation program is summarized in Annex 6.



- 18 -
Procurement and Disbursement
4.22      Procurement of goods and services will be handled separately for
those sections of the project being constructed by force account and through
contract. Bank guidelines will be followed for procurement by contract
through ICB. Contractors for Bank-financed civil works will be prequalified
in consultation with the Bank.
4.23      The proceeds of the proposed Bank loan would be disbursed against
normal documentation, on the basis of: (a) 66% of the total cost of civil
works contracts for construction of tunnels and weirs; (b) 66% of the total
cost for the supply and erection of the generating plant and associated
electrical equipment; and (c) 100% of foreign expenditures for training. The
estimated schedule of disbursements of the Bank loan is shown in Annex 7. The
closing date would be December 31, 1983.
Environment
4.24      Surveys carried out by Gibb in consultation with the environmental
adviser to the Fiji Government and the University of South Pacific have
revealed no significant adverse effect as a result of the project. There is
no habitation in the project area nor are there any artifacts of any signifi-
cance which will be affected. The Department of Health has expressed the
opinion that there are no diseases existing in the rest of Fiji which do not
exist in the area adjacent to the project sites. The environmental effects of
the project are therefore minimal and within the capacity of the Fiji
authorities to cope.
Risks
4.25      The risks associated with the proposed project are the uncertainties
inherent in all hydroelectric projects, such as possible geological problems,
hydrological complexities, and similar matters. However, the thorough and
competent preparatory work undertaken by FEA and the consultants, as well as
the precautions taken in organizing and supervising the construction work
(such as the establishment of the Special Board of Consultants), are expected
to keep the risks to a minimum.
FEA's Development Program
4.26      FEA's development program (para. 1.05) envisages an investment of
about F$182 million during the period 1980-86 as summarized below and detailed
in Annex 8.

4.27      The program is based on a sound energy policy and is appropriate.
If the Viti Copper project (para. 3.07) materializes or if demand growth were
to follow the high growth indications as a result of the demand of industry
the program would need to be revised bringing forward the implementation of
the next major hydro-electric power station. This would only affect the
investment program during the last three years of the 1980-86 period, and
there is sufficient time to review the program in the context of future trends
in demand growth.
5. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Past Performance and Present Position
5.01      Following the takeover of SCCED in July 1978 (para. 2.04) FEA
changed its fiscal year from August 1 to July 31, to the calendar year. FEA's
operating results for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1978 and for the
remaining five months to December 31, 1978 are shown in Annexes 9-11. Both
sets of statements reflect the consolidation of SCCED's accounts with those of
FRA. The accounts for the five-month period include the results from the
supply of electricity to all FEA's consumers including those formerly supplied
by the SCCED.  While the takeover did significantly change FEA's financial
position, its impact had largely been taken into account when preparing the
financial forecasts for the first power project. The change in its fiscal
year has also made comparison of the results for 1978 and 1979 less
meaningful.
5.02      Electricity sales increased about 4.8% in the year ended July 31,
1978 and sales for CY79 were about 6% higher than those for CY78. Compared
to the forecast when the first power project was appraised, the actual sales
growth was lower than expected. However, FEA's financial performance has
improved despite little change in the average revenue per unit sold because
average costs per unit sold declined initially following the takeover of the
SCCED. The reduction in costs was achieved through economies made following
the takeover of the SCCED and the capitalization of costs of repairing the
plant acquired from SCCED which had been inadequately maintained. For the
five-month period ending December 31, 1978, FEA earned a rate of return on



- 20 -
average net fixed assets in service (after revaluation) of about 4%. Net
income increased from F$139,000 in FY78 to F$985,000 for the five-month period
to December 31, 1978. However, in 1979 net income fell to F$325,000 as
interest payments on funds borrowed for Monasavu increased. Despite the fall
in net income, operating income provided about the same return on assets as
for the five-month period ending December 31, 1978.
5.03      In 1979, FEA carried out a valuation of all of its fixed assets
after taking over the SCCED assets in accordance with procedures agreed with
the Bank prior to the signing of the first power loan in 1978. Pertinent
points were:
(a) all assets would continue to be recorded in FEA's books at his-
torical or acquisition values;
(b) revaluation of assets would be on a notional basis and used only
for the purpose of calculating FEA's financial performance; and
(c) operating income would be adjusted to take account of higher
depreciation based on revalued gross fixed assets for the same
purpose as in (b).
5.04      The valuation was undertaken to establish a suitable rate base
sid a method for annual revaluations of FEA's assets on which an appropriate
agreed rate of return could be achieved.
5.05      The valuation put FEA's fixed assets at F$52.8 million or about 86%
higher than values recorded in its books as at December 31, 1978. Of the
total fixed assets, 45% is generating plant which is expected to be displaced
once the Monasavu-Wailoa hydro project is fully commissioned early in 1983.
5.06      The takeover of the SCCED increased FEA's net fixed assets by
F$9.4 million, its current assets and liabilities by F$1.9 million and it
assumed SCCED's long-term debts amounting to F$6.9 million. FEA agreed to pay
SCC F$200,000 annually for 87 years (F$6.1 million @ 3%), to provide 5 years
free streetlighting to Suva (at a total cost of F$300,000) and to meet the
costs of reconditioning diesel plant, formerly owned by the SCCED, at a cost
of F$1.5 million. The net effect of the takeover in FEA's books was that FEA
paid F$3.5 million as goodwill. It plans to amortize this amount after
Monasavu is commissioned.
5.07      After the takeover, FEA's balance sheet reflected a higher level of
long-term debt because of its acquisition of SCCED and its long-term debt.
Its debt/equity ratio which increased from 57/43 as of July 1977 to 71/29 a
year later. By December 31, 1978 it improved to 67/33 as the Government
increased its equity contributions for financing the Monasavu project but by
the end of 1979 it was again above 70/30; the level at which under the first
power project (Loan 1596-FIJ), it was agreed that FEA should not undertake



- 21 -
additional borrowing without the concurrence of the Bank. Accordingly, during
1979 it has consulted with the Bank on its planned borrowings. However, now
that FEA's assets have been revalued, its financial performance and debt/
equity ratio should be determined after taking account of the effects of the
assets revaluation. Thus if the debt/equity ratio is adjusted to include the
reserve arising from revaluation of assets it would be about 49/51. This
figure indicates that FEA can afford to incur additional debt in financing its
future expansion.
5.08      The current ratio position has declined since July 1978, as the
FEA's commitments to lenders and for the Monasavu construction increased. In
the latter part of 1978 and in 1979, FEA has resorted to short-term borrowing
prior to entering into longer-term commitments. The 1979 commitment was
arranged through the Government's Central Monetary Authority to prevent FEA's
plans for foreign commercial borrowing from competing with the Government's
borrowing program. FEA has since arranged its own commercial borrowing
through the Tokai Bank (Japan) and a loan of US$5.0 million equivalent is
expected to be contracted under a co-financing arrangement with the Bank.
5.09      Since the end of fiscal year ended July 31, 1978, FEA's debt service
coverage from internal sources has improved from 1.6 times to 2.7 times for
the period to December 31, 1978 and was sufficient to provide 1.8 times
coverage for FY79. This is an adequate level of coverage.
Financing Plan
5.10      Following the Bank's October 1979 appraisal of the proposed Project
FEA acted quickly by firming up its financing needs for fiscal 1980 and for
the project and as as result has already been able to obtain the remaining
funds needed to complete its financing plan for the the Project. It
arranged two local bond issues; one in December 1979 for F$2.5 million and
the other in January 1980, for F$3.0 million. In addition, the Fiji
National Provident Fund (FNPF) is lending FEA F$10 million in the form of a
20-year loan with interest at 9.75%. Also, as mentioned previously (para.
5.08), FEA has secured a commitment for a loan of US$5.0 million from the
Tokai Bank of Japan and a loan of STG t 5 million from CDC is expected to
be approved shortly. The proposed financing plan for FEA's system
development program during the construction period of the project (1979-83)
is given in the following table:

- 23 -
5.11      The plan shows FEA would finance its total investment needs
(including interest charged to construction) from equity contributions by
Government (15%) and borrowings (85%). The Bank's contribution to the
financing plan comprising the first power loan and the proposed loan
represents about 14% of the total requirement. Local lenders are already
providing 13% but the figure could increase since it is likely they will
provide a portion of the loans to be arranged (about 20% of the total). As
was the case under the Power I project, FEA is unlikely to be able to
contribute funds from its own sources for financing expansion during the
project construction period. The fuel price increases in 1979 have placed a
severe burden on FEA's consumers at the time when its construction
expenditures are at their peak.
5.12      The proposed financing plan would enable FEA to see its way through
an expansion phase in which its funding needs will be exceptionally high. The
plan depends heavily on continued Government equity contributions particularly
through 1982. One of the significant risks is the possibility of delay in the
commissioning of the Wailoa generating units which would slow the improvement
in FEA's cash flow which is forecast to begin in 1982 as its use of diesel
fuel for generation is phased out. FEA and Government are aware of this risk
and are making every effort to avoid any delay.
Tariffs
5.13      Although FEA has made modifications since 1978 to its rate structure
to reduce the number of blocks in its domestic and commercial tariffs, it
still uses declining block tariffs. This type of tariff structure is no
longer favored by most power utilities since it encourages electricity
consumption and is inappropriate when fuel costs are rising rapidly. Its
continued application is not suited to the current situation in Fiji as
existing rates are not sufficient to cover the expected increased marginal
costs of supply from the diesel plant. After the hydro plant is commissioned
in 1983 this latter position may be reversed. FEA is currently reviewing its
tariffs with the assistance of consultants (Electrowatt Engineering Services,
Ltd. of Switzerland) financed under a technical assistant agreement with the
ADB. The consultants commenced their work in November 1979 and a report is
expected about midl980. The consultants terms of reference provide for a
review of the level and structure of FEA's tariff rates taking account of the
marginal costs of supply to each consumer category. They will also look at
FEA' financial viability in the context of its ability to carry out Fiji's
long-range power development program and to review the provisions of the
Electricity Act relating to tariffs.
5.14      At negotiations, FEA agreed to inform the Bank of any changes
proposed to its rates and to make available to the Bank the results of the
tariff study at least one month prior to taking any action and furnish the
Bank any proposals for major modifications to its tariff structure.



- 24 -
5.15       FEA's average tariff in 1979 was about F¢9.4 per kWh (US¢11.3 equiv-
alent) as compared to F¢9.2 per kWh (US(10.1 equivalent) in 1978./1  Although
it would appe-r from these average rates that no change in the level of
tariff rates -.as occurred since 1978, this is not the case. In July 1978,
following the takeover of the SCCED, consumers in the Suva area were
subjected to FEA's rates which at that time were about 40% higher than those
being paid by SCCED consumers. Despite this increase the average revenue
contributed by Suva consumers was less than FEA's existing market due to the
larger number of domestic consumers in Suva who were charged rates lower than
those of commercial customers. In addition, rates were uniformly increased
for all FEA's customers by 7% in August 1979 and by a further 12% in October
1979. These latter increases served to partially offset the increased cost
of diesel fuel which escalated from a level of about F$127 a tonne in January
1979 to F$238 a tutine at the end of 1979 (an increase of 87% for the year).
Tariffs were increased by a further 10% effective April 1, 1980.
Future Financial Position and Covenants
5.16      FEA's hydro development program, which began in 1978, will result in
the replacement of almost all of its existing generating plant by 1983. The
cost of replacing this plant over a short period is placing a considerable
financial burden on FEA, its consumers, and the Government. Following the
large and unexpected increases in oil prices, FEA's consumers are facing
substantial tariff increases in 1980 which will result in average rates being
about 60% higher than in 1979 making them about US¢18 per kWh, which would put
Fiji's rates 2-3 times higher than those paid in most other countries. As a
result some consumers are already turning to alternative fuels such as
imported bottled gas for cooking and FEA's forecast market growth is expected
to be low at least through 1983 (about 5%). The FEA and Government are in
these circumstances reluctant to push rates any higher to provide funds for
construction from its consumers. The Government is meeting its share of the
cost of the hydro expansion by contributing US$32 million as equity or 15% of
FEA's needs during the construction period of this project.
5.17      The financial forecasts in Annexes 9-11 show FEA's expected finan-
cial performance through 1986. The assumptions used for preparing the fore-
casts are given in Annex 12. During appraisal, the Bank informed the
Fijian authorities that it would wish to agree on a specific rate of return
objective in accordance with the agreement reached in the loan agreement for
the First Power Project. The Bank also suggested that FEA adopt an automatic
tariff rate adjustment mechanism because FEA was reluctant to pass on rising
fuel costs to its consumers. At negotiations, FEA asked for more time to
establish a suitable method for future revaluation of its assets. On the
question of fuel costs, both the Government and FEA wished to avoid an
automatic tariff rate adjustment mechanism because they considered the rates
/1 US$1 was equivalent to F$0.91 in May 1978 but has since declined to
about US$ = F$0.835.



- 25 -
were already too high. Furthermore, any adjustment mechanism would be
irrelevant to FEA after 1981 when the first hydro units would be commissioned
and oil consumption would begin to decline. Accordingly, the Bank agreed to
defer implementation of a rate or return objective until 1982, and instead
agreed with FEA that it would set tariffs to provide internally generated
funds of F$1.5 million in the years 1980 and 1981. This level of cash
generation corresponded to that being planned by FEA in its 1980 budget and
financial projections for 1981. Although no automatic tariff adjustment
mechanism has been agreed, FEA's agreement to a specific level of cash
generation based on tariffs will ensure recovery of fuel costs in the next two
years. After 1981, FEA agreed to maintain tariffs to produce an annual rate
of return on its revalued net fixed assets in operation of 8% beginning in
1982. For this purpose the Bank and FEA will agree on a method for
revaluation of assets by December 31, 1981.
5.18      The financial forecasts shown in Annex 9-11 reflect the agreed
level of cash generation for 1980 and 1981 and the effects of applying an
8% rate of return on revalued assets after 1981. FEA's plant is assumed
to be revalued annually to reflect an increase in the current price level of
10%. The forecasts shows FEA's operating ratio would improve from 90% in 1979
to 41% in 1986, reflecting the lower costs of operations and maintenance of
hydro plant compared to diesel and the almost complete elimination of the
use of diesel fuel. FEA's debt/ equity ratio after taking account of the
surplus arising from revaluation of assets will rise to 64/36 in 1982 but
after the proposed project is commissioned will improve rapidly to 45/55 in
1986. This would represent a healthy position. The current ratio would be
above 2 in all years except 1981 when it would be about 1.6. These levels
will provide FEA with adequate liquidity to meet its commitments during the
forecast period.
5.19      With an 8% rate of return beginning in 1982, debt service coverage
and cash generation would be low. Debt service will remain low (between 1 and
1.2 times coverage) through 1986. However, the contribution to investment
will improve in 1985 and 1986 to 12% and 72% respectively as the hydro
development and the strengthening of the 132 kV transmission are completed.
Since the hydro system will have a life in excess of 50 years and it is being
financed by loans repayable over 10-16 years, it would be reasonable for FEA
to roll over some of its debt repayments. The forecasts are not based on this
assumption but in practice FEA would be able to follow this procedure
especially as its projected level of debt/equity will be well below the 70/30
limit agreed under the first power loan. Debt rollover would also improve
FEA's cash generation.

6. JUSTIFICATION
Least Cost Solution
6.01       Studies which led to formulation of FEA's 25-year development
program (1977-2001) in 1977 had established that the most economic sequence
of expansion of generating capacity for Fiji's Viti Levu island until the
turn of the century was a series of hydroelectric projects, interconnected
to provide a mixed diesel-hydroelectric operating system.  Existing diesel
stations would be operated as peak load stations to the extent of their normal
utility and the timing of new hydroelectric capacity determined accordingly.
The program has been reviewed in the context of the prevailing oil prices and
the updated electricity demand forecast.
6.02      The following alternatives were considered during the review:
(a) no further hydroelectric projects would follow the Monasavu-
Wailoa project, maximum use would be made of existing diesel
capacity and new diesel installations would be added as required;
(b) same as (a) above except that the thermal additions would be
through a combination of steam (coal-fired) and diesel
installations;
(c) the 1977 development program (para. 6.01) modified to incorporate
results of field investigations during 1977-79 (para. 4.03); and
(d)  earliest practicable development of an all-hydroelectric operating
system, with existing diesel installations either retired or used
only as system standby.
Alternative (d) was found to be the most economic alternative for discount
rates up to 11% using end 1979 oil prices even for the lowest anticipated
demand growth rate. If oil prices are assumed to increase at 3% annually the
conclusion would be valid for discount rates up to 13%. On this basis, the
timing of construction of the project for completion by 1983 is appropriate.
Internal Economic Rate of Return
6.03      The internal economic rate of return of the project (IERR) is the
discount rate which equalizes the economic costs and benefits attributable
to the project. The project costs and benefit streams are shown in Annex 13.
The costs are net of taxes and include those associated directly with the
project. The project includes some features e.g., storage, water-conductor
system capacity, relevant to the project which will follow. To that extent
costs are overstated. No additional investments on transmission or
distribution are needed for this project. Ideally the benefits should be
measured in terms of the consumers' willingness to pay, but since this is

practically impossible to evaluate, the incremental revenue (based on the
average price per unit sold in 1979) of the Project during the estimated life
of the plant was used as a proxy for total benefits in addition to fuel
savings in the early years. This is a minimum measure of the project benefits
as consumers surpluses are ignored in the analysis. On this basis, the IERR
is at least 15%.
7.  AGRREMENTS REACHED AND RgCOMENIATION
Agreements Reached
7.01      During negotiations, agreements were reached with the Government
and FEA on the following:
(a)  FEA will take appropriate steps by September 30, 1980 to grant
necessary authority to the general manager over the officers,
employees and day-to-day affairs of the FEA (para. 2.02);
(b)  FEA will review the consultants' recommendations on its management
and reporting systems with the Bank (para. 2.11);
(c)  Government will review with the Bank the recommendations of the
enquiry committee (para. 2.12);
(d)  FEA will submit its annual financial statements to the Bank
within six months of the end of its fiscal year (para. 2.19);
(e)  FEA will take appropriate action by December 31, 1980 to improve
its insurance coverage and to reduce risks on the basis of the
recommendations of its insurance consultants (para. 2.20);
(f)  Government would contribute F$9.3 million as equity on a
specific timetable to be agreed with FEA and the Bank and
would make arrangements to provide any additional funds
required to complete the project in the event of a cost overrun
(para. 4.17);
(g)  FEA would continue to employ consultants for the project under terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank (para. 4.18);
(h)  FEA will inform the Bank of any changes it proposes to make to its
rates and to make available to the Bank the results of its tariff
study at least one month prior to taking any action and to furnish
the Bank any proposals for major modifications to its tariff
structure (para. 5.16);



- 28 -
7.02      The signing of the EIB loan would be a condition of loan effec-
tiveness (para. 4.17).
Recommendation
7.03      With the above agreements, the project is suitable for a Bank loan
of US$15.5 million for 15 years, including a three year period of grace.

SECOIID POWER PROJECT
Status of Construction of MIonasavu-Wailoa (Power I)
Hydroelectric Project
Description
1.        The project, as originally authorized involved the following
works:
(a) a 70 m high, zoned embankment dam across the Nanuku stream in the
upper reaches of the Wainivondi River (Rewa basin) upstream of
Monasavu Falls. The dam was to be about 200 m long at its crest
with an impervious core of locally available red clay (residual
soil), surrounded by filters and rock fill shells. The total volume
of fill (rock and earth fill) was estimated at about 750,000 cu m.
A 5 m diameter concrete-lined diversion tunnel, 325 m long, on the
left bank was proposed to deal with river flows during construction,
and an ungated, reinforced concrete chute spillway (50 m wide at
the top narrowing down to 30 m) on the right bank to deal with over-
flows after construction of the dam;
(b) a water conductor system comprising:
(i)  a concrete-lined, 2.5 m diameter, low pressure tunnel,
2,400 m long;
(ii)  a vertical, concrete-lined surge shaft 6.5 m in diameter and
75 m high; and
(iii)  a steel lined pressure shaft, 1.8 m, in diameter, with a
sloping (40 degrees) section 850 m long, and a horizontal
length of 2,000 m. The steel lining will vary between 20 and
35 mm in thickness; and
(c) an overground power station on the left bank of the Wailoa River
designed for an ultimate installation of four 20 14W generating sets
of which only two sets were to be installed initially.
2.        The commissioning of Wailoa power station was scheduled for end-
1981. The cost of the project was estimated at F$49.36 million (para. 14).
The average annual energy generation expected was 200 GWh of which 180 GWh
would be firm. After a recent review of the hydrology of the project in July
1979 the corresponding figures are now 180 GWh and 159 GWh respectively.

Method of Construction
3.        Considering (a) the serious financial consequences of any delay in
dam construction; (b) the remoteness of Fiji from the main industrial econ-
omies; and (c) problems of cost overruns and delays experienced in Fiji when
relying solely on foreign contractors on an earlier Bank-assisted project the
Bank accepted the Fiji Government's decision to construct the project infra-
structure, the embankment dam, spillway, intake and powerhouse civil works
(which account for about 25% of the cost of the project) by force account.
The work was to be carried out through an autonomous Special Project Division
(SPD) set up as part of FEA under terms and conditions laid down by the Bank
(para. 4). The fact that grant financing from ADAB was available to finance
goods and services required by SPD ensured overall economy to Fiji. The
construction of the tunnels and supply and erection of the generating sets was
to be done by contracts arranged through ICB.
4.        The Bank agreed to the force account method of construction on the
following stipulated conditions:
(a) employment of a Special Board of Consultants (SBC) to review
project designs before and during construction and to review
construction;
(b) preparation of plans, construction drawings, specifications and
detailed cost estimates before undertaking any construction;
(c) maintenance of separate accounts by SPD;
(d) consultation with the Bank on the organizational structure of
SPD and on the appointment of key personnel; and
(e) consultation with the Bank before SPD undertakes any additional
work other than that specifically agreed.
It was anticipated that in this manner local expertise would be developed
to assist FEA in implementing its long-term program and that the SPD would
meet the country's need for developing a competent local construction
organization.
Progress of Implementation
5.        The establishment of the SPD and the construction of the water-
conductor system were recognized as the critical steps of a tight 4-year
construction program to be implemented under difficult climatic conditions
of incessant and heavy rainfall and inaccessible virgin territory. FEA and
the Government have done well in quickly building up the SPD and acquiring
the necessary construction plant and equipment. Starting from March 1978

ANNEX 4
Page 3
SPD was built up to its full strength by mid-1979. While it has been possible
to recruit the right calibre of staff for key SPD posts, the experience of
obtaining Fijian personnel for construction supervision proved disappointing.
More expatriates (8) had to be recruited at this lower level than originally
anticipated, but efforts are being made to associate local staff as
understudies to achieve long-term objectives. Some 25% more construction
equipment had to be procured than Gibb originally estimated. Notwithstanding
initial difficulties in building up the SPD and ensuring that its work
simulates that of a contractor as far as practicable, it can be recorded at
this stage that most of the teething problems have been overcome and that the
SPD is now functioning as an effective construction organization.
6.        The SBC was constituted early in 1978 with the membership indicated
in para. 4.19 of the main report. The Bank greatly appreciates the valuable
contributions which have been made by these experts to the rapid progress of
preconstruction investigations and evolution of final designs by mid-1978.
In regard to progress of construction, early in 1979, the SBC pointed to
Gibb's weaknesses in expertise on site supervision. Because of this and the
Bank's insistence, Gibb has posted a highly experienced engineer,
Mr. N. Worner to the site. His presence has already had a notable effect
on leadership and progress of work at site. The site organization of both
Gibb and SPD are now quite adequate.
7.        Construction of the project infrastructure, in the Koro-Ni-O
construction colony and access roads to the Monasavu dam and Wailoa power
station has been completed with delays ranging from 2-6 months, compared to
the original targets set in August 1977. The road to Wailoa proved much more
difficult to construct than expected and it delayed access to the tunneling
contractor at Wailoa (para. 8) by about 4-1/2 months. In general, it appears
in retrospect that the work involved in building up the project infra-
structure was underestimated by Gibb, supervision by the SPD in the initial
stages was not efficient, and weather and soil conditions were extremely
unfavorable.
8.        The main civil works contract - for the construction of the
diversion tunnel for Monasavu dam and the tunnels of the water-conductor
system was awarded to Barclays Construction Co. of Australia. Access to the
diversion tunnel and the intake end of the low-pressure tunnel was given more
or less in time. Construction of the diversion tunnel has been virtually
completed. The delay in providing access at Wailoa at the outfall end of the
high pressure tunnel (para. 7) and slower than expected progress on the
tunnels during the last year, indicate that there may be a delay in comple-
tion of the water-conductor system well beyond the contract date viz. July 31,
1981. Construction of the Monasavu dam is proceeding on the basis of impound-
ing commencing October 1, 1981. Attempts are being made, through a combina-
tion of improvements in tunnelling methods and some design changes (e.g., in
the slope of the pressure shaft), to ensure that completion of the water
conductor system is synchronized with the availability of water for testing.

ANNEX 4
Page 4
9.        The access roads to the dam site, the quarry and other facilities
and the haul roads have now been completed as required for smooth progress of
dam construction. The diversion tunnel is practically complete except for
the downstream extension (para. 10). About 80% of the stripping of the left
abutment and about 25% of the excavation of the right abutment have been
completed. These have revealed good foundations as expected during appraisal
and require a minimum of grouting. The present program of construction drawn
up by Gibb and SPD and confirmed by the SBC in December 1979 envisages:
(a) completion of all works necessary for river diversion by May
1980;
(b) construction of the dam to El 738 m, to permit commencement of
electricity generation by October 15, 1981; and
(c) completion of the dam to the full height (El 755 m) by June 30,
1982.
Targets (a) and (b) are substantially the same as envisaged during appraisal
in 1977.
Modifications to the Project Designs
10.       In June 1979, Gibb determined that there would be a saving of about
F$50.0 million (at 1979 prices) if, instead of developing the potential of the
Wainisavulevu valley at two separate power stations in that valley, as Gibb
had proposed earlier, the waters of that river, and adjoining high lying
streams were diverted into the Monasavu river and used at Wailoa. Gibbs'
memorandum, "Report on proposal to raise Monasavu dam from full reservoir
level (FRL) 738 to FRL 745", details the reasons (Ref. Project File Annex 14).
This recommendation was accepted. The more important of the design
modifications consequent to the decision taken during mid-1979 to integrate
the development of the Nanuku and Wainisavulevu rivers were:
(a) raising the full reservoir level of the Monasavu from El 735 m to
El 745;
(b) initial provision of four 20 MW generating sets at Wailoa instead of
two; and
(c) modifications to the design of the tunnels, surge tank and the
steel liner.
11.       The full reservoir level has been fixed at El 745 m due to
topographic limitations of the site which make this the upper practical limit.
Tests have been carried out to establish that the reservoir would be
watertight with the increased top water level. Zoning and cross-section
geometry of the embankment dam would be as originally proposed. The spillway



- 36 -
ANNEX 4
Page 5
design remains unchanged but it has been moved towards the right bank where
foundations are better and the excavation involved has been reduced. Raising
the embankment dam changes the location of the upstream and downstream toes of
the dam. The upstream toe is clear of the excavation works around the
diversion tunnel intakes, but a cut-and-cover extension about 24 meters in
length would be needed at the downstream end of the diversion tunnel to be
clear of the dam toe. Apart from the need for a review of the construction
program (para. 12) in the context of increased embankment volumes from 800,000
cu m to 1,645,000 cu m there were no otlher design implications on account of
the increased dam height.
12.       From a construction standpoint it was clearly advantageous to raise
the dam to the full height during the present construction phase even though
the need for the increased FSL would arise only in 1984. It was imperative,
however, that electricity generation at Wailoa should commence at the earliest
practicable date close to the end-1981 target. After consideration of several
options ranging from (a) increasing the investment on construction plant and
equipment to complete the entire work by 1981; (b) staged construction to a
full supply level of +720 m in 1981 (with a temporary glory-hole type,
vertical shaft spillway introduced through a rock ledge on the left abutment
to the diversion tunnel); and (c) staged construction to an intermediate level
which would enable use of the permanent spillway during 1981 (eliminating the
glory-hole spillway arrangement) it was found that alternative (c) (para. 9)
involved the least costs and risks and represented the most practical
solution. It has been adopted.
13.       Based on using waters of the Nanuku stream, and the two adjoining
streams, Wainambua and Wainaka the ultimate capacity of the Wailoa power
station had originally been optimized at 80 MW.  This would have enabled the
power station to be operated ultimately at a low load factor of about 25%,
which is appropriate for a mixed hydro-thermal operating system as envisaged
in 1977. With the scheme of diversions of Wainisavulevu and other adjoining
rivers the energy potential of Wailoa station would increase substantially.
The operating load factor of the station would increase to 56%. This is
consistent with the latest plans to operate the Viti Levu system as an
all-hydro complex until the end of the century - with diesels on cold standby
duty (para. 6.02(d) and the expected system load factors. Nevertheless, the
question of increasing the ultimate capacity of the station beyond 80 IW at
some future date has been examined. Gibb's recommendation is that provision
for a future increase in generating capacity up to 140 MW (for future low load
factor operation) should be made and that this can be done most economically
(minimizing initial investment) by introducing design features at the low
pressure intake and the surge tank which could enable future duplication of
the water-conductor system, if needed. The remaining hydro sites yet to be
developed on Viti Levu Island can be designed for operation at system load
factors or lower. In view of this, the need for a further increase in
generating capacity beyond 80 M4W is not likely to arise until some 20 years.
Gibb's recommendations are acceptable. They enable the investment saving

advantages of integrating the development of the two river systems - Nanuku
and Wainsavulevu - to be availed of with no major changes in the designs,

SECOND POWER PROJECT
Assumptions Adopted For Financial Forecasts
The following assumptions were adopted when preparing FEA's
financial forecasts:
A. Income Statements
1.        Electricity sales are based on the anticipated growth trend shown
in Annex 3 and discussed in para. 3.06.
2.        Revenue from sales of power have been calculated by assuming
internally generated funds of F$1.5 million in 1980 and 1981 and an 8% rate
of return on average net fixed assets in operation (after revaluation) in
1982 and thereafter.
3.        Other Operating Income comprises fees for reconnection, inspection
and licenses. It also includes receipts from minimum guarantee accounts and
for maintenance of streetlights.
4.        Fuel costs have been estimated in 1980 using the January 1980
prices of F$238 a tonne, plus 15% for escalation in 1980. Prices in future
years have been estimated to increase by 15% annually.
5.        Personnel expenses comprises salary, wages, provident fund contri-
butions, workers' compensation, leave and sick pay and allowances for
generation, distribution and administration personnel (those for commercial
and training functions are excluded). It is expected that the personnel com-
ponent for generation costs will be reduced by about 25% in 1982 when the
first hydro units are commissioned.  After 1982 costs are assumed to increase
at 7% annually while the level of staff is expected to remain constant (as
staff previously in training for the hydro operations and those restreamed
from diesel plants should be sufficient to meet increased staffing needs).
6.        Operation, maintenance and administration were based on FEA's
estimates furnished during project appraisal in October 1979 (after exclud-
ing personnel costs). Recurrent costs of training are also included under
this head.
7.        Depreciation expense calculations were made using FEA's current
depreciation rates as follows:

ANNEX 12
Page 2
Diesel plant                         5%
Transmission and distribution        3%
Hydro 60%                            1-1/4%
Hydro 40%                            2%
Properties                           2%
Furniture and equipment             10%
Vehicles                            20%
Training                            10%
8.        Non-operating income comprises profits/losses on commercial works
undertaken on behalf of the Government, rents received, realized foreign
exchange gains/losses and profits/losses on the sale of assets.
9.        Interest expenses have been calculated using the following rates:
IBRD - Loan 1596-FIJ                     7.25%
Proposed IBRD Loan                       8.25%
EIB existing Loan                        5.15%
Proposed EIB loan                        8.0%
ADB - Loan 345-FIJ                       7.7%
CDC                                      8.75%
Tokai Bank loan                         15.0%
Bond issues                              7.5% to 8.5%
Fiji National Provident Fund             9.0% to 9.75%
CMA Interim Loan                         8.25%
Loans (to be arranged)                  10.0%
Each year during which drawdown of loans is made, interest has been calcu-
lated on the amounts drawndown in that year for 6 months only.
10.       Interest charged to construction was calculated up to the date
of commissioning of major hydro and transmission projects. The commissioning
dates used were:
Monasavu-Wailoa                           -  December 1981
Wainambua/Wainaka Diversions Scheme    -  March 1983
Wainisavulevu                             -  December 1984
Transmission 132 kV - Phase I             -  December 1981
"   "    Phase II       -  December 1985
B. Balance Sheet/Funds Statement
11.       Fixed assets are valued at historical cost or in the case of those
acquired from the SCCED at acquisition cost. In 1979 the accounts have been
adjusted to take account of the FEA's 1978 revaluation (para. 5.03). Each
year of the forecasts gross fixed assets and depreciation have been revalued
at 10% per annum. No allowances have been made for the possible disposal,
retirement or scrapping or currently existing fixed assets.
