by 15 m to double its storage; (b) construction of\n            two small diversion weirs and about 4.0 km of concrete-lined\n            tunnels of 2.75 m diameter to divert the flow of two\n            neighboring streams (Wainambua and Wainaka) into the\n            Monasavu reservoir; (c) extension of civil works of the\n            Wailoa power station (also part of the first power project)\n            to its ultimate capacity (80 MW); (d) installation of the\n            third and fourth generating sets (20 MW each) and associated\n            electrical equipment at the Wailoa power station; and (e)\n            provision for overseas training of FEA's operators and\n            extension of training facilities. The project forms part of\n            FEA's program to increase the scope of Fiji's\n            hydroelectric generation and further reduce Fiji's\n            dependence on imported energy resources. Co-financing is\n            being arranged with the Commonwealth Development Corporation\n            (CDC), the European Investment Bank (EIB) and a group of\n            commercial banks. There are no unusual risks associated with\n            the project other than those inherent in all hydroelectric\n            projects such as possible geological problems and\n            hydrological complexities."}, "docdt": "1980-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
