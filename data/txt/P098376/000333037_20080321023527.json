"Ratings for the Public Finance and\n            Institutional Development Policy Loan Project for Panama\n            were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: Strong\n            analytical underpinnings and links to Bank investment\n            lending provide the foundation for a well-designed\n            development policy operation. The Loan successfully\n            incorporated lessons from previous adjustment loans to\n            Panama during the 1990s and best practice for well\n            performing middle income countries. This included (a)\n            emphasis on upfront action instead of ex-post\n            conditionality, and (b) support of a reform program instead\n            of specific conditionality. Ownership of reform is critical\n            for a successful outcome. A single-tranche Development\n            Policy Loan (DPL) can be an effective instrument for the\n            Bank to provide continuity to reform efforts and re\n            establish the policy dialogue when a new administration\n            takes office."}, "docdt": "2007-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
