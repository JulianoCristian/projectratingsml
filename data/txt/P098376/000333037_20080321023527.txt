F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The actions supported by the proposed DPL are expected to benefit Panama by helping to
create a more stable macroeconomic environment, introducing greater transparency into
public financial management, and contributing to improved efficiency of public spending.
As direct benefits, the Loan is also expected to help Panama obtain better financial terms
for public borrowing and to diversify its external sources of public finance.

    agenda (including privatization, trade liberalization and fiscal adjustment) initiated in
    the second half of the 1990s stalled, fiscal discipline was relaxed and the political
    environment became increasingly divided.        Popular discontent with privatization
    mounted and the 1999-2004 administration ceased to move on the liberalization
    agenda. Over this period, the Government moved away from the Bank as a partner in
    development, leaving much of the FY99-01 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
    unimplemented.

2. The economy improved substantially toward the end of the 1999-04 administration
    with GDP growth rising to 4.2 percent in 2003, and 7.6 percent in 2004. The boom
    was led by exports of goods and services, which benefited from a worldwide recovery
    of trade and strong private consumption and investment demand. Contrasting with
    these positive trends was the rapid deterioration of fiscal balances after 2000, which
    resulted in primary deficits in 2003 and 2004.        This decline primarily reflected
    deterioration in the finances of the central government and the social security institute
    (CSS), and was mostly due to declines in revenues. To restore fiscal sustainability,
    the administration introduced a tax reform in 2002 which had little impact due to the
    persistence of special fiscal regimes. The public wage bill, particularly in the CSS,
    also created additional budgetary pressures.         Reduced transparency of fiscal
    administration emerged as another challenge.          The spirit of the 2002 Fiscal
    Responsibility Law, which aimed at setting legal limits on the deficit, was not
    honored as the definition of the relevant fiscal parameters was modified. Increasing
    recourse was also taken to deficit financing via payment arrears, obscuring further the
    quality of fiscal information.

3. The overall public sector fiscal deficit reached an alarming 4.9 percent of GDP in
    2004 and raised Panama's public debt to 66 percent of GDP, triggering new concerns
    about the country's future debt sustainability (debt ratios were among the highest in
    the region and debt stocks mostly non-concessional). Fortunately, a major fiscal
    correction took place in 2005, which reduced the overall fiscal deficit to 3.2 percent
    and generated a positive primary balance. This correction was largely attributable to
    the timely policy response by the newly elected Torrijos Administration, which
    moved quickly to restore fiscal stability and reintroduced a broad reform agenda.
    Improved fiscal balances was an important pre-requisite at the time as the country
    prepared to unveil plans for an expansion of the Panama Canal which depended on
    external financing.

4. The Torrijos Administration assumed office in 2004 with a strong political mandate
    and a majority in the Legislative Assembly. Within six months of taking office, the



                                              1

   Government secured the passage of a fiscal reform package and of a politically
   difficult pension reform. Although the initial pension reform was over-turned by
   crippling protests, the government succeeded in forging consensus on a revised
   reform law. These measures were part of an ambitious medium-term development
   strategy which built on the structural reform process that was suspended after 1999.
   The Torrrijos administration also expressed renewed interest in collaborating with the
   World Bank and an Interim Strategy Note (Report No. 32887-PA, dated 08/30/05)
   was prepared.

5. The decision to pursue a DPL operation arose in the context of renewed Government
   interest in re-engaging with the Bank over its flagship reform program. The Bank
   had previously responded hereto through the preparation of key analytical pieces,
   notably the 2006 Country Financial Accountability and Procurement Assessment
   Report (CFAPAR), prepared jointly with IDB, and the 2006 Public Expenditure
   Review. Bank support of the 2005 Fiscal Reform followed from the increased risk of
   macroeconomic instability caused by a deterioration in the fiscal stance. Moreover,
   the 2006 PER had drawn attention to important opportunities for generating fiscal
   savings through the elimination of tax exemptions and reducing the public sector
   labor force. The rationale for supporting the 2005 pension reform in the Social
   Security Institute (CSS) was also related to fiscal concerns. Rising cash flow deficits
   in CSS since 2002 were linked to its pension component which was experiencing
   financial difficulties due to: (i) a decline in the ratio of contributing workers to
   pensioners; (ii) an increase in the relative share of informal non-contributing workers;
   (iii) very low yields on CSS financial investments and (iv) an inefficient expansion in
   the CSS labor force.

6. Improved public financial management (PFM), the second broad objective supported
   by the DPL, received Bank attention partly in light of the observation that Panama's
   social indicators, while generally better than the regional average, are not
   commensurate with the relatively higher amount of public spending (see PER, 2006).
   Prior actions and other policy recommendations were derived from Government's
   PFM programs, as assessed through the 2006 CFAPAR.                 Fiscal transparency,
   including improvements in public sector accounting and production of financial
   statements, was a particular concern in part because of several undesirable practices,
   such as insufficient fiscal information in the public domain and deficit financing via
   payment arrears. The focus on strengthened budget management practices arose from
   an interest in increasing the credibility and extending the planning framework of the
   budget preparation process, and due to concerns about a pervasive system of
   transactional control. Finally, support for public procurement reforms was, to some
   extent, related to the potential fiscal savings that were expected to arise from
   improved practices.

7. By supporting the implementation of the initial phase of the Government's new
   development program, as described in its Strategic Vision document (Strategic Vision
   of Economic and Employment Development Toward 2009), the DPL contributed
   towards the higher level objectives of that program. This vision rests on five strategic



                                              2

    pillars that emphasize poverty reduction and improved income distribution, faster
    economic growth and employment creation, the reorganization of public finances,
    human capital development and the modernization of the state, including greater
    transparency and the eradication of corruption in the public sector. The DPL also
    contributed towards the objectives of sustained broad-based economic growth
    (through fiscal reform), reform of public finance and modernization of the state.

8. The Public Finance and Institutional Development Policy Loan aimed at: (i)
    enhancing macroeconomic stability; (ii) introducing greater transparency into public
    financial management, and; (iii) improving the efficiency of public spending. These
    outcomes should contribute to building investor confidence and improve the

    foundations for sustained growth. The DPL was also expected to help Panama obtain
    better financial terms for its public borrowings and diversify its external sources of
    finance (see section V.F, `Expected Benefits' in the program document).

9. Section IV.C of the program document identified a set of near-team objectives for the
    operation, linking supported actions with the Government's program and the
    objectives of the Interim Strategy Note. Medium-term objectives were also identified,
    although their attainment were expected to require further policy actions.         The
    indicators, organized by reform area, are listed in table 1.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

10. The DPL supported the implementation of the initial phase of the Torrijos
    Administration's development program, as described in its Strategic Vision document,
    with a focus on restoring fiscal sustainability and improving fiscal transparency and
    public financial management. It covered the following five policy areas.

11. Fiscal reform. Responding to the need to restore a sustainable fiscal position (see
    section 1.1), Panama's authorities introduced a new fiscal reform (Ley 6) in February
    2005. That reform aimed at reducing the fiscal deficit to 1 percent of GDP by 2009,
    entailing and adjustment of 4 percentage points of GDP over the period of the current
    administration. It contained both revenue-raising elements (notably, the introduction
    of a minimum corporate income tax and elimination of special tax regimes), and
    expenditure-cutting elements (mostly reductions of public employment through
    attrition and elimination of vacancies).

12. Pension reform. To address the deteriorating financial position of the pension
    component of CSS (see paragraph 5), a range of parametric changes were applied to
    the existing Pay-As-You-Go scheme. New individual savings accounts were also
    introduced for all new entrants into the labor force (and current contributors under the
    age of 35) earning in excess of B./500 per month. From a fiscal viewpoint, the most
    important parametric changes achieved by the reform were: (i) an increase in the
    minimum contribution period required to become eligible for a pension, (ii) increases
    in the pensions contribution rate, (iii) the gradual inclusion of `representation
    allowances' as part of a worker's base salary, and (iv) an effective reduction in the
    replacement ratios (benefits).

13. Program to improve fiscal transparency. DPL-relevant actions include: (i) an
    increase in the quantity and quality of fiscal data in the public domain in 2006; (ii) a
    significant effort to reduce payment arrears in 2005; and (iii) the introduction of a
    new e-procurement system (PanamaCompra) for central and local governments.



                                              4

14. Program to improve public budgeting. In the context of the Government's plans to
    modernize public budgeting and investment programming, the introduction of a
    medium-term expenditure framework, including the preparation of macroeconomic
    and fiscal projections and a debt-sustainability analysis, was a significant step.
    Specifically, the DPL took into consideration that the 2007 Budget Policy formalized
    the introduction of this instrument and required budget entities to develop medium-
    term (2007-10) aggregate projections of revenues, capital and recurrent expenditures.

15. Public procurement reform.          The current Government has given priority to
    procurement reform to streamline public administration and increase efficiency and
    transparency of public spending.       The three most important actions include: (i)
    providing a stronger mandate to the Public Procurement Directorate, DCP; (ii)
    passage of the 2006 Procurement Law (Ley 22) which inter alia eliminated disruptive
    parallel frameworks applicable to several agencies and created an autonomous DCP;
    (iii) close to full implementation of PanamaCompra within central government.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:
16. Preparation of the DPL began in April 2006 and it was approved by the Board five
    months later.     All tranche release conditions had been met by appraisal and
    effectiveness and the loan was disbursed in January 2007 (see para 2.1). Several key
    factors contributed to the successful implementation of the operation, including:

17. Government commitment to its own reform program, and hence the DPL, was very
    high. Owing to its strong political mandate and majority in the Legislative Assembly,
    the Torrijos Administration was able to initiate and implement broad-based reforms
    early on in its term. Political capital and popularity suffered occasional set-backs, as
    in the case of the Pension reform, but the administration has generally struck an
    adequate balance between reform objectives and political realities without
    jeopardizing its own position or loosing track of the reform program. The critical
    importance of reform sequencing is also well-understood by the administration as
    illustrated by the emphasis to first consolidate fiscal accounts before embarking on a
    longer-term program improving fiscal transparency and the efficiency of public
    expenditure management. Subsequent policy decisions also support this observation
    (e.g. the Canal referendum preceding the conclusion of the US free trade agreement).

18. Strong analytical underpinnings and related policy dialogue helped guide the
    design and focus of this lending operation. This included the 2006 PER and the 2006
    CFAPAR, each helping to assess the Government's plans on, respectively, the Fiscal
    and Pension Reform Programs and the Fiscal Transparency and Public Financial
    Management components. The policy recommendations arising from these studies
    served as useful inputs as the Government further developed and implemented its
    own reform program.

19. The operational design. The results framework of the operation was very well-
    focused with relatively few prior actions (six) each of which had a high degree of
    substance spanning an appropriate range of five different policy areas. There were
    also good links with the relatively limited Bank portfolio, namely the Public Policy
    Reform TA Project, as well a similar project supported by the IDB. Some of the prior
    actions referred to legislation that had been enacted more than a year before appraisal,
    allowing the operation to focus on implementation progress.

20. The choice of a single-tranche instrument was appropriate given the
    circumstances. In principle, a programmatic operation is preferable to a stand-alone
    DPL as it introduces accountability for a medium-term framework and reduces the
    risks of an unsustained approach to policy reform. The poor track record of single-
    tranche operations in the region underscores this point. In practice, the task team was
    constrained by the short-term nature of the Interim Strategy Note (ISN), endorsed by
    the Board in August 2005, envisaging a single-tranche DPL and the alternative
    implied waiting one more year for the development of a full CAS. The eventual
    outcome, a single-tranche DPL appropriately embedded in a medium-term




                                              7

    framework1 followed-up by a strongly linked programmatic DPL operation under the
    new CAS, was clearly superior to the alternative, even if it was risky ex-ante. This
    way the Bank could respond timely to the Government's request for technical and
    financial support and be involved in the country dialogue early on in the
    administration's term by supporting and advising on important reform initiatives.

21. Risk assessment.        The risks identified at appraisal and effectiveness, including
    mitigation measures, were relevant.          These risks were political (inability of the
    administration to maintain popular support for the reform agenda) and economic
    (slowdown in services trade related to the absence of the Canal's expansion and a
    high debt burden). Risks to the pension reform agenda, in the form of delays or lack
    of implementation, were also highlighted. Political risks were limited as the main
    legislative actions had already occurred. Further, the administration remained firmly
    committed to the reform agenda.            Economic risks were mitigated through DPL
    supported measures to reduce debt-related risk through fiscal consolidation. The
    economic risk scenario, while relevant for the highly indebted, Canal-based service
   economy, ultimately did not play out. The Canal expansion project was launched and
   Panama's economic boom has continued thereby improving debt ratios.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

22. M&E design. During preparation, a set of indicators to monitor progress with regards
    to the program development objectives were defined (see table 1, section 1.2). These
    indicators were selected in agreement with Government counterparts, considering
    availability of data at the time of appraisal, relevance to represent the trends in the
    different areas and issues included in the operation and expected future availability.
    The 2006 outcome targets rely on a combination of quantifiable indicators (fiscal
    sustainability) and qualitative indicators (fiscal transparency and public expenditure
    management). Medium term government objectives relating to each of the outcome
    indicators (by 2010) were also identified, despite the fact that this was a single-
    tranche operation. These were intended to be used for overall program tracking
    purposes, in the understanding that they were likely to require additional policy
    measures beyond those supported by the DPL. In comparison to the 2006 outcome
    indicators, the medium-term tracking indicators were all quantitative. Almost all of
    the relevant program tracking indicators were retained in the new programmatic DPL
    series (see section 2.4 below), except for two indicators relating to public
    procurement. Outcome indicators for procurement were not easily identifiable at
    preparation due to the early stage of reform, lack of reliable data and lack of a
    government M&E design. Instead, specific actions were identified for the 2006
    outcomes.




1Though the medium-term objectives was beyond the scope of this DPL operation it was conducive to the
development of the follow-up programmatic series.




                                                 8

23. M&E implementation. Data availability for all indicators was adequate after
    appraisal, allowing the team and Government officials to follow up on the policy
    dialogue initiated during the preparation of the loan. Some outcome indicators for
    2006, such as the fiscal and public financial management indicators, are easily
    monitored. Fiscal information regarding the CSS and its pension component was,
    however, not publicly available. In fact, the CSS web page contained less data on the
    CSS accounts at the time of the ICR compared to 18 months earlier at loan
    preparation.   Assessment of procurement performance was easily compiled by
    contacting PanamaCompra.


2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

24. Despite being a single-tranche operation, close to full continuity has been established
    through the development of a new programmatic DPL series.             The new series,
    consisting of two DPLs, builds upon the Public Finance and Institutional DPL. The
    First Competitiveness and Public Financial Management Development Policy Loan
    (US$75 million) was presented to the Board on November 29, 2007. Four of the five
    original policy objectives are supported by the new series, including: consolidation of
    fiscal sustainability, enhanced fiscal transparency, improved budget management and
    public procurement reform. In light of the progress achieved so far, one new area,
    supporting competitiveness enhancing reforms has also been added to the agenda.
    Since the main actions with respect to pension reform were already taken, the new
    DPL series focused on other areas ­ as requested by Government. The new series
    continues support toward the medium-term objectives identified in the single-tranche
    DPL.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

25. Of the higher-level objectives listed in section 1.2, transparency in public financial
    management and efficiency of public spending continue to be highly relevant both for
    the Government and the Bank, as explained below. Macroeconomic stability, while
    always a critical pre-condition for growth and development, was less of a concern at
    the time of the ICR (December, 2007), chiefly due to the corrective fiscal policy
    pursued by government which the DPL supported.

26. All the specific objectives (see section 1.4) remain relevant to current country and
    Panama-Bank partnership program priorities (except Pension reform, see above). The
    medium-term development strategy of the Torijos Administration unveiled in 2005
    and supported by the Public Finance and Institutional DPL, has not undergone any
    substantial changes in the interim period. The DPL directly supported two pillars
    (reform of public finance and modernization of the state) through the fiscal
    transparency and public financial management components. The restoration of fiscal
    discipline, a necessary condition for growth, indirectly supported two other pillars
    related to growth and poverty reduction. A new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)


                                              9

    was endorsed by the Bank Board on October 30, 2007. The CPS, like the ISN,
    supports four objectives which are well-aligned with the pillars and goals of the
    government strategy. Half of the CPS lending envelope is devoted to a DPL series,
    the first two tranches of which is closely aligned with the DPL reviewed here as
    explained in paragraph 24.


3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

27. Fiscal reform. The 2005 fiscal reform has been largely successful, implying a
    satisfactory outcome rating for this component. The substantial and rapid correction
    in the fiscal stance that took place over the past 3 years was partly due to fiscal
    reform measures. The fiscal reform is estimated to have increased tax revenue
    collections by at least one percent of GDP in 2006.

28. In 2006, Panama recorded a surplus of 0.5 percent of GDP on the balance of the Non-
    financial Public Sector (cash basis, excluding ACP) ­ the first surplus in ten years. A
    small surplus is also projected for 2007. This represents a substantial correction
    compared to the 4.9 percent and 2.6 percent deficits, as a share of GDP, recorded in
    2004 and 2005. The DPL outcome target of a 3 percent deficit or less by 2006 was


                                                  10

    therefore clearly attained as was the overall objective of restoring fiscal sustainability.
    The government is on track to attaining the medium-term target of a 1 percent overall
    deficit by 2010, according to most observers, including the IMF.

29. The primary balance improved from a deficit of 0.7 percent of GDP in 2004, to
    surpluses of 1.8 and 4.9 percent of GDP in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Fiscal
    restraint and high economic growth (averaging 8.7 percent in 2004-06) reduced the
    consolidated public debt-to-GDP ratio from 66.0 percent in 2004 to 57.7 percent in
    2006 - well below the 61 percent target. The IMF projects a consolidated debt ratio
    of 37.6 percent by 2010, implying that the medium-term target of a debt-to-GDP ratio
    of 54 percent is within reach.

30. Improvements in the overall fiscal balance were due to a combination of higher
    revenues and reduced expenditures. Total NFPS revenues increased, as a percentage
    of GDP, from 21.1 in 2004, to 22.3 in 2005, and finally to 25.2 in 2006. The strong
    improvement in 2006 can mainly be attributed to an increase in Central Government
    revenues, with tax and non-tax revenue2 each explaining around half of the increase.

31. Tax revenue collections of Central Government rose by 31.5 percent (B./ 435 million)
    in 2006 due to a combination factors, including the fiscal reform, economic growth
    and extraordinary tax payments. Tax revenues, as a share of GDP, rose from 8.9
    percent in 2005 to 10.6 percent in 2006 implying that the overall improvement in
    revenues cannot be attributed to high economic growth alone. Extraordinary events
    were important, notably the US$120 million capital gains tax mainly arising from the
    acquisition of Banisto by HSBC (US$89 million).                     Capital gains tax revenue
    increased because the government, through Law No. 18 of July 2006, closed a
    loophole in previous tax legislation which exempted companies from paying tax
    during acquisitions for transactions not taking place in the stock market. Even if the
    extraordinary event of the HSBC purchase is excluded, the tax-revenue-to-GDP ratio
    rose by a full percentage point in 2006.3 This improvement can be attributed to the
    2005 Fiscal Reform, including the introduction of a cooperate minimum income tax
    as well as improved tax administration.

32. The increase in tax revenues in 2006 were primarily driven by an increase in tax
    payments by corporations, which rose by B./ 117 million (excluding capital gains
    taxes) ­ very close to the expected impact of the reform (B./ 113 million). The
    introduction of a minimum corporate income tax through Law 6, CAIR (Cálculo
    Alternativo del Impuesto sobre la Renta), raised an B./70 million hereof, which was
    also very close to expectations (B./ 75 million). CAIR assumes that gross taxable



2 The increase in non-tax revenues is largely explained partly two large transactions: (a) high fiscal
transfers made by the Panama Canal Authority and (b) back-payment of taxes by one of the port companies.

3An alternative measure of the same improvement is the elasticity of tax revenue to GDP which rose from
1.51 in 2005 to 2.19 in 2006 (when excluding capital gains tax revenue).




                                                   11

    profit equals 4.5 percent of gross revenues and taxes 30 percent hereof. Firms can
    apply to be exempt from this method of calculation if they experience a deficit, but
    will then be subject to an audit (in 2005, 75 percent of such requests were approved).
    If gross profits are higher than 4.5 percent then the tax is levied on the actual gross
    profit.

33. The introduction of CAIR induced a welcome behavioral change in terms of tax
    compliance among firms, who prior to the fiscal reform often reported deficits to
    evade tax payments. Alternative measures, such as a combination of high fines and
    extensive audits, may have produced a similar change more efficiently, but the
    authorities currently do not have sufficient auditing capacity to match most successful
    private enterprises. Even if companies can apply to be exempt of the tax, anecdotal
    evidence suggests that many small, family-run businesses choose to pay the CAIR to
    avoid the audit partly because of the perceived high administrative burden (Panama
    ranks 169 out of 179 countries in terms of the difficulty of paying taxes)4 and partly
    because they may be semi-formal. Such concerns has made the introduction of the
    CAIR somewhat unpopular in the business community.5

34. Improvements in tax administration have also been noteworthy. MEF's General
    Revenue Directorate (DGI) has increasingly enhanced the operation of tax
    information systems with a view of facilitating tax payer compliance and assessment.
    A modernization program is currently being implemented with IDB support. DGI
    recently undertook significant efforts to foster on-line presentation of income taxes,
    including an upgrade of the information system (e-Tax) coupled with an awareness
    campaign and user training programs.              In 2007, the fraction of income tax
    declarations (for fiscal year 2006) presented on-line increased to 24 percent for
    persons (up from 8 percent the previous year) and 36 percent for firms (up from 18
    percent the year before). DGI has also adopted a new tax audit strategy.

35. On the expenditure side, the improvement in the overall fiscal balance can largely be
    explained by a fall in central government investment, which was unrelated to the
    fiscal reform. NFPS expenditure fell from 26.0 percent of GDP in 2004 to 24.9
    percent in 2005, and remained constant at 24.7 percent in 2006. Capital spending
    exhibited a similar pattern by falling 0.7 percent of GDP between 2004 and 2005.
    Investment levels were extraordinarily high in 2004 due to the elections and this,
    combined with a drive by the new administration to identify alternative investment
    projects, explain the reduction. Investment spending has picked up again recently, by
    more than doubling in the first half of 2007 compared to same period the previous
    year.

36. Spending reduction measures under the 2005 Fiscal Reform, including a planned
    reduction in public employment, have had a modest impact on recurrent central
    government expenditures thus far.                  Expenditure reduction through attrition,
    elimination of vacancies and contracts for professional services were expected to
    reduce spending by B./ 100-130 million per year in 2005 and 2006. In actual fact,
    total public sector spending on wages and salaries rose by B./ 61 million in 2006.
    Moreover, total public employment rose by 4.3 percent between 2005 and 2006,
    much in line with the high growth rate observed in the past, averaging 4.1 percent
    between 1999 and 2004.               The recent increase in employment is explained by
    increases in staffing in the ministries of Education, Health and Government & Justice.
    Nevertheless, the government met the target stipulated in Law 6 (Article 3) of
    keeping the value of contracts for professional services below 2 percent of the payroll
    for service function personnel and below 2 percent of the amount of executed
    investment for both 2005 and 2006.6,7

37. Pension Reform.           The deterioration in the fiscal position of the CSS pension
    component (IVM) has been reversed and the balance is now steadily improving
    justifying a satisfactory rating. The IVM fiscal deficit (after government transfers)
    reduced slightly from 0.43 percent of GDP in 2005 to 0.36 percent in 2006. The
    outcome target for 2006 (-0.50 percent, including transfers) was attained. A positive
    balance is projected for 2008 when most of the reform measures will have taken
    effect (see table 5).

38. Improvements in the fiscal stance of IVM can be explained by a conducive
    combination of reform measures (inclusion of representation allowances, increased
    government transfers and higher contribution rates) as well as a favorable economic
    environment (increasing salaries and number of contributors).                        The share of
    representation allowances subject to contribution rose to 25 percent in 2007 and will

7It should be noted that when the fiscal reform was conceived in 2004, the authorities were operating on
the basis of substantially lower growth projections. Subsequently, the economy grew much faster than
anticipated and it is conceivable that the demand for public services also grew much faster, requiring more
public servants to satisfy that demand than was previously projected. As a result, the fiscal reform was
under-executed on the expenditure side and over-executed on the revenues.

    increase gradually to 100 percent by 2010. Government transfers rose from around
    B./20 million in 2004 to about B./100 million in 2008 and will continue to rise
    substantially in subsequent years. The positive effect of an increased contribution
    rate will take effect in 2008 as it raises to 11 percent, compared to 9.5 percent
    previously, and gradually to 13.5 percent by 2013. The economic boom implied an
    increase in nominal salaries of 10.6 percent in 2006 and 17.0 percent in 2007 as well
    as an increase in the number of insured individuals (expanding at the rate of economic
    growth).

39. The overall operational balance of CSS has also improved substantially. In 2006,
    CSS registered a small operational surplus (after transfers) compared to a deficit of
    0.4 percent of GDP in 2004 and this surplus is expected to increase steadily to 0.6
    percent of GDP by 2008. This is mainly due to improved finances of the pension
    component, as described above, and to an improvement in its second-most important
    component, health. The latter reversed an operational deficit of B./ 24 million in
    2002-04 to a surplus of B./ 39.8 million in 2006, part of which can be explained by
    higher government transfers. The medium-term target for the CSS operational deficit
    of 0.7 percent of GDP (after government transfers) by 2010 is attainable.

40. Encouragingly, the government has made good progress in terms of implementing a
    series of regulations since the DPL was prepared in July 2006. One of the risks
    identified in the Program Document related to the `possibility that various approved,
    but still pending, actions to the ongoing pension reform (e.g., the approval of
    implementing legislation) may become delayed or remain unimplemented for various
    reasons.' This risk was particularly pertinent since the follow-up DPL programmatic
    series does not include any component to support the consolidation of the Pension
    reform. Four important pieces of regulation have been prepared and approved by the
    CSS Board of Directors:

        a. Regulation of CSS Affiliation (March 2007), which updates the rules on how
            individuals become affiliated with CSS.
        b. Regulation on Benefits Determination for new Pensions (insured to the
            previous law and Pillar I and II) specifying parametric changes of Law 51.
        c. Regulation of affiliation to the Mixed System (Pillar I and II) (March 2007)
            detailing the option for insured under the age of 35 to migrate from the
            Defined Benefits Scheme to the mixed system by no later than 31 December
            2007.
        d. Investment Regulation (July 2007) giving specific instructions regarding
            Articles 105-113 in Law 51.

41. Furthermore, CSS has produced an advanced draft of the Regulation on Group
    Insurance for Pillar II related to the disability benefits and for the retirement benefit
    accrued from individual pension accounts. The Social Security Institute has also
    prepared a proposal of membership of the Actuarial Committee who will evaluate the




                                             15

    actuarial balance and capital endowment annually, according to the new law.8 This
    proposal is currently being evaluated by the President who will eventually nominate
    committee members. CSS has also established a technical committee in charge of
    registering individual accounts.           Management of individual accounts require a
    specific software which CSS is in the process of acquiring. Finally, an investment
    committee has been set up, the members of which are in the process of being
    certificated by the Local Securities Exchange Commission.

42. The investment policy of CSS has also improved markedly. As observed in the 2006
    PER, one of the reasons for the poor financial performance of CSS was linked to low
    financial return on assets, in particular the yield of assets held in Banco Nacional de
    Panama (BNP) earning less than 1 percent. In 2004, CSS reached an agreement with
    BNP under which deposits accrue market-based interest rates. Consequently, the
    average yield on BNP deposits has risen to 3.99 percent in 2005 and 4.69 percent in
    2006. Currently, around a third of assets are placed at BNP (up from a quarter at the
    time of the PER, 2006). In comparison, average yield on non-BNP assets rose from
    6.01 percent to 6.21 percent between 2005 and 2006. Most of these assets are placed
    in government owned banks or bonds. Further scope for higher average yield of the
    investment portfolio is considered limited, unless CSS is prepared to diversify into
    non-Panamanian assets.

43. Preparations for the introduction of the mixed system are underway, but significant
    challenges remain. While approval of various implementing regulations represent
    progress, it has so far proven difficult to persuade a substantial share of the around
    80,000 eligible members to migrate to the new mixed system, allowing for individual
    savings accounts. By November 2007, only around 1,000 (mainly high-earners) had
    opted for the new system. CSS is currently heavily engaged in a media campaign to
    inform members about the possibility of migrating before the deadline of 31
    December 2007. Scant interest from prospective members relate to the age group
    (below 35 years) of prospective migrants (few have started thinking about pension, in
    general) and complexity of the question (calculation of benefits from the two system
    depends on assumptions regarding future career path). Members can calculate the
    implications of changing system on the CSS webpage, but do not receive detailed
    guidance, say from a call support center.

44. The fiscal situation of CSS, including its pension component, has improved partly as
    a result of the parametric changes introduced by the Pension Reform and CSS is on
    track in terms of achieving the medium-term target for the operational deficit.
    Government transfers to the Fiduciary Fund will cover the operational deficit of the
    CSS for at least 20 years, so CSS is expected to have positive operational results in




8In the event that total assets fall below the stipulated 2.25 times annual expenditures, the Actuarial
Committee will recommend further action to restore assets, such as increases in contributions or reductions
in benefits. Considerably discretion (as opposed to fiscal rules) has been left to the Committee.




                                                    16

    the medium-term. Reasonable progress has been made in reform implementation
    compared to the time of appraisal and the pending issues do not put the reform at
    significant risk. While most of the institutional framework to receive new members is
    in place, the scant interest shown by members is a source of concern, since this
    represent a loss of opportunity for CSS and for non-migrating members who could
    have benefited from the new system.

45. Fiscal transparency. This component is rated satisfactory, as the Government has
    met the DPL-supported objective to enhance fiscal transparency through systematic
    reporting of fiscal information and responsible payments management. Publication of
    fiscal reports and management of payments improved considerably.

46. The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and the Office of the Controller's
    General (CGR) issue, on a timely and regular basis, in-year and annual budget reports
    and financial statements (complemented with information on debt and payroll), and
    make them available through public means, including the internet.                            In order to
    broaden the scope of those reports, the MEF and the CGR decided since 2005 to
    publish on a periodical basis the calculation of fiscal balances and correlated
    clarifying remarks. These data can now be found in: (i) MEF's annual reports on the
    Treasury General Account and half-yearly reports on the NFPS and Central
    Government Fiscal Execution; and (ii) CGR's annual and quarterly reports of the
    Controller General.

47. As a significant outcome of these efforts, the availability of public information on
    fiscal performance has increased through the publication of periodical fiscal balance
    reports that are now comparable to the previous year.9

48. One of the most serious problems in Panamanian financial management has
    traditionally been the delay in paying suppliers and contractors, which can add
    significantly to the value of public contracts, discourage participation in the
    procurement market, and reduce the transparency of fiscal figures.                                    The
    administration has made a significant effort to reduce arrears, making special
    allocations in 2004 and 2005 for this purpose, while seeking to remain current on the
    new payments falling due. As significant outcomes of these efforts: (i) end-of-fiscal-
    year outstanding accruals were reduced from 13.1% of central government
    expenditures in 2004, to 5.8% and 6.1% in 2005 and 2006 respectively;10 and (ii)



9In turn, increases in transparency carry unquantifiable higher level benefits, such as facilitating external
scrutiny and comparative analysis of fiscal performance, thus enhancing the government's financial
accountability framework. In the medium term, the government is advised to further improve the content
of budgetary and fiscal data in line with international practice.

10 The Program Document expected the balance of end-of-fiscal-year outstanding accruals to fall to 5% of
central government expenditures in 2006. In retrospect, this outcome indicator was very ambitious, given
the significant efforts made the previous year to reduce the floating debt. Still, the underlying objective of
establishing more responsible payments management can be considered successfully met, as the balance of


                                                      17

    accrued expenditures are paid on a timelier basis, thus reducing the incidence of
    arrears, as evidenced by the current average payment time of 72 days which falls
    under the Government's 90-day policy and contrasts considerably with the practice in
    previous years.11 Medium-term plans should include the development of better
    reports on accounts payable and arrears.

49. The Bank's policy and TA lending, together with assistance from the IMF and the
    IDB, will support the Government's medium-term targets to bring budgetary and
    fiscal information closer to international standards and further refine management and
    reporting on accounts payable.

50. Budget management. This component is rated satisfactory, as the Government has
    met the DPL-supported objective to improve budget management practices. The
    medium-term budgeting framework was introduced, thereby enhancing the
    Government's budget planning capacity.

51. Important steps toward developing a medium term fiscal framework, including the
    preparation of macroeconomic and fiscal projections and a first debt-sustainability
    exercise, were already taken by the MEF. Furthermore, its Circular on Budget
    Policies issued in July 2006 for preparation of the 2007 Budget Policy, formalized the
    introduction of the medium-term budget framework by requiring executing entities to
    develop multi-annual (2007-2010) aggregate projections of revenues, capital and
    recurrent expenditures. These projections, updated now for the 2008-2011 period,
    form part of the documentation used by the executive to prepare and propose the
    annual budget law to the legislature for approval. An exercise to formally develop
    medium-term sector investment programs is also underway.

52. These initial efforts represent an early, yet significant overhaul of the budgeting
    system, which has traditionally relied upon an annual time span that is too short for
    strategic public investment and expenditure planning. As a short-term outcome, the
    government's ability to plan strategically the use of public resources has increased,
    but - as is normal in this type of undertaking - further institutionalization,
    coordination and continuous learning from these early efforts is required before
    higher-level outcomes are achieved in the medium to long term.12




outstanding accruals in 2006 was reduced in more than 50 percent from that in 2004, and timeliness in its
payment has now significantly improved.

11A sample of payments made by Treasury in 2005 noted an average of 131 days between the date of the
provider's invoice date and the date of payment (see CFAPAR).

12The preparation of a medium-term budget perspective presents a number of unquantifiable benefits, such
as facilitating the implementation of policies sustainable from a fiscal perspective and the making of better
informed decisions on strategic allocation of resources among sectors and programs.




                                                     18

53. IDB's technical assistance, complemented by the Bank's policy lending, is supporting
    the Government's medium-term targets to improve policy-based budgeting and better
    align public investment programs with medium-term availability of resources and
    sector needs.

54. Procurement reform. The progress in implementing the procurement reform merits
   a satisfactory rating.     The Government has continued to prioritize procurement
    reform to streamline public administration and increase the efficiency of public
    spending. Important progress has been registered through the implementation of the
    new Procurement Law, reform of the Public Procurement Directorate (DGCP),
    development of a procurement reform strategy, and support for e-procurement.

55. The implementing regulations of the Public Procurement Law (Law 22 of June 27,
    2006) were swiftly approved through Executive Decree No. 366 of December 28,
    2006. The new procurement regulatory framework contains several improvements.
    First, it eliminated parallel frameworks applicable to several agencies (except CSS,
    ACP and municipal entities) which previously hampered the application of a
    consistent public procurement system. Second, it created an autonomous DGCP, as
    the entity responsible for the interpretation of the law. Importantly, the Directorate
    also enjoys political support to drive the reform process. Third, it established several
    procedures and systems for promoting efficiency, economy and transparency,
    including:   (a) establishing a framework for cost reduction strategies (e.g. price
    bench-marking and consolidation for economies of scale), (b) creating an independent
    administrative tribunal to handle procurement-related disputes, and (c) establishing a
    sound framework for the implementation of an e-procurement system.

56. The new e-procurement system (PanamaCompra) was released in October 2005 with
    the objective of promoting transparency and competition in public procurement. As
    of early 2007, public procurement processes in all the central government and a
    number of decentralized entities were already taking place through the system. Since
    Law 22 became effective, more than 11 million visitors have visited the portal and
    more than 5,600 companies have been registered in PanamaCompra to receive
    business opportunities notifications as potential providers, thus benefiting the
    development of enterprises of different size and nature. More than 3,500 government
    officials have been trained in the new legal framework and PanamaCompra thereby
    strengthening institutional capacity among contracting agencies.

57. As more information is generated by the electronic procurement system, the DGCP
    plans to strengthen its analytical capacity to feed into procurement strategies, aided
    by the development of procurement monitoring & evaluation systems with
    performance indicators. The DGCP has also launched an outreach campaign to
    collaborate more effectively with the private sector and civil society organizations
    (e.g. with the local chapter of Transparency International), and developed a
    methodology to conduct surveys to determine private and public sector perceptions of
   the procurement system.




                                             19

58. The DGCP has recently implemented innovative public procurement process
    (framework contracts) for the provision of key services and goods for the central
    government that, in the past, were procured in a fragmented manner. According to
    information estimated by the DGCP, during 2005-2006, the framework contracts
    produced savings for the central government of around US$30 million, while
    increasing competition, promoting greater transparency, and increasing the quality of
    the products and services. It is important to note that some of the services, such as
    telecommunications, were never previously awarded through competitive processes.
    Building upon the experience with the first framework contracts, the DGCP plans to
    develop formal cost-reduction strategies with price benchmarking. Additionally, with
    a view of reducing transaction costs and enhancing procurement transparency in the
    medium to long term, the DGCP plans to design in the short term standard documents
    and other procedures to be applied by all entities subject to Law No. 22.

59. All three outcome targets were attained by end-2006. Virtually all of the major
    public procurement offices use PanamaCompra to publish their procurement activities.
    This was a result of a major drive led by President Torrijos mandating the use of the
    PanamaCompra internet portal by all public entities beginning January 1st 2007.
    Providers can also access information of the current status of their request for
    payments and interested suppliers can obtain e-notification on current procurement
    activities for contracts larger than B./ 1,000 (i.e. the large majority of contracts).

60. Progress in the medium-term program tracking indicators has been difficult to
    establish since the M&E framework is still under development. The DGCP, with
    Bank support, has been working on improving the quality of an initial assessment of
    the procurement system under the OECD baseline indicators framework (expected to
    be ready by the end of 2007). At present, the DGCP has a few selective indicators
    that can provide an assessment of the reductions in average unit costs of key publicly
    procured goods and services. Finally, two perception surveys were conducted in mid-
    2006 (at the time of appraisal) and by end-2006. It would be premature to comment
    in detail on the results of these surveys due to the medium-term nature of the reform
    program, apart from noting that a small improvement was registered, but that the
    overall perception could still improve substantially. A follow-up survey will be
    conducted in the beginning of 2008.

61. The Bank will continue to provide technical assistance in support of the procurement
    reform through the programmatic DPL series and the Technical Assistance Project.
    In terms of operational efficiency, government procurement could be optimized under
    the framework of a comprehensive public procurement strategy comprising, among
    others, cost reduction strategies and more efficient procedures (including basic tools
    such as standard documents, manuals and guidelines). The Government is actively
    moving in that direction with the aid of a recently approved modern legal
    procurement framework. Nevertheless, transactional controls (both ex-ante fiscal
    control and the entities' own procedures) could be streamlined and applied on the
    basis of risk management considerations, and complemented by strengthening
    external audit capacity.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

62. The high relevance of the objectives combined with a satisfactory achievement of the
    PDOs merits an overall satisfactory outcome rating.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

63. The specific actions supported by this DPL are likely to have overall positive poverty
    and social impacts.        Improving the quality of public financial and expenditure
    management is critical for reducing poverty given the large share of GDP allocated to
    the social sectors. In addition, the fiscal reform induced a switch from indirect to
    direct taxes which has improved the distributional impact of the tax system.13 Lack
    of progress in reducing public employment implies the absence of any negative social
    impact. Most of the increase in tax revenues arise from businesses rather than
    individuals. Small, semi-formal family-run businesses may be negatively affected by
    the introduction of the CAIR to the extent that they prefer to pay it rather than
    accepting an audit, even if their financial results qualify them to pay the lower tax
    levied on profits.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(Not applicable).


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
    Rating: Negligible to low.

65. Fiscal Reform: There is currently a broad political consensus amongst all major
    political parties in favor of a disciplined fiscal stance and the main thrust of the fiscal
    reform.     There is some unpopularity with the alternative method of computing
    corporate tax, CAIR, within the business community, but these views did not seem to
    be shared by the main opposition parties at the time of the ICR.                    Continued




13Direct taxes rose from 4.6 percent of GDP in 2005 to 6.0 percent in 2006, thereby making it a more
important source of revenue than indirect taxes (4.6 percent of GDP in 2006).


                                                     21

    monitoring of progress of this component under the programmatic DPL series is a
    mitigating factor.

66. Pension Reform: In light of the politically contentions nature of the Pension reform,
    the current administration has no further plans of changing the legislative framework.
    Reversals in the pension reform agenda under a new administration is considered a
    low risk. Given the substantial government transfers, the fiscal outlook of CSS does
    not give rise to concerns about sustainability for at least the next 20 years. In their
    absence, additional parametric changes (in contributions, retirement age or benefits)
    would be required in around a decade, or so.

67. Fiscal transparency, budget management and public procurement. In these areas, the
    objectives pursued by the stand-alone DPL were already met. In terms of medium-
    term Government outcomes, two main risks, political and institutional, are identified
    below:

68. Political: The current Government will complete its term of office on June 30, 2009.
    Traditionally, new administrations have upon taking office made substantial changes
    within the civil service, especially in line ministries. These staffing changes can
    make an orderly transition challenging and can be disruptive to the sustainability of
    on-going programs, including those supported by the DPL. The Bank is, of course a
    small actor in this process. As recommended by QAG, the Bank will support the
    transition by preparing a set of policy notes to provide presidential candidates with an
    additional source of information about development challenges and on-going policies
    and programs. In addition, the Bank will coordinate with the new administration on
    training needs, especially with respect to project implementation.

69. Institutional capacity: Given traditional limitations in the capacity of public sector
    institutions, including civil servants' comfort in maintaining the status quo, the
    Government's drive to sustain the reform agenda may be slowed down. Despite these
    capacity constraints, a number of champions of reform showing already a good track
    record - with critical support from authorities - have been identified. The Bank is
    strongly supporting through policy advice and technical assistance these leaders. In
    the process, synergies between the policy agenda supported by the DPL and the
    investment lending operations by the Bank and partners have been identified and are
    being exploited. This effort will be complemented by the GOP's own mechanisms to
    raise awareness of the issues to be addressed and potential impact of reforms.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
   Rating: Satisfactory.

70. The Bank made an overall positive contribution to the reform efforts of the
    Panamanian government.         This contribution took place partly during policy
    discussions in the preparation of key, high-quality analytical work, notably the


                                             22

    CFAPAR14 and the PER, and partly during the preparation of the program document.
    The Bank encouraged a greater sense of realism in terms of reform efforts, advised on
    reform sequencing, and assisted in developing a systematic way of measuring
    progress over time. The DPL operation helped maintain momentum in the reform
    agenda and focus the attention of government on the key milestones to be achieved.
    The preparation of the program document, including the letter of Development Policy,
    worked as an effective commitment device since these documents later became
    publicly available.

71. Loan identification and design were consistent with the ISN, built on the experience
    of previous adjustment operations during the 1990s, and was consistent with the
    Government's development strategy. At the time the Public Finance and Institutional
    DPL was prepared, the Bank made an accurate diagnosis of the macroeconomic
    situation, public spending efficiency and challenges in fiscal transparency and
    procurement. The identified areas of support were critical to improvements in these
    areas.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)
    Rating: Satisfactory.

72. Supervision arrangements were implicitly dependent upon the design of a new
    programmatic DPL series (once disbursed, single-tranche DPL operations are
    typically not supervised).15 The successful development of a follow-up operation
    gave the Bank the opportunity to take stock of progress made since appraisal and
    effectiveness of the first DPL.          This included the areas of fiscal reform, fiscal
    transparency, budget management and procurement reform, but excluded the
    important area of pension reform. One component, procurement, benefited from
    ongoing Bank supervision under the TA loan. Supervision of this component was
    highly satisfactory as the Bank assisted the borrower in identifying `best practice' in
    the different dimensions of procurement and the procurement team promptly
    responded to the Borrower's requests for assistance.

73. Government performance in implementing the fiscal reform was satisfactory.
    Government commitment to fiscal reforms continues to be very high.                  This
    commitment is remarkable in light of Panama's history of high public deficits since
    the 1950s which eventually resulted in a high and unsustainable debt burden during
    the 1980s. Fiscal discipline is critical in the Panamanian context of full dollarization
    which implies the absence of monetary and exchange rate policies. The successful
    and rapid restoration of fiscal balance was, to a high degree, a consequence of a surge
    in tax revenues induced by the 2005 Fiscal Reform. Spending reduction measures,
    notably a reduction in public employment, remains a major challenge despite the
    provisions of the fiscal reform.

74. Performance on the pension reform is also rated satisfactory.              Government
    commitment to addressing the fiscal imbalances of the pension component of CSS
    was impressive. It assumed high political risk in facing opposition to proposed
    parametric changes and the resulting reform, while not ideal, thereby achieving the
    fiscal objective.    Continued commitment to reform implementation has been
    demonstrated over the past 18 months since appraisal and effectiveness, without Bank
    supervision, demonstrating a high level of reform ownership.

75. Government performance in fiscal transparency and budget management was
    satisfactory, as: (i) its publication of fiscal reports has increased tangibly and its
    management of payments improved considerably; and (ii) it introduced formally the
    medium-term budgeting framework, enhancing its budget planning capacity.

76. Finally, government performance on procurement reform was highly satisfactory.
    Presidential support was pivotal, as illustrated by the requirement that all public
    entities use PanamaCompra even if not required by law. Consequently, procurement
    reform is regarded as a key priority in the public reform agenda.            Other key
    stakeholders, including the Controller General (CGR), the Presidential Secretariat of
    Government Innovation (SPIG), and the Anti-Corruption Secretariat, have equally
    contributed to build a more effective and efficient procurement system.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory.

77. The performance of the Fiscal Reform, the Ministry of Finance and Economy, was
    satisfactory.  This rating reflects the strong performance of DGI - the general
    revenue directorate of the Ministry of Economy and Finance.

78. The implementing agency of the Pension Reform, CSS, has performed satisfactorily.
    The progress in implementing a series of reform supporting regulations is noteworthy.
    A competent core technical team at CSS has been pivotal in ensuring continued
    progress. The transition of members to the mixed system remains a challenge.
    Stronger CSS support, including the set-up of a call center providing customized
    advice to prospective migrants, could possibly have facilitated this process better.




                                              24

79. Performance of the MEF and the CGR in fiscal transparency was moderately
    satisfactory, as its publication of fiscal reports increased tangibly, its management of
    payments improved considerably, but the there is still room to reduce further the
    floating debt and payment processing times.

80. Performance of the MEF in budget management was satisfactory, as it introduced
    formally the medium-term budgeting framework, enhancing its budget planning
    capacity. Further institutionalization, coordination and continuous learning in this
    medium to long term endeavor should be fostered.

81. Finally, the Public Procurement Directorate (DCP) comprises a small, but skilled and
    effective team. The performance is rated highly satisfactory, as the DCP (and other
    key stakeholders) have been very responsive in implementing the Procurement
    Reform.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory.

82. This rating follows from the fact that both components of borrower performance were
    rated satisfactory.


6. Lessons Learned
(both operation-specific and of wide general application)

83. The Public Finance and Institutional Development Policy Loan successfully
    incorporated lessons from previous adjustment loans to Panama during the 1990s and
    best practice for well performing middle income countries.             This included (a)
    emphasis on upfront action instead of ex-post conditionality, and (b) support of a
    reform program instead of specific conditionality. These lessons remain relevant.

84. Ownership of reform is critical for a successful outcome. This suggestion is not
    novel, but nevertheless deserves emphasis as it is well-illustrated by this operation.
    The satisfactory outcome of the DPL was, to a large extent, a consequence of
    government-led initiatives. The legal and regulatory framework underpinning reform
    was initiated and developed by the Administration itself, with technical input from
    the Bank.      As this ICR review has demonstrated, the government has made
    substantial progress even in areas that were not supervised by the Bank, such as
    pension reform. DPL objectives were strategically aligned with the government
    strategy (procurement reform is a good example).               In the public financial
    management components, the core DPL objectives were linked to the Government's
    reform and strategy. Two critical entities, the MEF and CGR, shared the same
    objectives to strengthen fiscal transparency, and coordinated their complementary
    efforts to their pursuit.

85. Strong analytical underpinnings and links to Bank investment lending provide
    the foundation for a well-designed development policy operation. The key pieces


                                              25

    of Economic and Sector Work (ESW), the PER and the CFAPAR contributed not
    only to the design of the DPL, but also helped inform the reform efforts of
    Government and supported a fruitful policy dialogue. In the area of procurement
    reform, the tracking indicators of this DPL (as well as the programmatic series) relate
    to specific activities which will be financed under the TA loan.

86. A single-tranche DPL can be an effective instrument for the Bank to provide
    continuity to reform efforts and re-establish the policy dialogue when a new
    administration takes office. By working on the preparation of the DPL, the Bank
    team was able to engage with the new administration officials in discussions about
    their medium term plans and possible areas of collaboration, a process that would
    have been much more challenging in the absence of the DPL.16

Annex 4. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The Ministry of Economy (originally, the Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy) has
received technical assistance and financing from the World Bank for decades.
Nevertheless, the previous government suspended this relationship. Panama, in contrast
to other countries in the region, has good access to international credit markets, which is
why the interest of the current government in the collaboration with the World Bank
centers around technical assistance and studies, rather than financing. Meanwhile, the
government was faced with deficiencies in the areas of fiscal programming, budgeting
and the design and implementation of programs of state modernization.

On the other hand, there was a clear vision of an economic program, as described in the
document Visión Estratégica de Desarrollo Económico y Laboral Hacia el 2009. The
vision rested on five strategic pillars: poverty reduction and an improved income
distribution, economic growth and employment generation, reorganization and reform of
public finances, human capital development and state modernization (including greater
transparency and eradication of corruption in the public sector). Meanwhile, there were
concerns about the fiscal situation with the public sector fiscal deficit of 4.9 percent of
GDP in 2004 and with public debt of 66 percent of GDP. As indicated in the ICR, the
Government passed a fiscal and pensions reform package six months after taking office,
both of which were politically contentious but central to Government priorities.

The Torrijos Administration also expressed renewed interest in collaborating with the
World Bank and an Interim Strategy Note was prepared (Report No. 32887-PA, dated
08/30/05). There was a mutual interest in engaging in a policy dialogue over the new
reform agenda through the means of a DPL operation ­ as indicated in the ICR.

The Government agrees with the description and the evaluation presented in the ICR.
The program focused on specific themes in the following political economy areas: Fiscal
reform, pension reform, program to improve fiscal transparency, program to improve
public budgeting and public procurement reform. The program was successful, largely
because of the high degree of government ownership, as indicated in the ICR, as well as
the strong analytical support by the Bank in the policy dialogue. The political will of the
government in support of its reform program was evident given that the fiscal and
pension reforms were initiated before an agreement was reached with the World Bank.

The fiscal reform, including public financial management, was highly satisfactory in the
sense that the Non-Financial Public Sector deficit close to 5% of GDP in 2004 was
eliminated and a surplus attained in 2006. The Primary Balance changed from -0.7% to
4.9% over the same period. This final element was the main objective of the fiscal
reform. Finally, in large part due to the effect of high economic growth, the level of
public debt to GDP fell from 66.0 per cent in 2004 to 57.7 percent in 2006, with an
important share (higher than 5 percent of GDP) owed by public entities. At the same
time, the significant increase in public investment improved the quality of spending. In
the beginning of 2005, the government managed to stabilize the debt level ­ with an



                                            30

increase in 2006, in large part, owing to a debt refinancing operation (which improved the
debt profile). With respect to public employment, the government target (to maintain
1999 levels, except in the social priority sectors health, education, security) was attained.
For this reason we do not agree with the strong emphasis that the Bank places on the
increase in public employment in the report.

The Bank performance was highly satisfactory. The design of the DPL program with a
single tranche, without having a full CAS, with emphasis on anticipated actions and
support to reforms with ex-post conditionality, was adequate.            The planned and
completed studies, like the Public Expenditure Review (PER), are of high priority, and
they were swiftly prepared. There was important assistance to the public procurement
reform program, transparency and competitiveness There was a good coordination in the
design of the program jointly with the Minister of Finance and the MEF technical team.
