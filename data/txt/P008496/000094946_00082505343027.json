project is\n            satisfactory, sustainability is highly likely, and the\n            institutional development impact is substantial.\n            Nonetheless, lessons suggest that: 1) tax administration\n            projects do include investments in automation, due to the\n            nature of tax processing, but the strong inclination to\n            focus on the complexities inherent in automation\n            procurement, and implementation, due to a country's\n            difficult environment to understand the business\n            requirements, and the human resources dimension of change,\n            may reverse project priorities, at the expense of the\n            expected tax administration reforms, as was the case.\n            Instead, supervision should include the right mix of\n            professionals to stay focused on implementation priorities;\n            2) following on automation investments, an information\n            technology (IT) tactical plan, prepared early on, would have\n            allowed an easier management of change, based on shared\n            objectives, strategies, and performance indicators. The\n            absence of such a plan, was the cause of unrealistic\n            financial resource allocation, and project timetable. But,\n            the process of change must be directed by professional tax\n            administrators, not the IT department, who most likely would\n            lack tax administration knowledge; 3) training programs\n            should be monitored, to ensure the relevance of topics, and\n            the adequacy of know-how; and, 4) unscrupulous practices may\n            be prevented through stronger financial controls."}, "docdt": "2000-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
