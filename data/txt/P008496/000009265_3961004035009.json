The project is designed to support the Tax and\n            Financial Controls Office's (APEH's) modernization\n            efforts to develop and streamline policies and procedures,\n            and to implement the underlying information technology\n            systems necessary for the functioning of a modern and\n            efficient tax administration.  Specifically, the project\n            will support:  (a) institutional development through the\n            financing of short-term experts to provide advice in tax\n            administration; (b) development and implementation of a new\n            information technology system, including (i) technical\n            assistance; (ii) computers and peripheral equipment; (iii)\n            software development tools; and (iv) administrative software\n            packages; and (c) training in development and the use of\n            applications systems.  Training in use of hardware, and\n            software tools will be provided by suppliers."}, "docdt": "1993-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
