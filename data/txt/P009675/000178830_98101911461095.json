The use of the proposed\n            loan would be limited to expenditures abroad; the terms\n            would follow those of recent Bank loans to development\n            finance companies, including the standard commitment charge.\n            As in the previous loan, only those projects which need more\n            than US $4 million of ICICI's resources, including Bank\n            funds, will require the approval of the Bank."}, "docdt": "1973-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
