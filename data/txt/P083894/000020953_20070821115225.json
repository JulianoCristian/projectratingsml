Timor-Leste had the following ratings: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. The Second Timor-Leste\n            Transition Support Program had the following ratings:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            low or negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            borrower performance was satisfactory. The lessons learned\n            included: 1) Fostering ownership and supporting country\n            systems. As a budget support operation, the TSP has ensured\n            that the use of funds from the operation responds to\n            Government priorities, supporting ownership; 2) Building\n            management capacity and results-orientation through program\n            implementation. The TSP has supported capacity building\n            through its dialogue on policy design and implementation and\n            its monitoring of results. The Government's capacity is\n            much stronger in these areas today than it was at the\n            restoration of independence; 3) Prioritizing for results in\n            a capacity-constrained environment; 4) Balancing short-term\n            results with long-term institution-building. Budget support\n            operations such as TSP play an important role in the\n            long-term strengthening of Government systems and processes\n            and the development of institutional structures; 5)\n            Supporting a whole-of-Government approach. In bringing the\n            majority of Timor-Leste's development partners together\n            around a whole-of-Government framework for development, the\n            TSP has provided an anchor for all donor-financed activities\n            in the country; 6) Providing timely analytical inputs for\n            appropriate program design and fruitful dialogue. The TSP\n            has been built on detailed analytical work to guide the\n            design of program objectives and activities; 7) Balancing\n            coverage and focus. The TSP brought to light the challenges\n            of budget support in low-income, low-capacity countries; and\n            8) Minimizing the burden of preparation, appraisal, and\n            monitoring. The Government and, in particular, the Ministry\n            of Planning and Finance as the main coordinating agency, has\n            argued that TSP progress and appraisal missions have placed\n            a considerable burden on the administration, with the\n            counterpart teams fully engaged in the TSP process during missions."}, "docdt": "2007-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
