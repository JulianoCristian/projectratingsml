The program focuses on the development of\n            institutions and the delivery of public services that are\n            critical for a stable transition to Independence and the\n            effective use of future oil and gas wealth. On the basis of\n            the Government's FY2005 budget submissions, budgetary\n            and balance of payments support financing requirements for\n            FY2005 are estimated at US$31 million, which should be fully\n            covered by IDA and TSP partners' co-financing. The\n            Transition Support Program (TSP) presents a sub-set of the\n            highest priority actions drawn from the Government's\n            strategic planning instruments (notably the National\n            Development Plan, sector policies and Sector Investment\n            Programs) and reflected in agencies' FY2005 Annual\n            Action Plans (AAPs) and budgets. In consultation with\n            Ministry of Planning and Finance (MOPF), Government agencies\n            identified their TSP priorities, together with quarterly\n            milestones and performance targets to guide implementation."}, "docdt": "2004-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
