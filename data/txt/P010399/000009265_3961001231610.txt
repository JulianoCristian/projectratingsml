MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNAlIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
0 THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBUC OF PAKISTAN
FOR AN
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND RESOURCE CONSERVATION PROJECT
1.      I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on
a proposed development credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for SDR 21.4
million, the equivalent of US$29.2 million, on standard IDA terms with a
maturity of 35 years to help finance a project for Environmental Protection
and Resource Conservation. The European Economic Community (EEC) would
cofinance the project, and would provide a grant equivalent to US$13.5
million. The project focuses on two main areas, the strengthening of
environmental protection institutions, and rehabilitation of agro-ecological
resource degradation.
2.       Background. Over the last 40 years Pakistan's environment has
deteriorated greatly due to rapid population growth, mismanagement of natural
resources, lncreasing urbanization and, more recently, industrialization.
3.      In the agricultural sector, there is widespread and continuing
degradation of Pakistan's natural resources from the watershbds and rangelands
of the north to the plains and coastline of the center and south. Excessive
and indiscriminate deforestation and grazing of mountains and hillsides is
denuding them of their protective vegetative cover, increasing the intensity
of water ru-off and downstream flooding, accelerating sheet and gully
erosion, and intensifylng the silting-up of reservoirs and damage to human
settlements and agricultural production. On the plains mismanagement of
irrigation and drainage is increasing water logging and salinity. Overgrasing
of arid and semi-arid rangelands is damaging fragile plant/soil relationships
and leading to desertification. Indiscriminate development, natural habitat
destruction and unchecked hunting is endangering large numbers of species of
mammals, birds, reptiles and plants.
4.       In the urban and industrial sectors, the rapid growth of Pakistan's
cities and industrial areas is poorly planned, and is outstripping local
institutions' capabilities to supply necessary services, particularly potable
water supplies, and sewerage and other waste disposal services. Raw sewerage
and urban solid waste are dumped in drainage channels, local streams and
rivers, harbors and beach areas. Inadequate or poorly enforced controls allow
motor vehicle exhausts to excessively pollute the atmosphere, and factories to
dispose of their emissions and waste products witbout regard to their effect
on Pakistan's air, water supplies and soil. Ongoing Bank Group projects are
addressing some of these problems, while the National Conservation Strategy
(NCS) and Environmental Action Plan will consider further measures to rectify
them.



- I -
S.      Until now policy-makers and farmers have focused almost exclusively
on questions related to agricultural production, and have given insufficient
consideration to developing sustainable resource use systems. Pakistanu's weak
environmental protection institutions, inadequate legislation, low level of
public awareness, policy distortions and insufficiont short-term incentives to
encourage resource poor farmers and livestock owners to adopt activities with
long-term benefits, all contribute to the mismanagement of its natural
resources.
6.      PokyDOltorkons   Due to the substantial divergence between private
and social costs, traditional land and resource use rights freqtently conflict
with government policies for sound management and preservation of forests and
rsngelands. Local ommnunity access rights to protected foreqts for timber,
firevood collection and grazing have severely degraded large areas of forest,
and, because of Increased populations, in some areas these rights are now non-
sustainable. Watershed protection for large dams has often been left to the
provincial authorities where the dam is situated, while the irrigation
supplies have gone to beneficiaries outside this area. Consequ4ntly,
watershed protection has been inadequate, and potential dam life is being
reduced through excessive siltation. The beneficiaries of irrigation supplies
Ln other provinces sbould pay their share of watershed protection costs.
Pakistan does not have effective policies for rangeland development,
management and preservation. Most rangeland improvement and management
projects have ended in virtual failure because development policies do not
deal adequately with socio-economic constraints, particularly as they effect
sustainable stockfing rates. Policies for the use of Indus river waters
contribute to the degradation of mangrove forests in the Indus delta, the main
fish and crustacean breeding area along the Pakistan coastline. After
diverting irrigation supplies, insufficient sweet freshwater is left in the
river for the survival and natural regeneration of mangroves. Irrigation
water is under-priced which contributes to farmers over-watering crops and
then to rising groundwater levels, soil waterlogging and salinity. Under-
pricing of water remains a principal constraint to mobilizing the financial
resources to invest in adequate drainage to contain waterlogging and salinity.
7.      Legisison. Although in 1983 Pakistan passed major environmental
protection legislation (the Environmental Protection Ordinance (the
Ordinance)) providing for the control of pollution in the air, water and soil,
and preservation of the living environment, little bas been done since then to
rectify eromental problems. This bas bappened because the Government of
Pakistan (GOP) has not been committed to enforcing the Ordinance, the
environmental protection agencies are weak, under-staffed and inadequately
funded, policy-makers and the public have little awareness of environmental
problems, and the necessary trained staff are not available.  Additionally,
the 1983 Ordinance is incomplete and cannot be enforced until Its definitions
and operating regulations are written and gazetted.
8.       nattufiensk The Environment and Urban Affairs Division (IUAD) of the
Ministry of Housing and Works is the main federal line and policy making
agency dealing with the environment. The Ordinance established the Pakistan



-3-
Environmental Protection Council (the Council) and the Pakistan Environmental
Protectlon Agency (PEPA). ZUAD acts as a secretariat for the Council, whose
responsibilities include enforcing the Ordinance, establishing national
environmental policy, incorporating environmental considerations into national
development plans and policies, enforcing national environmental quality
standards and promoting environmentally-related research. The Council, which
is chaired by Pakistan's President, has yet to meet, and PEPA has yet to be
permanently staffed. The incompleteness of the 1983 Ordinance, along with the
council not meetin8g is delaying the promulgation and enforcement of national
environmental quality standards and other important actions such as the
formulating of guidelines for environmental impact assessment (EIA)
procedures.
9.      At the provincial level, Punjab, 8indh and North-Vest Frontier (NVFP)
provinces have established Environmental Protection Agencies (EPAs). These
receive their authority to act from the 1983 Ordinance, and their
responsibilities include monitoring environmental pollution and enforcing
environmental quality standards and regulations. Since the Council has yet to
issue national environmental quality standards, EPAs cainnot yet act in this
area. Punjab's EPA is the most developed, while Sindh and NWFP's EPAs are
still in the formative stage.
10.     Stratgy. To counteract environmental degradation, GOP has recently
finalized an NCS. EUAD prepared it, assisted by a non-governmentaL
organization (NGO), the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and
Natural Resources, and with financial support from the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA) and the United Nations Development Program. The NCS
will be GOPs first step in preparing a National Environmental Action Plan.
IDA, CIDA, and the Swedish International Development Agency will assist GOP to
develop this plan.
I1.     While IDA is currently reviewing NCS, IDA and other donors generally
support Pakistan's environmental objectlves and strategies as annunciated in
NCS. NCS proposes three broad strategies to promote effective natural
resource and environment management, that is, achieving greater public
partnership hi development and environmental management; merging environment
and economics in decision-making; and focussing on durable improvements in the
quality of life. To implement these strategies, however, substantial
institutional development will be required. This project will initiate this
institutional development, and to improve natural resource manaSement, will
undertake studies and operations to rehabilitate degraded watersheds,
rangelands and natural habitats. The project concentrates on this area of
natural resource degradation as IDA is already assisting to finance several
large projects to combat Pakistan's other major agro-ecological problem,
waterlogging and soil salinity. IDA is also currently assisting GOP undertake
a sectoral environmental assessment of Pakistan's irrigation drainage programs
(plus associated studies) to develop a comprehensive, efficient, and
ecologically sound approach to reducing waterlogging and soil salinity.



12.     Lessons fom Pa  IDA Involment The proposed project incorporates
succesusful features, and lessons learned, frcmi earlier natural resource
rehabilitation and development projects in Pakistan and elsewhere in the
world. The main features include: (L) establisning programs to improve the
data base and knowledge concerning environmental pollution and natural
resource degradatiot., including measuring existing pollutlon and natural
resource degradation, and monitoring future changes in them; ('i) developing
policies and programs to nror.,te the efficient use of resources and ensure
that natural resource prices reflect their true scarcity value ia
environmental terms. This will require removing subsidles and clarifying
property rights; (ilL) using EIA procedures to push government line agencies
towards becoming more r nponsible for effectively managing natural resources;
(iv) where uncertalnty exists as to the feasibility of a proposed program,
using pilot p-ojects to develop appropriate site specific responses to
technical and socio-et-nomic problems; (v) involving project communities in
project design and Implementation, and obtaining their agreement before
implementing an intervention; and (vi) taking a multi-disciplinary approach in
designing project interventions, and in evaluating the possible consequences
of these interventions; (vii) providing for considerable adaptive/on-farm
research to improve hill and dryland farming practices, and for the means to
disseminate this new knowledge and practice to the local community.
13.     Rationalef IDA InvovmentL The project forms an integral part of GOP's
environmental protection and natural resource conservation strategies which
IDA supports. It focuses mainly on initiating the strengthening of federal
and provincial environmental protection institutions, developing appropriate
legislation, policies and mass awareness programs and, through pilot and other
operations, rehabilitating degraded watersheds and rangelands. Through both
the policy dialogue at the central level and the more technically oriented
investments at the project level, IDA Is well placed to assist GOP tackle the
range of policy, institutional and teebnical issues that relate to the
onvironment and natural resource management projects. The development of an
effective and coherent national approach, supported by site-specific
implementation capacity, will be a long-term undertaking, which is suitable
for IDA support. Finally, there will be an important role of encouraging
coordination and cooperation between donors, particularly on key policy and
institutional issues where IDA could make a major contribution.
14.     Proec ObjectIvs.L The project's specific objectives are to:
(1) Initiate the strengthening of key federal and provincial environmental
protection institutions to enable them to deal with environmental protection
and resource conservation in a systematic and planned manner, and to Improve
coordination between them; (ii) strengthen environmental legislation, and
initiate environmental policies and programs; (iii) disseminate Information
concerning damage to the environment and natural resources to policy makers,
government officials, and the public; (iv) strengthen professional education
in environmental and natural resource management; (v) implement subprojects to
rehabilitate, protect, develop and manage agro-ecological resources which have
been damaged or which are threatened with damage; and (vi) undertake policy



- 5 -
studies on natural resource management and preparation of future environmental
protection and resource conservation projects/subprojects.
15.     Projct Dserpton. The project would consist of two oroad crNiponents; a
series of actions to initiate the strengthening of environmental protection
instiutions in Pakistan, and a series of operations, studies and pilot
activities to rectify or develop site-specific responses to repairing damage
done to natural resources such as watersh,ds. rangelands and natural habitats.
The first component would provid.  taff, training, teebnical assistance,
vehicles, equipment and incremental operating funds to initiate the
strengthening of EUAD, PEPA, and inadh and NWFPs' EPAs; and establish an
environmental section in Punjab's Planning and Development Department (P&D).
It would assist develop operating regulations for the 1983 Ordinance;
establish a geographical information system (GI8) based on remote sensing at
the Department of Environmental Planning and Management, Peshawar University
(DEEN), to strengthen professional training and research in natural resource
management; initiate mass awareness programs at the federal level and in Sindh
and NMF to educate decision-makers and the public concerning environmental
issues; and undertake policy studies on natural resource management and
feasibility studies for future projects. It would also provide for a mid-term
review of project progress. Additionally, project institutions would develop
guidelines and introduce ZIA procedures; introduce and enforce environmental
quality standards for the discharge of pollutants into Pakistan's air, vater
and soil; measure and monitor environmental pollution including the
degradation of natural resources; and liaise and coordinate with line agencies
in introducing aconomically viable and ecologically sound natural resource
management practices.
16.     The second component would consist of: (i) three watershed
rehabilitation and development subprojects; (ii) one rangeland rohabilitation
and development subproject; and (iii) three reforestation/wildlife refuge area
maagement submrojects. The subprojects are linked to the institutional
development in that they are designed according to NCS strategies, will allow
policymakers to monitor the effects of their policies, and will provide
valuable site-specific learning exercises in implementing watershed and
rangeland rehabilitation. Subproject monitoring and evaluation results will
be regularly sent to the environmental protection institutions, whose staff
will also be involved in the mid-term and final reviews of the subprojects.
17.     The project has an estimated total cost of US$57.2 million equivalent
with a foreign exchange component of US$16.6 million (292).  IDA's proposed
credit of SDR 21.4 million (US$29.2 million equivalent) would finance 512 of
project costs. The remaining project costs would be financed by EEC (24X),
community farmers and households (102), and GOP, GOProvinces and GOAJK (162).
Schedule A shows a breakdown of project costs and the financing plan, while
Schedule B shows amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule. Schedules C and D respectively, give a timetable of
key project processing events, and the status of Bank ¢:.oup operations in
Pakistan. The attached map shows the location of the natural resource



subprojects which the project vould rehabilitate, while the Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 9946-PAR, dated Kay 8, 1992, is being circulated separately.
18.     Project Impeen taton.  UAD would be the main implementing and
coordinating agency for the first project component, that is, strengthening of
environmental protection institutions. The provincial Forestry Departments,
with assistance from Provincial Agriculture. Livestock and Communications and
Works Departments whore necessary, would mainly be responsible for
implementing the natural resource rehabilitation subprojects. EUAD would
monitor the provinces' imp.ementation of the subprojects, and would report
half-yearly on impLementatLon progress to IDA. When introducing ZIA
procedures and regulation of lndustrles emissions, GOP will develop incentive
packages to encourage and assist Lidustry to accept and meet the emission
standards. GOP will give industry time to fully conform with standards to
ensure growth and employment do not fall.
19.      Proect Sustainabilty. This project is the first in what will need to be a
long-term program of donor asslstance for developing and strengthening
environmental protection institutions, policies, and educational and training
programs in Pakistan. Recent GOP action to finalize and projectize NCS
indicates a desire to go forward and adequately support such a program.
Project staff have adopted a multL-disciplinary approach to the designing of
the natural resource rehabilitation subprojects. This, and including the
local commnities in subproject design and implementation, plus obtaining
their agreement to proposed subproject interventions, will help ensure
subproject sustainability.
20.     Acons Agreed. At negotiatlons agreement was reached with GOP on the
following: (i) EUAD would establlsh and staff three sections by December 31,
1992; (ii) PEPA would recruit and place one Director and three Deputy
Directors by December 31, 1992, a second Director and three Deputy Directors
by December 31, 1993 and the third Director by December 31, 1994; (iii) Sindh
EPA would recruit and fill at least four of its seven sanctioned Assistant
Director positions by December 31, 1992, the remaining three Assistant
Director positions by June 30, 1994, and the four Deputy Director positions,
together wlth the necessary support staff positions by June 30, 1995;
(iv) NWmP EPA would recruit and fill two Deputy Director, five Assistant
Director and two administrative staff positions, together with the necessary
support staff positions, by June 30, 1994; (v) Punjab's P&D would establish
and staff i.ts environmental section by December 31, 1992; (vi) DEPI would hire
at least two additional full-time teachLig staff to work wLth GI8 by December
31, 1992; (vii) federal and provlncial agencies would finalize arrangements
gad sign contracts for engaging consultants, with qualifications and under
conditions acceptable to IDA by March 31, 1993; (vill) BUAD, Sindh and  oPr
EPAs, and P&Ds of Punjab, Sindh, NWFr and Azad Jammu Kashmir (AJ1) would:
(a) submit proposals for studies to IDA for review and approval before
commencing the studies, and (b) engage consultan.s with qualifications and
under conditions acceptable to IDA for undertaking the studies; (ix) the
Council would hold its initial meeting by December 31, 1992, and thereafter
meet regularly at least twice a year; (x) environmental sections in the



-7-
federal Planning Commission and Punjab's P&D, and the provincial ZPAs, by July
1, 1993, would: (a) cemmence screening all public development expenditures;
and (b) require government agencies to undertake ZIA procedures for all public
investments considered likely to ad. ersely affect the ervironment;
(xi) government staff would inform t1s AgrLcultural Development Bank of
Pakistan (ADBP) and/or the branch of the commercial bank in the area of any
proposed subproject development, and would invite them to join project
impleventation discussions with local communities when appriopriate; (xiL) in
*        accordance witn terms of reference acceptable to IDA, KUAD and P&Ds of Punjab,
Sindh, NWFP and AJK, plus appropriate NGOs, jointly with IDA, and with
observers from PEPA and provincial EPAs as appropriate would undertake: (a) a
mid-term review of the overall project and individual subprojects, by no later
than September 30, 1995, and would produce a report identifying any reqaired
changes in project implementation with which the project agencies would
comply, and (b) a final-year evaluation of the individual subprojects during
the project's last year of implementation. The IDA credit would not become
effective until the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council, or
the Central Development Working Party, or Provincial Development Working
Party, as the case may be, bas approved the project's Planning Commission
Forms No. 1 and sanctioned project expenditures.
21.     BenefiL Project benefits are expected to include: (i) improved
capability of institutions to deal with environmental protection and conserv-
ation of natural resources in a systematic and planned manner; (il) increased
shrimp and fish production from rehabilltation of m.igroves along the Sindh
coastline; (iii) stabilization of hillsides and rediction of soil erosion,
improved water infiltration of soil, and increased irewood, timber, crop and
livestock production from upland farming and rangeland rehabilitation and
development; and (iv) preservation of wildlife from improved wildlife manage-
ment. Subprojects which would rehabilitate natural resources are estimated to
have internal economic rates of return ranging from 12 to 30%.
22.      Risks. The main risks to the project include: (i) the possibility of
insufficient, sustained governmental support, funding and implementatton of
environmental institutions and policies; (ii) local communities may reject
government initia..ives to introduce a regulated use of range and forest lands;
and (ii) individual farmers may not be able to finance some of the proposed
farm improvements such as orchard production.  To ensure adequate government
support for maintaining and implementing environmental institutions and
policies, the project design adheres closely to proposed NCS strategies;
incremental staff recruited under the project would become permanent govern-
mental employees at the project's conclusion; and environmental issues would
be introduced into GOP's formal economic planning and review process of
investment decisions, particularly through the use of ZIA procedures. The
inal design program for the natural resource subprojects should help ia
obtaining local community agreement to regulated land use in watersheds and
rangelands. It allovs local communlties and NGOs to be involved in project
design through diagnostic studies of farming systems and communLty resources
to discover and prioritize production constraints and community problems, and
then through roundtable dlscussions between the implementing agencies and



- 8 -
local communities avd NGOs, to agree on a dselopmert plan. Finally, to
ensure farmers can obtain sufflelent credlt to undertake farm development,
assurances were obtained from the government that the local branches of the
Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan, or the commercial bank in the
project areas, ,wl be lnfozued of any proposed project development and be
invited to join project lmplementation discussions with local communitlea when
appropriate.                                       1
23.     Part of the proposed project (about 20X of the total expenditures)
would be carried out ln hJK, an area over which India and Pakistan hbve been
in dispute since 1947. By including ftnance for this component in the
proposed Credit, IDA does not intend thereby to prsjudice the determination of
the claims of the parties.
24.     RcoPmmendatIon. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
wlth the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.
