Lessons relevant for future\n            operations suggest that specific environmental problems\n            should be addressed through simpler projects, at the\n            provincial level, and that strong local ownership could be\n            ensured through consultative processes, prior to emphasizing\n            implementation of an institutional development process,\n            which is dependent on socioeconomic, and political factors,\n            and may thus require a long due process. Structural\n            constraints within civil service functions, affected project\n            performance, an issue which could be improved by emphasizing\n            the efficacy of staff continuity. Additionally, procurement\n            procedures should be agreed prior to effectiveness, to avoid\n            the delays, and the weak technical assistance experienced,\n            as a result of procurement disagreements; and, deficiencies\n            regarding withdrawal applications, and the use of the\n            Special Account, further delayed implementation, which could\n            have been avoided, had an assessment of the project's\n            financial management needs, been implemented at appraisal,\n            or through a provision for advancing funds, with the full\n            accountability of project directors. Although social\n            participation conveys a higher potential for sustainability,\n            because of the multi-sectoral nature of resource\n            conservation projects, it is recommended that systematic\n            community, socioeconomic studies be undertaken regularly."}, "docdt": "2000-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
