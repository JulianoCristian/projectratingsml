There are four project components. The first enhances\n            educational access and quality by 1) financing research and\n            evaluation of innovative educational models, strategies, and\n            curriculum for grades K-12; and disseminates the results of\n            this work; 2) pilot testing and evaluation of the programs\n            of \"Telesecundaria' and \"Aceleracion del\n            Aprendizaje\"; and 3) designing reforms of pre-service\n            teacher training programs and providing equipment and\n            training materials. At the local level, this component funds\n            sub-projects which may support reforming in-service teacher\n            education programs, creating/strengthening education demand\n            through targeted information campaigns, creating incentive\n            schemes to increase school coverage, and implementing\n            projects linking school learning with productivity. The\n            second component provides technical assistance to strengthen\n            the education ministry's capacity for project\n            implementation, monitoring, evaluation, and knowledge\n            management; supports the formation of strategic\n            partnerships; and builds the capacity of municipalities to\n            create education plans and improve school governance. The\n            third component supports the ministry's role in\n            reinforcing participatory and democratic forms of school\n            governance and developing social capital and civic values.\n            The fourth component strengthens information systems and\n            designs, implements, and evaluates pilot projects."}, "docdt": "2000-03-10T00:00:00Z"}
