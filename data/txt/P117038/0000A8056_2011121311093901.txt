                         suspension notice of July 28, 2011, and the guidance note are attached to this ISR.

                         The Project had been making good progress untiltill the beginning of March 2011 when the prevailing country situation started to make have an impact on the implementation. The

                         able to transfer the remaining 9 months until November 11, 2011 when a pending withdrawal application of Euro 3.4 million which covers 6 months (December 2010 through May
                         2011) was released. As the current project closing date is December 31, 2011, it is unlikely that the cash assistance for the remaining 3 months (June through August 2011) will be
                         transferred.
