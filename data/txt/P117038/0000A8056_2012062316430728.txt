                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is to report on a supervision mission and progress to date.

                         The activities under WORKFARE ASSISTANCE which supported the Labor Intensive Works Program (LIWP) have been fully completed achieving the component's objectives:
                         creating temporary employment opportunities for 17,136 hhs (vs. original target of 12,000 to 16,000 hhs) within the most seriously affected communities for the carrying out of basic
                         infrastructure activities which included soil protection, agricultural terraces rehabilitation, maintenance and improvement of local feeder roads, street pavement, etc. The component

                         evaluation is being finalized and will be discussed during the upcoming mission in June 2012 for input into the Implementation Completion and Results Report.

                         It is important to point out that during the implementation period, the LIWP has developed into a full blown safety net program for Yemen. The direct contracting mechanism used for
                         the LIWP has performed far better than commercial contracting in the current country context especially during political upheaval in 2011. Only 3% of the subprojects had been

                         stopped, compared to 23% overall in the Social Fund for Development's program. The participating communities had been very much engaged in implementing subprojects as they
                         offer sources of income for communities that are quickly running out of other options. In order to overcome the shortages and price increases of fuel and materials, more local
                         materials have been used and sometimes, communities have used donkeys and camels instead of vehicles to transport the materials. The LIW program's positive performance
                         enabled the Social Fund for Development to mobilize additional donor support (DFID, Dutch and KfW). The lessons learned from this Project will be fed into the same program
                         supported through the Social Fund Phase IV Project.

                         The program also reported "indirect benefits" of the LIWP which were: decrease in illegal immigration to neighboring countries, lower internal immigration to main cities, decrease in
                         conflicts among participating communities, building self-help spirit among program participants, and unskilled and semi-skilled laborers gaining experience which helped them find
                         future jobs.

                         During the December Joint-Donor Review mission, SFD and development partners agreed that this program needs to be temporarily expanded (in terms of the scale of the financing)
                         and accelerated in order to respond to the needs on the ground through the Social Fund IV Project. The LIWP provides a quick transfer to the poor and vulnerable so that they can
                         reduce the food consumption gap and decrease household debt among other priorities while rehabilitating damaged economic and social infrastructure and building community
                         assets. Under the Social Fund IV Project, the LIWP will be further scaled up. The program will also give priority to population groups which may have been affected by the current
                         crisis, and prioritizing geographical areas that have been affected most by the conflict.

                         The CASH ASSISTANCE for the first three months (September, October and November 2010) was transferred to 40,007 households in November 2010, and another 6 month
                         payment was transferred as a lump sum to the beneficiaries in December 2011 after a long delay due to the suspension of disbursement for the Yemen portfolio for almost a year.
                         The original project closing date was December 31, 2011 and the Bank approved the delay of the Closure of the Grant Account from December 31, 2011 until the suspension was
                         lifted and a retroactive extension of Closing Date could be processed. The suspension was lifted on January 20, 2012 and consequently the closing date was retroactively extended
                         to June 30, 2012.

                         The withdrawal application (WA) for the final three month payment is being processed. The submission of the WA has been delayed due to prolonged strike at the Social Welfare
                         Fund (SWF) as a result of the aftermath of the political crisis. The external auditor had problems accessing the SWF to review the documents for the Interim Financial Reports as
                         supporting documents for the WA. The stoppage of cash transfers due to the suspension has obviously had a negative impact on the beneficiaries who rely on predictable payments;
                         the cash assistance is often the last resource for the poorest households affected by crisis.
