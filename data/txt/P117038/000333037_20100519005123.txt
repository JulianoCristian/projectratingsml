Environment Management Plan of the SFD 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Yemen’s Social Fund for Development (SFD) was established in 1997 as an 
administratively and financially autonomous agency to help implement national social 
and economic plans. The SFD is supervised by a Board of Directors chaired by the Prime 
Minister and composed of members representing the government, the private sector and 
civil society. The Board defines and approves the SFD’s general policies and plans and 
monitors its performance and progress in achieving goals. 
 
By improving basic services and facilitating poor communities’ access to them, the SFD 
helps reduce poverty and improve living conditions of poor people. It also helps refine 
approaches to delivering social services and empowers communities and local councils to 
take charge of development in their areas. 
 
The current list of donors to SFD include: the Arab Fund for Social and Economic 
Development (AFSED), DFID, EC, KfW, the Islamic Development Bank (IDF), 
Netherlands, the OPEC Fund, World Bank/IDA, Saudi Fund, and the U.S. Government. 
The French and Italian governments have supported the SFD through seconding experts 
to the SFD.   
In 2008, the SFD introduced a new program—supported by the donor-initiated Global 
Food Crisis Response Program—that uses a labor-intensive works approach to provide 
income for individuals and families most affected by the dramatic increase in food prices. 
 
The SFD achieves its goals through four main programs: 
 
·
Community development 
initiatives facilitate access to basic social and economic 
services—mainly in rural areas deprived of such services, as well as some urban 
areas. 
·
Capacity building
 of local partners, along with efforts to support capacities and 
organize communities and some government agencies and nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs). 
·
Small and Microenterprise Development 
projects enhance small and microfinance 
services by supporting intermediaries such as NGOs and financing institutions, and 
develop business sector to provide nonfinancial services for small entrepreneurs. 
·
Labor-intensive works 
focus on creating job opportunities to temporarily absorb 
unskilled workers.
 
These four programs cover projects in a wide range of sectors and sub-programs, 
including education, water, sanitation, health, groups with special needs, rain-fed 
agriculture, rural roads, integrated interventions, training, organizational support, cultural 
heritage and small and microenterprise development.  
 
SFD has an operational manual which is a dynamic document that has been subject to 7-8 
revisions over the last twelve years. It is now a comprehensive document that includes 
Page  5
SFD Environment Management Plan
 
5/50                                                       
 
details on all aspects of operations. It includes criteria for what subprojects to finance, 
what intermediaries to work with, as well as what process the subproject should go 
through until it is contracted. The manual also includes details on monitoring and 
evaluation of the subprojects, procurement methods, financial management issues, etc. A 
technical audit is conducted every two years to ensure that the SFD’s operations are 
based on the manual. So far, all technical audits have shown that the SFD is using the 
manual as the main tool to guide its operations. 
Additionally, SFD contracts independent consultant to undertake annual environmental 
audits. In May 2004, SFD has developed the first Environment Management Plan (EMP) 
and since then, three annual environmental audits have been conducted and a lot of 
experience has been gained in the environmental issues. As SFD-III is approaching its 
end by the end of year 2010, and with the beginning of SFD-VI it becomes crucial to 
update the EMP based on the results of the previous environmental audits and experience.  
 
The updated Environment Management Plan (EMP) shall cater for the environmental 
needs of the SFD sub-projects in a simple, responsive and cost effective manner that will 
not unnecessarily overload or slow down the project. 
 
When implemented efficiently, the EMP should ensure that  
-
Any environmental issues or concerns are addressed in the design 
phase of the sub-projects. 
-
Mitigation measures minimizing environmental impacts are being 
implemented. 
-
Monitoring for compliance and sound environmental performance 
is continued.  
 
2. National Environmental Law  
 
In 1995, Parliament enacted a comprehensive Environment Protection Law (Law No. 26 
of 1995), consisting of five chapters and 95 articles. 
 
The law's objectives are to protect the environment, to combat pollution, and to protect 
natural resources, society, human health, and habitats from activities that damage the 
environment. In addition, the law is designed to protect the national environment from 
activities practiced beyond the national boundaries and to implement international 
commitments ratified by the Republic of Yemen in relation to environmental protection, 
control of pollution, conservation of natural resources, and the protection of such globally 
important environmental elements as the ozone layer and climatic changes. 
 
To avoid future adverse environmental effects, the law stipulates the incorporation of 
environmental considerations in economic development plans at all levels and stages of 
planning for all sectors. It also, imposes the performance of environmental assessment for 
all projects proposed by government, public, private, and cooperative agencies, and 
foreign companies. No licenses are to be issued for projects that degrade the 
environment.  
 
The law also broadened the role of the Environment Protection Council (established in 
1990) to include planning, licensing, monitoring, and auditing functions and to develop 
the procedures for defining, adopting, and monitoring environmental standards. The Law

6/50                                                       
 
also outlines the role of line ministries and other technical authorities in the protection of 
air, water, and soil. 
 
3.  SFD Administrative Framework  
 
As a governmental institution, SFD follows the national environmental law through 
applying its EMP and maintaining good coordination with Environmental Protection 
Authority (EPA). Since the establishment of the EMP, the Water and Environment 
Unit, in headquarter, was assigned to be the focal point for all environmental issues. 
The main tasks of the WEU in the field of environment are summarized below: 
 
·
Formulation of environmental policies and ensuring the mainstreaming of such 
policies into SFD’s activities; 
·
Monitoring the implementation of SFD’s Environmental Management Plan  
into SFD’s Programs; 
·
Formulation of environmental training programs and monitoring their 
implementation; 
·
Conduct environmental auditing to ensure application of the EMP; 
·
Participate in the Appraisal Committee to ensure the mainstreaming of 
environmental policies and guidelines; 
·
Coordinate with the EPA ; 
·
Preparing studies/manuals to promote environmental best practices and compile 
annual progress reports. 
 
To insure the smooth implementation of the EMP, the following points are needed to be 
agreed with the EPA:  
·
The environmental classification of sub-projects A, B and C; 
·
Class C sub-projects can proceed without EIA; 
·
Class B sub-projects need simple EIA and can be handled within the SFD; 
·
Class A sub-projects need detailed EIA and should be conducted by a qualified 
consultant and submitted to EPA for review and approval; 
·
The list of qualified consultants for conducting EPA for Class A sub-projects and 
the Annual Environmental Audit (AEA) for SFD's programs

4.1. Environmental Classification of Sub-Projects 
 
The sub-projects of the SFD would be classified into three groups. Lists A, B and C 
would represent these groups as follows:  
Page  8
SFD Environment Management Plan
 
8/50                                                       
 
List C: 
 
These are sub-projects which are known to have no adverse environmental 
impacts, and accordingly will not require any environmental assessment or 
follow-up
.
Small and micro finance, training, institutional capacity building, 
awareness, minor rehabilitation and furnishing/equipping of schools and training 
centers are examples of sub-projects falling under this category and represent 
around 10% of the overall number of sub-projects.  
List B:  
 
This category of sub-projects represents a relatively large percentage of the 
overall number of sub-projects (about 85%). These are sub-projects that are likely 
to have only limited adverse environmental impacts. Sub-projects falling under   
this category would include, but are not limited to: 
-
Construction of schools, teacher’s housing, training centers, etc. 
-
Construction of health units, dispensaries, maternity clinics, medical 
research and control centers, etc. 
-
Rural feeder roads (cut and fill is up to 60% of the total cost), stone 
pavement, bridges and water passage ways, etc. 
-
Construction of dams (up to 50,000 m³), rainwater harvesting 
cisterns and mechanized water systems 
-
Establishing livestock markets, small slaughter houses (up to 5000 
beneficiaries), vaccination yards, etc 
-
All cultural heritage sub-projects such as rehabilitation of 
“Megshamats”, Mosques, and fortresses, etc 
-
Rehabilitating terraces, and flood protection  
-
Wastewater systems (sewerage network and treatment plant) for 
population up to 2,000 capita 
-
Municipal solid waste collection and transportation  
-
Land fill up to 5,000 capita  
 
These sub-projects would require a scoped (limited) EIA using a simple “Form B”. 
(attached in annex 4)  
 
List A:  
 
This list is limited only to those sub-projects with significant environmental 
impacts, and for which a full EIA needs to be prepared and reviewed. The list of 
sub-projects under this category would include, but might not be limited to: 
-
Landfill sub-projects for over 5,000 capita 
-
Centralized healthcare waste management projects (for towns or 
cities)  
-
Dams with capacities over 50,000m³ 
-
Wastewater collection and treatment systems (sewerage networks 
and/or treatment plants) for population over 2,000 capita  
-
Rural feeder roads (cut and fill over 60% of the total cost) 
-
Slaughter houses serving more than 5,000 capita 
 
Sub-projects falling under this category would require a full EIA. An “EIA form A” 
would guide its preparation. The EIA of all list A sub-projects shall be submitted to the 
Page  9
SFD Environment Management Plan
 
9/50                                                       
 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for review and approval whereas that of list B 
sub-
projects don’t need to be sent to EPA as their impacts are local, and small and can be 
easily identified, and mitigated within the SFD.  
 
4.2. Environmental Screening and Registering 
 
Environmental screening would take place at an early stage of the SFD sub-project cycle. 
During the “Field Appraisal” stage, the project officer (PO), based on the sub-project 
proposal and with the help of the classification lists, would classify the sub-project into 
category A, B or C and register it on the MIS as such. The Head of the relevant Unit 
(UH) or the Branch Manager (BM) reviews the classification of the sub-project and 
might re-classify the sub-project if he/she sees the necessity to do so.  
Sub-projects classified as “C” would be further processed with no environmental 
assessment or follow-up. Sub-projects under classes “B” and “A” would be subject to 
environmental assessment and follow-up as described hereafter.  
 
4.3. Environmental Assessment of Sub-Projects 
 
Environmental assessment takes place during the second stage of the sub-project life 
cycle (preparation of project document).  
 
Sub-projects classified under category “B” would be subject to a focused
EIA. The sub-
project consultant would be required to complete a simple “EIA Form B”. The PO will 
provide the consultant with checklists and guidelines to help him/her identify and include 
the relevant mitigation measures. Mitigation measures indicated in the “EIA Form B” 
should be included in the project design and reflected in the project document.  
 
On the other hand, sub-projects classified under class “A” would require more attention 
and accordingly a more detailed environmental impact assessment. In this case, a short 
list of recommended environmental consultants prepared by SFD and approved by EPA 
should be used to hire from among to conduct the EIA.  
 
The EIA for the sub-project classified as “B”, will first be reviewed by the PO in the 
Branch Office (BO) to check for any missing data, information or un-addressed issues. 
The sub-project document and the EIA, including the environmental self monitoring plan 
are then sent to the Unit Head (UH). The UH may forward a copy of the sub-project 
document and the EIA to either: 
-
External Environmental Reviewer (EER), or 
-
Environmental Coordinator “ECO” within the Water and Environment 
Unit.  
Or, in case he/she is satisfied with the EIA, may decide to submit the sub-project 
documents to the Sub-projects' Approval Committee. 
The External Environmental Reviewer (EER) (or Environment Coordinator ”EC”) will 
provide back to the UH his comments and opinion concerning the EIA. In particular 
he/she will evaluate and comment on the proposed mitigation measures, as well as the 
environmental self-monitoring and reporting plan.  
 
The EIA for class "A" sub-project conducted by a qualified Consultant from the shortlist 
agreed with EPA shall be first reviewed by the PO for any missing data or un-addressed 
Page  10
SFD Environment Management Plan
 
10/50                                                       
 
issues, then submitted to the UH for review and then sent to the EPA with a cover letter 
requesting the approval.  
 
The sub-project document including the EIA Form (A or B) as well as the opinion of the 
EER (or EC) in case of class B and EPA in case of class A, are then put forward to the 
Project Approval Committee (PAC). In case the sub-project site is changed after 
approval, the EIA would have to be re-conducted for the new site.  
 
4.4. Environmental Self Monitoring, Reporting and Periodic Inspection 
 
Construction Phase:
During construction, the Sponsoring Agency (SA) is responsible to ensure that mitigation 
measures are being implemented. During this phase the sub-project consultant would 
include in his/her periodic reports the status of the environmental concerns and the 
progress concerning implementation of the mitigation measures as reflected in the EIA 
and sub-project document. The PO reviews the periodic reports and follows-up 
periodically to ensure that environmental mitigation measures are being implemented. 
 
On the other hand, quality assurance visits that are conducted frequently by the technical 
unit will be enriched to include the environmental issues.  
 
Operation Phase:
The party assigned for implementing the self monitoring plan, would be required to 
prepare and present to the PO periodic self monitoring reports as stipulated in the self 
monitoring plan. These self monitoring activities would be simple, straightforward and 
would have been already agreed to in the self-monitoring plan and presented with the 
EIA. The Environmental Coordinator (ECO) within the Water and Environment Unit will 
review the environmental self monitoring reports, and will periodically inspect sub-
projects for environmental compliance and performance.  
 
4.5. Environmental Education, Training and Awareness 
 
To be able to efficiently implement the (EMP), it is important to provide to the SFD staff 
as well as the SFD consultants focused environmental training and awareness. The 
following environmental educational and training events are required as a minimum: 
-
Present the updated EMP and explain its objectives and benefits. 
The process as well as roles and responsibilities will also be 
presented and discussed. Guidelines and checklists also will be 
provided and explained.  
-
Qualify consultants with previous records in environment studies 
to be hired for class "A" EIA studies and Annual Environmental 
Audit 
 
4.6.  Environmental Auditing and Reporting  
 
Annually an environmental consultant will be recruited to conduct an environmental 
compliance and performance audit. An audit report will be presented jointly by the 
Page  11
SFD Environment Management Plan
 
11/50                                                       
 
consultant and the Environmental Coordinator (ECO), and presented to SFD 
management. Based on the findings of this report, the Managing  
Director (MD) will 
forward an “Annual Environmental Report” to the World Bank. 
 
5.  Requirements of Environment Impact Assessment (EIA): 
 
The requirements of EIA will vary according to the sub-project classification.  
For class "B" sub-projects, as the potential impacts are limited to the sub-project site, the 
consultants hired to conduct the sub-project study will be capable to conduct the simple 
EIA study required for this type of sub-projects. However, training the consultants on the 
SFD’s EMP and all its requirement including environmental screening form ( B), 
potential environmental impacts, mitigation measures, self monitoring and follow up 
indicators will be needed. The task of conducting the simple EIA shall be included in the 
ToR for the study of the sub-project. 
 
For class "A" sub-projects, as the potential impacts are high in terms of magnitude and 
scope, special arrangement is needed. To avoid conflict of interest and to come out with 
high quality EIA study, it is recommended that the EIA study shouldn’t be conducted by 
the same consultant hired for the sub-project study, but should be conducted by a 
qualified consultant selected from the short list approved by SFD and the EPA. 
Therefore, SFD will need a list of qualified consultants to conduct the EIA for class "A" 
sub-projects as well as the Annual Environmental Audit. To have this list, training 
courses for consultants with previous records on environmental studies shall be 
conducted and ended with screening exam to come out with the required list. And as the 
EIA for class "A" shall be approved by the EPA, all the process shall be done with the 
full participation of EPA, and the final list shall be approved by both SFD and EPA.  
Annex (1) shows the estimated budget for training SFD staff, and consultants for class 
"B" and "A" sub-projects through SFD IV.

Annex (6) 
SFD’s interventions in the field of Cultural Heritage (C.H.) 
Refined Vision for Phase IV (2011-2015) 
 
Introduction 
 
Yemen enjoys a rich, diverse and very much endangered cultural heritage expressed 
by its unique architecture, cultural landscape, antiquities, traditional handicrafts, 
music, costume & ritual, dialects, wealth of manuscripts and other aspects all 
representing a strong expression of deep rooted civilization, national identity as well 
as a considerable potential economic resource. 
 
While employing SFD’s capacity and managerial advantage was a much needed 
contribution to the national C.H. preservation efforts, safeguarding and preserving this 
heritage was also regarded increasingly by SFD as a possible area for addition to its 
poverty alleviation efforts from the perspective of the generating temporary and 
longer term employment as well as from the poverty targeting perspective. 
 
SFD’s relation to Cultural Heritage has evolved from no intervention, as C.H was not 
foreseen as one of SFD’s areas of action upon its establishment to a careful limited 
intervention by the year 99 till C.H became officially one of its supported sectors 
since the start of the second phase. 
 
By 2002 SFD became the most important and active partner to the Ministry of Culture 
as regarded by the World Bank and others. SFD’s operations increased and developed 
further to become more diverse and achieve wider geographical coverage putting the 
Social Fund as the first player in this area at the national level. 
 
However, the size and nature of threats facing different cultural heritage assets is 
simply much bigger than to be addressed by SFD’s efforts; it is even beyond Yemen’s 
resources and capacity if best used for safeguarding its rich, diverse, and patrimony. 
 
While poverty, lack of awareness, social, urban and architectural metamorphosis in 
addition to other factors coalesce with the time caused decay to form an accelerating 
threat to Yemeni Cultural Heritage assets; concerned agencies experience chronic 
structural weaknesses at the managerial & technical levels in addition to the lack of 
adequate legislative bases and financial resources enabling to play an effective role in 
protecting Yemen’s C.H. which makes a catastrophic picture for the current situation 
and less optimistic for the future. 
 
As Yemen’s well known genuine architecture represents the most immediate symbol 
of its rich culture and the strongest expression of its heritage, SFD initially directed its 
operations to the built heritage as to document and save as many endangered 
important sites and monuments as possible, and to enhance the conservation status of 
historic cities, especially those inscribed in the World Heritage. 
 
Over the time SFD’s interventions grew and became more diverse addressing various 
aspects of tangible and intangible heritage to the extent allowed by the technical and 
financial capacity. Generally, the implemented interventions were of high technical

quality and represented a real; much needed improvement in the conservation status 
of many endangered aspects of the country’s cultural heritage. 
 
Despite the above, a real progress towards improving the legislative, administrative, 
managerial and technical environment still stands as a fundamental requirement for 
saving Yemen’s cultural heritage and avoiding a regrettable loss of the important 
value it bears.  
 
Directions of SFD IV relating to Cultural Heritage activities 
 
Towards the fourth phase of its operations, SFD still considers the continuation of 
rescuing and restoring endangered significant sites and monuments in addition to 
improving conservation status of Yemeni historic cities as a necessary, realistic and 
badly needed strategy. This is due to the fact that endangered assets cannot wait till 
sufficient improvement of the institutional and legislative environment gets achieved, 
as many of those sites and monuments could collapse, disappear or fall beyond 
restoration if SFD’s continued interventions do not take place. 
 
However, SFD recognizes the importance of expanding and scaling up its 
interventions in the area of urban conservation by 
enhancing the national capacity at 
the central and local levels
 in protecting historic cities against negative effects of 
accelerated urbanization on their authentic urban fabric, and architectural traditional 
styles. This will be given a steadily growing attention throughout the upcoming phase, 
particularly through the ongoing program “
Development of Historic Cities of Yemen
”
co-financed by SFD.   
 
For this positive effort to preserve cultural assets, SFD is using qualified national and 
international expertise to secure quality interventions, trying at the same time to 
enhance and expand national technical capacity. The French Government has 
seconded a cultural heritage expert to work with SFD. SFD has secured Yemen's 
membership in the International Center for studying Conservation of the Cultural 
property (ICCROM) of UNESCO, in addition of carrying out a number of explicit 
activities for technical and institutional capacity building for relevant partners. 
Recently, SFD and the Ministry of Culture have signed a MOU which supports SFD's 
vision in Phase IV, and both parties sides will work together to achieve critical 
objectives. Some of these include: (i) convincing and providing support to the 
Ministry of Higher Education to adopt standard conservation as a mandatory subject 
in the curricula of Architecture and Engineering faculties in Public and Private 
universities, and (ii) pushing forward the draft of the Preservation of the Historic 
Cities and Sites law, which represent the absolute necessary legislative basis for 
protecting Yemen's Cultural Heritage. Currently Yemen does not have any guidelines 
for preservation and restoration of cultural heritage. 
 
In Phase IV, a growing number of projects will enhance SFD’s interventions links to 
the direct capacity building, developmental needs and employment issues. Temporary 
and longer term 
employment
 will be among the major and default indicators of C.H. 
projects. 
 
Such evolution in SFD’s strategies in C.H. will also enhance effectiveness of SFD’s 
contribution towards protecting Yemen’s endangered heritage through wider coverage

and probably longer term impact, in comparison with exclusively focused support on 
saving individual sites and monuments
—although the latter will continue to represent 
a
major component.  
 
With the above in mind, the refined strategic lines through which SFD foresees the 
delivery of its overall contribution to the national Cultural Heritage preservation 
efforts will be stated as follows:   
 
·
Contribution to the conservation of main historic sites especially those 
inscribed in the World Heritage sites and those of architectural importance; 
·
Expansion of the nation’s technical, professional and managerial capacity at 
different levels to protect cultural heritage; 
·
Assisting in the establishment of inventories of the country’s cultural heritage 
assets; 
·
Saving 
the 
most 
threatened 
most 
significant 
sites 
and 
monuments             
(Given the large number and diversity of threatened assets); and 
·
Exploring possibilities and piloting operations to associate Cultural Heritage 
with development and the use of different C.H assets as means of income 
generation. 
 
Quality assurance for SFD’s Cultural Heritage interventions 
 
SFD has a separate Cultural Heritage Unit.  
 
Though C.H. conservation projects of SFD follow and use traditional 
–still living- 
traditional building skills & methods, SFD benefits from regional and international 
expertise to ensure quality of interventions to comply with international standards, 
especially in major conservation operations (main monuments and interventions 
within historic cities inscribed in the World Heritage). 
 
SFD’s project officers, national consultants and trainees from relevant Governmental 
Organizations participated in special training events where they were introduced to 
the concepts of preservation and to the international relevant charters and practices 
(i.e. Venice Charter, Borra Charter and the Narra Document in particular - with which 
the major operations comply). Officers from SFD C.H. Unit attended further 
specialized courses organized by ICCROM- Athar program. 
 
Meanwhile, a number of specialized experts
2
lead and also provide technical 
supervision for SFD’s main conservation operations through direct on-site supervision 
or regular visits that take place on monthly, bi-monthly & semi annually basis.
