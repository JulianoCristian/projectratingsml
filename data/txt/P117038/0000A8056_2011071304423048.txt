                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project's closing date has been extended to December 31, 2011. The Project had been making good progress till beginning of March 2011 when the prevailing country situation
                         started to make an impact on the implementation. The Bank has not been able to release the Project funds since mid-March which prevented from paying cash benefits to 40,000
                         beneficiaries for Temporary Cash Assistance Program. Meanwhile the Workfare Assistance Program has been less affected though price increase in material and fuel cost and the
                         security situation are beginning to have an impact.
