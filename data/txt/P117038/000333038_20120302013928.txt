                                      Extension of Closing Date


          Republic of Yemen — Emergency Social Safety Net Enhancement Project (P117038)
              European Union Food Crisis Rapid Response Facilty Grant No. TF095879

                                         Restructuring Paper

1.       This restructuring paper seeks the approval of the Regional Vice President to retroactively extend
the Closing Date of Grant Agreement No. TF095879 from December 31, 2011 until June 30, 2012. The
Project Development Objective is to contribute to the reduction of the negative impact of food price
volatility on the poor and vulnerable in selected areas, and support the protection and building of
community assets in poor communities.

Project Implementation Progress

2.       The Grant was approved by the Vice President for the Middle East and North Africa Region on
March 16, 2010, for a total of EUR 17.5 million, and became effective on April 27, 2010. The Grant
Closing Date was first extended from June 30, 2011 to December 31, 2011. This would be the second and
final extension of the Grant Closing Date. No modification is proposed to the Project.

3.        The Project had been making good progress until the beginning of March 2011 when the
prevailing country situation started to have an impact on implementation. The cash assistance support for
the first three months (September, October and November 2010) was transferred to 40,000 households in
November 2010, and the Project was not able to make transfers for the remaining 9 months until
November 11, 2011 when a pending withdrawal application of Euro 3.4 million which covers a six-month
transfer (December 2010 through May 2011) was released.

4.      The Government of Yemen, through its letter Ref. No. 3363 dated December 7, 2011, requested
that the Closing Date of the Grant (TF09589) be extended from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012.
OP/BP 13.30 prohibits extension of the Closing Date for Projects under suspension [para 6 (b)].
However, BP 13.30, paragraph 9 allows the Bank to delay the Closure of the Grant Account and
Cancellation of the Grant Funds. Consequently, by letter dated December 21, 2011, the Bank delayed the
closure of the Grant Account and Cancellation of the Grant Funds until the suspension was lifted.
Suspension was lifted on January 20, 2012.

Justifications for the Extension of the Grant Closing Date

5.       The proposed extension is necessary to allow the Social Welfare Fund to complete the cash
transfer to 40,000 households which has been delayed due to the prevailing country situation and the
consequent suspension of disbursement for the Yemen portfolio on July 28, 2011.

6.      In accordance with OP 13.30, the team confirms that: (i) the Project Development Objective
continues to be achievable; (ii) the performance of the implementing agencies is satisfactory based on the
most recent supervision mission in December 2011; (iii) an action plan has been prepared by the
Implementing Agency and agreed with the Bank to ensure successful completion of the Project; (iv) the
Grant is fully committed, and acceptable audit reports have been received for the 2010 calendar year; and
(v) suspension of disbursement was lifted on January 20, 2012.
