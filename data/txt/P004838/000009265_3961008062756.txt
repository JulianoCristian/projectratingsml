MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIET NAM
FOR A NATIONAL HEALTH SUPPORT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum  and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for SDR 68 million
(US$101.2 million equivalent), on standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity and 10 years grace,
to help finance a National Health Support Project (NHSP).
2.    Country/Sector Background. Viet Nam  has undergone a period  of successful
macroeconomic stabilization, structural reform, and adjustment to external shocks. While growth
performance and future prospects are good, Viet Nam remains a very low-income country with a
per capita GDP of less than US$200. The policy challenge for the 1990s lies in taking advantage
of Viet Nam's substantial growth potential while at the same time ensuring widespread
participation in the benefits of development. Ensuring access for the poor to basic social services
will be essential to this effort.
3.    Viet Nam's past record on health and fertility improvements has been impressive and
matched by few low-income countries. Beginning in the mid-1970s, however, a number of
problems arose. Among these were sharply diminished external assistance to the sector, acute
macroeconomic instability and a deepening fiscal crisis in the mid-1980s. Under these
circumstances, inputs to the sector--drugs, equipment, medical supplies, maintenance--began
declining. A well-functioning health service system has therefore been breaking down. As a
result of declines in the quality of service, utilization rates have plummeted--outpatient
consultations have fallen by half from 1987 to 1993. Consequently, past gains in health are
threatened. For example, there has been a major resurgence of malaria. Malnutrition rates are
some of the highest in South and Southeast Asia.
4.    At the same time the sector has had to address a new set of policy and planning challenges
presented by the transition to the market economy. Liberalization measures have included
introduction of user fees, legalization of private practice, and sale of drugs on the open market as
well as liberalization of the pharmaceutical industry. Government is particularly concerned about
the impact of these measures on the poor. There is a belief that the private sector can do more in
health but policy makers are unsure how to delineate public-private roles. Expenditures by the
private sector are by far the largest source of financing for health care; mostly in the form of self-
medication through purchase of drugs. The state budget paid for about 16 percent of all health
expenditures in 1993. Given this reality, it is especially important that the Government improve
its capacity to ensure that public spending on health reaches the poor. Currently, less than five
percent of the total public funding is directed to preventative care in rural areas. Similarly, total
health subsidies for the better off are more than double those for the poor.
5.    The challenge for the sector is to revitalize the grass roots health delivery system to
provide better quality care, especially in the poorer underserved areas of the country, with a focus
on preventative, promotive and early treatment programs.  Given current trends, without



- 2 -
Government intervention the basic infrastructure for delivering publicly funded programs like
malaria control, immunization, family planning and other community health services that are not
amenable to fee for service arrangements could be greatly weakened. Thus, there is a need to
secure an essential infrastructure for delivering public health services with large collective benefits
in which market mechanisms are known to fail. At the same time the Government's capacity to
foster private financing of health care and private provision of quality health care needs to be
strengthened. This will necessarily involve efforts to improve its policy formulation capability.
Given its long-standing commitment to equity, the Government is especially keen to strengthen its
ability to formulate policies that more effectively address the health needs of the poor.
6.    Project Objectives. The project's overall objective is to improve the health status of the
rural population of Viet Nam in the poorer areas of the country. Specifically, it would aim to: (a)
provide high quality, reliable primary health care on a sustainable basis in fifteen of the poorer
provinces; (b) reduce nationwide mortality and morbidity due to malaria, tuberculosis and acute
respiratory infections (diseases that disproportionately afflict the poor), as well as the adverse
socio-economic impacts associated with these diseases; and (c) strengthen the capacity of the
Ministry of Health (MOH) and provincial health departments in policy-formulation, planning and
management in order to better achieve the above objectives, with a particular focus on improving
the capacity to ensure that the basic health needs of the poor are met.
7.    Project Description. To achieve its objectives, the project would finance the following
components: (a) Service Delivery (US$60.1 million or 52 percent of the total base cost) in the
areas of: (i) infectious and communicable diseases, (ii) maternal and child health care, (iii) family
planning, (iv) reproductive health services, (v) and other basic health care; b) National Program
Assistance for the Malaria, Tuberculosis and Acute Respiratory Infection Programs (US$51.4
million or 44 percent of the total base cost), including provision of (i) drugs, (ii) insecticides, (iii)
transport and equipment, and (iv) technical assistance, in order to attain full coverage according
to the plans for each national program; and (c) Strengthening Institutional Health Planning and
Management (US$4.7 million or 4 percent of the total base cost) including support for: (i)
improving the planning and management of health public expenditures; (ii) improving capacity to
mobilize private financing for health and private capacities for providing health care services; and
(iii) generating population-based household data and analyses to facilitate more effective and
equitable health sector planning and management. Fourteen indicators will measure project impact
and implementation progress for the components, e.g., infant mortality and TB case-finding rates.
8.    Project Cost and Financing.  Total project cost is estimated at US$127.3 million
equivalent including taxes, or US$123.8 million excluding taxes, with a foreign exchange
component of US$84.5 million (66 percent of project cost). The proposed Credit of SDR 68
million (US$101.2 million equivalent) would finance about 79.5 percent of the total project costs
net of taxes. The remainder would be financed by a grant from the Swedish International
Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) of US$4.7 million equivalent, a grant of US$4.3
million equivalent from the Netherlands Government, and a Government contribution of US$17
million. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursement and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule
B. A timetable of the project's key processing steps and the status of Bank Group operations in
Viet Nam are shown in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR No.
14971 VN), dated December 22, 1995, is being distributed separately.



- 3 -
9.    Project Implementation. The project would be implemented over a seven year period by
the Ministry of Health and the local governments of project provinces. Day-to-day project
management would be the responsibility of a Project Management Unit (PMU) reporting to the
Minister, and corresponding Provincial Project Implementation Units in the 15 project provinces.
Overall guidance for the project would be provided by a ministerial-level Steering Committee
comprising the Ministries of Health, Finance, and Planning and Investment, the National
Committee for Population and Family Planning, and the State Bank of Viet Nam. Technical
implementation of various components would be the responsibility of corresponding existing
departments and institutes in MOH.
10.   Project Sustainability. The annual recurrent cost burden of the project has been estimated
to represent less than one percent of the projected national health budget at the end of the project.
The key interventions of the project have been chosen because they address a large disease burden
in Viet Nam, especially among the poor. They are also ones which World Development 1993:
Investing in Health specifically indicates are highly cost effective. As such they constitute
interventions that should result in demonstrable gains in health status and thus be ones the
Government would want to sustain. With respect to the project's focus on the poor, there is
concern in the Government that regional inequalities could worsen in the near term in the course
of anticipated overall economic growth. Thus, for the foreseeable future there is likely to be
political support for directing resources to improving health care in the poorer provinces targeted
by the project. However, the current system is inefficient in that the bulk of public resources go
to large hospitals, in part due to demand caused by failures at lower levels in the health system.
The project aims to strengthen local delivery systems, thus lessening the demand for higher level,
more expensive care; make more transparent the MOH's resource allocation process so that
resources increasingly can go to provision of more cost-effective health services; and facilitate
increased private financing of care thus lessening the burden on public funding of health care.
Together these measures should lead to a more sustainable health sector.
11.   IDA must nonetheless be concerned with the issue of the Government's commitment to
sustaining the project objectives well after the completion of the project. This issue must be
viewed from a sector perspective and not only a project one. As the project progresses, IDA's
overall policy dialogue will need to explicitly focus on the issue of sustainability, with two
dimensions. The macroeconomic work to be carried out under the proposed SAC II would
address the issue of overall allocations for the sector. The work carried out at the sectoral level
under the public expenditure component of the project would focus on the composition of these
allocations, with particular attention to encouraging adequate investments in priority public health
areas. These two concerns would then be brought together during the project mid-term review in
the form of an exchange of views between the Government and IDA concerning long-term
investments in the sector. In addition, IDA would also need to play a role in encouraging other
donors to reinforce the emphasis on having the Government sustain investments in public health.
12.   Lessons from Previous Bank Experience. IDA has experience with only one social sector
project in Viet Nam, the Primary Education Project. Relatively slow initial implementation
progress in this project highlights the need for investments in helping counterpart agency
personnel become fully familiar with IDA procedures such as procurement. However, subsequent
projects will clearly benefit from the knowledge that is now accumulating in the Government
about these matters, e.g., formulation of standardized bidding documents.

13.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. IDA's goal in Viet Nam as articulated in the CAS
(discussed by the Executive Directors on November 21, 1995) is to promote broad-based
economic development and to combat poverty. The project would contribute especially to the
latter objective. A key element of IDA's strategy is to assist in the provision of basic social
services to poor households. The project responds directly to the findings of IDA's Viet Namm:
Poverty Assessment and Strategy (Report No. 13442-VN), in particular that insufficient resources
are being directed to providing essential public health care in rural areas, especially in poorer
provinces, while public subsidies for health are primarily going to those most able to afford this
care. The project is also one means to further IDA's commitment to assist the Government in its
transition to a market economy by supporting the development of policies that promote cost
recovery.
14.   IDA initially became involved in the sector through the production of the Population,
Nutrition and Health Sector Review  (No. 10289-VN) in 1992, which set out the first
comprehensive description and analysis of the sector. IDA's first operational involvement will
provide assistance for addressing the needs of the sector through three distinct yet interdependent
initiatives. In addition to the NHSP, a proposed concurrent IDA-funded Population and Family
Health Project (PFBP) would provide similar support at the grass roots level in an additional 15
provinces, while also strengthening capacity nationwide to foster achievement of population and
family health objectives. A third proposed Child Nutrition and Development Project would
concentrate on reducing Viet Nam's strikingly high child malnutrition rates. In addition, these
projects will complement the IDA-funded Primary Education Project (Cr. 2548-VN) by
reinforcing investment in female education through investment in women's health.
15.   IDA is also increasingly playing a role in providing leadership for donor efforts to build
institutional capacity in MOH for policy work. The Government has indicated its interest in
having IDA play a larger role in overall donor coordination in the sector.  Given IDA's
contribution in the area of policy, this should have added value for overall donor assistance.
16.   Agreed Actions. During negotiations, the following principal agreements were reached
with Government: (a) the local health facilities to receive project support would be selected,
staffed (including provision for adequate staff funding), and maintained on the basis of criteria
agreed with IDA; (b) selected key indicators would be used to monitor and evaluate
implementation progress and project impact; (c) semi-annual progress reports would be provided
to IDA not later than June 30 and December 31 of each year; (d) by March 31, 1999, a
comprehensive mid-term review of project implementation would be carried out on the basis of
terms of reference developed in consultation with IDA; (e) surveys, studies and training would be
undertaken to ensure the informed participation of, and consultation with, ethnic minority
communities; and (f) by September 30, 1996, IDA would be furnished with the Government's
strategy for implementing its cost recovery policy for essential drugs and medical supplies in
project provinces and provision of these drugs and supplies free of charge in mountainous and
remote areas of project provinces. Both approaches would be discussed with IDA and receive
special attention during the mid-term review.
17.   The following would be conditions of credit effectiveness:  (a) the Project Steering
Committee, (b) the Project Management Unit, and (c) the Provincial Project Implementation
Units would have been established and the managers of (b) and (c) would have been appointed.

18.   Poverty Category. Viet Nam's GNP per capita of less than US$200 ranks it as one of the
poorest countries of the world. The project aims to improve basic health services at the grass
roots. Hence it contributes to poverty alleviation and is self-targeted towards the rural poor. It
also will improve access to health services for disadvantaged and isolated ethnic minorities, who
are among the poorest and most underserved groups in Viet Nam. The program is therefore
poverty-focused and falls under the category "Program of Targeted Interventions."
19.   Environmental Aspects. The project would not have a negative effect on the environment
It has been ranked "C" for environmental assessment purposes. In the long term, an effective
primary health care system which includes adequate provision of family planning and family health
services will lower fertility rates and reduce environmental pressures associated with rapid
population growth.
20.   Program Objective Categories. The project would invest in improvements in basic health
services in provinces selected for their poverty and unfavorable health indicators, with a particular
focus on improved health services for women and children. These are not only cost-effective
public health interventions but would also support poverty alleviation and enhance the
participation of women in development.
21.   Participatory Approach. Through the PHRD grant for project preparation, MOH worked
to involve provincial, district and commune health officials in the design, planning and preparation
of the project. Five regional workshops of several days each were held throughout the country in
which provincial and local health officials systematically reviewed and commented on all
components of the project. Provincial Implementation Units will be set up in the 15 project
provinces where primary health services are to be upgraded. They will be asked to provide
regular feedback to MOH and IDA on the process of project implementation, including the
participatory processes being followed.
22.   Project Benefits. The project would result in better health for people in rural areas of 15 of
the poorest provinces in Viet Nam through improvements in the grass roots health delivery
systems. Upgraded health facilities that are equipped with adequate equipment and essential drug
supplies and staffed by personnel who have had their skills and knowledge improved through
retraining, would result in a much improved primary health care system that delivers quality care.
Some 500,000 women requiring maternal care, about 1.2 million children under three years of age
and around 1.2 million contraceptors would benefit annually. Given similar inputs from IDA's
proposed concurrent PFH project in an additional 15 provinces, over half of Viet Nam's 53
provinces would benefit. This would result in significant overall improvements in health status in
the country.
23.   The project's support to national communicable disease control programs would result in
a substantial reduction over time in morbidity and mortality due to malaria, tuberculosis, and
ARI. As both malaria (35 million people at risk) and tuberculosis (about 55,000 new cases
annually) lead to reduced productivity in the labor force on the part of those infected, these
reductions would have important benefits to the economy. Moreover, when such programs are
effectively implemented, especially in the case of tuberculosis, reductions in the number of new
cases are usually long-term. Thus, there are also economic gains to the health system as a
consequence of reducing the current substantial costs of treatment.



- 6 -
24.   The project's focus on building institutional capacity for policy formulation would result in
a strengthened Government capacity to develop policies for the sector that lead to a more
effective and efficient use of sector resources over the long term. An important corollary to this
would be increased capacity of the Government to achieve its objective of more effectively
targeting health resources for the benefit of the poor. Also, improvements in the Government's
ability to mobilize private financing of health care by those able to pay for it, as well as its ability
to promote quality provision of private health care, should lessen pressures on the public budget
for financing health services and free up resources that can be directed to the needs of the poor.
25.   Risks. There are three main risks. The first is that the Government will not provide the
financial resources necessary to guarantee the salaries of commune health center workers over
time. Without this, the other grass roots inputs will have minimal impact. During negotiations,
the Government provided assurances that funds for commune health worker salaries would be
provided in the fifteen provinces. Adherence to this agreement will be closely monitored during
project life. A second risk has to do with the generally weak implementation capacity of MOH to
manage the project at all levels, which could lead to delays in project implementation. Of
particular importance is the need for a strong Project Management Unit with qualified, adequately
supported staff. During negotiations, Government gave assurances that adequate staffing and
financing for the PMU would be provided. In addition, extensive training for PMU staff in IDA
procedures is planned prior to implementation.
26.   A third risk relates to the previous two. An underlying assumption of the project is that,
once rural facilities are properly staffed and equipped, their utilization rates will rise as people
regain confidence in the services available. These services are unlikely to be found elsewhere as
they are for the most part not ones that the private sector would provide. However, people will
return to public health facilities only if they are convinced, by the quality of care they receive and
by the outreach functions of these facilities, that doing so results in better health. This fact
reinforces the importance of project interventions that are technically sound and that can be
effectively implemented so as to clearly demonstrate their utility to those that need them most. It
will be important, therefore, to closely monitor response to the provision of services. A set of
performance indicators was agreed upon at appraisal.  In the course of annual workplan
discussions and the mid-term review, progress with respect to these indicators will be reviewed
and adjustments made to the project as necessary.
27.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
