F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower in improving the health status of the
rural population in the poorer areas of Viet Nam by (i) providing high quality, reliable
primary health care on a sustainable basis in 15 of the poorer provinces; (ii) reducing


                                              ii

mortality and morbidity due to malaria, tuberculosis and acute respiratory infections
(diseases that disproportionately afflict the poor) as well as the adverse socioeconomic
impact associated with these diseases; and (iii) Strengthening the capacity of the MOH in
policy-formulation, planning and management in order to better achieve the above
objectives, with a particular focus on improving the capacity to ensure that the basic
health needs of the poor are met.

(incl. %        inclusion of some of the poorest provinces in the project, which tend to have

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
At the time of project preparation, Vietnam was undergoing a major transition from a
centrally planned economy to a market economy. In the early 1990s, the Vietnam
economy was just beginning to stabilize, following decades of economic crises in the
1970s and 1980s - a period characterized by the vestiges of a protracted war, weak
government policies, a less supportive international environment and the collapse of the
Soviet Union and with it, financial support from former countries of the communist bloc.
Pivotal change in economic reforms started with the initiation of the Doi Moi reforms, in
1986, which culminated in significant achievements in economic growth in the ensuing
decades. Annual GDP growth averaged 7% in the 1989-92 adjustment periods, driven by
strong exports and fiscal discipline that reduced inflation from 400% in 1988 to 5.2% by
1993. However, challenges remained. The per capita GNP was below US$200 in 1993;
poverty incidence was high (average poverty rate in 1993 was 58.1%) and disparities
persisted. Poverty was largely concentrated in rural areas (66.4% in rural versus 25.1% in
urban areas), among ethnic minorities, and had a regional dimension (poverty rates were
highest in mountainous areas). In recognition of these inequalities, the government
developed an extensive system of social programs and safety nets. However, since the
1980s, the quality and quantity of the programs rapidly deteriorated and health was no
exception.

Significant improvements in health outcomes were achieved, with gains realized in most
health status indicators. Occurring in parallel to these changes in the macroeconomic
environment, Vietnam experienced significant and impressive improvements in health
status. Life expectancy at birth had increased, total fertility rate dropped from about 6.0
per woman in 1975-80 to near replacement levels today. Infant and maternal mortality
rates also declined. These improvements in health outcomes were attributed to strong
political commitment at all levels, relatively high literacy rates among women, a vast
network of primary health care services (in particular at the commune levels, managed by
cooperatives) and focused programming on preventable diseases (such as malaria,
vaccine-preventable diseases) through targeted vertical programs. However, significant
public health challenges persisted. Malnutrition rates were still among the highest in the
region. Unmet needs for family planning1 were estimated at 44% of women, and modern
methods of family planning were largely unavailable. Resurgence in infectious diseases
such as Malaria, Tuberculosis, and the emergence of new infectious diseases such as
HIV/AIDS, SARS and Avian Influenza were being observed. Akin to trends in poverty,
the improvements in health outcomes had not progressed uniformly. Most indices, such
as MMR and IMR were worse among ethnic minorities, in remote areas, and within
certain geographical regions.

Reduction in investments in the health sector led to a deterioration in quality of care and
decline in utilization, mostly of the CHCs. The dismantling of the community cooperative
networks, sharply diminished external support to the sector, macroeconomic instability
and fiscal crises of the mid-1980s all contributed to this. Many CHCs had deplorable
infrastructure,   lacked    very    basic   equipment     and   were     inadequately    staffed.
Unsurprisingly, the quality of services deteriorated, and utilization of such facilities
declined over the years. The poor were disproportionately affected, because, whereas
CHCs were more likely to be utilized by the poor (0.24 contact rate vs. 0.12 for the
richest quintile), the better off tended to utilize other public facilities and private clinics.

Rationale for Bank investment. The Investment in the Health Sector at this time was
consistent with the 1995 Country Assistance Strategy for Vietnam which cited the
improvement of health and education for human resource development as key activities
under one of the pillars of the CAS ­ Poverty Alleviation. In addition, the Sector Work
`Vietnam: Population, Health and Nutrition Sector Review' of 1992, supported by the
Bank, identified the key issues in the health sector and laid down the foundation upon
which Bank assistance to the sector was subsequently built. This project was the first
health sector project supported by the World Bank in Vietnam. At the same time, this
project complemented the Population and Family Health Project, which addressed a lot of
demand side issues. The Bank investment was very timely, given the rapidly deteriorating
state of the health infrastructure, in particular, of the commune and district level facilities
which primarily served the poor. The Bank's comparative advantage in its convening
power was also leveraged as other key donors ­ SIDA and the Netherlands participated in
this project. Finally, the project also built on the Bank's knowledge of the sector and
experience in similar countries around the world.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)
The objective of the project is to assist the borrower in improving the health status of the
rural population in the poorer areas of Viet Nam by (i) Providing high quality, reliable
primary health care on a sustainable basis in 15 of the poorer provinces; (ii) Reducing
mortality and morbidity due to malaria, tuberculosis and acute respiratory infections
(diseases that disproportionately afflict the poor) as well as the adverse socioeconomic
impact associated with these diseases; and (iii) Strengthening the capacity of the MOH in
policy-formulation, planning and management in order to better achieve the above
objectives, with a particular focus on improving the capacity to ensure that the basic
health needs of the poor are met.

About 14 key performance indicators targeted at the specific objectives/components of
the project were approved. They include in order:
    (A) For the first objective, (1) Proportion of total targeted CHCs that have been
        improved, (2) Proportion of improved DHCs of the targeted total, (3) Utilization
        of CHCs, (4) Infant Mortality Rate, and (5) Maternal Mortality Rate.
    (B) For the second objective, (6) Malaria Prevalence rate, (7) Malarial case fatality
        rate, (8) TB Case Finding rate, and (9) TB Cure rate.




                                                2

    (C) For the third objective, (10) Access to primary health care services, (11) Public
        funding to commune and district level facilities, (12) Progress on project
        disbursement, (13) Progress on credit disbursement, and (14) Actions in key
        policy areas.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification.
The PDO/indicators were not formally revised in the course of project implementation.
The project, within its stated objectives, allowed for enough flexibility to respond to the
changes that fitted within the overall development objectives during implementation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The project was designed to benefit the entire population, particularly with respect to the
national priority programs for Malaria, TB, and Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI), and
by better management of the health system through the enhancement of the policy-
making capacity of the MOH. The primary target groups of this project as identified in
the SAR were (i) Rural population in the poorer areas of the country, in particular poor
residents of the 15 poorest provinces who would benefit from improved quality of
services at the CHCs, ICPs and DHCs, and (ii) The poor and other vulnerable groups
disproportionately affected by infectious diseases (Malaria, TB and ARIs).

The intermediate beneficiaries identified were the health care workers delivering these
services who would benefit from training, and better working conditions; and the MOH
staff responsible for policy formulation and management who would also benefit from
capacity-building activities.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
The key components of the project and indicative costs were as follows:

Component 1: Assistance to Commune and District Health Centers (US$60.1 million
equivalent to SDR 40.4 million estimated base cost, of which US$52 million or SDR 35
million was spent).
   Disbursed           World Bank           Government        Netherlands         SIDA

This component aimed to improve essential public health services at the primary (CHC)
and first-referral level (DHC) facilities in 15 provinces selected according to specific
criteria outlined in the SAR. The subcomponents were: (1) A package of civil works to
upgrade or build new health facilities to meet certain minimum standards for service
delivery; (2) Provision of essential drugs, basic equipment and supplies to the CHCs and
DHCs; and (3) In-service training of health personnel to build capacity.

Component 2: Assistance to Three National Priority Programs (US$51.4 million
equivalent estimated base cost, of which US$39.8 million was spent).

This component aimed to support three already established national health programs for
malaria, tuberculosis, and ARI respectively.

(1) The National Malarial Control Program subcomponent aimed at protecting
populations at risk of malaria through locally effective anti-vector measures, improved
program management and epidemiological services. The project financed inputs such as
insecticides, equipment, transportation, training, and technical assistance.

(2) The National Tuberculosis Program aimed at reducing the TB incidence within the
general population as well as curing infected patients, through the attainment of a case
finding rate of 70% of new infectious patients and cure rate of 85% of all patients
enrolled in treatment. The project provided drugs, equipment, transportation, training and
operations support.

(3) The ARI Program aimed to extend coverage of ARI treatments services to 100
percent of children under-five years of age by the year 1999 through the provision of
inputs such as the training of workers, financing of drug treatment costs, and the large-
scale implementation of a case management approach.

This component aimed to improve the beneficial impact of policies affecting the health
sector by enhancing the capacity of the MOH to use several health sector planning and
management tools. The subcomponents included: (1) Improving the planning and
management of public expenditures for health by (a) Improving the budgeting,
accounting, and operational reporting systems of the central MOH hospitals and institutes,
provincial health departments, and the central MOH; and (b) Preparing a public
investment plan for the health sector; (2) Assisting the government in better mobilizing
private financing for health by improving the system of setting, charging and collecting
prices for publicly provided health services to better protect the poor and increase
revenues available to enhance the quality and quantity of these services; and preparing
proposals for further expanding private production of health services; (3) Generating
population-based household data and analysis for health sector planning.

1.6 Revised Components
The project was not formally restructured. Hence, no major revisions to the components
occurred. However, notably, there were some modifications to planned activities as
outlined below.

1.7 Other significant changes
The project was extended three times. The first extension (18 months from October 2003
to March 2005) was in order to support some of the activities under the TB sub-
component such as the procurement of drugs and equipment. The implementation of this
sub-component had only picked up steam after the mid term review. It was important to
maintain Bank support for this sound program, as the drugs financed under the project
were at that point absolutely critical to program performance and alternative financing
sources were not immediately available. Global Fund financing only became available
years after that.

The second extension (7 months, from March 31 2005 to October 31, 2005) was to allow
for completion of the unfinished procurement of TB equipment. Unfortunately the
changes in the management slowed down the procurement process and the lengthy
review and approval procedures of MOH attributed to further delays.

The third extension (1 year from October 2005 to October 2006) was to assist in the
Avian Influenza emergency response. The urgent need for a large amount of medical
equipment in the hospitals of the affected provinces could only be met by external
financial supports. Upon the request of the government, Bank management agreed on an
exceptional basis to allow a third extension so that remaining project funds could be used
to support preparation of a national plan and the purchase of critical equipment. The
national plan was prepared but the procurement of equipment was stalled because of
unacceptable technical specifications. The funds were then cancelled and the government
eventually purchased the needed equipment using their own funds. A new Avian Flu
operation which was better designed to respond to the emergency nature of the disease
was later prepared with Bank support.

Component 1:
· Number of beneficiary provinces changed from the original 15 at appraisal, to 18 at
    the end of the project. One of the provinces (Ha Bac) was split in two, Bac Giang and
    Bac Ninh; In addition, a decision was made in 2001 to expand investments to two
    new provinces.
· Construction of 55 Inter-commune Polyclinics (ICPs) in mountainous areas, with
    very limited access to DHs, was added to the project, based on the borrower's request.
· Some modifications were made in this component that included (i) a reduction in the
    civil works at commune level and an increase in civil works at district level; (ii)
    decreased investments in essential drugs (list decreased from 33 drugs to 7); and (iii)
    an increase in the number of training modules from 5 to 9.

Component 2:
In addition to the extension for supporting implementation of the national TB program,
there were changes in implementation arrangements, with the procurement management
responsibilities transferred from the PMU to National TB Program.

Component 3:
The activities under subcomponent 3.2 were replaced by three sets of activities ­ the
hospital inventory survey, a review on the health card for the poor program, and training
in health economics.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
The rapid transition and economic growth following the introduction of the Doi Moi
reforms in 1986 had an impact on the health sector. Vietnam had a good support for
health, with strong political commitment from the government, an extensive primary
health care network supported and financed by the rural cooperative system, and Central
Government support for National Target Programs that were performing well. The period
immediately preceding the project was characterized by a shift from collective to family-
based agriculture and, with that, an end of the collective revenue generation system of the
rural cooperatives, with the defunct status of the latter. This led to the depletion of funds
available for health at the commune level. Many services were either withdrawn or scaled
back, especially within CHCs in poorer areas. The widening quality gap that ensued was
compounded by the introduction of user fees and the legalization of the private sector in
1989.

The program benefited from the availability of sound analytical work such as the
Population, Health and Nutrition Sector Review 1992, the World Development Report
1993: Investing in Health, and the 1993 Vietnam Living Standards Survey. This Sector
Review among other things underscored the need to address access to health services at
the community-level. It also prioritized addressing diseases of public health concern such
as malaria, TB and ARI which disproportionately affect the poor. The project was fully
aligned with the national priorities of the Government and with the Country Assistance
Strategy which outlined investments in health and education as one of the key



                                             7

components in its poverty reduction strategy. The project was designed to be pro-poor,
and help improve basic social services that had deteriorated from years of fiscal crises.

The design of the Project focused on key areas that needed support and by doing so
contributed to the improvements of health outcomes, especially for the poor. The project
design responded to pertinent supply-side constraints in the health care system that
stemmed from years of underinvestment and deterioration of quality of care. Through its
focus on basic services for poor areas in particular to the CHCs, and activities that largely
benefit the poor as well as the three priority diseases, the project made important
contributions towards better health outcomes, especially for the poor. When taken
together with the Population and Family Health Project that was implemented in parallel
and which focused on demand side issues and reproductive health, the package provided
Vietnam with important investments for the health sector. The project could have paid
more attention to demand side interventions, especially those geared towards overcoming
financial barriers and changing the health-seeking behaviors of selected target groups.
Some of this was left to the Population and Family Health Project which was designed
around the same time and focused on demand side factors and social mobilization that
influenced health seeking behavior. Despite the complementarities of the two operations,
the project could have done more on demand side issues such as improving financial
access for the poor.

Despite the important focus areas, the design was complex and MOH faced important
challenges, especially in the area of procurement. The unfamiliarity of MOH with Bank
procedures and the complexity in design contributed to implementation delays. The
project design reflects three different approaches to supporting the health system: the
provision of specific inputs (supplies, drugs, equipment, civil works, and training) to the
health system; the support of Vertical National Targeted Programs; and building capacity.
It also included several financing sources. The MOH faced important challenges,
especially with procurement. As the first Bank financed project in the health sector, the
MOH was unfamiliar with ICB procedures for procurement of drugs and medical
equipment. Proficiency with such procedures is typically acquired by practice, and
usually only after about one or two ICB cycles have been completed. In spite of the
limited capacity, international TA on procurement was not included as it was not
considered an option in the country then, a situation that later changed with the
realization of the value of such TA in expediting procurement procedures and building
capacity. The project eventually served as a `training ground' for procurement staff who
subsequently worked in future donor-financed projects or in private sector. The
discrepancies between national procurement regulations and the Bank's procurement
guidelines contributed to the delays of large amount of procurement of equipment,
suppliers, and civil works. For instance, the National Competitive Bidding and Shopping
procedures contained seventeen discrepancies. It was therefore challenging to stay in
compliance with the international best practice. Adding to the delays, was the poor
communication and coordination among relevant departments, agencies, and institutions,
and the lengthy internal procedures for review and approval of procurement related
documentation at each stage of the cycle, e.g. planning, drafting, advertising, evaluation,
and contracting.

Over time, MOH made improvements as regards bidding document reviews, but
procurement planning, in particular cost estimations, remained a major obstacle. It was
not uncommon to have the annual procurement plan approved by mid-year. Although the
intention was to spend borrowed funds with care, the laborious process did not always
add value. In summary, this project shared most of the challenges faced by first
generation projects in the country, and provided valuable lessons to future projects in
design, capacity building, and procurement execution.

2.2 Implementation
The project was declared effective on May 24, 1996 and closed on October 31, 2006.
Overall, the project implemented key activities and was flexible in terms of meeting
client's changing demands over the ten-year period. The leadership in MOH provided
important policy support that aided the implementation process. However, frequent
delays in implementation were encountered due to limited capacity at national and
provincial levels and large amount of procurement involved for drugs, medical equipment,
and civil works. ICB and NCB procedures were new to the project staff as well as the
national bidders and contractors. Some of these constraints were project specific and
others were generic as also pointed out by the CPPR. The key implementation constraints
for this project include:

(i) Limited capacity at various levels especially the PMU in a relatively complex project -
At the national level, there was the PMU in place, managed by a Vice Minister as Project
Director. Lead persons were appointed for components 1 and 3, who in turn coordinated
with respective departments responsible for implementation of various activities.
Component 2 was implemented directly by the national institutes implementing the
national programs and overseen by the PMU. At the provincial level, a Project Manager
was appointed in each project province responsible for activities in their respective
provinces. Coordination became more challenging than expected especially given that
project managers and most of the staff were working only part-time on the project. There
were no provisions to hire consultants at that time, therefore only civil servants could be
contracted, with minimal financial incentives for the additional workload. Most of the
positions in the PMU were vacant at the initial stage of implementation. In later years, the
project faced a high turnover of project staff and had to continuously train new staff
throughout the project lifetime. Severe shortage of qualified staff plagued most of the
projects in the country. Although having a vice minister as project director showed strong
commitment of the MOH to the project, this often proved counterproductive, as the
director could not give time to day-to-day operations, but had to sign all contracts and
key communications to the Bank, resulting in frequent delays in getting documents
signed. Delegation of signing was not a common practice.

Lessons learned by the MOH were reflected in subsequent projects, whereby either the
project director or the deputy director now have to be full-time managers, supported by
civil servants, contracted staff and consultants, especially on procurement and
disbursement. Government counterpart funds provide salary supplements to the civil
servants, and consultants are paid at market prices. Same arrangements are made for



                                             9

provincial PMUs. More importantly, capacity at every level has been strengthened
gradually over the past ten years and MOH is in the process of decentralization,
switching from execution to stewardship functions on policy and regulations.

(ii) Procurement delays of ICB packages - In spite of repeated training workshops on
procurement, and some improvements in capacity, preparation of technical specifications
and evaluation of bids remained extremely challenging to the MOH evaluation group.
Some of these challenges include:

(1) Difficulty in reaching specification agreements. The review group normally consisted
of doctors and medical technicians who were familiar with only one or two preferred
brand names of equipment. Disagreements often ensued; resulting in several meetings,
repeated bid validity extensions and up to 5 to 6 month delays for major packages;

(2) The requirement in the national procurement regulation to reject bids above the
ceiling price. This discrepancy between the national procurement regulation and the
Bank's procurement guidelines was cited by several projects as a major obstacle in
implementation, and was raised as a country issue with MPI and the Government Office
in many occasions. Yet it remains unresolved;

(3) Slow decision-making process. There seemed to be a tendency for making collective
decisions in MOH on most of the procurement related issues ­ a situation worsened by
the `PMU 18' scandal in the press. Project staff and managers at various levels began
trying to avoid any misperception of corruption. The unwillingness to make decisions
became one of the major factors causing procurement delays in the last few years of
project implementation;

(4) Drug Procurement was particularly problematic, due to the uneven quality of the
products of drug suppliers from less regulated markets. Several times, the project had to
return whole containers after drug inspections were carried out. The issue though related
to procurement, could only be resolved at the regulatory level.

In general, health sector procurement has been challenging in most of the Bank financed
projects in many countries. This project does not seem to be an exception, although it
could have done better if public procurement reform in Vietnam has moved faster.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
An overall results framework was not prepared in full at the preparation stage. Indicators
were identified and were a mixture of overall goals and outcomes as well as some input
indicators, most times with no clear linkages with the PDOs or to project performance.
The vertical programs already had their own established M&E systems in place and had
clearer results frameworks. For components 1 and 3, the initial design was complex and
mixed in terms of what the project was trying to measure.

Implementation of the M&E was equally suboptimal, with no baseline information
collected for the indicators and no monitoring carried out. Two years into project



                                            10

implementation, an effort was made, in response to a government proposal to simplify the
M&E and to rely on routinely collected data from the MOH, however, this was not
effectively followed up, until 2002, when the Bank mission, began outlining a plan for
end of project evaluation.

While the indicators were not always appropriate and better for some components than
others, there was good data about the direction of the sector and the outcomes in project
supported provinces. Selected surveys also provided useful indicators as did some of the
project monitoring data. Still, attribution is difficult in this case as with several health
projects. For example, some indicators focused on higher level impacts, hence not
appropriate for determining project performance. IMR and MMR are such examples.

Overall, the M&E framework was mixed in terms of quality, and efforts in
implementation were insufficient. There was much room for doing more at the
preparation and implementation stages in this regards.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance.
No safeguard issues were triggered in this project. It was determined that the project
would not have any significant impact on the environment and there were no resettlement
issues triggered in the project.

Financial management: Throughout the life of the project, basic financial management
arrangements were in place to manage, control, account and record the funds and
transactions of the project and to manage the fixed assets. Internal controls such as
segregation of duties, fixed assets record/reconciliation, bank and cash reconciliation, and
reconciliation of funds received between the PMU's accounting software records and the
Bank's records were in place and operated satisfactorily (see sections 2.1 and 2. for
discussions of procurement practices and experience).

There were sufficient numbers of staff assigned to finance-related tasks and at central
level the such staff were experienced and adequately skilled. At the provincial level,
there were financial management capacity weaknesses and the Bank FM team worked
with the PMU to undertake a stock-taking of financial management capacity in the
provinces and to develop and implement training programs for Provincial PMU finance
staff, and to undertake regular review and monitoring of the provincial financial
management activities and reports. Assistance was provided to the project to produce
detailed and practical guidelines for the provincial accounting and reporting to support
more timely disbursements, accounting and reporting.

The major issue throughout the life of the project was the complicated hierarchy of
authority within the various Departments of the Ministry of Health and the high staff
turnover in such departments, which caused delays in approvals that affected
disbursement progress. Delays in approvals continued to impact on the completion of the
project with the selection of the independent auditor and signing of the audit contract for
the final audit of the project delayed more than six months.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
Since project completion, available primary health care services have improved. The
CHCs and DHCs are being utilized, health care workers have benefited from training and
capacity-building activities completed. Maintenance however remains a problematic
issue. The TB and Malaria programs continue to perform well. Additional financing for
these programs has been successfully mobilized from other sources such as the Global
Fund. ARI management is now integrated into the PHC service network. This project
generated a lot of lessons, which have been applied to subsequent Bank projects such as
(1) the adoption of a more focused regional approach to addressing health sector issues,
(2) increased focus on supporting demand-side interventions in subsequent Bank projects;
and (3) increased involvement of provincial level authorities in the design and
implementation of the project. Government and Bank have adopted these lessons into the
new operations.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The project was highly relevant at the time of its design and still remains so at the time of
this ICR, primarily because it addressed some of the key issues affecting the health sector.
At the time of the project design, the health infrastructure in Vietnam was in rapid decline
following the decrease in available financing for basic health services. Improving the
quality of basic services was important to support the revitalization of the health system
and improve services. The project objectives still reflect strategic priorities and vision of
the government for the health system as outlined in the objectives of the `Comprehensive
Development Design for the Health System in Vietnam to 2010 and vision by 2020.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Overall Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The objective of the project is to assist the borrower in improving the health status of the
rural population in the poorer areas of Vietnam by (i) providing high quality, reliable
primary health care on a sustainable basis; (ii) reducing mortality and morbidity due to
malaria, tuberculosis and acute respiratory infections; and (iii) strengthening the
institutional capacity of MOH and provincial health departments to meet the basic health
care needs of the poor. Despite data limitation and the problem of attribution, based on
the available information, achievement of the specific project development objectives is
rated `Moderately Satisfactory' overall. Although not directly attributable to this health
sector intervention, rural health status as outlined in the overall project objective has
improved2, as illustrated in the table below.

The project's contribution to this was through its focus on specific provinces which are
largely poor and rural. The investments at the CHC and VHW level health services,
which are more pertinent in rural areas, also helped ensure that poor rural communities
were the major beneficiaries of the investments. Most of the results and outcomes were
achieved and some exceeded the targets. At the same time, the project faced important
implementation challenges and the M & E framework could have been strengthened
significantly. Thus, and as will be noted below, the overall rating of the project is
Moderately Satisfactory. Given the unique nature of each individual component,
independent assessments of their achievements are reflected below:

Component 1: `Moderately Satisfactory'

The project improved the quality of available primary health care services within the
specific provinces in the country. The investments in the CHCs, where the poor access
basic services and which serve as point of convergence for preventive and curative
services for the poor, helped ensure that residents of the target communes had access to
CHCs that could provide basic care. The report from beneficiary assessment supported
the fact that the quality of services provided in the CHCs was perceived to have improved
as a result. It is also noteworthy that the approach adopted by the project helped create a
safety net against the potential collapse of primary health care services with the economic
and institutional changes that were taking place in country. An evaluation of the impact
of project investments using data from the NHS reported that, compared to matched non-
project provinces (which also received other investments), the CHCs in the project
provinces had better quality in terms of infrastructure, staff skills and morale, and
capabilities for performing basic functions. However, poor maintenance of the facilities
remained a threat to long term sustainability of the improved quality of care. CHCs built
by the project were often in worse state, requiring more repairs, compared to those in
matching communes. The government has since introduced new measures like the health
fund for the poor and increased supervision of CHCs by the Local People's Committee,
to provide financial support and new financing mechanisms for basic health services as
well as improved oversight of CHC management.

Secondly, the project through its well-targeted focus on poor areas of the country
improved the quality of health infrastructure available in some of the poorest areas of the
country thus creating a more equitable coverage of quality primary health care. There
was increased confidence of the local people in the quality of the commune health centers
in project areas (although an evaluation survey reported that the CHCs in the minority-
dominated communes fared worse in terms of quality compared to those where the Kinh
ethnic group formed the majority). This led to an increased utilization of project health
centers (10% more than in matched, non-project health centers, which had also received
investments from other sources in the same interval). This increase however, was mostly



                                             13

from utilization by the non-poor (richest 60% of households). This may be a result of
financial barriers to access for the poor, as well as a correlation between poverty,
educational levels, and health seeking behaviors - areas not directly addressed in the
project.

Component 2: `Moderately Satisfactory'

The objective of component 2 to reduce mortality and morbidity due to malaria,
tuberculosis were not only met, but surpassed. Case fatality rate per 100,000 for malaria
declined from 0.24 (1997) to 0.09 (2002); the prevalence rate per 1000 has also declined.
The total annual number of deaths due to malaria declined from 203 in 1996 to 46 in
2003.

In addition, the number of confirmed cases of malaria declined from 76,356 in 1996 to
37,416 in 2003.

Regarding support to the National TB Control Program, by the end of the project in 2005
the case detection rate (i.e. the proportion of estimated smear positive cases detected and
reported each year) and cure rates (i.e. the proportion of smear-positive cases that are
smear negative in the last month of treatment and at least on one previous occasion) were
84% and 93%, exceeding the targets of 70% and 85% respectively. The DOTS coverage
rate nationally, increased from about 93% in 1997 to 100% by 2003; this level of
coverage has been maintained to date. That was due largely to sustained government
commitment and several decades of high quality technical assistance from the
Netherlands Government (KNCV and MCNV) who have played a lead role in providing
technical guidance to the National TB program since 1986, and also supported the
program financially. The Bank funding was complimentary to these efforts, providing
about 51% of the total actual expenditure on the NTP between 1997 and 2002, most of
which went on the purchase of drugs and equipments.

                      Case Detection Rate      DOTS Treatment Success Rate



New challenges emerged in the course of the project pertaining to TB control. These
include the rising incidence of TB, largely driven by the emerging HIV epidemic
concentrated among vulnerable groups; difficulty in reaching residents of mountainous
areas with services, poor TB management practices in the private sector, and the
relatively high prevalence of MDR TB (See table below).

                MDR TB                          1996     2002
                New cases                       2.3%     3%
                Previously treated cases        32.5% 25%

Additional indicators, other than the case detection rate and the DOTS treatment success
rate, might be needed to obtain a more accurate picture of TB burden in Vietnam; this
could include assessing the impact of the HIV epidemic on TB incidence. HIV alters the
progression of TB. Given the paucity of data, the socioeconomic impact of this
component as outlined in the PDO, would be difficult to determine, however, this
program has been successful in reducing the burden of these diseases, which
disproportionately affect the poor.

Component 3: `Moderately Satisfactory'

The staff in the MOH have benefited from these activities and their level of skills have
been enhanced to use these policy tools, however, the project did not focus on structural
constraints to policy making and capacity building. This component began quite slowly
(especially Subcomponent 3.2) and was reported to have made very little contribution to
health policy development by Mid-term review. This led to a subsequent revision to
reflect new developments in the rapidly changing health sector, and the implementation
of other activities improved. The training received by MOH staff helped build
institutional memory, and the skills acquired in the implementation of the studies and
surveys which characterized most of the interventions, definitely contributed to the
capacity within the MOH. Some of the early trainees went on to master survey methods
and became trainers themselves. The establishment of a Health Policy Unit supported by
the Swedish Cooperation also ensured that technical capacity for health policy was



                                            15

retained within the MOH. In addition, the results from some of the studies such as the
National Health Accounts, Hospital Inventory Survey and the National Health Survey,
have been useful inputs in the design of subsequent health policy reforms such as the
Health Insurance for the Poor. However, capacity at the provincial level remains weak as
identified in the Sector Analysis. Also, some of the institutional constraints were not
addressed as noted above. This component built on the long-standing cooperation
between the Swedish International Development Agency, and the Government of
Vietnam, reinforcing collaborative efforts between the Swedish International
Development Agency, the Bank and the Government of Vietnam.

3.3 Efficiency
No data was collected on this at appraisal or during the project, hence efficiency cannot
be evaluated.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
The PDOs were very relevant to the health sector context in Vietnam, addressing some of
the key challenges the health system faced at that time. Targeting was appropriately
geared towards the poor areas, at services utilized by the poor and at diseases that
disproportionately affected the poor. The project filled a much needed gap in resources
for salvaging the rapidly deteriorating public health infrastructure and concentrated a
package of interventions in each Commune Health Center.

The project made significant contributions in improving the availability of improved
quality of primary care for the project provinces, thereby increasing equitable access to
care and narrowing the gap in the quality of services between communes in better-off
provinces and those in poorer provinces. Secondly, through its support for the national
targeted programs for TB and Malaria and ARI, the objectives of these programs were
reached and even surpassed. Thirdly, the skills of the staff of the MOH were enhanced,
and subsequently very useful policy and planning tools were developed and made
available for policy-formulation.

In spite of the achievements of the project, the rating is conservatively put as moderately
satisfactory, for the following reasons: First, implementation constraints caused many
delays during the life of the project and perhaps more could have been done and results
could have been reached faster. Second, although the first component provided important
inputs to the health sector and linked well with the other investments related to the health
policy, the project could have done more to look into the maintenance of the facilities,
which eventually suffered from inadequate maintenance. Third, the national programs did
very well but more or less sustained an already strong and high performing program. In
the case of TB for instance, the WHO targets of case detection rate of 70% and treatment
rates of 85% had already been exceeded. In 1996, rates were 76% and 90% (the latter
dropped to 85% in 1997) respectively. Therefore what the program did was more of help
sustain these achievements. Finally, the project could have done better in terms of design
and implementation of M & E because in spite of good outputs and project outcomes,
achievement of PDO and efficiency were difficult to determine due to data unavailability
as well as attribution constraints.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The project provinces were among the poorest in Vietnam. The investments under the
project contributed to the reduction in the disparities in the quality of available PHC
infrastructure between the richer and poorest provinces. Two regions, the Northwest and
Central Highlands which are two of the poorest, benefited mostly from project
investments; hence the targeting of the project has been pro-poor. In addition, by
supporting the expansion of the National Programs for TB and Malaria, diseases that
disproportionately affect the poor, the burden of these diseases on the poor were reduced.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
As discussed above, component 3 of the project was aimed at strengthening policy
formulation and management by supporting the development of an information base on
which strategic decisions for the health system can be based. Research studies and
surveys were the key outputs of this component. The first National Health Accounts in
Vietnam was conducted, the first comprehensive household and health facility survey
(the NHS), patient exit survey, public investment plan for health, and the study on health
insurance for the poor were conducted.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
One of the unintended positive impacts of investments in CHCs was the improvement of
preventive health services. It was observed that, in the provinces that benefited from
project investments, the quality of preventive services the poor received was perceived to
be higher, compared to matching communes. The analytic work done under component
three also provided good ground work for the health policy unit that was established with
SIDA support in 1993. As component three was mainly financed by SIDA, the link
between the two sets of activities was a positive outcome.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
A survey of communities' attitude towards the health services and the National Health
Support Project was carried out in September 2003. The objectives of this survey were:
(i) to understand the factors that affected local people's perception; (ii) to obtain
communities' perceptions as regards the quality of health services provided at Commune
Health Centers; (iii) to draw a trend of health service utilization at commune level; and
(iv) to make recommendations on how to improve the service quality at the CHCs. The
assessment was carried out in five project provinces, 11 districts and 16 communes
representing different geographic regions of the country. Methodology involved
participatory tools and techniques (e.g., observation, focus group discussion) plus
analyses of data available from the local reporting system. Major findings are
summarized below.

Local people's perceptions on CHCs' operations

Factors that affected local perceptions include the level of education (interest in project
increased with level of education), ethnicity (ethnic minorities, often due to language
barriers, were less engaged and were also less likely to utilize health facilities), mass



                                            17

media/communication/information exchange (e.g. availability of television sets) and
residence (more attention paid to the project by people in lowland areas compared to
residents of mountainous regions). In all the 16 studied communes, a high appreciation
on the new CHCs was generally expressed, however, certain concerns persisted. Often
bed space was deemed inadequate in some CHCs, whereas others close to higher level
facilities were often bypassed, hence underutilized, underscoring the need to apply
different interventions to CHCs based on the key characteristics such as location,
population, and demand.

Trend in health services utilization of local people

Overall, it appeared local people made their decisions on choice of health providers based
on the perceived quality of services, reputation of doctors/health workers, affordability,
convenience and accessibility. The survey concluded that before 2000, local people often
used private health services available in the commune, went to DHC or to provincial
hospitals in case of severe illnesses. After the project, local people began using CHCs
more, although the utilization of private services is also increasing. Patients who are
either severely ill, better-off, better aware of the importance of health care, and when
transport is more convenient, often sought health care services at the highest level
possible. However, poor people who resided in remote and mountainous areas relied
mostly on CHC services.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The overall risk to development outcome is rated moderate. There is a degree of risk that
the improvements in quality of care that have been observed might be short-lived. This is
due to the risk of infrastructure and equipment investments deteriorating from lack of
adequate maintenance in the health centers. The TB and malaria programs, however,
continue to perform strongly and are likely to sustain the development outcomes achieved
as government commitment to these priority programs remains very strong and there has
been an increase in support from donor agencies such as The Global Fund. This is
important support as the TB program will face new demands and challenges in the
context of the emergence of HIV/AIDS epidemic in Vietnam. The government is going
through a process to delegate and decentralize more support to the provinces and local
government. It is important to find ways for achieving national objectives of such
important programs in the context of a decentralized system. The other important
development that affects the overall risk rating is health financing reform. Such reforms
like the health fund for the poor (Decision 139) and other key reforms are addressing
important access and equity issues and can potentially transform the sector. This is a
great development if implemented well. New strategy documents and a World Bank
sector work are looking into these issues.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The strength of the Bank team's approach in the design of the project includes: (1) a
design that builds on and is in line with the Government's strategy, articulated in the
"Strategy for Health for All by the Year 2000 and Strategic Health Plan for the period
1990 ­ 1995 in Vietnam" and with the objectives of the CAS; (2) a design that is
technically relevant and well informed by sector work such as the "Vietnam Population,
Nutrition and Health Sector Report in 1992", and the World Development Report 1993 ­
Investing in Health; (3) high level dialogue, engagement and ownership of the
government; and (4) the identification of key activities that capture some of the priority
areas affecting the health sector in Vietnam.

There were some weaknesses in the preparation that may have had an impact on the
quality at entry: (1) The design appeared quite complex for an MOH with no prior
experience with Bank projects; (2) The focus on a supply side only approach could have
been better served with more demand side interventions; (3) The M&E framework
focused on a mixture of higher level of objectives and project specific outputs, some of
which were not attributable to project investment and unable to capture project results.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

On the positive side, frequent and technically sound supervision missions were conducted
by the project team and in some cases, with development partners. This ensured timely
identification of the problems as they presented. Several major implementation issues
were resolved without any negative impact due to the good engagement and follow-up.
Secondly, the task team adopted a flexible approach and accommodated several requests
of the MOH which were consistent with the PDO, reasonable and contributed to the
outcomes, such as the introduction of Inter-Commune Polyclinics (ICPs), expanding the
training modules and including new districts and provinces to the eligible pool. The task
team should therefore be commended for their flexibility in accommodating the
challenges faced by the client and in the proactive manner they sought to deal with issues
as they arose. In addition, there was good continuity in TTL and task teams which helped
move the project forward.

However, several substantial challenges underscored the weaknesses in supervision.
Three main areas of focus include:

Monitoring and Evaluation: At the beginning of the project, no baseline data was
collected for monitoring the performance indicators. It took almost 2 years after project
effectiveness for the M&E capacity issue to be addressed and was thus rightly rated



                                            19

unsatisfactory, however, only in that time interval. The performance indicators were also
left unchanged in spite of major changes in the supported activities, for instance
Subcomponent 3.2 of the project. More attention should have been paid to strengthening
and integrating data collection and on monitoring the performance outcomes rather than
focusing on the supply of project inputs.

Procurement: The project faced many challenges when it came to procurement. It was
the major source of problems and bottlenecks in implementation. A change in PMU
leadership brought about some improvement, which was short-lived. At mid-term review
the project was declared satisfactory and no longer a problem project. This appeared to be
an overtly optimistic assessment, as, by the subsequent mission within the same year,
procurement was declared unsatisfactory again. This was a recurring problem throughout
the project's lifespan, sometimes almost putting the achievements of the development
objectives in jeopardy. The Bank team could have been more proactive in anticipating
and dealing with the procurement issues.

Documentation and ISR rating: There are concerns about the level of candor in the
ratings of project implementation. In some instances, procurement was rated satisfactory,
even when the aide memoire reported significant implementation problems, procurement
issues, and minimal disbursements. M&E was also rated satisfactory for a significant part
of the project life, although its implementation was very weak. At the same time, the risk
ratings were not realistic; mostly said to be negligible, despite acknowledgements of
significant capacity constraints holding back the smooth implementation of the project.
This persistent discrepancy such as between project disbursement and implementation
rating was also noted during the procurement review.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The overall Bank performance is rated `Moderately Unsatisfactory'. Given the context at
the time of project preparation, the components addressed key problems in the health
sector and helped salvage the primary health care network in Vietnam especially the
CHCs. A platform and minimum standard of care was created, upon which the health
system could rebuild. Secondly, the project achieved good outcomes such as an increase
in utilization of the CHCs and the improvement upon previous successes of the National
Programs. Thirdly, the project design was consistent with the priorities of the government
and the Country Assistance Strategy, and incorporated sound technical input from
previous health sector analyses.

Implementation was adaptive to the significant capacity constraints in the MOH, and
some capacity was built in the process. However, the design was too complex for an
MOH with limited capacity, as it incorporated several interventions and a complicated
project implementation arrangement. M&E systems were not put in place, and some
performance indicators were not appropriate and did not measure the performance of the
project. The follow up could have been more decisive and supervision more proactive



                                            20

especially pertaining to fiduciary and procurement issues. This was reflected in the
project being declared a problem project, without any prior documentation of it as a
potential problem project ­ an action that could have provoked more attention to the
issues. The ISR ratings which guided actions by Bank management could have been more
candid and consistent with the details specified in the aide memoires especially regarding
procurement and implementation which were problematic in almost the entire course of
the project.

It therefore appears that although the project was relevant and achieved some good
outcomes, implementation was suboptimal. Given the duration of the project and the
critical role implementation of the project played, more weight was accorded to the
implementation performance, hence the modest rating of moderately unsatisfactory. It is
also worth mentioning that Quality at Entry was not assessed by QAG either during
preparation or after effectiveness

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The government demonstrated commitment towards achieving the objectives of the
project and the level of dialogue and engagement were encouraging. The fact that a
Deputy Minister was assigned the project director, underscored the level of importance
accorded to the project. This being the first health project, the Ministry of Health was not
familiar with procedures for Bank financed operations, and had some difficulty adapting
to Bank requirements, which were sometimes quite different from what they were used to.
This often slowed the implementation of the project.

A high level of policy dialogue was also maintained throughout the project. However,
this high level of political commitment was not translated into sufficient support for
project implementation. Two years into the project, the NHSP was the only World Bank-
financed project in Vietnam without a full time PMU director or deputy director.
Secondly, the policies introduced such as the new national guidelines/standards for CHCs
and other civil works activities were at odds with the agreements reached earlier in the
project, leading to some conflict in the design of the CHCs and District Technical blocks.
Thirdly, the delays in follow up of previously discussed policy actions of the government
contributed to the cancellation of some of the activities in Component 3. Finally, long
term sustainability of the investments in the facilities remained a concern, as the
maintenance budget and policy support was not always assured in particular at the local
levels.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

At the initial stages, implementation was very slow, staffing positions remained largely
unfilled, much needed capacity was lacking, in addition to the high turnover of available
staff. Slowly, staffing improved, but not without the delays in implementation.



                                             21

Communication and collaboration between departments and other implementing units
was inadequate often resulting in delays and disagreements especially on procurement
procedures even after a World Bank no objection had been issued. The pool from which
the management personnel were drawn was limited to regular civil servants who had
other responsibilities; hence there were not enough full time staff to fill the positions.
This improved with new PMU leadership. Some of these critical issues were addressed,
and in spite of the delays, a substantial part of the targets were met. At the time of the
mid term review an action plan was outlined to improve performance, but compliance
with this implementation plan remained poor, with many of the agreements not followed
up or acted upon in a timely manner. This contributed to the delays reported in the
subsequent Portfolio Performance review. The implementation of the monitoring and
evaluation of the project performance could have been significantly improved upon.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The overall rating is moderately unsatisfactory because of the reasons given above. The
government remained committed throughout the project implementation and managed to
implement the project despite the lack of familiarity with the World Bank's procedures.
However, this level of commitment was not effectively translated into adequate support
for the PMU, with severe staffing inadequacies through most of the implementation
period. In addition, procurement remained problematic. Whereas the due process was
usually followed, the procurement procedures were not always completed in a timely
manner, in particular the evaluation of the bids resulting in two project extensions and a
cancellation of the third extension. Some of these constraints were more systemic in
nature; however the implementing agencies could have been more responsive,
collaborative and proactive to avoid the delays and procurement issues that plagued the
project.

6. Lessons Learned
     Project design benefit from ESW and analysis. This project provides another
       example where the priorities were selected based on careful project design and
       analysis and as a result the project addressed key priority areas that affected
       health outcomes, especially for the poor.
     Consistency with government strategy is a key factor for successful programs.
       The project benefited from strong political support as it was carefully designed to
       support government own priorities for the health sector. It was also consistent
       with the CAS for the World Bank and helped achieve the desired outcomes.
     Flexibility during implementation is important.          Especially in a country as
       dynamic as Vietnam, it was important to adopt a flexible approach to the project
       to be able to respond to the important needs of the client when needed and where
       they were consistent with key DO of the project. Project design should be less
       complex, to facilitate implementation. Standardization of the investments makes it
       difficult to adapt to local conditions. More flexibility and local input is thus
       needed in such investments, in order to balancing the specific local needs with the
       set norms.



                                            22

     Procurement capacity and processes need to be carefully analyzed.
       Investment operations especially for a new borrower can face many challenges in
       terms of procurement issues. Civil works and procurement of medical equipment
       and drugs were challenging. A careful understanding of the procurement capacity
       and system, and more proactive approach to this during project supervision could
       have helped.
     Results framework need to be carefully designed and can help operation.
       This operation had an M & E framework but that had its limitations. There is a
       need to link the project inputs and outputs to the desired project outcomes and
       Development Objectives. In addition to having an M&E framework, collection of
       baseline information and laying out a system for monitoring, using to the extent
       possible the existing system, would help ensure adequate monitoring of project
       performance.
     Reporting and documentation should embrace more candor in reflecting
       issues and constraints noted during supervision. This will ensure that the
       appropriate flags are raised in a timely and proactive manner that allows for early
       and decisive interventions to avert the worsening of implementation constraints.
       For proper implementation, an experienced, and fully staffed PMU with a clear
       mandate and understanding of the procedures of both the government and the
       World Bank or any other donors, is critical. Frequent turnover of staff, suboptimal
       leadership and limited capacity all hamper project implementation.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

There was no economic or financial analysis at the time of appraisal. No NPV, Economic
or Financial Rate of Return was calculated a priori for the project, and no analyses are
available to assess them as economic or financial results. Neither was data collected to
determine the impact of the project; hence an economic analysis for the project is not
feasible.

For the TB program, it was estimated by the NTP, that the average cost per case
diagnosed between 1997 and 2003 was $28 and the average cost per case treated was $30.
No estimates of the total costs for TB control were made, as the available estimates did
not include the costs incurred by households for direct and indirect expenses, the
recurrent costs to the government for salaries, maintenance, depreciation, and funds for
sustaining the provincial TB teams.

For the malaria program, it was also estimated that the between 1997 and 2003, the cost
of treatment per episode of malaria (clinic visit + drugs) was $11. A cost savings of $9.5
million was estimated, which was twice the annual was spending on malaria control. Out
of pocket cost to the households was estimated at $14 million4.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

An assessment of communities' attitude towards the health services and the National
Health Support Project was carried out in September 2003. By this time, all but the TB
subcomponent had been completed. The objectives of the assessment were: (i) to
understand the factors that affected local people's perception; (ii) to obtain communities'
perceptions as regards the quality of health services provided at Commune Health
Centers; (iii) to derive a trend of health service utilization at commune level; and (iv) to
make recommendations on how to improve the service quality at the CHCs. The
assessment was carried out in five project provinces, 11 districts and 16 communes that
represent different geographic regions of the country, using a number of participatory
tools and techniques (e.g., observation, focus group discussion) plus analyzing data
available from the local reporting system. Major findings are summarized below.

Factors that affect local people's perceptions
It was observed that certain factors that characterize the local populations influenced their
perception of, and hence, experience with the services and project investment results.
These include the level of education, ethnicity, mass media/communication/information
exchange and residence.

Education: Local people especially in remote and mountainous areas tend to have lower
levels of education. Those under 40 generally had a higher level of education than the
older population. Some correlation between education and attention paid to project was
observed. In communes with high average levels of education (such as Huong Lac
Commune, Lang Giang District, Bac Giang Province), local people expressed more ideas
and comments on the project.

Ethnicity: Many ethnic minority people (e.g., Xinh Mun, Thai ethnics) could not speak
Vietnamese and this was often a barrier to health care. In addition they had very few
opportunities for exchange with the outside world. Certain practices, such as, sacrifices,
have been increasingly dropped, but home delivery by some ethnic minority women still
exists. An example is in Chieng Mai Commune, in Mai Son District of Son La Province,
where the head of the Ban Village in the commune mentioned that about 70% of the
local women delivered at home with some help by a traditional midwife or sometimes by
a VHW and did not fully appreciate the need for delivery in CHCs.

Mass media, communication and information exchange was another factor that affected
local people's perception. In communes with a high percentage of people with TV,
people exchanged and communicated with each others more, and were more aware of the
importance of health care.

Place of residence
The survey found that for a number of remote and mountainous communes, especially
those not connected to the national power network, access to mass media was very
limited, which, in turn, led to a lack of information and awareness on health care issues.
In those locations, with low population densities, the opportunities for information



                                             34

exchange were very few. Another issue related to place of residence was the observation
that those who lived further from a District Health Center showed more interest in the
investment for the CHCs than those who lived near a DHC. The survey report concluded
that people in plain areas tended to pay more attention to the project and the quality of
CHCs' services compared to those living in mountainous areas, and that Kinh ethnic
group had more awareness about the project and service quality compared to other ethnic
groups living in remote areas.

Local people's perceptions on CHCs' operations
In all the 16 surveyed communes, people generally expressed a high appreciation of the
new CHCs. A number of commune leaders mentioned that health services were better
delivered thanks to the upgraded facility and availability of more equipment. However, it
was also indicated that the CHCs have not adequately addressed the local health care
needs for the increasing population. There were instances where a mismatch existed
between availability of and demand for CHC services. Some CHCs were functioning
above capacity, with limited beds equipment, drugs and doctors, as in the case of Loong
Phieng Commune, Son La. Even, some mothers had to rest on the floor after delivery. On
the other hand, those CHCs situated close to a DHC received significantly fewer patients.
According to the survey authors, this suggests that the application of the same investment
package for all CHCs without adequate consideration for key characteristics such as
location, population, and demand was not appropriate.

The survey suggests a mixed picture as regards a possible relationship between the
availability of doctors and utilization of the services. Among 9 of the 16 studied CHCs
that had a doctor, 5 (or 55.6%) witnessed an increase in the number of patient visits,
whereas, of the 7 remaining CHCs without doctors, 5 of them (71.42%) also experienced
an increase in the number of patient visits, although, most of these CHCs are in remote
areas and further from the DHCs. It was also indicated by local people that health
workers at the CHCs could deal with only simple problems, hence more equipments and
skilled staff were being requested.

It was reported that the amount of drugs available at CHCs was often inadequate. It was
not clear what was subsidized and what was for sale. The prices at CHCs appeared to be
higher than at other health facilities and at the private sellers. It also differed among the
CHCs themselves. There is no price list at the CHCs. Drug price was reported as one of
the factors that would affect the utilization of a CHC.

The survey suggested that the CHC Head played an important role in management,
organization and delivery of health care services at commune level. In Nhon My
Commune, Soc Trang Province, for example, the presence of a new CHC Head who had
strong capacities and reputation, coincided with a 5 to 6 fold increase in the number of
patient visits.

Overall, an improvement in CHCs staff's capacities due to the training provided by the
project was widely acknowledged. The training for Village Health Workers (VHWs)
appeared to be useful in a number of communes especially where the VHW networks



                                              35

were also working for and supported by other programs. Regarding the quality of CHCs'
health care services, an overall perception of improvement was reported. However, in
places with alternatives readily available and accessible (e.g., polyclinics, DHCs,
provincial hospitals), people would still bypass the CHCs for the higher levels due to the
perception of better quality of care in the latter. This was the case in 50% of the studied
communes which had CHCs located close to DHCs.

Close supervision and support from the commune to the CHCs was also adjudged to be
important, especially financial contribution and close collaboration with local mass
organizations for different health activities. It was, noted that the budget support from the
communes was limited. Some communes however, reported good collaboration with a
number of mass organizations and local authorities especially in health communication
activities. In those communes without effective collaboration with different organizations,
e.g., in Loong Phieng Commune, Yen Chau District, Son La Province, the Women's
Union, and local authorities appeared to be uniformed about various health care programs.
The survey used a set of criteria5 to score6 and rank the communes' performance in health
care. The ranking indicated that about three quarters of studied communes were rated
average, a quarter excellent, and only one case rated below the average. The "excellent"
communes were reported to have received support from other projects and other donors
as well.

Trend in health services utilization of local people
In general, quality of care was perceived to be better at higher levels than the CHCs,
hence the preference for the former. This was the case particularly with better off people.
The CHCs still proved to be an important and primary source of care for the poor when
they get ill, especially in remote areas where DHCs are not easily accessible. The
utilization of the CHCs in remote areas seemed to correlate with the quality of the health


5Local perception on quality and accessibility to health services at CHCs; Utilization of CHCs' services vs.
other health care facilities; Accessibility to DHC and/or Provincial Hospital; Availability of private health
services; and Availability of drug stores.

6A commune would be rated "excellent" if it is scored 4-5 (i.e., the CHC is easily accessible in terms of
distance and cost; capacities and attitude and behavior of CHC's staff are improving; most of local people
seek health care services at the CHC in the first place; good access to district and provincial hospitals;
health staff at district and provincial levels have strong capacities and good behaviors; availability of
private health services and drug stores). A commune would be rated "average" if it is scored 3 (i.e., the
CHC is easily accessible in terms of distance and cost; CHC's staff are capable to meet most of health care
needs of local people; no negative comments on CHC's staff's attitude and behavior; local people accept
CHCs services as the first contact for health; the utilization of CHC is average ­ people seek CHC's
services for common diseases; access to district and provincial hospitals is relatively difficult due to
distance and limited transport; service quality at district and provincial levels is considered average; and
there are some private health services and drug stores). A commune would be rated "below average" if it is
scored 1-2 (i.e., the CHC is not easily accessible; the capacities of CHC's staff are limited and they do not
have trust by local people; local people are not satisfied with CHC's services; low utilization rate of the
CHC ­ local people mostly seek health care services at another facility; no easy access to district/provincial
hospitals due to lack of transport, further distance, and complicated procedures; and private health services
and/or drug stores are not available).




                                                        36

services provided and trust of local people in health staff as well as their own awareness
of the need to seek health care services. The referral system did not seem to be effective,
as people could choose what facility to go to and so a nearby DHC could be chosen
instead of a further CHC even for very basic care.

In addition to public health facilities, private health providers are increasingly available
and utilized. The survey suggested that private health facilities were often better equipped,
more hygienic, with more qualified and experienced health workers (such as reputable
retired doctors), more service oriented, and easily accessible. Private drug stores seemed
to attract local people better as they sold a wider range of drugs, often at a better price
and were located within an accessible distance.

In summary, the respondents surveyed made their decisions based on the perceived
quality of services, reputation of doctors/health workers, affordability, convenience and
accessibility. The survey concluded with the observation that before 2000, available
options for curative care included private clinics, DHC or provincial hospitals. After the
project, local people have begun using CHCs for curative care services as well. Care is
still sought at the highest possible levels for severe cases, by the better-off, and when
accessible. Meanwhile, the poor who live in remote and mountainous areas still rely
mostly on CHCs' services.

                                     Executive summary

A major question confronting health planners in the mid-1990s was how to revitalize the
Primary Health Care (PHC) delivery system that had in previous years been largely
responsible for Vietnam's well-known health accomplishments.                This system, like
commune-based social welfare provision generally in Vietnam, had fallen into disrepair
and organizational disruption in the early years of the economic transition.

Launched in 1995, the National Health Support Project (NHSP) addressed the above
question with over $100 million in investment over six years (financed by World Bank
credit and Dutch and Swedish aid) and ambitious aims for its three components:

    o To support the provision of high quality, reliable primary health care on a
        sustainable basis in 16 poorer provinces, primarily by upgrading health facilities
        and providing in-service training of health personnel at district and commune
        levels (component 1).
    o To target specific communicable diseases nation-wide (component 2); and
    o To strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Health in policy formulation,
        planning and management (component 3).

This evaluation was commissioned by the Ministry of Health in the final months of the
project's duration to examine its success in achieving its objectives. Given the large
scale of the NHSP and its status as the first Ministry of Health project supported by the
World Bank, this report addresses issues both particular to the project and of larger
strategic significance to health sector policy development. The following key questions
are addressed in this synthesis report and in several thematic papers produced by the
evaluation team:

         Design/strategy (part II). Given a multitude of potential strategies to revitalize
         the grassroots public health infrastructure, how appropriate was the choice of
         areas in which the project decided to invest? How has the design stood the test
         of time?
         Implementation (part II and Thematic Papers #1-2). To what extent did the
         health sixteen provinces meet key implementation challenges, such as assessing
         local needs, arranging delivery of inputs, and enforcing minimum standards?
         Output quality (part III and Thematic Paper #3). What quality of outputs did the
         some $50 million invested in grassroots facilities alone purchase? What is the
         current state of this infrastructure in project-invested localities?
         Impacts (parts IV-V and Thematic Papers #4-8). To what extent have grassroots
         CHC capabilities to provide quality PHC been raised? To what extent is the
         `revitalized' network actually being utilized?

The evaluation is based on central-level interviews, a rapid field assessment in five
provinces, and statistical analysis of an extensive database of 88 project and 220 non-
project communes. An important constraint on the evaluation was the absence of useable
baseline and impact monitoring data specific to the project.

                                         Key findings


The NHSP's strategy for revitalizing the grassroots PHC system was heavily facility-
based and supply-oriented. To evaluate the larger significance of the NHSP is to ask
what contribution such a strategy has made within Vietnam's health sector over the past
10 years, and what future relevance it has.

The NHSP in context

Extending coverage of the rural population to basic health services, through its system of
10,000 CHCs built largely during the pre-doi moi `first generation' of health policies, has
traditionally been the strength of Vietnam's health sector. It was this system that was in
disrepair in the early 1990s when the NHSP was being conceptualized. It is no surprise
that NHSP investments were overwhelmingly on the `supply side' of the health system,
i.e. on those inputs which can procured, distributed or organized by the Ministry of
Health acting more less on its own. Such investments are well suited to the purpose of
expanding coverage, or, to be more precise, of raising the quality of infrastructure that
had in many places become so deteriorated that it no longer `covered' much of anything.

Almost ten years later, there is strong evidence that Vietnam's health sector has not only
emerged from serious organizational disruption suffered during the early transition, but
has solidified and improved the quality of its system of PHC delivery.            Whereas
previously a CHC providing theoretical `coverage' to a commune population might have
been understaffed, unequipped and in a facility on the verge of collapse, such cases are
increasingly rare even in remote areas.

NHSP investment quality

The NHSP has made a significant contribution to this `second generation' rebound.
Specifically, results of the evaluation suggest that the project has enhanced the quality of
infrastructure in some of the poorest places in the country. In so doing, it has helped to
greatly even out the quality of the PHC coverage provided by CHCs to the rural
population:

    o Project-invested CHCs in mountainous areas now enjoy a quality of infrastructure
        that is not greatly different from average non-project CHCs in delta regions.
    o Investments in essential equipment and, to a lesser extent, drugs, have also made a
        contribution; across both the project area and Vietnam generally, the great
        majority of CHCs are now outfitted with basic equipment and a stock of essential
        drug.
    o Whereas before coverage of in-service training for grassroots medical personnel
        was spotty, at present it is relatively comprehensive. The project has made a
        contribution to this not just in terms of sponsoring training in project-invested
        areas, but also in developing curricula being applied in almost one-third of the
        country.




                                              40

In all of these areas, CHCs throughout Vietnam show great improvement, and those in
the project area have (particularly for infrastructure quality) have improved faster than
non-project communes.

Boosting the quality of service coverage at the commune and district levels in this way
was highly appropriate from an equity perspective. Investments in grassroots PHC are
pro-poor: the poor use CHC and district hospital services more heavily than their share in
the population suggests, in large part because those who are better-off typically gravitate
towards higher-quality providers in district, provincial and even central level hospitals.
The poor, who stand to gain most from reductions in mortality rates from preventable
causes, also benefit disproportionately from the improved operation of CHCs as the
primary bases from which preventive health services are delivered.

In short, the project has helped to even out the quality of PHC coverage in some of the
poorest areas of the country.

Impacts observed in the field and in statistical analysis

To what extent are these improved CHCs actually providing improved service to the
populations in their catchments area. Drawing on both the field assessment and a
statistical comparison of project and similar non-project communes, the evaluation cites
four main impacts:

    o Improved morale and professionalism of CHC workers;
    o Raised community perceptions of CHC quality;
    o Utilization rates in CHCs that are on average 10% higher for both in-patient and
        outpatient services compared with non-project communes; and
    o A higher quality of preventive services supplied by the national health programs
        and actually accessed by the population.

The effects on both utilization and preventive service quality, while modest in scale, are
both statistically significant and observed across several regions and topographies.

Institutional quality and equity: the recurring problems

Two problems were consistently highlighted in the fieldwork and confirmed by statistical
analysis.

The first concerns institutional quality. Management and implementation of the NHSP
suffered from many weaknesses. These included:

    o Extremely weak information systems at central level with which to monitor the
        impact of the project and make course corrections;
    o Poorly designed arrangements for monitoring infrastructural quality and for
        holding contractors and suppliers accountable for high-quality service delivery.
    o A general lack of transparency in information exchange between the four levels of
        government implementing the project.

Beyond these project-specific factors, the actual management of CHCs varied greatly in
quality, depending both on the level of resources allocated to the CHC and the pressures
for accountability faced by CHC staff. Five such pressures were found to underpin CHC
performance: district technical supervision, commune-level political supervision, and


                                             41

competition from private providers, user feedback, and internal norms of professionalism.
CHCs surveyed by the team varied from having several of these pressures operative to
virtually none. Such variations had a strong impact on quality of project outputs: across a
range of localities, project-invested infrastructure is being degraded at an alarming rate
due to unevenness in the resources and incentives to maintain it in high working order.

Equity of access to high-quality PHC is the second, closely related area in which major
question marks are raised by the team.              Some of the variations noted above in
implementation and institutional quality were generic across localities. But many others
were correlated with poverty-related indicators. Even within the project area, the poor ­
and particularly ethnic minorities ­ live in communes with the lowest-quality
infrastructure, least adequate staffing of CHCs, and the poorest quality institutions
underpinning CHC performance. Partly for this reason, there are marked disparities in
impact noted in our analysis:

    o Although preventive service quality has improved for all groups due to the
        project, it is still significantly lower in mountainous localities than elsewhere.
    o Utilization of CHCs by the poor appears not to have increased due to the project;
        instead, the 10% increase noted above being driven by the non-poor.

Thus substantial number of CHCs ­ primarily, but by no means exclusively, in
mountainous localities ­ are failing to achieve or sustain minimum standards of PHC
quality or to boost utilization at all.       Since these communes typically have a high
proportion of ethnic minorities and/or poor households across the board, such failure is
having serious equity consequences.          Disparities in infrastructure quality have been
remarkably reduced with NHSP investment, as noted above. But our findings suggest the
persistence of an `equity gap' that this is not bridgeable by a supply-driven, facility-based
project alone.

Policy implications of the NHSP experience

Three types of interventions ­ neglected in this project's design ­ will be increasingly
important to a `third generation' of health sector reforms in Vietnam, given the high
priority given by health officials to equity and efficiency concerns. The first is a focus on
improvements to the institutional environment underpinning CHC performance. Much
work remains to be done to identify mechanisms for increasing the pressures for
responsive CHC performance while ensuring an adequate flow of resources to them for
meeting minimum standards in key areas such as preventive health programs.

The second area is greater attention to the demand-side of interventions underpinning
health quality and access, i.e. interventions aiming to increase basic health knowledge
and to influence the demand of individuals for basic services (such as maternal
immunizations and antenatal care).           One important demand-side innovation in the
Vietnamese policy environment at present is the focus on getting health insurance into
the hands of the poor. Consolidating NHSP-style supply side investments while focusing
attention onto the demand side in this way holds great promise.

The third concerns the need to work out effective institutional arrangements for health
sector decentralization.       The NHSP in practice offered one set of investments to
localities, despite the incredible diversity of commune environments and patters of


                                                42

utilization. This resulted in investment patterns that were sub-optimal in terms of both
efficiency (e.g. inpatient capabilities being strengthened in CHCs adjacent to district
hospitals) and equity (e.g. a lack of attention to the special needs of minority communes).
Recent promulgation by the Ministry of Health of standardized targets that all CHC
facilities should ideally meet by 2010 seem to continue in this centralizing vein. Health
sector decentralization is indeed taking place in Vietnam. The question is how to orient
MoH systems to support this process while ensuring minimum standards are maintained
without recourse to blunt standardization.

Such decentralization poses capacity challenges at both central and local levels. The
project's experience in this regard should give pause for thought. Its supply-driven
approach, coupled with poor information systems and strong pressures (including,
unhelpfully, from the World Bank) to disburse funds rapidly, made adaptive
administration difficult. Better management and support systems, including from the
World Bank's side, should be a priority in further health sector collaboration.

Annex 8. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) found the report to
be comprehensive, concise, and informative. They asked for clarifications of the rating
scales in respect of performance, and asked whether the ICR could include an additional
annex that described the main findings from previous evaluations so that the readers
could compare and make their own judgements. They also wish that the Bank could work
more effectively with them in the health sector in the future.

The Dutch Government spokesperson also found the report to be fine as is and they said
they have no comments.
