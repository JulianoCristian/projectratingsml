The main component, the\n            Phase IV extension of Koyna, will be completed late in\n            FY1999. But the underlying developmental outcome to\n            strengthen the state electricity board was only marginally\n            successful and is unlikely to be sustained. Key lessons\n            learned were: The project did not produce operational and\n            financial improvements in Maharashtra's power sector.\n            It has become clear that a sustainable solution to the\n            sector's problems requires focusing on restructuring\n            the state power sector rather than revitalizing the state\n            electricity boards (SEBs) as attempted in the past. This\n            restructuring includes, inter alia, the unbundling of\n            monopoly utilities, corporatization, establishment of an\n            independent regulatory commission, tariff reforms, and\n            privatization of distribution. This lesson has been applied\n            in the ongoing power sector reform projects in Orissa,\n            Haryana, and Andhra Pradesh. Projects must be carefully and\n            adequately prepared, including the evaluation of risks that\n            might cause delays, with an implementation team in place\n            prior to loan approval, with bidding documents prepared and\n            preferably issued and bids received; these are prerequisites\n            if projects are to move smoothly from preparation to the\n            implementation phase, with minimum delays to project\n            completion. Resettlement issues must be dealt with during\n            project preparation."}, "docdt": "1999-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
