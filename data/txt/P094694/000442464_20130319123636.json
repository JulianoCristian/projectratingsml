The country has made\n            considerable progress in reducing malaria prevalence through\n            a combination of case management, larval habitat management\n            (LHM), wide-scale distribution of free insecticide-treated\n            nets (ITNs), and indoor residual spraying (IRS) in\n            high-prevalence areas. And yet, elimination appears ever an\n            elusive goal, and malaria remains the leading cause of death\n            in children under five. Given these facts, it is vital to\n            enhance existing malaria control programs in order to move\n            towards effective elimination. Given that the prevalence of\n            malaria parasitaemia was twice as high among younger\n            individuals, despite overall low infection rates in the\n            general population, children and young adults are good\n            targets for further interventions to reduce parasite\n            infection as Eritrea moves towards malaria elimination."}, "docdt": "2011-12-06T00:00:00Z"}
