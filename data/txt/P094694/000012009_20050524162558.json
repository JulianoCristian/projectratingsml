Some of the\n            report recommendations are : the Government of Eritrea (GOE)\n            should establish a National Steering Committee on\n            Health-Care Waste Management (HCWM) to ensure coordination\n            and supervision of the HCWM Plan at the country level; a\n            National Action Plan should be implemented over a five-year\n            period to progressively upgrade the current HCWM practices\n            at all levels of the Health System;  establish legislation\n            on the Management of Hazardous Wastes (that would consider\n            not only HCW but also other categories of hazardous wastes,\n            such as pesticides, certain industrial wastes, etc);\n            formulate clear National Guidelines for the management of\n            HCW; these guidelines will complement the Eritrean Hospital\n            Standards Clinical Policies and Procedures; designate a\n            Health-Care Waste Management Officer (HCWMO) in large\n            hospitals who should be given the responsibility to operate\n            and monitor the management of the HCW; implementation of\n            standardized segregation procedures to be followed in all\n            Eritrean Health-Care Facilities (HCFs), implementing a three\n            bins system that should be systematically associated with a\n            color coding, and a labeling system; and finally, for all\n            the HCFs, highly infectious wastes generated in medical\n            laboratories and isolation wards, to be chemically\n            pre-treated in a solution of sodium hypochlorite in\n            concentrated forms. Additionally, incinerating all the\n            Cytotoxic and Pharmaceutical Waste generated throughout the\n            country in the rotary kiln of the National Cement Factory\n            located in Massawa should be practiced."}, "docdt": "2005-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
