HAMSET II aims\n            to: (1) contain the spread o f HIV/AIDS/STI in vulnerable\n            groups as well as the general population through a focused\n            multi-sectoral approach, with renewed attention to the most\n            vulnerable populations; (2) expand the coverage of directly\n            observed treatment (DOT), improve case detection and\n            treatment outcomes for TB; (3) reduce or at least maintain\n            malaria mortality and morbidity at the current low levels;\n            (4) improve the coverage o f effective Reproductive Health\n            (RH) interventions; and (5) strengthen the overall health\n            system, including human resources for health, to enable the\n            country to better address HAMSET diseases. The project has\n            four components: 1. Multi-Sectoral Response: This component\n            supports key (non-health) line ministries and civil society\n            organizations at both national and zoba level to scale up\n            prevention (especially behavior change communication and\n            stigma reduction), care and support interventions for\n            HIV/AIDS/STI, malaria, TB and reproductive health (RH) (with\n            emphasis on mobilizing communities to utilize health\n            services). 2. Health Sector Response: This has five\n            sub-components: HIV/AIDS/STI TB, malaria, RH, and Human\n            Resources for Health. Each o f the first four sub-components\n            will comprise three activity categories: (a) Human resources\n            for HAMSET diseases: HAMSET II will improve human Improve\n            the information base for decision making; (b) Scale up\n            prevention interventions; and (c) Scale up diagnostic,\n            treatment, care and support services; 3. Community Managed\n            HAMSET Response Program: As a continuation of HAMSET's\n            Community-Managed HAMSET Response Program, this component\n            aims to scale up and consolidate community-driven\n            initiatives to address HAMSET diseases including\n            reproductive health. 4.
