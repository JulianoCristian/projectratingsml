A. STRATEGICCONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Countryandsector issues

The proposed project i s the follow-on to the IDA-financed Eritrea HIV/AIDS/STI,
Malaria and Tuberculosis Control Project (HAMSET) (US$ 40 million IDA credit,
expected closing date March31,2006).

This section highlightsthe key country and sector issues since the start of HAMSET in
2001.

Country issues: Eritrea remains one o f the poorest countries inthe world with an annual
Gross National Income per capita of US$ 180 and 66 percent o f the population living in
poverty. Economically, it has not fully recovered from the 1998-2000 border war with
Ethiopia. The current "no war, no peace" situation created by the border demarcation
impasse with Ethiopia as well as well as frequent droughts continue to restrict severely
the country's economic development. Eritrea's level o fhumandevelopment remains low.
In2003, itranked 156thamong 177countries inthe UNDP's HumanDevelopment Index.

Sector issues: Despite the challenging macro-economic environment, Eritrea continues to
make great efforts to improve the health status o f its citizens, especially inreducing child
mortality, fightingmalaria andcombating HIV/AIDS.

Its infant mortality rate (IMR) fell from 72 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1995 to 48 in
2002, while under-five mortality rate (U5M) fell from 136 to 93 over the same period.
These are well below the Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) average o f 101 for IMR and 171 for
U5M. Immunization coverage is one o f the highest in SSA, with 76 percent o f children
aged 12-23 months fully immunized in2003. This represents an 83 percent improvement
over the 1995 level -- at a time when immunization rates have generally been decreasing
across Africa. Malaria mortality and morbidity were reduced by more than 80% in the
last four years, by far the best performance in SSA. Eritrea also has one o f the best
insecticide-treated nets (ITN) coverage in SSA. HIV/AIDS prevalence remains relatively
low at 2.4% o f pregnant women in 2003 (compared to 2.8% in 2000). Over the same
period, the number o f reported sexually transmitted infections fell by a quarter. Inthe last
four years, Eritrea has initiated an excellent peer-led Behavior Change Communication
(BCC) program for HIV/AIDS as well as a successful condom promotion anddistribution
initiative. Blood safety has greatly improved with 100% o f blood units now screened for
HIV.

Notwithstanding such successes, the control o f HIV/AIDS/STI, TB and malaria --
 important causes o f the burden o f diseases (BOD)-- remains an unfinished agenda in
 Eritrea. Reproductive health, which has strong two-way links to HAMSET diseases, is a
 major health problem and has not been successfully addressed. Below is a summary o f




                                             4

the key challenges Eritrea i s facing in HAMSET diseases'. Further details can be found
inAnnexes 5,6,7 and8.

HIV/AIDS/STI: Compared to other SSA countries, Eritrea's adult HIV prevalence
remains relatively low at 2.4% in 20032. However, the infection rate is very high in
certain areas and populations. Geographically, HIV prevalence is much higher in the
Assab/Tio cluster inthe Southern RedSea zone (7.2%), EdagaHamus andAkria clusters
o f the Maekel zone (4.5% and 4.1% respectively) and Massawa cluster of the Northern
Red Sea zone (2.9%) than the national average. Socio-economically, certain groups
exhibit very high infection rates: bar, hotel or tea shop workers3 (11.9%), housemaids or
servants (9.5%), military or national service personnel (6.0%) and truck/bus drivers
(4.0%). Demographically, unmarried urban women aged 15-24 are disproportionately
affected (8%). These facts point to (i)          the need to target vulnerable groups4 and (ii)         the
threat o f a more generalized epidemic in urban areas. In order to avoid a full-scale
epidemic, the country needs to intensify its efforts to prevent infection in vulnerable
groups and transmission between vulnerable groups and the general population.
Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT)                        and Prevention o f Mother-to-Child
Transmission (PMTCT) still require a major scale up, especially outside the capital area.
Syndromic management o f STI needs much strengthening. Treatment, care and support
for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) remains limited as it is estimated that only
one infive PLWHA are receivingcare and support.

Malaria: The epidemiology o f malaria in Eritrea i s very complex with different
transmission patterns in different parts o f the country. The successful malaria control
program has made Eritrea one o f a few countries likely to meet both the Abuja Targets
and the Roll Back Malaria Goals. However, without continued vigorous control efforts,
there is a significant risk o f malaria outbreaks, especially as Eritrea's neighboring
countries are less successful in fighting malaria. In 2004, only 7.5% o f under-five
children with fever presented to health facilities received appropriate treatment within 24
hours according to national guidelines. The majority o f fever cases are now treated at the
community level by malaria health agents, but little i s known about the quality o f such
treatment. Newer technologies and tools, such as long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets
(LLINs) and Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) are under evaluation and
will need to be deployed appropriately. Efforts must be redoubled to target the most
vulnerable, particularly pregnant women, under-five children, non-immune populations
andpeople living inhigh-transmission areas.




  Fromthis point onward, inthe context of HAMSET 11, the term "HAMSET diseases" denotes HIV/AIDS,
STI, TB, malaria and reproductive health diseasesand conditions.
  Ministry ofHealth of Eritrea, 2004. HIV Prevention Impact inEritrea: Results from the 2003 Round o f
HIV Sentinel Surveillance. Asmara, Eritrea.
  There are currently no statistics ofthe HIV/AIDSprevalence rate among commercial sex workers (CSW).
I t is likely that some o f the hotelhadtea shops workers engage incommercial sex.
  InEritrea, vulnerable groups at ahigher riskofHIV/AIDS/STI infection include the followings: CSWand
their clients; bar, hotel and tea shop workers; national service personnel, truck drivers and young unmarried
urban women. The spouses of these groups are thus also vulnerable.


                                                       5

Tuberculosis:   In 2004, MOH reported Direct Observed Treatment Strategy (DOTS)
population coverage o f SO%,    a case detectionrate o f 70% and a treatment success rate o f
82%. However, the TB recording and reporting system is not reliable and such statistics
might not reflect the actual situation o f TB control in Eritrea. The low proportion of
smear positive cases (19%) and high proportion o f smear negative pulmonary cases
(43%) suggest problems with smear microscopy as well as over-reliance on radiology for
TB diagnosis. The TB control program has been affected by inadequate capacity, weak
supervision, and lack o f quality assurance as well as a limited information base for
decision making. For these reasons, progress in TB control progress i s lagging behind
that inmalaria andHIV/AIDS/STI.

Reproductive Health: In2002, while 70% o f pregnant women had at least one ante-natal
care (ANC) visit, only 28% were delivered by a skilled birth attendant. A very low 8%
o f women in the reproductive age used modem contraceptive methods. The harmful
practice o f female genital mutilation (FGM) remains widespread with 85% prevalence in
2002. Accessibility, availability and quality o f emergency obstetric care are limited. As
a result, the matemal mortality ratio (MMR) remains very high at 998 per 100,000 live
births, above the Sub-Saharan African (SSA) average. Disparity in reproductive health
(RH) outcomes is large, with MMRinthe SouthernRed Sea (SRS) zoba 30 times higher
thanthat inthe central zoba. Insummary, Eritrea's RHindicators are amongthe worst in
SSA and RH is an important outlier among an otherwise encouraging set o f health
indicators.

Cross-cutting issues:      The cross-cutting issues identified in the HAMSET Project
Appraisal Document are still relevant to varying extents. A highly mobile and dispersed
population i s a challenge for the provision o f services. The lack o f information for
decision making has been addressed in malaria and, to some extent, in HIV/AIDS, but
not inTB' and RH. Insufficient health financing remains a great challenge for the sector.
Little information is available on the effectiveness and efficiency o f health expenditure.
Coordination between the technical programs o f the MOH needs improvement, while
collaboration across sectors has improved under HAMSET. Shortage o f qualified health
staff, especially in remote areas, is still one o f the most critical challenges, although the
Government has attempted to address this problem with (i)            the establishment o f the
Orotta Medical School and (ii)      scaling up the training o f nurses, associate nurses, public
health workers and laboratory technicians (the latter supported in part by the IDA-
financed EritreaHealth and HAMSET projects).

Recipient's policies and strategies: The Government o f Eritrea (GoE) has formulated a
draft health sector policy, which emphasizes equitable provision ofbasic health service to
its people. Priority is given to the control o f infectious diseases, especially
HIV/AIDS/STI, TB and malaria, as well as the reduction o f matemal mortality. With
regard to specific HAMSET disease control programs, the country has developed and i s
implementing well-defined, comprehensive five-year strategic plans for HIV/AIDS/STI
(2003-2007),    TB (2004-2008) and malaria (the 2001-2005 plan was successfilly

  The on-going TB prevalence survey financed byHAMSET, once completed, will provide critical
informationfor TB control.

executed, the 2006-2010 plan has been adopted).        These strategic plans provide the
framework for the HAMSET project's support.              A draft National Sexual and
ReproductiveHealthPolicy hasjust beenprepared.

Recipient's commitment and actions:        The Government is strongly committed to
improving health in general and to the fight against HIV/AIDS/STI, TB and malaria in
particular.  This is a critical element behind Eritrea's achievements in child health,
malaria and HIV/AIDS as discussed above as well as the successful implementation o f
the on-going HAMSET project. HAMSET is the best performer in IDA's portfolio in
Eritrea.   It also compares favorably with other IDA-financed Multi-Country AIDS
Program(MAP)projects inthe region. The Mid-Term Review o f the HAMSET project
concluded that the Government has made impressive progress in the multi-sectoral
control of HAMSET diseases (especially promoting healthy behavior though multi-level
communication),      strengthening HAMSET diagnostic, health care and counseling
services, and community-based response. The strong leadership o f the MOH and good
collaboration with line ministries and civil society are key to the good performance o f
this project.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement

The link betweenhealth andmacroeconomics is well established. For a low-income SSA
country like Eritrea, the rationale to combat HIV/AIDS/STI, TB, malaria and RH, all o f
which are MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs), i s beyond dispute.

Implementation o f the HAMSET project has been successful. With the prospect o f the
HAMSET credit being fully utilized soon, it is important to maintain the momentum in
addressing HAMSET diseases and to scale up success. As a very poor country facing
economic difficulties, Eritrea i s unable to raise adequate domestic resources for this
purpose. Although Eritrea was allocated modest amounts o f US$ 8.1 million for
HIV/AIDS andUS$2.6 million for malaria by the Global Fund(GFATM) under the first
phase, the country receives limited extemal financing for the health sector and thus IDA
support is critical.

IDA's contribution to health sector development inEritrea is significant andhas evolved
over the years. Both the recently closed Health project and the nearly fully disbursed
HAMSET project supported the implementation o f key priorities for the sector. Policy
dialogue which started within the context o f these projects has continued. Another pivotal
development was the preparation o f the Health Sector Note (Report No. 28267-ER72001)
which formed the basis o f the Government's health sector policy preparation. Currently,
IDA is the largest external financier for the health sector as well as for the control o f
HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria.          Except the GFATM, other donors typically provide
supporting technical assistance.

The updated Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for 2005-2007 states that IDA will continue to
maintain its engagement with the Government in addressing humanitarian and social
vulnerability. Investing in the follow-on o f the successful HAMSET project would be
part o f the effort to improve the performance o f the IDA portfolio in Eritrea. Thus, the


                                             7

proposed project is consistent with the ISN objectives. It i s also in line with the World
Bank's overall goal for health, nutrition and population inthe Africa region, which aims
to help client countries achieve sustainable improvements in their health outcomes,
especially for the poor.          The World Bank's comparative advantages in (i)
macroeconomics and health, (ii)    multi-sectoral actions for health and (iii) system
                                                                                  health
strengthening can support countries inmeeting this objective6.

3. Compliance with repeater requirements:

Compliance with basic repeater requirements: The on-going HAMSET Project has been
rated satisfactory for implementation progress and achievement o f development
objectives in all Project Status Reports since effectiveness.           The Mid-term Review
confirmed that: (i)  the project implementationis on track; (ii) development objectives
                                                                   the
are likely to be met; and (iii) Development Objective ratingis satisfactory. Available
                                the
information shows that impact so far has been consistent with original Project Appraisal
Document (PAD) expectations.          There are no unresolved fiduciary issues, or any
environmental, social and safeguard problems. As discussed above, external support for
health and HAMSET diseases i s limited and without a repeater project, the country will
not be able to maintain the momentum, scale up interventions or address RH.

Compliance with MAP repeater requirements:                 The National Strategic Plan for
HIV/AIDS/STI was developed in2003. It reflects Eritrea's HIV/AIDS priority areas and
corresponding strategies to address them. Leadership and coordination is provided by the
national high level HAMSET Steering Committee in which line ministries and civil
society are represented. Community grant applications have been processed within a
reasonable time.      The country has initiated exceptional, innovative implementation
measures such as the highly-successful RapidResult Initiatives. MOH and other technical
units inthe line ministries have provide good technical support for subprojects andpublic
sector activities.   The only requirement which the country has not fully met i s the
establishment o f an operational M&E system for HIV/AIDS. This is also a weakness for
most MAP projects as identified by the Interim Review o f MAP. However, progress in
M&Ehas beenmade recently, such as the finalization o f the National M&E Framework
for HIV/AIDS/STI. An M&E system will be fully operational under HAMSET 11, (see
SectionC).

4. Higher level objectives to which the project contributes

Among the MDGs, Goal 4 (improving maternal health), Goal 5 (reducing child mortality)
and Goal 7 (combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other communicable diseases) are health-
related. By addressing HAMSET diseases, the proposedproject would directly contribute
to all o f these goals. The addition o f the reproductive health component provides the
opportunity to address two additional MDGs; Goal 4 (promote gender equality and
empowerment o f women) and Goal 6 (improve maternal health). Based on the current
trends, Eritrea could, with continued investment and support from development partners,

be one o f a very few SSA countries to achieve many o f the health-related MDGs,
especially those for child mortality, malaria and HIV/AIDS. Given the clear linkage
between health, poverty and economic development, the project would ultimately
contribute toward achieving Eritrea's poverty alleviation and economic growth
objectives.

B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

This project is a Sector Investment Grant under IDA'SMAP for the Africa Region. It i s
the follow-on to the Eritrea HIV/AIDS/STI, MalariaandTB Control Project (HAMSET).

2. Projectdevelopmentobjectiveandkey indicators

The project's development objectives are to: (i)   contain the spread o f HIV/AIDS/STI in
vulnerable groups as well as the general population through a focused multi-sectoral
approach, with renewed attention to the most vulnerable populations; (ii)expand the
coverage o f Directly Observed Treatment (DOT), improve case detection and treatment
outcomes for TB; (iii)   reduce or at least maintain malaria mortality and morbidity at the
current low levels; (iv) improve the coverage o f effective Reproductive Health (RH)
interventions; and (v) strengthen the overall health system, including humanresources for
health, to enable the country to better address HAMSET diseases.

As HAMSET I1 supports the priorities and activities o f the National Strategic Plans
(NSP) for HAMSET diseases, the project adopts selected indicators from the NSPs as its
keyperfonnance indicators.

        measures, prevention and treatment, and support investment at the lower levels
        where front line services are delivered;
         Broadenthe evidence base for HAMSET diseases;
         Promote the integration o f activities at all levels by supporting the "Three Ones"
         approach not only inHIV/AIDS but in all HAMSET diseases, especially through
         (i)the development of national and local comprehensive work plans
         encompassing all activities, not just those funded by HAMSET and (ii)
         conducting annual joint-reviews o f HAMSET diseases. This i s to avoid
         duplication of efforts, maximize efficiency and synergy, ensure complementarity
         andhelp lay the foundation for a future "Sector-Wide Approach" to health sector
         development; and
         Strengthen the collaboration between HAMSET I1and other concurrent human
         development (HD) and non-HD operations by IDA in the country (Integrated
         Early Childhood Development, Education, Power Distribution and Rural
         Electrification, etc.)

3. Project Descriptionby Components

The project's total cost is estimated at US$ 26.5 million. This would be financed by a
US$ 24 million        ant from IDA, US$ 2 million* from the GoE and US$ 0.5 million from
the communities? The project has four components:

Multi-Sectoral Response (US$ 3 million): This component supports key (non-health)
line ministries, and civil society organizations" at both national and zoba level to scale


  Inthe case of RH, the draft nationalstrategic planhasnotyetbeenfinalized. HAMSETI1wouldhelp
with the finalization of the plan.
* This isa tentative number.
  Community contributions are often in-kind.

up prevention (especially behavior change communication (BCC) and stigma reduction),
care and support interventions for HIV/AIDS/STI, malaria, TB and RH (with emphasis
on mobilizing communities to utilize health services). The multi-sectoralresponse will be
more focused than under HAMSET. With technical guidance from the MOH and the
Project Management Unit (PMU), multi-sectoral partners will be facilitated inidentifying
evidence-based interventionstargeting vulnerable groups. Work planswill be subject to a
competitive appraisal process with a set o f clear eligibility criteria that reflect the
project's priorities and take into account various factors such as implementers'
comparative advantages, past performance as well as their compliance with M&E
requirements. There will be no "hardware" activities (e.g. construction) under this
component. Where multi-sectoral partners have zoba level presence, it is expected that
the majority o f resources and implementationwill be carried out at the zoba level.

For both national and zoba implementers, the project will support the development,
implementation and monitoringhpervision o f their annual integrated HAMSET work
plans. Their preliminary work plans are to be prepared by October o f each year and
finalizedby the end o fFebruary o f the following year.

Health Sector Response (US$ 14 million): This has five sub-components -
HIV/AIDS/STI (US$ 3 million), TB (US$ 2 million), malaria (US$ 2 million), RH(US$
4 million) and HumanResources for Health (US$ 3 million). Each o f the first four sub-
components will comprise three activity categories:

     (a) Improve the information base for decision making: The project will support
         disease surveillance and reporting, surveys and operational research. Priority is
         given to (i)    routine disease reporting over "drop-in" surveys; (ii)          activities that
         build up in-country capacity and make use o f existing mechanisms (e.g.
         Integrated Disease Surveillance system o f the MOH)" and (iii)practical
          operational research. For each of the HAMSET diseases, one major undertaking
          for the health sector response is to coordinate a mapping exercise o f high risk
          groups and the current coverage o f interventions to identify vulnerable
         populations and strategic areas for targeted interventions.
     (b) Scale up prevention interventions: The project will support the MOH (in close
          collaborating with other sectors and the communities) to scale up the successful
          BCC program for HIV/AIDS under HAMSET and, wherever appropriate, expand
          it to cover allHAMSET diseases inone integratedmessage. The project will also
          support other effective non-BCC prevention interventions for HAMSETdiseases.
          Details are elaborated in the Annexes on the project description and for each
          disease.
     (c) Scale up diagnostic, treatment, care and support services: The project aims to
          help the MOH improve the availability, accessibility and utilization o f quality



 loCivil Society organizations refer to BIDHO (an organization o f People Living with AIDS andHIV or
 PLWHA), NationalUniono f EritreanWomen, National Union o f EritreanYouth, NationalConfederation
 o f Workers and the faith based organizations.
 ''New  important mechanisms will also be introduced, e.g. maternal mortality audits.

        services for the diagnosis, treatment, care and support services for,HAMSET
        diseases.

    Human resources for HAMSET diseases (US$ 3 million): HAMSET I1will improve
    human resources for the fight against HAMSET diseases by supporting the
    development and implementation o f an overall Human Resources for Health (HRH)
    policy and strategic plan. Not limited to pre-service training, this sub-component will
    address other systemic HRH issues such as HRH management, coordinated HRH
    planning across the sector, retention and deployment, the piloting o f incentive
    mechanisms for HAMSET service providers, etc. By doing so, the project will
    contribute to increasing the number o f appropriately trained, motivated and equitably
    distributed health care providers for Eritrea.      Although in-service training for
    HAMSET diseases will be the responsibility o f each technical program inthe health
    sector response, the Research and Human Resource Development (R&HRD)
    Department will play an important role in coordinating different in-service training
    activities to promote maximumefficiency and integration.

Community Managed HAMSET ResponseProgram (US$4million): As a continuation
o f HAMSET's Community-Managed HAMSET Response Program (CMHRP), this
component aims to scale up and consolidate community-driven initiatives to address
HAMSET diseases including reproductive health.              Learning from the HAMSET
experience, CMHRP will (i)    empower communities to take charge o f their health through
the support o f small-scale, genuinely community-managed sub-projects; (ii)promote
results-based approaches such as the use o f RRI in sub-project implementation; (iii)
strengthen the links, coordination, and synergies between community subprojects and
activities by other HAMSET implementers; and (iv) developing the capacity o f
communities to prepare and implement subprojects. CMHRP has two sub-components.

HAMSET Grants for Sub-projects (US$ 3.4 million): This subcomponent will finance
community-managed initiatives that directly address HAMSET diseases. Priority will be
given to low-cost, effective community interventions for HAMSET diseases, especially
those targeting the most vulnerable groups. CMHRP will adopt a results-based
framework that is aligned with the national objectives and priorities in HAMSET
diseases. An "open menu" o f activities inconjunction with a negative list will be used to
help communities choose effective interventions and, at the same time, allow innovations
and flexibility. Community groups, with technical support from other HAMSET I1
participating partners operating at the local level, will identify, develop implement, and
sustain community subprojects.

Community Mobilization and Capacity Development (US$ 0.6 million):                     This
subcomponent will support community-based activities to: (i)     mobilize communities and
help them identifyandprioritize their HAMSET problems; (ii) communitycapacity
                                                                  build
to develop and implement       subprojects through skills in participatory planning, sub-
project management and implementation; (iii) the RRI approach in community
                                                   apply
subprojects; and (iv) monitor and evaluate sub-projects, including participatory
assessments to obtain feedback from beneficiaries. Capacity building activities will be



                                             13

strategically provided by the C M H W team in collaboration with other implementing
partners.

Project Management and Coordination, Capacity Building, M&E, and Innovation and
New Policy Development (US$3 million): This has four sub-components.

        Project management and coordination (US$ 1 million): This will cover the
        operating costs o f the existing national and zoba Project Management Units
        (PMU) as well as the costs for coordination o f project activities at the central
        level.
          Capacity building (US$ 0.5 million):                 This aims to mobilize and build the
        capacity o f non-health cadres (e.g. in non-health sectors, local governments and
        civil society) in planning, management and implementation o f project activities.
        The project will promote knowledge sharing and the dissemination o f best
        practices among the implementers.
        M&E (US$ 1 million): While the Health Sector Response Component supports
        epidemiological and behavioral surveillance, disease reporting, etc. (the outcome
         and impact aspects o f the overall M&E framework), this sub-component focuses
         on cross-cutting, operational aspects o f M&E. These include the development and
         implementation o f a comprehensive M&E system and the use o f data to improve
        program management and decision making. Details are further discussed in
         section C3 andAnnex 3.
        Innovation and New Policy Development (US$ 0.5 million): This sub-component
         supports the development, piloting and evaluation o f innovative approaches in
         service delivery which can then be used for system-wide application; for example,
         incentive mechanisms for service providers and users, conditional cash transfers
         for maternal and child health, a community report card on HAMSET services,
         preparation work for a possible sector-wide approach (SWAP)program, etc.

4. Project Descriptionby Diseases:

HAMSET I1components are mainly organizedby implementing agencies as described
above. This sectionprovides a project description by diseases.

HIV/AIDS/STI

Prevention: The project supports key priorities in the NSP for HN/AIDS/STI, with a
renewed focus on targeting vulnerable groups such as CSWs and their clients, truck
drivers, badtea houseshotel workers, conscripts and populations living in urban "hot
spots". The rationale is to constrain transmission among vulnerable groups and from
vulnerable groups to the general population. For this purpose, the project will support (i)
a socio-geographic mapping exercise o f vulnerable groups1*; (ii)scaling up BCC,



l2 Some vulnerable groups inEritrea have already been identified epidemiologically by the 2001and 2003
prevalence surveys. Socio-geographic mapping is the next step to identifythe size o f such vulnerable
groups, their distribution, social networks, etc. for targeted interventions. Inaddition, mapping will help


                                                        14

condom and STI referral programs for such populations; (iii)                 increase the coverage and
quality o f VCT services, including the possible "routine VCT" approach for selected
urban hot spots (especially Assab) in which people are offered VCT services (with an
"opt out" option) every time they come into contact with the health system. At the same
time, HAMSET I1will continue to support efforts to raise the levels o f knowledge, good
behavior and practices related to HIV/AIDS and reduce stigma inthe general population
(especially through an increase in the involvement o f PLWHA in HIV/AIDS education
efforts).

Treatment, care and support: HAMSET I1will focus on:

             strengthening syndromic management o f sexually transmitted infections
             (STI);
             financing support activities which are crucial for successful highly active anti-
             retroviral therapy (HAART) implementation - such as management o f
             opportunistic infections (01),multivitaminsupplements for PLWHA, training
             o f health professionals in HAART, improving the laboratory capacity for
             HAART, procurement o fHIV/AIDS commodities and supplies (as ARVs will
             be financed mainly by GFATM), and strengthening logistic management
             information system for ARVs andAIDS supplies;
             care and support for PLWHA by religious groups, communities and networks
             o f PLWHA - the latter through facilitating the formation and effective
              operation o f BIDHO (the NGO o f PLWHA inEritrea) at the zoba levels (and
              sub-zoba levels where the prevalence is high);and
              care and support for AIDS orphans.

Expanding the information base for decision making: HAMSET I1 will support the
monitoring o f the epidemic and its determinants in vulnerable groups and the general
population.

Malaria: HAMSET I1will continue to support Eritrea's highly successful multi-pronged
strategy for malaria control.         The project's approach is to help the National Malaria
Control Program (NMCP) to at least maintain the current good coverage o f key
interventions as well as address the areas that need further vigorous actions as identified
by the evaluation o f the implementation o f the last National 5-year Strategic Plan. The
latter include the need to (i)       maintain and increase the coverage and use o f ITNs, (ii)
improve the management o f fever at the community and health station levels, (ii)                ensure
the availability and accessibility o f antimalarials and complementary drugs, (iii)             identify
the most effective methods o f vector control and how they can be best targeted, (iv)
introduce new effective malaria control commodities such as LLINs and ACT, and (v)
identify and implement the most appropriate methods for reducing malaria morbidity and
mortality inpregnant women.




identify the extent of other vulnerable groups such as injection drugs users (IDU) and menwho have sex
with men(MSM).


                                                     15

Tuberculosis: As progress inTB control under HAMSET was not on a par with malaria
andHIV/AIDS, support for the TB programwillbe one o fthe key priorities o fHAMSET
11. To achieve the project development objective (PDO) o f improving DOTS coverage,
TB detection and treatment outcomes, the project will especially support: (i)
strengthening o f program management capacity at both national and zoba levels, (ii)
improving TB management skills for health workers, (iii)fully operationalizing the
quality assurance program for TB diagnostics set up under HAMSET to reduce the high
percentage o f smear-negative TB cases, (iv) ascertaining and improving the quality o f TB
recording and reporting, (v) strengthening supervision and (vi) enhancing community
involvement in TB control (including an evaluation o f the Community DOTS (pilots
under HAMSET for scaling up). Special attention will be paid to TB supervision from
central to zoba levels and from zoba to sub-zoba levels. In addition, the zoba
Communicable Disease Coordinator will conduct "quarterly TB monitoring Eieetings"
which will bring sub-zoba TB staff together to review TB control activities (see Annex 7
for details).

Reproductive Health: HAMSET I1will support the scaling up o f a set o f critical RH
interventions which aim at reducingmaternal andneonatal mortality as well as improving
adolescent reproductive health. These include: (i)  improving the quality and coverage o f
ANC; (ii)    expanding access to skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care
(EmOC); (iii)  introducing maternal death audits; (iv) child spacing to improve maternal
health and child survival; (v) increasing access to PMTCT; (vi) ensuringblood safety and
availability for EmOC; (vii) increasing adolescents' access to appropriate, youth-friendly
RH information and services; and (viii) reducing gender based harmful traditional
practices such as FGM, early marriage and inappropriatefeeding practices.

The key approaches are to: (i)  integrate RHwith other HAMSET diseases; (ii)    strengthen
community level interventions to increase awareness o f RH risks and danger signs,
promote good RHpractices as well as mobilize communities for care, support, referrals
andmaternal audit; and(iii) inter-sectoral activities inRH.
                             promote

Details are elaborated in Annex 8. A draft National Sexual and Reproductive Health
Policy has recently been drawn andwill be put inplace by December 2005. HAMSET I1
will support the keypriorities andactivities o fthe new policy and strategic guidelines.

Links between HAMSET diseases: HAMSET I1will exploit opportunities to address
the close links and complex interfaces betweenHAMSET diseases, such as:

       HIV/AIDS and TB: TB screening and prophylaxis for PLWHA, VCT referral for
        TB patients, treatment o fTB/HIV co-infection,
       RH and TB: effective treatment and follow up o f pregnant women with TB and
        their children;
        HIV/AIDS/STI and RH: VCT services as part o f ANC, PMTCT, integrated BCC
        for HIV/AIDS/STI andRH ;
        STIand HIV/AIDS: VCT referral andBCC intervention for STIpatients; and
       Malaria and RH: prevention andtreatment o fmalaria inpregnant women.

    e   Malaria and HIWAIDS: provisiono f ITNs to PLWHA.

A flexible step-wise approach: The project will be implemented in steps. Each step
equals one year, toward the end o f which there will be ajoint-review for each HAMSET
disease which brings together all the key implementers and donors to review the overall
program (not just activities funded by HAMSET 11). It will review the progress for the
past year and the plans for the coming year (See Annex 11 for details o f annual joint-
reviews)     On the basis o f such reviews, and the lessons from the upcoming
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) o f HAMSETI3 as well as other studies and
surveys, the project content will be amended as necessary. This approach will also allow
flexibility to address new HAMSET priorities which might surface during project
implementation. Project activities and costing were calculated in detail only for the first
year at appraisal, but with clear agreed milestones and indicative costs for each (sub)
component for subsequent years. The proposedkey tasks o f each step include:

    0    Year I:Start implementationo fHAMSET 11.Complete mapping exercises o f
        vulnerable groups. Finalize the National Sexual andReproductive HealthPolicy
        and start implementationo f selected activities. Put inplace annualjoint-reviews.
    0    Year 2: Fullyoperationalize the nationalM&E frameworks for HAMSET
        diseases. Scale up successful interventions. Conduct 2nd Lot Quality Assurance
        Survey (LQAS). Conduct the mid-term review toward end o fYear 2.
    e    Year 3: Maximize scaling up o f interventions withinthe project's capacity.
    0    Year 4: Conduct 3rd LQASandother evaluation. Wrap up implementationand
        ICR.

5. Lessonslearned and reflected in the project design

HAMSET as thefoundation of the new project: HAMSET i s a success and provides a
solid foundation for HAMSET 11. Key findings o f the HAMSET Mid-Term Review
(MTR) are incorporated inthe design o f HAMSET I1and successful interventions such
as malaria control, RRI, and BCC under HAMSET will be the basis for scaling up.
Project design will be further fine-tuned as new lessons from HAMSET emerge. Key
cross-cutting lessons from the MTR o f the HAMSET project include: (i)a simple,
functional M&E system which incorporates regular feedback is crucial for decision
makingandprogrammanagement; (ii)         communities can be mobilized for disease control
efforts and behavior change, but they need to take charge and community initiatives need
to be genuinely community driven; and (iii)      all implementers (especially those at the
local levels) needto give priority to the most effective interventions.

The needfor a renewedfocus on targeted interventions for vulnerable groups and their
linkages to the general population:       Currently, HIV prevalence in Eritrea is highly
concentrated among certain vulnerable groups such as CSWs, truck drivers, badtea
houseskotel workers, conscripts and those living in urban hot spots. Evidence from
HAMSET shows that targeting vulnerable groups in Eritrea is feasible. For this reason,


l3The ICRfor HAMSET is expectedto be completedbyJune 2006.


                                             17

one of the key features o f the design o f HAMSET I1is a renewed focus on interventions
to, halt transmission o f HIV/AIDS among vulnerable populations and between such
groups and the general population. Targeted interventions are also relevant for other
HAMSET conditions such as malaria and RH, where mortality and morbidity
differentials between different socio-economic and ruravurban groups are large and thus
focusing on the most vulnerable groups is appropriate.                  Successfully reaching these
populations i s thus strategically vital, and requires good mapping and actions from
multiple sectors andactors as well as locally drivenprograms andresponses.

Other disease-specijk          lessons from     HAMSET: These include: (i)strengthening
management capacity and technical skills of TB staff; (ii)           vigorous malaria control efforts
needs to be continuedto avoid the re-emergence o f malaria outbreaks as well as to reduce
further malaria mortality and morbidity; (iii) links between reproductive health and
                                                       the
other HAMSET diseases are two-way and the latter cannot be adequately addressed
without improving RH services; and (iv) the commonality and synergy o f interventions
for HAMSET diseases could be further exploited, especially inprimaryhealth care.

Lessons from the Eritrea Health Project: The draft ICR for the recently closed IDA-
supported Eritrea Health Projectt4 emphasizes the importance o f realistic and focused
project development objectives which have clear links to project components and
activities (a clear input-output-outcome production chain). It also points to the need for a
balance between "hardware" and "software" activities. IDA support in malaria control
andblood safety under the HealthProject was shown to bevery cost-effective.

Lessonsfrom the Interim Review of MAP projects (October 2004). Strategic thinking is
needed in terms o f how to invest in specific activities and interventions which have the
greatest impact, based on analyses o f current epidemiological and behavioral data. An
evidence-based approach that strikes the balance between broad-based general public
intervention and the targeting o f vulnerable groups is called for. A performance-based
disbursement system should be considered to encourage good perfonners. Civil society
should be fully involved in the design o f materials and procedures for grant making,
application and reporting. So far, no MAP has a fbnctional M&E system where data are
systematically collected and utilized for sound and evidence-based decision-making
purposes. Therefore, adequate resources should be set aside to develop operational M&E
systems which can provide adequate biological, behavioral and routine program activity
monitoring information.

Inaddition, to enhance the quality of interventions, IDA should (i) better technical
                                                                                 offer
guidance to implementation agencies on good practices; (ii)                 assist with developing a
standard set o f quality guidelines for sub-projects; and (iii)            develop greater technical
support capacity, especially for scaling up local responses, strategic planning, designing
national M&EandimplementingARV procurement, supply anddelivery systems.

6. Alternativesconsideredandreasonsfor rejection

Same scope as HAMSET (namely, no inclusion of RH in the project): As discussed
above, this was rejected due to (i)      the urgent need to address the poor RH outcomes,
which are an outlier in an otherwise promising set o f health indicators; and (ii)the
existence o f clear two-way links between RH vs. malaria and HIV/AIDS, which cannot
be adequately addressed ifRHservices are not improved concurrently.

Programmatic approach:           One alternative for the project design is to take a
programmatic approach (e.g. a health sector development support program) inwhich IDA
would finance all o f the health sector's priorities under the MOH's strategic plan, notjust
HAMSET diseases. However, such a programmatic approach would require: (i)an
advanced Health Sector Strategic Plan, (ii)a medium-term expenditure framework
(MTEF) for health; and(iii)     acceptable levels o f transparency and accountability inhealth
planningand budgeting (e.g. public expenditure review for health). The current macro-
economic environment is not conducive for such an approach. However, to the extent
possible in the context o f a MAP project, efforts will be made inthe areas o f planning,
financing and budgeting, implementation and M&E o f HAMSET I1 to prepare a
foundation on which a future SWAPoperationcan be built.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnershiparrangements(if applicable)

There are only a limited number o f development partners financing activities to address
HAMSET diseases inEritrea15. These include international and bilateral agencies (most
notably the Global Fund, UNAIDS, WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF, World Bank, USAID, and
the Italian Cooperation) and one international NGO (Norwegian Church Aid). For
HIV/AIDS, coordination between partners is through the Global Fund Country
Coordinating Mechanism, the HAMSET Steering Committee and the UN Working
Group on HIV/AIDS. For RH, there is a strong but informal coordinating committee that
meets once a month and includes all donors, UN agencies, NGOs and the MOH. In
addition, the HAMSET PMU i s also managing the Global Fund resources, so
coordination i s also functioning at the project management level.

Under HAMSET 11, IDA will continue to collaborate closely with the other development
partners to assist the GoE in implementing the "Three Ones" principle, not just for
HIV/AIDS but also for the other HAMSET diseases, especially in strategic planning and
M&E. For each HAMSET disease, annual joint reviews and planning led by the
Government will be the main coordination mechanism to foster collaboration among
partners.



l5Not only are there few development partners but their total contribution to health sector financing i s
small.

 Coordinationwith other IDA Projects

  There are a number o f IDA-financed projects which have links to HAMSET 11.First, the
  Integrated Early Childhood Development Project has clear links to both the reproductive
  health and malaria objectives o f HAMSET as well as the CDD implementation
  mechanisms. Second, the Power Distribution and Rural Electrification Project is linked
  with the Reproductive Health activities o f HAMSET I1 through the provision o f
  electricity supplies to obstetric care units in the areas it covers. Third, the Education
  Project has links to the BCC activities for HAMSET I1diseases implemented by the
4 Ministry o f Education. Finally, the Demobilization and Reintegration Project i s a
  valuable partner in reaching demobilized soldiers, who are a vulnerable group for
  HIV/AIDS/STI. Opportunities for coordination between HAMSET I1and the above IDA
  projects will be exploited throughjoint planning, implementation, supervision andM&E.

  2. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements

  InHAMSET 11, the implementation arrangements will mirror those of HAMSET, with
  some minor strengthening. A detailed description o f the ImplementationArrangements is
  presented inAnnex 13.

  GeographicImplementation:The project will be implementednationally inall 6 zobas
  (districts). Socio-geographic mapping o f vulnerable groups ineach o f the zobas will help
  identifyhot spots and geographic areas o f priority. Special attention will be given to (i)
  Asmara, Assab, Massawa and other urban' areas for HIV/AIDS/STI; (ii)Gash-Barka,
  Debub, Northern Red Sea and Anseba for malaria; (iii)              Northern and Southern Red Sea
  for tuberculosis; and (iv) rural areas, especially those of Northem and Southern Red Sea
  zobas, Gash-Baka and Anseba for reproductive health.

   Strategyand Oversight: TheNational HAMSET Steering Committee (NSC), chairedby
  the Minister o f Health, provides strategic direction and approves the annual work
  program and budget for the HAMSET implementing partners. As a high level political
   and strategic body, the NSC will be strengthened to hold implementers accountable for
   resu1tsl6.

   Implementation: The project will be implemented by the Ministry o f Health, selected
  non-health line ministries, national and local civil society organizations, and community
   groups. Eritrea has been very effective in decentralizing project implementation with
   Project Coordinating committees and Project Management Units at the central and
   regional levels. HAMSET I1will build upon the strong implementation arrangements
   established under HAMSET.


   l6 The Global FundCountry Coordinating Mechanism (CCM), chaired by the Minister o fNational
   Development serves a similar function for the GFATMwork program inEritrea andhas almost an identical
   composition (with the exclusion o f the Zonal Administrators andthe inclusion o fUNagencies). However,
   it was felt bystakeholders during the MTRthat the two committees were appropriate for specific tasks, and
   merging themwould not add value to either HAMSET or the GFATMwork program.


                                                      20

National-LevelCoordination& Implementation:

National Technical Committee (NTC): This comprises the key implementing partners at
the national level. Chaired by the Director General of Health Services o f the MOH, the
N T C reviews workplans and activities o f implementing partners and addresses strategic
implementation and coordination issues. The PMU serves as its secretariat. To improve
the authority and functioning o f the NTC, under HAMSET 11: (i)          the NTC will be
reduced in size (to fewer than 10 members); (ii)     the members will be of a Director
General level (or equivalent); and (iii)   a HAMSET Technical Working (comprising
HAMSET focal persons for all implementing partners) will be established to support the
NTC.

Line Ministries Other than MOH and Civil Society Partners: As in HAMSET, the line
ministries other than M O H and civil society partners will focus their activities on target
groups within their constituencies (i.e. National Confederation o f Eritrean Workers may
focus on mobile construction workers, Ministry of Labour and Human Welfare on
orphans and commercial sex workers, etc) through BCC, IEC and other "software"
interventions.  While all of the multi-sectoral partners add value to the HAMSET I1
project, some ministries and partners such as the Ministry of Defense, Ministry o f
Education, Ministry o f Labour and Human Welfare, and National Union of Eritrean
Women have more strategic roles to play. Other implementingpartners include BIDHO,
National Confederation o f Eritrean workers, National Union o f Eritrean Youth and
Students, Ministry o f Local Government, Ministry o f Information, Cultural Affairs
Bureau, Faith Based Organizations, Ministry o f Transport and Communications, and
other partners that may become active during the project cycle.

Ministiy of Health: Many o f the units of the Ministry o f Health will be active in
HAMSET 11, and will be expected to: (i)     implement health-sector HAMSET activities;
(ii) outnationalmonitoringandevaluationforHAMSETdiseases;and(iii)
    carry                                                                           provide
technical guidance to non-health and community implementers. The Regulatory
Department and the Research and Human Resources Development Department are new
partners. Under HAMSET 11, particular attention will be paid to the management o f
HAMSET programs at the zoba level and health sector's support to the CMHRP and
community participation.

Project Management Unit: PMU i s accountable to the Minister o f Health, and
responsible for various aspects o f project management such as financial management,
procurement and facilitation support to the implementing agencies. Under HAMSET 11,
the project will recruit a Project Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist. The Community
Managed HAMSET Response Program (CMHW) will also be managed from within the
PMU.

Zoba-LevelCoordinationandImplementation:

This largely mirrors the institutional arrangements at the national level.

Under HAMSET, a Zoba Steering Committee (ZSC) provides oversight and strategic
direction and i s ledby the Zonal Administrators. The ZSC also approves zoba HAMSET
budgets. So far, only 3 Zobas have established ZSCs. Under HAMSET 11,maintaining or
establishing ZSC is at the discretion o f the Zonal Administrators. Where there is no Zoba
Steering Committee, its fknctions will be delegated to the Zonal Administrator who i s
encouraged to convene ad hoc committees to support hindher in this capacity.
Membership o f such committees shall be left at the Zoba Administrator's discretion, and
may include heads o f departments, baito members (locally elected representatives),
and/or representatives o f civil society organizations. The Zonal Administrators will be
encouraged inHAMSET I1to guide implementers indeveloping effective and integrated
interventions anddemonstratingresults.

Zoba Project Management Unit (ZPMU) reports to the Zonal Administration (Zoba
Administrator's Office) and includes a Project Officer, CMHRP Facilitator and an
accountant. Under HAMSET 11, the ZPMU will hire additional support staff (data clerk/
secretary) and take a stronger role in programmatic monitoring and evaluation,
supervisiono f community interventions andcoordinating capacity buildingactivities.

Zoba Technical Committee (ZTC) is chaired by the Zoba Medical Officer and provided
with secretarial support by the Zoba PMU. It includes all multi-sectoral and MOH
implementers. The ZTC will be strengthened as a technical and coordinating body to
improve the quality and integration o f Zoba workplans which are responsive to local
priorities (as identified through mapping and LQAS surveys).         The ZTC will also be
oriented innewprocedures for reviewing and approving community subprojects.

Line Ministries Other than the MOH and Civil Society Partners: Multi-sectoral partners
inHAMSET I1will work with the ZTC andwith their central ministry/office to develop
strategic workplans. Where community capacity i s weak, it is expected that multi-sectoral
partners will provide mobilization and facilitation support to communities. As the GoE

formalizes the decentralization process, local government authorities will play a role in
community mobilization andproject coordination.

Zoba Health Management Ofice (ZHMO): Under the leadership o f the Zoba Medical
Officer, the units o f the ZHMO will be coordinated to (i)implement health sector
HAMSET workplans that respond to the targeting priorities identified through mapping
and LQAS and (ii)     provide technical support to non-health implementers. The Health
Promotion Officer, and the Peer Coordinators supported by HAMSET, have the
additional functions o f (i)coordinating the Behavior Change Communication activities
by establishing and facilitating Peer Groups and (ii)providing, in coordination with the
ZPMU, support to the Community Managed Response Component. Additional staff will
be recruitedto facilitate M&E at the zoba level.

VillageHealth Committees: These operate at the kebabi(village) level and are flexible in
structure and composition. Most include local leadershillage administrators, sector
workers and representatives o f civil society organizations. Under HAMSET 11, the
Village Health Committees will continue to play an important role in identifying and
mobilizingcommunities to develop sub-projects (with CHMRP).

Community Management Teams (CMT): This is an elected body to represent the
community group that will benefit from a subproject grant. Onbehalf of the community,
the CMT plans, prepares and implements subprojects. Under HAMSET 11, there will be
an emphasis on (i)    reaching vulnerable populations and (ii)scaling up BCC groups.
These CMT will benefit from additional capacity buildingunder HAMSET 11.

Coordination and Planning: HAMSET I1will emphasize (i)         integrated planning at the
national and regional level and (ii)   improved communication (including supervision,
reporting, and sharing experiences) between national, Zoba and sub-zoba level
implementers.

3. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results

With the exception o f malaria, which has a functioning M&E system, progress on
monitoring and evaluation was uneven under HAMSET. (Some o f these deficiencies are
discussed in Annex 3).        The HAMSET I1 project supports the development and
implementation o f a functioning and sustainable national M&E system for HAMSET
diseases in Eritrea. In that context, HAMSET I1M&E i s an integral part of such a
national system which should allow assessment o f (i) progress o f project activities
                                                        the
(monitoring), and (ii) overall effect o f the project on the beneficiary population
                         the
(evaluation). The key approach of M&Eunder HAMSET I1is to buildupon, consolidate
and improve various existing M&E initiatives for HAMSET diseases in Eritrea. Every
implementer at national, zoba and sub-zoba levels has a role to play in M&E, including
the use o f M&E data for decision making.         The proposed Annual Joint-Review o f
HAMSET diseases is a keypart o fthe effort to promote one national M&E system.




                                            23

TheM&E System

M&E under HAMSET I1will focus on: (i)          strengthening and consolidating the existing
M&E systems in the MOH (particularly the Health Management Information System
(HMIS); and (ii)developing a component of the M&E system to capture project
management data from implementing agencies outside the MOH (line ministries, partner
agencies andcommunity subprojects).

Strengthening and consolidating the existing M&E systems in the MOH: A Modular
HealthManagement Information System (MHMIS) will be developedwith the support o f
HAMSET I1as well as other development partners such as USAID, using the existing
HMIS as the base. It will consolidate:

    0   facility-based information on morbidity and mortality as well as in-patient and
        out-patient interventions relatedto HAMSET I1diseases (the existing HMIS).
    0   logistic management information system (the existing LMIS), which will be
        improved to include information about key equipment, pharmaceutical usage and
        supplies.
    0   outreach activities by the MOH, including healthpromotion activities.

Manual reporting forms from sub-zobas will be entered into a modular computerized
information system at the zoba level which then feeds into a central MHMIS. At the
national level, the Regulatory Department will carry out rapid analysis and prepare
bulletinsabout keyindicators to informdecisionmakingbyimplementers at all levels.

Capturingproject management datafrom non-MOH implementing agencies: The second
M&E component is a system developed to support the PMUto manage the project and
gather information from other line ministries as well as CMHRP. Both o f these data
streams will be entered into a computer database at the zoba level and forwarded to the
national PMU. The Regulatory Department will also analyze these data and report on
them inbulletins.

Data from the M&E system will enable: (i)     a bi-annual management review at each level;
and(ii) annualjoint review at the national level.
         an

Every two years, the Regulatory Department will take the lead in a decentralized
population based survey (LQAS) conducted by small sub-zoba teams to track selected
outcome indicators such as changes in behavior, knowledge and attitudes, utilization o f
services, etc. Other special studies will include health facility assessments.

It is a complex task to develop an M&E system for a multi-sectoral project addressing
four health issues. For this reason, a two-component M&E system is proposed as
described above. To ensure that both components are mutually complementary, the
MOHRegulatory Department will coordinate all M&E activities, and collate information
from the MHMIS and the PMU. It will also collate and use information from other
existing data streams @e., disease surveillance, population-based surveys, health facility

assessments, and other special studies). See Annex 3 for additional details about the
M&Esystem.

Priority activities to be carried out inthe first year under HAMSET I1are:

0  Draft the national M&E conceptual framework to include HAMSET I1diseases
0  Carry out a baseline survey
   Develop an M&E operationalplan.
0  Develop an MHMIS inone pilot zoba and scale this up to the five remaining zobas
0  Develop a computerized PMUM&E system inone pilot zoba and scale this up to the
    five remaining zobas.
0   Conduct the first annualjoint-review.

4. Sustainability

Institutional and capacity sustainability. The Government o f Eritrea, with the support o f
development partners including IDA, has mobilized different sectors, mass organizations
and communities to respond to HAMSET diseases in a multi-sectoral approach. It i s
highly likely that after the project, the social capital as well as the sectoral and
community capacity built with HAMSET 11contributions will continue. For the health
sector, the project would increase the institutional capacity to develop policies and
workplans, implement programs, as well as monitor and evaluate interventions.

Technical sustainability:      As discussed in the technical appraisal section, HAMSET I1
supports well-established, simple technical interventions and practices. Most o f them
have already been applied inthe country. Therefore, technical sustainability is likely.

Financial sustainability: Although HAMSET 11's approach i s to focus on "software" and
minimize the additional recurrent costs, financial sustainability seems unlikely given the
current macroeconomic difficulties and limited domestic resources for health in Eritrea.
However, the control o f communicable diseases is public goods and can evidently
contribute to economic growth andpoverty alleviation. Plus, investing inHIV/AIDS/STI,
malaria, TB and reproductive health i s cost-effective and with a highreturn o f economic
and social benefits (see Annex 16 for details). These justify the investment despite the
unlikely financial sustainability. In addition, it is likely that Eritrea would be able to
access more resources from a wider range o f development partners as macro-policies and
fiscal transparency improve. Thus, the capacity o f HAMSET to demonstrate results will
be crucial. Long-term financial sustainability ultimately rests with Eritrea's ability to
raise and allocate domestic resources for health in general and HAMSET diseases in
particular.

5. Critical risks andpossiblecontroversialaspects

Intenszjkation of border tension: Currently, the border dispute between Eritrea and
Ethiopia is still unresolved. The risk o f escalating border tension remains a threat.
Project implementation could be adversely affected as seen in the recently closed Eritrea


                                                25

Health Project. The Project's flexibility in design and implementation would allow the
GoE to adapt program activities insuch a circumstance.

Risk of complacency:        So far, political commitment in the fight against HAMSET
diseases has been exceptionally high in Eritrea.              However, there i s a small risk o f
complacency, especially in areas where there has been success (e.g. malaria). Mitigation
measures include: (i)      continued dialogue; (ii)strengthening the information base for
HAMSET diseases; and (iii)      communicationprograms.

Human resources shortage: Currently, Eritrea i s facing a shortage in human resources
for health, especially inthe higher cadres (doctors, registered nurses). Although it is not
due to a massive "brain drain" as in some other Sub-Saharan African countries, this i s
nevertheless a major challenge for the sector and has the potential o f constraining
Component 2 (Health Sector Response), especially inhealth system-dependent activities
such as TB control and Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC). Mitigationmeasures include:
(i)supporting the implementation o f the HRH sub-component; (ii)                   working beyond the
public sector (e.g. tapping the capacity o f communities, civil society organizations); and
(iii) procurementofconsultancieswhilebuildingin-countrycapacity.
    strategic

Failure to embrace the most cost-eflective interventions: Due to inadequate information
as well as misconceptions about priorities and effective interventions by local leaders,
implementers (especially at the zoba and community levels) might fail to embrace the
most cost-effective interventions. This risk, ,which is higher for the multi-sectoral
approach to H N / A I D S control than for other HAMSET diseases, would be mitigated
through: (i)technical support and clear guidelines for zoba HAMSET technical
committees for the technical appraisal o f various implementers' proposals and work
plans; (ii) development o f guidelines and menus o f eligible interventions as well as a
results-based framework for community sub-projects; and (iii)                  sharing information on
best practices and cost-effective interventions with local implementers.

Implementation failure:        The Eritrea 2004 Country Portfolio Performance Review
(CPPR) found the performance o f the IDA portfolio in the country to be mixed, and the
GoE is working hard to improve the situation. HAMSET is the best performer, mostly
due to a highly effective MOH, high commitment o f central and local governments as
well as other implementers. Nonetheless, there i s a risk o f implementation failure for the
proposed project due to cross-cutting challenges and underlying macroeconomic
constraints.    The risk o f implementation failure is higher for new and challenging
components such as HRH and RH. Mitigation measures include close supervision,
proactive implementation support andcontinued policy dialogue.

Limited M&E: Given the patchy progress in M&E under HAMSETI7, the risk o f
inadequate M&E exists for parts o f HAMSET 11. This would be mitigated by (i)
application o f the simple yet highly effective M&E tool such as the LQASmethodology;

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic andfinancial analyses

Detailed economic analysis on HIV/AIDS has been carried out by both the HAMSET
project and the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program for the Africa Region (Report No.
20727 AFR, paragraphs 76-78) which demonstrates the impact o f the epidemic on
economic development and poverty as well as the cost-benefit o f HIV/AIDS
interventions. There is also a large androbust body o f knowledge regarding the impact o f
other HAMSET diseases on African economies and the economic rationale for
interventions (see Annex 16 for details).

The project will minimize its fiscal impact by prioritizing "software" over "hardware".
Civil works will be minimal and restricted to renovation o f existing RH facilities. The
recurrent cost of future maintenance for "hardware" and additional equipment financed
by the project will be negligible. Additional staffing and operational costs are modest.
Counterpart fimd requirements are reasonable and only cover duties andtaxes incurredby
the project andpart o f the operating costs mainly salaries.

However, the fiscal impact of the project is likely to be significant. A total o f US$24
million is expected to be disbursed from IDA during the project cycle. The Government
will needto invest aroundUS$0.5 millionper year as counterpart funding for the project,
which is equivalent to 5% o fthe MOH's recurrent budget inFY04. The Government will
assume the responsibility for the maintenance o f project investments after HAMSET I1
closes.




                                             28

2. Technical

The proposed project is built on the principles o f internationally-accepted best practices
for HAMSET diseases, taking into account the country's specific socioeconomic
circumstances and epidemiological situation. For HIV/AIDS, the approach is one o f
addressing an epidemic which i s not as generalized as in other SSA countries, yet very
highincertainpopulationsandhot spots. Insuch a circumstance, the HIV/AIDS program
needs to focus intensively on the most vulnerable groups and their linkages to the general
population. Socio-geographic mapping o f hot spots will facilitate targeted interventions.
For malaria, the project supports the Government's strategy in malaria control with
interventions endorsed by the World Health Organization(WHO) andRoll Back Malaria.
The malaria program was already very successful in implementing its first five-year
strategic plan which was supported by HAMSET. For TB, the project will help scale up
the implementation of DOTS, the intemationally accepted strategy for TB control. For
RH, HAMSET I1supports a set of evidenced-based interventions which aim at reducing
maternal and neonatal mortality as well as reducing gender based harmful traditional
practices.

The project would finance the development and implementation o f standard clinical
management protocols developed by the MOH which are in line with the
recommendations o f WHO andUNAIDS. Such protocols will be used for VCT, PMTCT,
prevention o f opportunistic infections, clinical management o f sexually transmitted
diseases, malaria, tuberculosis, antenatal, perinatal andpostnatal care as well as EmOC.

The role o f different sectors and the community in the control o f HAMSET diseases is
well established. Therefore, one o f the mainstays o f HAMSET I1 i s to support a
decentralized approach to the implementation o f an integrated package of HAMSET
interventions in which different sectors, communities and households are mobilized and
empowered. The project also places great emphasis on strengthening institutions, learning
andinnovation, andmanagingfor results.

3. Fiduciary

HAMSET I1Project will make use o f the existing HAMSET institutional arrangements
for procurement and financial management as well as the same control environment.
Financial management and procurement at national level and related coordination and
planning will be the responsibility of the Project Management Unit (PMU) as under
HAMSET.




                                             29

Financial Management

IDA has reviewed the financial management arrangements of the current HAMSET
project on several occasions as part o f the implementation support for ongoing projects in
Eritrea. The most recent review was carried out in December 2004. This followed a
previous assessment in February 2004 to evaluate the financial management
arrangements for conversion to report-based disbursement. The project was the only one
inIDA'SEritreaportfolio that met the requirement, andnow benefits from the flexibility
provided under the report-based disbursement mechanism. Annex 14provides a detailed
review o fthe financial management arrangements for the project.

Inconclusion, the financial management arrangements for the HAMSETprojectmeetthe
minimum requirements to comply with the Bank's OPBP 10.02. The project is well
managed in the area o f financial management, thanks to the tremendous effort o f the
project management, as well as the accounting staff. This inturn has had positive results
in record keeping including the enhancement of the project' computerized accounting
systems. These arrangements will need to be applied to the proposed project through an
action plan included inAnnex 14.

Procurement

Similarly, procurement under HAMSET I1will continue to be carried out by the Project
Management Unit on behalf o f participating agencies (PAS). The rationale for this
arrangement is that the PMUhas demonstrated competence under both the former Health
project and HAMSET to effectively and efficiently carry out procurement on behalf o f
the PAS.

An assessment o f the capacity o f the Implementing Agency to implement procurement
actions for the project was carried out.          The assessment reviewed the national
procurement environment, organizational structure for implementing the project and the
interaction between the project's staff responsible for procurement and for administration
and finance. The key issues and risks concerning procurement for implementation o f the
project have been identified and corrective measures have been agreed and described in
anAction Plan.

A Country Procurement Assessment (CPAR) was completed in June 2002 and a report
submitted to the Government. The report incorporated an action plan for implementing
recommendations for reforming the procurement system in Eritrea. An IDF grant was
approved in M a y 2003 to assist the Government in implementing these reforms. The
expected outputs o f the IDF grant are procurement legislation; procurement regulations,
standard bidding documents; and guidelines for establishing an institutional framework
which is not adequate at the moment and needs improvement. One o f the main findings
o f the CPAR is lack o f procurement capacity in Eritrea. The joint CPPR conducted in
December o f 2004 also confirmed that the overall procurement capacity in Eritrea is still
weak, especially at the Regional level, due to lack o f skilled procurement staff. However,
HAMSET is being implemented by a PMU which was initially established to implement



                                              30

the Health Project.     The PMU has therefore acquired a lot o f experience.          The
Assessment reconfirmed that the PMU has adequate capacity to implement HAMSET I1
andproposed some actions to strengthen this capacity at national and project level. The
actions proposed include: continuing implementation o f the CPAR recommendations;
preparation o f a procurement manual and standard bidding documents; definition o f the
roles and responsibilities o f staff involved in the procurement process; review o f
remuneration for PMU staff; continuous training o f the procurement officer and
improvement inthe record keeping system.

The procurement o f goods and services would be carried out according to Bank
procurement guidelines. Details are presented inAnnex 15,

4. Social

HAMSET I1will continue to pay close attention to social issues with a renewed focus on
(i) (withemphasis onFGMandthe vulnerabilities ofCSW); (ii) risks
    gender                                                                       the
associated with active and demobilized soldiers; and (iii)      mobile populations (both
seasonal and cultural).

Gender:     Misconceptions and cultural beliefs drive many gender-based harmful
traditional practices such as FGM, early marriage and short child spacing. They also
hinder the utilization o f health services, including antenatal care and skilled care at
delivery. These can only be successfully addressed through culturally sensitive
interventions.

With regard to HIV, social, cultural, and economic factors generally put women, and
young girls inparticular, at a serious disadvantage compared to their male partners when
negotiating the use o f condoms. Inaddition, biological factors put women more at risk to
HIVinfection than men. Women lack the relativeprotectionthat male circumcision may
offer.   Moreover, the diagnosis and management o f Sexually Transmitted Infections
(STI) is much less sensitive, specific and effective for women as compared to men,
increasingthe risk to infection with HIVthough sexual intercourse.

Commercial Sex Work and TransactionalSex: Limitedaccess to economic opportunities
drive women to adopt economic coping mechanisms that may include transactional or
commercial sex. Stigma and the cultural aspects o f CSW may prevent some CSW from
actively participating in HAMSET I1activities. Women engaging in transactional sex
may not identify themselves as CSW and may not benefit from targeted interventions.

Armed servicepersonnel: In Eritrea, many men are in the armed services. Being away
from families can makes them more vulnerable to HIV/AIDS/STI.

Mobile Communities: Mobile communities, whether tribal nomads, seasonal migrants, or
mobile laborers, may be less able to participate in and benefit from project activities due
to their mobility and the possibility o fbeing overlooked by authorities andimplementers.




                                             31

Project responses to social issues: The project would address these issues through
supporting the GoE to: (i)  continue to learn more about behaviors and circumstances that
make target populations vulnerable (i.e. women, CSW, mobile populations, demobilized
soldiers etc.), refine BCC and interventions to be sensitive to cultural issues (e.g. FGM,
early marriage and gender) and ensure that messages and interventions are cross-cutting;
(ii)implement patient exit polls at facilities offering HAMSET services; (iii) up hot-
                                                                                 set
lines where people facing stigma and discrimination can voice their grievances and seek
help; (iv) support implementing agencies that work with targeted groups (i.e. Ministry o f
Defense, Ministryo f Labour and Human Welfare, National Union o f Eritrean Women,
National Confederation o f Eritrean Workers); and (iv) make sure the procedures for
mobilizing and appraising o f CMHRP subprojects will facilitate the targeting o f
potentially marginalizedgroups.

Together with other initiatives in the country, HAMSET I1will work with community-
based organizations to provide support for activities that reduce the risk o f HIV infection
among women, such as basic education on sexual and reproductive health, HIV, and STI;
activities for youth designed to delay sexual debut; harmonizing the age o f consent,
marriage, and maturity to 18 years; encouraging voluntary testing; and empowering
women on matters pertaining to access to information, employment, and economic/social
recognition.    HAMSET I1 will support the development o f culturally, morally, and
scientifically acceptable AIDS education programs for youth in and out o f school and
advocate for the protection o f youth against behaviors that place them at increased risk o f
HIV infection.      Furthermore, HAMSET I1 will contribute to the analyses o f risks,
vulnerability and impact o f HIV/AIDS to identify gender disparities that perpetuate the
risks o f HIV infection and vulnerability to the negative socio-economic impact o f AIDS.
It would promote the just and fair distribution o f resources, efforts and interventions to
protect women, men, youths and children and ensure the socio-economic rights o f every
individual.

5. Environment

The proposed project has been classified as category ((BDfor environmental screening
purposes given the risks associated with the handlingand disposal o f medical wastes. As
a repeater project, HAMSET I1will make use o f the existing arrangements for safeguard
issues which havebeen successfully implemented under HAMSET. A Health Care Waste
Management Plan (HCWMP) and an Environmental Assessment (EA) for insecticides
were developed by the GoE and approved by IDA under HAMSET. Both documents
were disclosed inEritrea and at the Bank InfoShop before appraisal o f HAMSET II.

MOH has complied with the recommendations made by the EA. The proposed project
will finance insecticides for malaria control activities, although the overall use will be
relatively small (e.g. for impregnation o fbednets) andonly safe compounds approved by
the World Health OrganizationPesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) will be used.

The HCWMP has been under implementation since October 2004. The Ministry o f
Health has established a task force to ensure dissemination o f the HCWMP as well as



                                              32

  compliance by all health facilities in the country.           Supervision o f the Health and
  HAMSET projects has confirmed that the two regional hospitals financed by IDAwere in
  compliance with HCWMP requirements. A successful Rapid-Result Initiative to improve
  safe injectionpractices and management of sharps and medical waste has been scaledup
  to referral hospitals infive out of six zobas.

BriefCountryProfile

Eritrea is a mountainous country in the Horn o f Africa bordered by the Red Sea on the
east, Djibouti to the south-east, Ethiopia to the south and Sudan to the west and north.
The population is composed o f nine ethnic groups - the Afar, Bilen, Hedareb, Kunama,
Nara, Rashahaida, Saho, Tigre, and Tigrinya. The administrative structure is composed
o f 6 zobas (regions), 58 sub-zobas, 699 Administrative Areas, and 2,564 villages. With
80 percent o f its population living in the countryside, Eritrea is one o f the most m a l
countries in the world which hinders general development and service delivery.
Likewise, 80 percent o f the population is illiterate, posing health communication,
management, andhealth regime compliance challenges.

The thirty year war for independence from Ethiopia damaged the mainly agrarian
economy, destroyed much o f the infrastructure and depleted human resources. After
gaining independence from Ethiopia in 1991,Eritrea went through a periodo f rapid and
stable economic growth from 1993 to 1997, with an annual GDP growth rate averaging
7.4 percent. When the border war with Ethiopia broke out in 1998, GDP growth declined
to less than 1 percent in 1999. An estimated 75 percent decline in crop production
combined with the destruction and loss o f physical capital caused a 9 percent decline in
GDP in 2000. Currently, the "no war, no peace" situation as well as frequent droughts
continue to restrict economic development.

DemographicProfile

The population o f Eritrea i s 4.4 million, with an annual growth rate o f 2.2%. The total
fertility rate is 4.8 children per woman and crude death rate i s 13.3 per 1,000 population.
Life expectancy, at 52.3 years for women and 49.9 for men, remains low although the
country has not experienced the full impact o f the HIV scourge to the extent o f many
SSA countries. Total life expectancy increased from 48.9 to 51.1 years between 1990
and 2003 andis projected to reach 58 years by2020.

Morbidity and mortality vary widely by region within Eritrea, with rural areas and areas
near the border with Ethiopia carrying a much higher burden o f disease. The majority o f
morbidity and mortality o f adults i s due to infectious disease, especially malaria, TB,
HIV/AIDS, and diarrheal diseases. Malaria, HIV/AIDS, and TB will be discussed in
more detail intheir separate annexes. Great strides have beenmade inchild health: from
1995 to 2003 IMR dropped from 72 to 45 deaths per 1,000 live births and the Under 5
Mortality Rate (USMR) fell from 136 to 84. The immunization rate i s one o f the highest
in the region with 75.9 percent of children 12 to 23 months old vaccinated, which
represents an 83 percent increase over 1995 levels at a time when immunization rates
have been decreasing across Africa. Such impressive progress puts Eritrea on a par or
better than some middle-income African countries in terms o f child health. In fact,


                                            34

Eritrea i s one o f the few low-income SSA countries likely to meet some o f the health
MDGs.

The main caused o f under-five deaths include diarrheal diseases, respiratory infections,
malaria, and malnutrition. Especially, malnutrition, a major contributing factor to child
morbidity and mortality, i s high. Around 40% o f under-five children are stunted (chronic
malnutrition), 16% are wasted (acute malnutrition) and 40% underweight (both chronic
and acute malnutrition).

Provision of Health Services

The Eritrean health system has made significant progress, especially considering the
destruction in physical infrastructure and human resources caused by the long
independence war. Immediately after independence, the GoE adopted a Primary Health
Care Policywhich guides the development o f the sector.

The health delivery system i s divided into three tiers: primary, secondary and tertiary
care. The lowest-level service delivery unit i s the Health Station staffed by a nurse or
associate nurse which usually has a catchment area o f 5km radius that includes several
villages. Many communities have informal community health agents andtraditional birth
attendants who are supervised by the Health Station but are accountable to and paid by
the community rather than the Government. The Mini-Hospital (the lowest level facility
that has an operating room) provides services at the sub-zoba level, the Zoba Hospitals at
the zoba level, and the ReferraVSpecialty Hospitals at the national level.

The MOH restructured itself in 2003 to align hnctions within the Ministry and improve
the efficiency and effectiveness o f its units.             The MOH is now composed o f three
principal departments (Health Services, Regulatory Services, and Research and Human
Resources) whose Directors General report directly to the Minister. There are several
other smaller support units whose managers also report directly to the Minister.
Management o f health services is slowly improving and Eritrea has taken advantage o f
management and uality assurance programs supported by development partners,
especially in IMCI", maternal health and HIV/AIDS. Although Eritrea has made great
strides in expanding its primary health care system, the percentage o f the health budget
that goes to support hospitals is still large. In acknowledgement o f this, the M O H is
working to increase the efficiency o f the hospital system.

Private Sector

Eritrea has a nascent private sector consisting o f both NGOs and for-profit providers,
including a new public-private hospital for fee-for-service patients. There are a small
number o f NGOs, but they are mainly involved in working with the Government rather
than the direct provisions o f services as seen inEast Africa.




l969 percent o f all facilities have a provider trained inIMCI(USAID).


                                                        35

Human Resources for Health

Eritrea, like most SSA countries, is experiencing a shortage o f health care workers. See
Annex 10 for a detailed discussion inHuman Resources for Health.

Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene

Over 70% o f Eritreans do not have access to clean water and even less have access to
proper sanitation. Efforts have been made to introduce safe water systems, but progress
has been slow, especially due to the rural nature o f Eritrea. There is a highprevalence o f
diarrheal andrespiratory diseases inEritrea, especially among children. Further reduction
o f child mortality andmorbidity could be achieved through improvements inclean water,
sanitation, and hygienepractices

Health Financing

Health financing in Eritrea is a major challenge for health sector development.
Information on Government budget for health is limited and National Health Accounts
have not been prepared for Eritrea. As a result, the complete picture regarding revenues,
expenditures, andthe flows o f funds inthe health sector is not available.

According to WHO estimates, Eritrea's total health spending was US$9 per capita or 4.3
percent o f GDP in 2000, o f which, public expenditure was US$ 6 per capita (or 66
percent o f total expenditure on health) and private US$3 (or 34% o f total health
expenditure). Public expenditure on health is around 4 percent o f Government's budget,
which i s one o f the lowest levels in SSA. The largest share o f the national health budget
comes from extemal assistance, at US$3.6 per capita (equivalent to 61 percent o f public
expenditures on health, or 40 percent o f total health spending). Private health spending
(for private care or users' fees in the public sector) constitutes only 3 percent o f total
health spending. Government's contribution was US$2.3 per capita (39 percent o f public
expenditures on health, or 26 percent o f total health spending). Between 1995 and 2000,
there was significant reduction inGovernment's spending on health (32 percent reduction
innominal US dollar terms, 43 percent reduction inshare of GDP terms)20.Most ofthe
Government's budget for health comes from taxes. However, tax-based revenue has been
stagnant innominal terms and declined inreal terms. On the other hand, this also means
the MOH is efficient and becoming more so.                 The main challenges facing health
financing inEritrea are increasing recurrent costs due to large capital investments, limited
ability to expand domestic financial resources for health due to the stagnant economy,
lack o f sound financial data for policy making, and limitedcapacity inhealth financing.

                               PROJECT(HAMSET11)


Background

With the exception of malaria, which has a good M&E system, progress on monitoring
andevaluationwas uneven under HAMSET. Below are some o fthe deficiencies:

       An M&E conceptual fiamework and an operational plan (with an agenda and
       budget for HAMSET diseases) have been drafted but not finalized.
       Reporting forms concerning in-patient, out-patient, outreach activities of health
       facilities were either overly complex or not clearly related to management
       decisionmaking-or they didnot exist.
       No computerized management information system (MIS) has existed for most
       HAMSET activities (ie.,       at health facilities, for behavior change and
       communication (BCC), in the community managed HAMSET response program
       (CMHRP), and from line ministries andpartner agencies)
       The PMU has not had any M&E capacity and has not been able to effectively
       report on HAMSET activities.
       No M&E unit has existed in either the PMU or MOH units until recently, when
       the Regulatory Department was given the responsibility o f coordinating M&E.
       There are insufficient information technology and M&E resources (technology
       and humanresources) for M&E at the national and zoba levels.
       Data collected by different disease control programs are sent vertically to their
       respective National Management Programs and would not be collated at the zoba
       level in a way that would help zoba decision makers, including the Zoba
       Technical Committee.

TheHAMSET 11Monitoring and Evaluation System

HAMSET I1will support an integrated M&E system for HAMSET diseases, and in a
broader sense, for Eritrea's health system through the development o f two harmonized,
closely-linked information systems:

    0  a Modular HealthManagement Information System (MHMIS) for the MOH and
    0  a M I S system for project management data from non-MOH implementing
       agencies.

Each computerized information system will collate information in each zoba, and then
feed the data into a central information system which aggregate information at the
national level. Both output indicators and outcomeshesults (i.e., treatment outcomes,
changes inbehavior, knowledge and attitudes, etc.) will be monitored.




                                           40

Modular HMISfor MOH


    0   This will be based on the existing HMIS which, maintained by the Zoba Medical
        Team, currently collects information on facility-based service utilization,
        morbidity and mortality as well as epidemiological surveillance information. The
        HMIS will be strengthened and expanded with additional modules to include
        outreach andhealthpromotion activities. It will thus cover:

    (i)     information about morbidity and mortality related to HAMSET I1diseases,
            service utilization, as in-patient andout-patient interventions,
    (ii)    logistic management information system (LMIS) with information about key
            equipment, pharmaceuticalusage and supplies, and
    (iii)   outreach activities by the MOH, including healthpromotion activities.

Information will be recorded manually in sub-zobas by the health facility staff or Health
Promotion (BCC) team and forwarded monthly to the Zoba Medical Team. At the zoba
office, these data will be entered ina computer database and sent monthlyto the National
HMISinAsmara where the 6 zoba databaseswill be aggregated. The resultingNational
database will be forwarded on a quarterly basis to the Regulatory Department (and
related MOH departments) for rapid analysis and preparation o f a bulletin about key
indicators. The Regulatory Department will disseminate these bulletins quarterly to the
Minister o f Health, the HAMSET I1 Technical Committee, and relevant MOH
departments.

This modular-base platform will gradually add all HAMSET health programs, starting
with HIV/AIDS and STI (2005), then TB Control and Reproductive Health (2006). At
the end o f this process, and ifappropriate, the Malaria Control program will be included.

Every two years, the Regulatory Department will facilitate a decentralized population
based survey to gather outcome indicator data to will track changes in behavior,
knowledge and attitudes inzobas. These data will be collected by small sub-zoba teams
using precoded questionnaires and entered into a database at the zoba level that will
follow the same reporting stream described above. Other special studies to be carried out
are health facility and quality o f care assessments.

MISfor Project Management Data
The second system is a MIS developed to support the PMU to manage the project and
gather information from other line ministries and civil society implementers as well as
the Community Managed HAMSET Response Program (CMHRP). The PMU will hire
an M&E coordinator in the central PMU and a data ClerWadministrative support in each
of the 6 zoba PMU offices. Using a simple, precoded Activity Reporting form line that
can be combined with the Financial Management reporting system, non-MOH
implementers (Le. line ministries, civil society organizations, CMHRP) will report to the
zoba PMU specific activities carried out, their location, the target population and its size.
Data will be entered into zoba computer databases and forwarded on a monthly basis to
the central PMUwhere zoba information will be consolidated. The PMUwill send these

Challenges, Priorities and Innovations

It is a complex task to develop an M&E system for a multi-sectoral project addressing four
health issues. To ensure that both systems are mutually supportive, the MOH Regulatory
Department will coordinate all M&E activities, and collate information from the HMIS and the
PMU. It will also collate and use information from other existing systems (i.e., disease
surveillance, population based surveys, health facility assessments, and other special studies). It
will also synthesize information inbulletins for formal disseminationwithin the GOE andto the
Bank.

Decentralized monitoring using Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) as introduced during
HAMSET will be used by Zoba and sub-Zoba managers to assess the status o f key outcome
indicators in their catchment areas. LQAS is a sampling method adapted from industrial quality
control methods; its key feature is that local managers using a very small sample o f interviews
canjudge whether a predetermine coverage target has been reached. It can also be aggregated to
calculate coverage proportions at Zoba, regional andnational levels.

The Rapid Results Initiative (RRI) as introduced in HAMSET will continue to be
institutionalizedto aid the MOHinstrategic planning.

The use o f handheld computers and/or PDAs for decentralized data collection can be explored
and piloted. This technology can reduce the error indata input and increase the speed inwhich
information can be used for decision making.

Capacity and TechnicalAssistancefor M&E

Current M&E capacity in Eritrea is limited. Substantial amounts o f capacity building will be
needed to put such a system inplace. HAMSET 11's support will focus on:

                             Annex 4: Detailed Project Description
 ERITREA: HIV/AIDS/STI, TB, Malaria and ReproductiveHealthProject (HAMSET 11)


The project's total cost is US$ 26.5 million. It is financed by a US$ 24 million grant from IDA,
US$ 2.0 million from the GoE and US$ 0.5 million from the communities. The project has four
components:

Multi-Sectoral Response (US$ 3 million): This component supports key line ministries other
thanthe MOH, local governments andcivil society organizations at bothnationalandzoba levels
to scale up prevention (especially BCC and stigma reduction), care and support interventions for
HIV/AIDS/STI, malaria, TB and RH (with emphasis on mobilizing communities to use
HAMSET services).

With fewer resources available for this component under HAMSET 11, the project will
emphasize (i)integrated planning, (ii)focused interventions, and (ii) results-based
implementation and reporting. Behavior Change Communication will be a focus area for all
multi-sectoral implementers.

Integration: Under HAMSET, the multi-sectoral response activities were implemented in a
rather fragmented manner. Under HAMSET 11, the planningprocess will be strengthened so that
integrated work plans are developed with the technical support o f the PMU and MOH which (i)
reflect the comparative advantage o f each sector/implementer, the HAMSET priorities o f the
locality and the immediate needs o f the most high-risk, vulnerable groups within each
implementer's constituency, (ii)cover more than one HAMSET diseases with combined
interventions wherever possible (e.g. a BCC intervention including HIV/AIDS/STI, RH and
malaria messages), and (iii) complement activities being funded by other projects and initiatives
to address HAMSET diseases (e.g. the GFATM, the Integrated Early Childhood Development
Project, the Education Project). The socio-geographic mapping exercises of high-risk groups as
well as the LQAS will provide the basis for such work plans. Preliminary work plans are to be
prepared by October o f each year and finalized by the end o f February o f the following year.
IDA reviewed all work plans for the first year and will randomly prior review a sample o fplans
inthe subsequentyears.

Focus: The multi-sectoral response will be more focused thanunder HAMSET. Not all the work
plans will be funded as priority will be given to the most crucial sectors and implementers,
especially those who (i)  have large number o f vulnerable groups in their constituency, and (ii)
have demonstrated their ability to deliver under HAMSET. Proposed key multi-sectoral
implementers include Ministries o f Education, Defense, Labour and HumanWelfare, National
Union o f Eritrean Women, National Union o f Eritrean Youth and Students, BIDHO, and faith-
based organizations; modest support may be provided to other supporting organizations. The list
o f implementers to be funded by HAMSET I1will be revisited annually and their work plans
subject to a competitive appraisal process with a set o f clear eligibility criteria which will be
further elaborated inthe Operations Manual. Inprinciple, the annual work plansneedto:

     (i)    be inline with the National Strategic Plans for HAMSET diseases;


                                                  53

    (ii) utilizeevidence-based,effectiveinterventions;
    (iii)    have specified objectives and target populations (especially high-riskgroups); and
    (iv)     clearly define the expected results andhow to monitor them

Other factors to be taken into account include each implementer's comparative advantages, past
performance as well as its compliance with M&E requirements. Activities that do not meet the
criteria will not be supported. There will be no "hardware" activities (e.g. construction) eligible
for funding under this component. In keeping with the project's emphasis on decentralizing
implementation, the multi-sectoral proposals at the national level should quantify the proportions
of resources to be implementedby central vs. local implementers. Good practice suggests that
national agencies should, inmost cases26retain no more than 30% o f resources which are to be
used activities at the central level. The rest shouldbe for activities at the local level.


Results: HAMSET I1will pay special attention to the results-based agenda in the multi-sectoral
response. As discussed above, clearly defined outcomes and methods to monitor them will be
part o f the eligibility criteria. The project will encourage the application o f the Rapid-Result
Initiatives inthe annual work plans o f the implementers.

Behavior Change Communication (BCC): BCC will be emphasized as a priority under the multi-
sectoral response component with the technical support, guidance and supervision o f the MOH
(especially the Health Promotion Unit). The multi-sectoral partners are well placed to support
BCC activities and reach out to vulnerable groups within their constituencies. Similar to
HAMSET, the project will have a multi-pronged approach inBCC:

     (9      Promote healthy behaviors through multi-level communication: The HAMSET
             Project already supported the development o f communication strategies for HAMSET
             diseases. Implementers will be encouraged to continue implementing such strategies
             under HAMSET 11. Peer-led BCC and IEC campaigns for general population and
             vulnerable groups should: (a) raise awareness about HAMSET diseases (andharmful
             practices such as FGM); (b) promote healthy behaviors; and (c) reduce stigma and
             discrimination.
     (ii) Promotehealthylifestylesthroughtheeducationsystem:HAMSETI1willcontinue
             to support the key priorities inthe school healthprogram o f the Ministry o f Education
             inthe FRESH Partnership (Focusing Resources on Effective School Health-WHO,
             UNESCO, UNICEF and IDA). HAMSET I1will finance activities to: (a) implement
             school health curricula developed under HAMSET; and (b) support peer-led health
             education (e.g. through student health clubs). School sanitation (e.g. construction o f
             latrines, environmental activities for schools) have already been financed by
             HAMSET and the Integrated Early Childhood Development Project.                            Therefore,
             HAMSET I1will only focus on the "software" aspect o f school health.
     (iii) Sensitize 1ocaVopinion leaders and decision makers:                      There i s a high level o f
             awareness and commitment to the fight against HAMSET diseases among local/
             leaders and decision makers in Eritrea.               However, they still need to be further

Health Sector Response (US$ 14 million): This has five sub-components - HIVIAIDSISTI
(US$3 million), TB (US$ 2 million), malaria (US$ 2 million), RH(US$ 4 million) andHuman
Resources for Health (US$3 million). Each of the first four sub-components will comprise three
activity categories:

(a) Improve the information base for decision making:            The project will support disease
surveillance and reporting, surveys and operational research at the national, zoba and sub-zoba
levels. Timely, comprehensive and crucial information on HAMSET diseases will be used for
policy formulation, annual work program planning and for rapid response to outbreaks o f
HAMSET diseases. Priority i s given to (i) disease reporting over "drop-in" surveys; (ii)
                                              routine
activities that build in-country capacity and make use of existing mechanism such as the
IntegratedDisease Surveillance system o f the MOH; and (iii)      operational research with practical
implications. Key areas for the project to support include:


                                                 55

HAMSET disease surveillance and reporting: The project will continue to support HAMSET
disease surveillance initiated under HAMSET. For example, HAMSET I1 will continue to
finance sentinel surveillance for malaria, second-generation surveillance for HIV/AIDS/STI, TB
reporting and recording. For maternal health, HAMSET I1will support the introduction o f
cause-of-death reporting and maternal audits to help monitor maternal mortality and it causes.
This sub-component therefore will finance the required consultant services, workshops, training,
test kits andreagents for biological surveys, other recurrent costs for surveys and surveillance.

Epidemic forecasting and preparedness:           HAMSET 11 will continue to support the
implementation of the national strategy for epidemic forecasting which was initiated under
HAMSET.

Operational research: The project will continue to support operational research in program
management, epidemiology, entomology, drugresistance, risk factors, community and individual
knowledge, attitude, practices and behaviors in HAMSET diseases. Especially, for each o f the
HAMSET diseases, one o f the major undertakings for the health sector response inthis category
is to coordinate a socio-geographic mapping exercise o f high risk groups and the current
coverage o f interventions among them to identify strategic populations and areas for targeted
interventions.   This mapping exercise will provide the basis for planning o f work plans by
implementers andis expected to be completed within one year after the project's effectiveness.

HAMSET I1will foster the systematic use o f information for policy formulation, planning and
budgeting.     This will be through the (i)dissemination o f information and findings to key
implementers (especially those in the non-health sectors, zoba HAMSET coordinating
committees as well as zoba implementers) through preparation and distribution o f reports; and
(ii) ofsuchinformationintheeligibilitycriteriaforprojectfunding.
    use

(b) Scale upprevention interventions: Inthe prevention o f HAMSET diseases, the health sector
plays two roles -- as the implementer o f selected interventions and as the technical advisor to
non-health implementers (e.g. non-health line-ministries, local governments and communities) in
their prevention activities. In both cases, the project will support the MOH to coordinate and
scale up the BCC program for HIV/AIDS under HAMSET and, wherever appropriate, expand it
to cover all HAMSET diseases in one integrated message. The project will also support other
effective non-BCC prevention interventions for HAMSET diseases (e.g. malaria vector control).
Activities financed by this sub-component therefore include:

     0   Supporting the HPUand the MOHtechnical programs to design and implement BCC and
        IEC activities;
     0  Financing the salaries and operating costs o f BCC coordinators at the zoba level who will
         expand their current focus from HIV/AIDS to all HAMSET diseases;
     0   Strengthening the capacity o f PHUand the MOHtechnical programs to provide technical
         advice, guidance and supervision o f activities conducted bynon-health implementers;
     0   Supporting environmentally sound and effective techniques for malaria vector control
         (e.g. ITN, IRS,larviciding, environmental control measures);




                                                 56

    e   Supporting the MOHto conducting formative research on RHand, on that basis, develop
        a communication strategy for RH; and
    e   Supporting MOH's condom distribution efforts in collaboration with the Eritrea Social
        Marketing Group.

(c) Scale up diagnostic, treatment, care and support services: The project aims to help the MOH
improve the availability, accessibility and utilization o f quality services for the diagnosis,
treatment, care and support for HAMSET diseases. Specific activities to be supported by
HAMSET I1 for the control o f each disease are described in each corresponding annex (see
Annexes for HIV/AIDS/STI, malaria, TB and RH). Insummary, these include:

        e  Directly Observed Therapy, Short Course for TB (DOTS);
        e  Early detection and treatment o f malaria in the community and health facility,
           especially among under-five children andpregnant women;
        e  Management o f severe and complicatedmalaria inreferral facilities;
        e  VCT, PMTCT for HIV/AIDS;
        e  Management o f 01inPLWHA;
        e  Ensuringa safe blood supply;
        e  Supporting ARV implementation (as ARVs will be funded mostly by the GFATM,
           HAMSET I1will only finance a part o f ARV procurement. Instead, the project will
           focus more on supporting services for ARV implementation);
        e  Syndromic management o f STI, with laboratory confirmation when available;
        e  Focusedantenatal care, newbom care andpost-abortion care; and
        e  Skilled attendance at delivery, EmOC and child spacing.

Scaling up such activities will be a prioritized for the lower levels (zoba and sub-zoba) and for
vulnerable groups where applicable.

For the above activities, HAMSET 11will finance relevant drugs, reagents and medical supplies,
equipment, minor renovation o f RH facilities, recurrent costs (where applicable) such as salary,
per diem and incentives for MOH staff, operating and maintenance costs for facilities and
equipment, as well as transport costs.

(d) Human resourcesfor HAMSET diseases (US'$3.0 M): HAMSET I1will help the country to
improve its human resources in the fight against HAMSET diseases and RH by supporting the
development and implementation o f an overall HRH policy and strategic plan. Namely, the
project will support the MOH to: (i)  consolidate existing HRHpolicies; (ii) a five-year
                                                                              develop
National Strategic Plan for HRH; and (iii)  formulate and implement annual HRHwork plan in a
coordinated manner across the sector. With regard to training, the project will support pre-
 service and in-service training, with an emphasis on an integrated approach to training in
HAMSET diseases. The shortage o f midwives and anesthetists i s particularly dire and will be
 given special attention in response to the urgent RH needs. In addition to training, this sub-
component also aims to address other systemic HRH issues such as HRH management,
retainment and deployment, as well as the piloting o f incentive mechanisms for HAMSET
 service providers, etc. Under this component, the project will finance required consultancies,



                                                57

workshops, recurrent costs for pre-service and on-the-job training, as well as development and
dissemination o f training materials.

Community Managed HAMSET Response Program (US$ 4.0 million):                    Building on the
lessons and experiences o f HAMSET I,this component would finance: (i)       community-demand
driven subprojects that are effective, results-based and for which communities have a
comparative advantage; and (ii)  capacity development interventions for subproject implementers
at the local level. Under HAMSET 11, CMHRP would aim to more closely relate investments in
subprojects with humanand social capital development.

For HAMSET 11, a results-based framework closely aligned with national objectives and
priorities for addressing HAMSET diseases would be adopted, and within this fiamework a pilot
an open menu along with a negative list inorder to provide flexibility and allow innovations for
communities to identify and select their subproject interventions, based on their comparative
advantage. Community-based subprojects would be implemented applying CDD approaches in
order to give greater control over decisions and resources to community groups and local level
stakeholders, inpartnership with local administration.

In the initial phase, three windows for providing grants for community subprojects would be
piloted:

Window "A" includes subprojects with a value <$300, to be appraised and approved at village
level andwith support from Village HealthCommittees.

Window "B" includes subprojects with values ranging from >$300 but <$3000, to be appraised
and approved at zoba level.

Window "C" includes subprojects with a value <$5000 and which are specifically targeted to
vulnerable groups, to be appraised and approved at zoba level. Subprojects to be financed under
this Window are expected to be initially co-managed by beneficiary communities and relevant
partner agencies collaboratingunder the Multi-Sectoral Response Component (i.e. BIDHO, Faith
Based Organizations (FBOs), NUEWS, etc.) untilthe capacity o f the former is developed.

An enhanced resource allocation andtargeting framework for HAMSET I1is beingdeveloped to
better target vulnerable groups. Resource allocation and targeting would be undertaken to in
order to: (a) ensure that a concerted effort i s made to reach vulnerable groups who have not, so
far, beenable to fully benefit from CMHRP; and (b) serve as a monitoring mechanisminorder to
assess if regions and specific geographic areas are able to meet their targets and to offer
assistance (capacity building) where they are laggingbehind.

This component would also assist HAMSET I1 to intensify its efforts to enable genuine
community-driven development by enhancing community members' and their associated
organizations' skills in social promotion, community mobilization, participatory planning, and
community identification, prioritization, andmanagement o f subprojects. It would pay particular
attention to collaborative facilitation, participatory monitoring and evaluation exercises to be




                                                 58

carried out at the local level. The bulk o f capacity development interventions for CMHRP would
be strategicallyprovided along the subproject cycle. (For more details, please see Annex 9).

Project Management and Coordination, Capacity Building, M&E, and Innovation and New
Policy Development (US$3 million): This has four sub-components.

(a) Project management and coordination (US$ 1.0 M): This will cover the operating costs o f
the national and zoba Project Management Units (PMU) as well as the costs for coordination o f
project activities at the central level.

(b) Capacity building (US$0.5M): This aims to mobilize andbuildthe capacity o f non-health
cadres (e.g. in non-health sectors, communities, and local governments) in planning,
management and implementation o f project activities.        The project will promote knowledge
sharing andthe disseminationo fbest practices among the implementers.

(c) M&E (US$1.0 M): While the Health Sector Response Component supports epidemiological
and behavioral surveillance, disease reporting, etc. (the outcome and impact aspects o f the
overall M&E framework), this sub-component focuses on cross-cutting, operational aspects o f
M&E. These include institutionalizing routine programmatic monitoring and scaling up the
successful Rapid Result Initiative pilots (which, by their nature, is a decentralized participatory
M&E approach). A dedicated budget will be available for this purpose.                For example,
implementers will be provided a top-up as a small percentage o f their approved financing for
routine M&E. For those who implement their work programs using the RRIapproach, technical
assistance will be provided under this sub-component. The project will finance required
consultancies, training, workshops, development of management and information systems to
facilitate the implementation o f the national M&E frameworks for HAMSET diseases (see
Annex 3 on M&E).

(d) Innovation and New Policy Development (US$ 0.5 M): This sub-component supports the
development, piloting and evaluation o f innovative approaches in service delivery which can
then be used for system-wide application; for example, incentive mechanisms for service
providers and users, conditional cash transfers for maternal and child health, community report
card of HAMSET services, preparationwork for SWAP,etc.

Epidemiology

Eritrea has a relatively stable HIV/AIDS epidemic with the general adult prevalence rate at 2.4
percent in 2003 (compared to 2.8 percent in 2001) and the disease still mainly confined to high
risk groups and certain urban "hot spots".        The main mode o f transmission in Eritrea is
heterosexual sex between casual partners and this has been the main focus of the Government's
response.

CountryResponse

The MOHhas a 2003-2007 National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS implemented by the National
HIV/AIDS/STI and TB Control Division (NATCoD). NATCoD has five units: Prevention and
Counseling Unit, HIV/AIDS Care Unit, TB Control Unit, and an Epidemiology and Monitoring
Unit. Thenationalstrategy hasninepriority areas:

     1. Strengthening o fthe multi-sector response to HIV/AIDS;
    2. Scaling-up activities to prevent the sexual transmissiono fHIV/AIDS;
    3. Increasingthe availability and capacity o fhumanresources inthe health sector;
    4. Promoting early diagnosis andtreatment o f sexually transmitted infections;
    5. Promoting the early diagnosis o f HIV infection through increased access to voluntary
         counseling and testing and the prevention of mother to child transmission o f HIV for the
         general population, and especially for the military, youth, andwomen;
     6. Ensuring blood safety and adherence to universal precautions inhealth care settings and
         intraditional medicalpractices;
     7. Improving the availability and quality o f comprehensive health care for people living
         with HIV/AIDS;
     8. Expandingthe availability and quality o f psychosocial and economic support for people
         livingwithHIV/AIDS; and
     9. Strengthening research, surveillance, monitoring, and evaluation of the HIV/AIDS/STI
         epidemic;

Progress includes an almost universal awareness (99 percent) o f HIV/AIDS and its major modes
of transmission, a reduction inthe number o f casual partners among young adults, a 20 percent
reduction in STI cases in health facilities between 2001 and 2003, the establishment o f VCT
 clinics ineach zoba, the screening o f all donated blood and the exclusive use o f volunteer blood
 donors. Inhealthcare settings, guidelines for universal precautions, Post Exposure Prophylaxis
 (PEP), and medical waste management have been developed.               Due to experience from
neighboring countries, the army was targeted early with a variety o f programs and HIV
prevalence has remained low inthis group.




                                                  60

Support from Other Donors

The GoE's response via NATCoD has received support from several donors, including IDA, the
Global Fund, USAID, and UNAIDS. The Global Fund has committed over US$8 million for
HIV interventions insupport o fthe EritreanHIVIAIDS strategy, o fwhich over US$3 millionhas
been disbursed to date. In addition to this donor-sponsored national intervention, there are
multiple smaller donor programs by UNDP, Catholic Relief Services, UNFPA, Norwegian
Church Aid, and Lutheran World Federation. These programs are limited in scope and rarely
have budgets more than US$200,000 per year.

Monitoring and Evaluation and Research

The "Eritrea Risk Groups and Behaviors Identification Survey" (HIV/AIDS-RGBIS), a survey of
HIV/AIDS risk group andrisk behaviors was completed in2001. It is a nationally representative
cross-sectional sample survey of 4,753 individuals aged 15-49. The study included the general
population and four subgroups: the army, antenatal attendees, bartender^^^, and students.
Knowledge o f HIV/AIDS was almost universal at 99% with no significant variation across
subgroups or geography.           Knowledge o f prevention measures was high, especially among
younger age groups. Unfortunately, this didnot translate into highcondom use: only 18 percent
of young respondents reported using a condom at first sexual intercourse and on average there
were four years between first sex and first use o f a condom. The study revealed that the group
most likely to be HIV positive is bartenders. This highrate needs to be further investigated to
identify possible links (impaired decision making due to use of alcohol and drugs, association of
bars with commercial sex trade, and bartenders 60 percent perception of `no risk' for STI, etc)
and potential interventions. The age groups most at risk for infection were young adult women
(ages 20-34 years) and adult men (ages 25-39 years). The study also revealed that awareness o f
non-HTV STDs and their affect o f HIV transmissionwere low. Radio was identified as the most
common source o f general knowledge and knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS while less then one
fifth of responders identified a health worker as a source of information about HIV/AIDS.
Considerable knowledge gaps were identified. For example, a greater percentage o f respondents
identified      blood     transfusion      as     means     of    transmission          (15%)    than      vertical
transmissionhreastfeeding (14%).

At 89 percent, Eritrea has one o fthe highest rates o fFemale Genital Cutting (FGC) inthe world.
There is evidence to support that FGC leads to increased HIV infection both through the use of
contaminated cutting instruments as well as through the increased likelihood o f tissue damage
andbleeding duringintercourse.




27Pleasenote that since the Eritrean law against commercial sex work i s strictly enforced, commercial sex workers
are often referredto as "bar and hotel workers".

HAMSETApproachto HIV/AIDS

In order to facilitate implementation and supervision, the project components are organized
according to the implementers o f the activities and HIV/AIDS is integrated into these activities
along with TB, malaria, and reproductive health. In this section, the HIV/AIDS activities are
separated to get a complete view o f the comprehensiveness o f the planned HIV/AIDS
interventions.

Prevention and Stigma Reduction: The GOE recognized early on that HIV/AJDS is a cross-
sector issue and that all ministries and sectors must get involved in order for the epidemic to be
reversed. Each ministry will provide services to both their intemal clients (employees and their
families) and to their external clients (the people whom the ministry serves). The Ministry of
Education is expected to play an important role due to the vulnerability o f school-aged children,
particularly adolescent girls, to HIV/AIDS and the "captive audience" of students. BIDHO
networks o f PLWHA will play an important role in creating a supportive environment for
PLWHA.

Activities will occur on a national, zoba, and community level with each level conducting the
interventions most suited to its skills. National IEC will include celebrities and opinions leaders
inpublic service announcements. This work will lead to awareness but probably not result in
much actual behavioral change. The work on the community level will be peer to peer, last
longer, andmove people firther along the stages o fbehavior change toward initiation o f the new
protective behavior andthen to maintenance o f the behavior.

The MOH has a separate component for its involvement inHIV/AIDS/STI. The activities will
improve the diagnosis and treatment o f HIV/AIDS/STI (described below).             There is also a
separate cross-cutting component on improving Human Resources for Health for HAMSET
diseases, including the development o f an HRHstrategy.

 YCT: Voluntary Counseling and Testing centers have been opened inevery zoba inEritrea. In
HAMSET 11, VCT services will be expanded to make services more accessible to high risk
groups. For example VCT services will be made available at truck stops. In selected urbanhot
spots, adults will be offered VCT with an "opt-out" option whenever they come into contact with
the health system.  .

Safe Blood: Great strides were made in the improvement o f blood safety during HAMSET.
With the addition o f reproductive health and Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC) into HAMSET
11, the demand for blood is expected to increase and the capacity to deliver safe bloodwill need
to be scaled up to include every health facility that will be providing EmOC. Activities will
 include the training o f lab technicians, the purchase o f testing kits, and the expansion o f blood
processing, refrigeration, and delivery systems. N o w that Eritrea has strengthened an unpaid
blood donor policy, new methods o freachingout to potential blood donors will need to be found.
 One possibility includes integrating appeals for blood donation into antenatal care. Partners and
 relatives o f pregnant women receiving ANC can be educated on the role that donated bloods
 plays in saving women's lives. Other possibilities include integrating blood donation into the



                                                  63

community component, either by itself or in conjunction with community planning for
emergency transport o fpregnant women with danger signs.

PMTCT: Given fertility rates in Eritrea, there are over 150,000 pregnancies per year in the
count$'.    PMTCT in Eritrea will pose some challenges, given that most pregnancies occur in
rural areas where less than 20 percent o f births occur in health facilities.        In 2001 the
Government started a pilot PMTCT project in three sites in Asmara where 70 percent o f all
pregnant women receive antenatal care and 90 percent o f all antenatal attendees deliver in a
health facility. Lessons learned from this pilot project will be usedto expand the program.

Care for P L W A and Impact Mitigation:           The GoE has devised protocols for treating
opportunistic infections (OIs), but several barriers still need to be surmounted. Methods to
diagnose most 01s are not available and only a handful o f staff have been trained in01diagnosis
and management. Several o f the needed medications are not on the essential drug list and most
PLWHA are not aware of their status or where to go for treatment.           Psychosocial support
networks are just being established in Asmara with no services available elsewhere. Impact
mitigation will involve support in income generation. Home care will provide support and
dignity to those dyingo f HIV/AIDS. Efforts by Faith Based Organizations and BIDHO will be
supported inthis area.

The Government plans to treat 2,000 o f the estimated 60,000 to 70,0000 PLWHA with ART.
The standard regime consists o f Nevirapine, Lamivudine, Stavudine which i s provided through
special clinics. Through the Global Fund, money is available to purchase more ARVs but there
are not funds allocated for the clinical, diagnostic, logistic, and supportive services that are
needed to ensure consistent, high-quality ART and to prevent development o f resistance.
HAMSET I1will support an analysis o f the contents and costing o f an appropriate minimal
package o f services that must all be available in order to start a person on ART. Given the
limited funds available for HIV/AIDS, the GoE and IDA will decide what amount to allocate to
ART versus other forms or prevention, care, and support.

Orphans: The GoE has recognized that the AIDS epidemic has increased the number o f orphans
and vulnerable children beyond the coping abilities o f families and communities. The IDA-
funded IECD project which is expected to close this year has done very successful work in the
field o f orphan care and as IECD prepares to shut down, HAMSET I1will continue and expand
GoE's orphan support. These activities will be part o f the community response component o f
HAMSET I1 and also part o f the multi-sectoral interventions by the Ministry o f Labor and
Human Welfare. Possible activities include economic, nutritional, and psychosocial support,
support to stay in school, vocational training, and income generating skills. See the annex on
community responses for more information on community support o f orphans and vulnerable
children.

Monitoring and Evaluation:      In keeping with WHO'S "Three Ones", Eritrea has a unified
national M&E system "to assess the magnitude o f the problem, track trends over time, identify
emerging priorities, assist in advocating for greater investment in HIV/AIDS, and inform

decisions on resource all~cation.~'This system and the use o f the data it generates will be
strengthened via improvements intechnology, training, supervision, analysis, andplanning.

Research: Clearly more data are needed on HIV/AIDS risk factors, especially when compared
to the wealth o f information from surrounding countries. One possible option for HAMSET I1i s
to support the HIV/AIDS module o f DHS+, especially regarding the role o f male and female
circumcision in HIV infection. Mapping and service targeting o f highrisk groups also needs to
be conducted, especially for the groups inEritrea about which the least i s known: men who have
sex with men and injection drugusers.

Challenges

The main challenges to the control o f the HIV/AIDS epidemic will be increasing condom use,
especially with casual partners; continued expansion o f VCT and support services; and avoiding
the complacency that can accompany early success. Although progress has been made, none o f
the interventions have been operationalized on a national level.               Given the near universal
awareness o f HIV/AIDS, the focus o f HAMSET I1will be on scaling up behavior change to
reduce risk factors especially among high risk and vulnerable groups. The desired behavior
change includes: increased age o f first sex, reduced number o f casual sex partners, and increased
use o f condoms for casual sexual encounters. Emphasis will be placed on creating an enabling
environment within communities andhighrisk subgroups to make it easier for people to choose
and maintain protective behaviors. The demobilization o f soldiers from the higher prevalence
border areas back to their communities and families may result in an increase inthe rural areas
which have so far remained at a low prevalence.             Community involvement will need to be
expanded, including tapping into the resources o f village health committees. More research i s
needed on the barriers to condom use andthe behaviors o f highrisk groups including bartenders,
commercial sex workers, menwho have sex with men (MSM), and Injection DrugUsers (IDUS).

 EFUTREA: HIV/AIDS/STI,TB, MalariaandReproductiveHealthProject(HAMSET 11)


EpidemiologyinEritrea

The epidemiology o f malaria in Eritrea is among the most complex inthe world. Transmission
intensity ranges from year-round transmission in parts o f Gash-Barka to highly seasonal
transmission in much o f the rest o f the country, to complete absence o f transmission in the
highlands around Asmara. Most transmission areas o f the country are epidemic prone. With the
exception of parts o f Gash-Barka, malaria transmission occurs almost entirely following the
rainy season. Peak transmission season for inland regions runs from August through November.
For the RedSea coast, the transmission seasonis from December throughMarch.

Plasmodium falciparum is the primary infecting species, accounting for 84% of documented
malaria cases. The remaining 16% i s caused by P. viva. In recent years, P. falciparum has
developed moderate levels o f resistance to chloroquine, the traditional first-line treatment for
malaria. Resistance to other antimalarials is uncommon. Studies conducted inthe last few years
have demonstrated that Anopheles arabiensis i s the predominant vector o f malaria in Eritrea.
Other Anopheles species play an insignificant role in malaria transmission. The predominant
breeding site for An. arabiensis is small water bodies that develop on the edges of river beds as
the rivers dry up. Adult mosquitoes prefer to rest and feed indoors, but have also been found to
rest, to a lesser extent, outside.

Currentstatus of malariamorbidity andmortality

About 27,000 cases o f malaria were diagnosed at health facilities in 2004, which represents an
86% reduction since 1999. Another 88,000 suspected cases were treated by community health
agents (CHAs) in the same year, which is a reduction from 120,000 cases in 2000. Overall,
morbidity has dropped well over 80% since 1999, exceeding the goal set by Roll Back Malaria.
Where malaria accounted for 32% o f outpatient visits and 28% o f hospitalizations in 1999, these
figures have now dropped to 4% and 13% respectively. Duringthe same period, total outpatient
visits increased by 8%.

Similar results have been seen for mortality. Deaths o f patients seen at health facilities dropped
by 84%; this represents a 35% decrease inthe case-fatality rate. Mortality o f children less than
five  years droppedby 53% andinolder children and adults by 64%.

 Controlstrategies

The National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) and Zoba malaria control officers o f Eritrea
have used a combination o f proven, cost-effective strategies for malaria control and have
modified those strategies based on the findings o f aggressive monitoring and evaluation
 activities. The strategy strikes a balance betweentreatment andprevention activities.


                                                 66

The key strategies employed bythe NMCP are:

1. Early diagnosis, prompt treatment, and appropriate management: Persons with
suspected malaria undergo appropriate diagnostic procedures and receive rapid effective drug
treatment and supportive care, as necessary. Diagnosis and treatment is provided both at the
facility level and inthe community, through trained CHAs. Severe cases will receive appropriate
referral. During HAMSET, access to definitive diagnosis at the health center and hospital level
was greatly expanded. Currently all hospitals and more than 80% o f health centers have this
service.   In addition, when evidence of chloroquine resistance was identified, national drug
policy was changed to adopt a combination o f chloroquine and Fansidar (sulfadoxine-
pyrimethamine) as first line treatment. This new policy has been implemented throughout the
country. Efforts were also made to reduce stock-outs of drugs at health facilities. A recent
health facility survey demonstrated that 82% o f health facilities reported no stock outs o f
essential antimalarials in the last three months. More than 6000 CHAs have been trained inthe
management o fmalaria inthe last 5 years andprovided with stocks o f antimalarial drugs.

2. IntegratedVector Management: Eritrea has employed a range o f interventions to reduce
human-mosquito contact. Eritrea has used indoor residual spraying (IRS) for many years, but
has become much more selective in its use. It has utilized surveillance data to target spraying
activities much more effectively.      Although DDT and Malathion continue to be the main
insecticides used for IRS, HAMSET financed the identification o f environmentally-friendly
alternatives to these chemicals.      Under HAMSET, use o f alternative methods was greatly
expanded. Inparticular, insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) were significantly scaled-up inhigh
risk areas. Approximately, 865,000 ITNs were distributed during the last five years and annual
re-treatment campaigns now cover more than 0.5 million of these nets. Presently, about half o f
all households in malarious areas have at least two ITNs. In addition, with the support o f
U SAID'S Environmental Health Project (EHP), community-based environmental management
and larviciding has been greatly expanded. EHP has also assisted NMCP inestablishing sentinel
sites for monitoring vector dynamics and conducted assessments o f the effectiveness o f various
vector control strategies.

3. Epidemic forecasting, early warning, and response: This has become a particularly
important component o f Eritrea's malaria control strategy. NMCP, with the support o f the
Research Triangle Institute, has developed an epidemic preparedness plan and has begun to
implement it. It i s also working with this institute to improve its ability to forecast and detect
epidemics. NMCP has procured reserve stocks o f drugs, bednets, and insecticides to facilitate its
response to epidemics.

4. Operational Research: The NMCP has put great emphasis on conducting operational
research and using the results to modify policies and programs. Drug efficacy trials provided
essential information that led to a new malaria treatment policy. Entomologic studies have
helped to clarify the predominant malaria vectors in Eritrea and helped to stratify malaria risk
areas down to sub-zoba level and below. Pilot studies have been carried out on the use o f rapid
diagnostic tests and to assess alternatives to DDT. Research is now focusing on the relative
effectiveness o f various integrated vector management strategies.




                                                 67

5. Healthpromotion, communityeducation and involvement: Campaigns have been carried
out to promote the use o f ITNs andrapid, effective treatment. Many o f these activities havebeen
focused around Africa Malaria Day and National Malaria Week. Promotions activities have not
yet been integratedwith other health promotion activities carried out bythe MOH.

6. Program management, supervision, and monitoring and evaluation: NMCP has an
extensive, stand-alone surveillance system for malaria. As the MOHrolls out integrated disease
surveillance, the malaria surveillance system will be incorporated into this system without
compromising the valuable informationprovidedto the NMCP andZoba malaria authorities.

Five year plan, 2005-2009

Buildingon the success o f the last five years, the NMCP and its partners have developed a new
5-year strategic plan for malaria control, covering the period from 2005-2009. The primary goal
o f this plan is:

    To reduce morbidity andmortality due to malaria to such low levels that malaria is no longer
    a major public healthconcern inEritrea by the end o fyear 2009.

Specific objectives include:

0    Reduce confirmed malaria related mortality by 50% between 2004 andthe end o f 2009.
0    Reduce reported malaria morbidity 30% betweenthe 2004 level andthe end o f 2009.
0    Reduce severe case fatality by 60% from that o f 2004, by the end o f 2009.
0    Prevent the occurrence o f malaria epidemics until2009.

The new strategy builds on the existing successfkl program and continues all o f the current
programactivities, including:

     1. Earlydiagnosis andprompt treatment- at health facility andcommunity levels;
     2. Lntegrated vector management- using selective IRS, scaling up ITNuse, and appropriate
         environmental management;
     3. Epidemic forecasting and response- refining and simplifying current forecasting models
         for use at sub-national levels, strengthening capacities for quick response;
     4. Operational research- to refine and strengthen existing strategies and assess new tools and
         approaches;
     5, Health promotion- scaling up activities that promote prevention and control, integrating
         with other MOHhealthpromotion activities; and
     6. Program management/Monitoring and evaluation- ensuring strong infrastructure for
         program implementation at all levels, strengthening use o f surveillance data inprogram
         decision making.

 It also details challenges to be addressed to further refine the program activities. Some o f these
 are:

  health andreproductive healthactivities, particularly healthpromotion and service delivery at
  peripheral levels, and disease surveillance;
0 Further clarifying the effectiveness o f various vector control measures, particularly the role
  o f IRS, which recent studies have shownto be o f questionable value inparts o f the country;
0 Identifying cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternatives to DDT;
0 Developing strategies for preventingmorbidity andmortality inpregnant women;
0 Transitioning drug policy to adopt artemisinin-based combination therapy, as recommended
  byWHO;

 ERITREA: HIV/AIDS/STI, TB, Malaria and Reproductive Health Project (HAMSET 11)


Epidemiology

There i s little information on the epidemiology o f TB inEritrea. It is estimated that the Annual
Risk o f TB infection is around 2 percent. This translates into over 8,000 new TB cases per year
inEritrea, ofwhom 4,000 are infectious, smear-positive cases. With a HIV/AIDSprevalence of
2.4%, it seems that Eritrea so far has managed to avoid the HIV/TB dual epidemic which is
ravaging other SSA countries. However, a 2004 study ina referral hospital inAsmara showed a
HIV/AIDS prevalence o f 22.6% among 200 TB patients. This indicates the threat o f a dual
epidemic is very real. Information on the situation of Multi-Drugs Resistant (MDR) TB in
Eritrea i s not available. To expand the information base for decision making, a TB prevalence
survey using florescent microscopy (financed by HAMSET, with technical assistance from
Koninklijke Nederlandse Chemische Vereniging or KNCV, a Dutch NGO) is underway in
Eritrea.

National Response to TB

The WHO-recommended DOTS strategy was introduced in 1996 and has been expanded to all 6
zobas. According to the MOH, 37 o f the 54 Health Centers are implementing DOTS. A
National Strategic Plan (NSP) for TB (2004-2009) has been formulated. According to the NSP,
the objective i s to increase coverage to 100percent, keep detection rates stable, and increase cure
rate from 82.3 percent to 85 percent by 2006. The variety o f drug combinations currently being
used will be standardized and drugs will be provided in fixed dose combinations inblister pack
form rather than as loose pills to facilitate patient compliance andmonitoring

TB control is the responsibility o f the National HIV/AIDS/STI and TB Control Division
(NATCoD). At the zoba level, the Communicable Disease Coordinator (CDC) i s in charge o f
coordinating TB control activities.

Case detection: In principle, NATCoD adopts the passive case finding approach by sputum
smear examination o f people presenting to health facilities with complaints o f chronic cough. In
2003, 4,708 new cases were detected (out o f the 8,000 new cases which were expected to occur
in the population). However, the low proportion of smear positive cases (19%) and high
proportion o f smear negative pulmonary cases (65%) points to possible problems with the
quality o f smear microscopy as well as over-reliance on radiology for TB diagnosis. Findings o f
the TB prevalence survey will shed light on this area.

Treatment outcomes: According to NATCoD statistics, treatment success rate (sum o f cure and
treatment completion rates) has been improved from 73% to 82.3% over the last two years.
However, Bank field supervisions reveal various discrepancies and mis-categorization o f
treatment outcomes in the TB reporting system at local levels. Therefore, such statistics might




                                                   70

not be accurate. Drugs are purchased through the Global Drug Facility and stock outs are
reportedto be rare.

TB & HIKAIDS:          This area remains largely unexplored. Currently TB patients are not
consistently counseled on HIV risk or referred for testing. Since TB is the number one cause o f
death amongst PLWHA, a great deal needs to be done to put PLWHA on TB prophylaxis or into
treatment should they develop active TB.

The National TB Strategy has the following goals for HIV and TB: (i)    establish integrated care
of HIVIAIDS and TB in all primary health facilities by 2006; (ii)      decentralize and combine
training and supervision with HIV programs at the zoba and sub-zoba level; and (iii)         joint
Information andEducation Communication on TB, DOTS, andHIV.

Donor Support: Inaddition to IDA support under HAMSET, the TB programhas been receiving
assistance from the Italian Government and WHO in terms o f TB commodities and technical
assistance. The Government currently does not receive TB funding from the Global Fundbut i s
applying for funds through the next round.

Summary of the challenges in TB:


    0  Progress on tuberculosis has laggedbehindthat for AIDS andmalaria.
    0  Quality o f the TB recording and reporting system is dubious. Current statistics might not
       reflect the actual TB situation.
    0  A system o fsupervisionis not inplace.
    0  Case detection needs improving, especially through strengthening o f smear microscopy
       andquality assuranceo fTB diagnostics.
    0  TB management skills o f healthcare workers needto be improved. Lower TB staff need
       more training and support supervision.
    0  Programmatic management needs to be strengthened at bothnational and zoba levels.
    0  Transport for health care workers at the sub-zoba levels to follow up on defaulter cases is
       lacking.

                                   Annex 8: Reproductive Health
 ERITREA: HIV/AIDS/STI, TB, Malaria andReproductive HealthProject (HAMSET 11)

Introduction

The MOH has identified reduction o f matemal mortality as the utmost reproductive health
priority in Eritrea. The commitment was underlined at the conference on the Road Map for
Accelerating Matemal and Newbom Health held in Asmara in October, 2004. With over 200
participants from all over the country, the conference discussed policy and strategic directions
for improving matemal and newbom health and outlined a `road map' for achieving the
objectives. Safe motherhood together with other components o f RHhas been emphasized in the
new RH policy. The MOH intends to address child spacing, harmful traditional practices and
adolescent sexual and reproductive health because o f their impact on matemal and child
outcomes and gender.

OverallAim and Strategy

The overall aim o f the RH component o f HAMSET I1is to improve matemal and neonatal
outcomes in Eritrea. This will be achieved by expanding availability and access to maternity
services, by increasing their utilization through improved quality o f care, and by addressing
specific gender-based harmful traditional practices that are a barrier to service utilization and
impinge on the health andrights o fwomen. Both demand and supply issues31will be addressed
through the implementation o f proven effective interventions in Safe Motherhood and for
elimination o f gender-based harmful traditional practices. Special emphasis will be given to
interventions that overlap with those for other HAMSET diseases in order to maximize the
synergy and buildingon the success o f HAMSET.

Synergy between reproductive health and H A M S E T diseases and benefits

Reproductive health has been recognized as a major public health problem in Eritrea for a long
time, as confirmed in the National Primary Health Care Policy o f 1998. To address the
challenges and accelerate the pursuit o f the MDGs, the MOH intends to strengthen the
reproductive program by integrating key interventions into HAMSET 11. There is a strong
rationale for the integration based on the outcome overlaps and synergies:

     e  Matemal and child MDGs cannot be achieved without improving access to reproductive
        health through the primary health care system.                 Matemal mortality is very high in
        Eritrea.    The death o f a mother significantly decreases the survival chances o f her
        children. Inadequate care during pregnancy and child birth is also directly related to
        highneonatalmortalitythat accounts for 50% o finfantdeaths inEritrea;
     e  Increasing access to reproductive health i s essential to improving the nutritional status o f
        women and children while greater attention to nutritional needs o f children, especially
        girls, is fundamental to their healthanddevelopment;


31Among supply interventions, one ofthe priority areas is security o fRHcommodities.


                                                        73

        Because o f Eritrea's youthful population, investments in adolescent health and
        development should address their vulnerability to poor reproductive health, including
        HIVIAIDS;
        Identicalmodes o f transmission: HIV infection is predominantly transmitted through sex
        or from mother to child duringpregnancy and childbirth;
        Common risk groups: The same women and adolescent girls who are the most
        vulnerable to HIV infection are also at highest risk group for unplanned pregnancy and
        maternal morbidity and mortality. Adolescent sexual and reproductive health programs
        and antenatal clinics offer an ideal opportunity for expanding HIVIAIDS interventions to
        the vulnerable.
        Shared approaches - Pregnant women and children under 5 are the highest risk group for
        severe attacks o f malaria. Reaching mothers with bed-nets and IPT through antenatal
        clinics i s a known effective intervention inmalaria control programs. Similarly, PMTCT
        clients are a ready entry point for ART programs.

Integrating reproductive health and HAMSET should bringincreased benefit to all, more so for
women, children U5 and adolescents living indeprived rural areas by:

        Enhancing focus and investment on interventions to promote maternal and child health
        andeffective utilization o fexistingresources;
        Reducing health risks andburden o f disease associated with pregnancy and child bearing
        for women;
        Improving child survival by expandingprogram coverage, intensity and effectiveness o f
        interventions;
        Reducing sexual and reproductive health risks for adolescents by encouraging behavior
        change with specific attention to HIVIAIDS and early pregnancies;
        Encouraging community participation and ownership o f HAMSET activities, and
        addressing healthrelatedharmfultraditional practices and gender concerns; and
        Enhancingmultisector interventions to address factors beyond the health sector.

Status of Reproductive, Maternal and ChildHealth in Eritrea

Demographic indicators: Eritrea has a young population that exhibits the broad based pyramid
typical o f countries at the beginning o f the demographic transition. Although there i s no recent
census data, the population is currently estimated to be 4.4 million. Total Fertility Rate (TFR) is
estimated at 4.8 (EDHS, 2002) and is higher in rural (5.7) than in urban (3.5) areas. It is
projectedthat the population will increase by 20% by 2010 and by 50%, to nearly 6.5 million by
2020. Population under 15 years was 43% in2002 and is expected to increase inabsolute terms
from 1.9 to 2.3 million by 2020. This youthful population will continue to drive Eritrea's
population growth over the next two decades, despite declining fertility trends (from 6.7 to 4.8
children per woman between 1990 and 2002). Dependencyratio inEritrea is highand continuing
to rise. In2002, almost halfthe populationwas either below 15 years or above 65 years, givinga
total dependency ratio o f almost 100%. Today, Eritrea's vulnerable population is estimated to be
2.2 million, increasing from 1.9 million in 2004. Over a million internally displaced persons
returned to their homes but are unable to restore livelihoods due to prevailing economic
hardships.

Matemal and child health indicators :Although there have been tremendous healthachievements
inrecent years, M C His still indire straights inEritrea. The reasons are many, including lack of
knowledge on risks and illnesses, poor access to RH/MCH services, poor nutrition, hannfil
traditional practices, and low levels o f education and low socioeconomic status o f womerdgender
inequalities.

0   Poor access and utilization of RH services: Access and utilization o f M C H services in
    Eritrea is less than optimal. This was confirmed by EDHS (2002) where 72% o f women
    reported at least one constraint to seeking care. Cost, distance and lack o f transport were by
    far the commonest reasons sighted.


0   Family planning. The family planning program has not done well in Eritrea.                         Family
    planning has previously been sensitive and it has been easier to discuss it in the context o f
    child spacing and benefits to both matemal and child health. Spacing o fbirths for two years
    or more confers significant benefit not only to the mother but also to child survival. The
    CPR stagnated at 8% between 1995 and 2002, making it one o f the lowest inthe region. The
    DHS, however, confirmed increasing knowledge and awareness o f modem methods and
    desire to space and limit family size. There was also greater acceptance of FP among urban
    women (17%) who were up to four times more likes to use a family planning method than
    rural women (4%). Contraceptive use is closely correlated with female education and access
    to services.


0   Maternal and newborn health. Matemal and perinatal ill-health, together with childhood
    conditions (diarrhea and ARI) constitutes 50% o f the burden o f disease inEritrea. Malaria i s
    a major public health problem that affects 75% o f the population, especially children U5 and
    pregnant women. It remains a major cause o f indirect matemal mortality.

    Safe motherhood: Although much improvement has beenrecorded over the last two decades,
    matemal mortality rate i s still high, estimated variously at 998/100,000 live births between
    1984 and 1994 (with a lifetime risk o f 1:14 inDHS, 1995) and 752/100,000 live births (with
    a lifetime risk o f 1:28 according to a 2005 study by Ghebrehiwet          32.  This study also reported
    significant regional variations: from 46/100,000 in Zoba Maakel to 1,261/100,000 in Zoba
    Southem Red Sea. Three of the six zones (Anseba, Gash Barka and Southern Red Sea had
    MMR above 1,000/100,000 live births. Forty eight percent (48%) of matemal deaths
    occurred during delivery and 36% after. Direct causes o f matemal mortality in Eritrea are
    similar to elsewhere inAfrica with unsafe abortion as the single biggest killer. Other causes
    include hemorrhage, sepsis, obstructed labor and eclampsia.

child health indicators are worse among the semi-nomadic group that form 30% of the Eritrean
population.    Here, family planning i s almost non existent and antenatal care and skilled
attendance in labor rare. Anemia in pregnancy is prevalent and hemorrhage, obstructed labor
andcomplications o fabortion account for most maternalmortality andmorbidity.

Child health and nutrition. Although child health indicators in Eritrea are poor, the trends have
been more encouraging thanfor maternal health.

Infantmortality rate decreased from 81 to 48/1000 live birthsbetween 1990 and2002. Under5
mortality also followed a similar trend, decreasing from 140 to 93/1000 live birthsbetween 1992
and 2002, albeit with significant rural urban inequities. Diarrhea, acute respiratory infections
(ARI)and malaria are the commonest causes of child mortality and morbidity. Recent reports
(EDHS 2002) show that although Under 5 diarrhea and ARI are common, only 68% o f mothers
with children with diarrhea used ORT and 44% of children with ARI received modern health
care.

Under-5 malnutrition i s high and has seen little improvement since 1995. Over 50% o f U 5 are
stunted and another 13 underweight. The prevalence o f underweight is highest inthe 6-24 month
age group, a reflection o fboth low birthweight and poor weaning practices.

Childhood anemia is equally prevalent, seen in 50% o f U5 children. This is higher than the
regional average o f 32% and indicates the need to improve supplemental feeding and awareness
o fmothers. Mother's education i s a major factor inchild malnutrition inEritrea.

The 2002 EDHS also reported a full immunization rate o f 76% at 12-23 months. This was a
slight decrease on the 2000 EPI survey which showed 79.4%.            Overall most immunizable
diseases were on the decline inthe last decade, indicating the success o f EPI. Tetanus data have
been erratic, probably due to the poor performance o f antenatal care and TT efforts.

Harmful traditional practices, which are gender-based, continue to undermine the health of
women and children in Eritrea, especially those linked to nutrition and sexuality. FGM is the
best known example. Eritrea has had a strong anti FGMprogram that has resulted in a modest
drop inprevalence from 95% to 89% between 1995 and 2002. The decline was most notable in
younger women below 25 years, indicating a change inpractice inthe communities.

Government's Policy

Reproductive Health Component of H A M S E T I1

The package o fplannedinterventions includes:

Focused antenatal care. Inthe last decade, experts realized that mere access to and utilization o f
antenatal care was not an effective way o f predicting which women are likely to develop life
threatening complications during pregnancy and childbirth. The risk screening approach often
incorrectly picked women who did not develop complications while missing many who
subsequently had complicated pregnancy. Inaddition, the risk screening created a false sense o f
security for women categorised as low-risk andtheir health providers. Antenatal care can detect
and treat chronic conditions such as anaemia, diabetes and hypertension through clinical
examination and laboratory tests (Hb and urinalysis) and is still an essential and important link
betweenthe woman and the health services. To make it more effective, experts now recommend
a more focused approach to antenatal care consisting o f four visits and:

    e  Counselling about danger signs o f pregnancy and delivery complications andwhere to go
       incaseofemergency;
       Supplyo firon, folate andvitamin A supplements;
       Advice onproper nutrition duringpregnancy and lactation;
       Treatment o f conditions that affect pregnancy such as malaria, TB, hookworm infections,
       STDs, including HIV/AIDS;
       Providing tetanus toxoid immunizationsto protect the newbom;
       Voluntary HIV counselling and testing;
       Information on breastfeeding and contraceptives; and
       Screening for domestic violence andproviding appropriate counselling andreferral,

Prevention of mother to child transmission o f HIV (PMTCT) will be offered as part o f the
matemity package, starting with VCT for HIV in selected antenatal clinics. Using standard
WHO protocols already tested in existing pilot sites in Asmara, the project will support
expansion o fPMTCT programs to at least four other major towns.

Skilled care during;preqnancv and deliverv. This i s defined as the process by which care i s
provided to a woman and her newbom duringpregnancy, childbirth and immediately afterwards
by a skilled health provider properly supported with equipment, supplies, communication and
transport. Less than half o f births in Eritrea are assisted by a skilled\attendant due to such
constraints as, availability (serious shortage of skilled attendants); access (physical, cultural and
financial obstacles) and; poor quality o f care (both clinical and interpersonal staff attitudes).
Studies also show that distance i s a major factor in the utilization o f skilled attendants by
communities. Only one third as many women utilize these services when the facility i s 120


                                                 78

minutes away compared to 30 minutes. The project will improve access to skilled care by
accelerating the training o f additional midwives and in service training in Life Saving Skills
(LSS) and newborn care for doctors, nurses and associate nurses. Supplies and equipment will
also be addressed. Special focus will given to behaviour change and community mobilization
and ensuring a continuum o f care with emphasis on lower health facilities where most deliveries
take place and are the first line o f contact with patients. Policies, norms and guidelines will be
reviewed to support this process.

Emergency obstetric care (EmOC) refers to management and treatment o f obstetric
complications. It does not typically include preventive care, monitoring o f labour or newborn
care. EmOC i s divided into basic (undertaken at lower levels o f facilities) and comprehensive
(undertaken in at secondary or tertiary levels, usually involving a physician who i s able to
perform a caesarean section). Although an EmOC survey has not been done, indications are that
the situation in Eritrea is dire. The project will therefore support an EmOC survey and will
strengthen delivery o f emergency services at the various levels, including review o f policies and
establishment o f clear norms and guidelines for delivery o f services. Renovations are envisaged
to provide theatre facilities in sub-Zoba hospitals for which equipment and supplies will be
provided. Since Eritrea has only six obstetricians, Medical officers and Clinical officers will be
appropriately trained inCaesareansection and LSS. The number of Nurse-anaesthetists will also
be increase. to cover for expansion o fEmOC.

Postnatalcare is the service provided to women inthe first 42 days after delivery. Most maternal
deaths occur during this period, especially the first 24 hours, from complications such as
haemorrhage, sepsis and eclampsia.         Post natal care aims at maintaining the physical and
psychological well being o f the mother and her newborn but is rather underdeveloped inAfrica,
Eritrea included, Most mothers are discharged within 24 hours o f delivery inEritrea, makingan
even stronger case for an organized PNC.

Post abortion care. Complications o f abortion are a major cause o f maternal mortality and
morbidity inEritrea. It accounts for 40% o f maternal deaths at the national Referral hospital in
Asmara, 40% o f outpatient and 50% o f gynaecological admissions. The MOH, with support
from UNFPA andUSAID, is introducing post abortion care (PAC) which will be available inall
hospitals and health centres, performed by both physicians and nurses. PAC will include all the
four elements: emergency evacuation o f products o f conception by manual vacuum aspiration
(MVA), post abortion counselling and family planning, linkage with RHservices for follow up,
and community participation and involvement. The project will supplement the contribution o f
UNFPA and USAID to ensure that targets for PAC training and purchase o f MVA equipment
andsupplies are met.

Emergency referral i s a critical part o f safe motherhood. The project will adopt the Four Delay
Model (Delay inrecognizing danger signs; in seeking care; inreaching appropriate care; and in
receiving care at health facilities) approach to address this issue.       While ambulances and
telecommunication will be needed, the lasting solution lies ineffective liaisonbetween the health
sector and communities and improvement o f roads and other transportation systems. The project
will enhance referral systems between communities and health care providers by encouraging
communities to create emergency transportation plans and establish maternity waiting homes



                                                  79

where appropriate. Telecommunication will also be addressed within the network limitations in
the country.

Child spacing or family planningis defined as a way o f thinking and living, adopted voluntarily,
upon the basis o f knowledge, attitudes and responsible decisions by individuals or couples, in
order to promote health o f the family group and thus contribute to social development o f a
country.     It allows couples and individuals to prevent mistimed, unwanted or high risk
pregnancies and is therefore one o f the key pillars o f Safe Motherhood. Family planninghas not
taken o f f in Eritrea and the CPR is one o f the lowest in the region. The project intends to
promote child spacing through community mobilization and improved access to quality services.
Within this context the feasibility o f expanding the community based distribution (CBD)
approach will be considered.

Capacity building. Shortage o f skilled service providers i s the most critical constraint to delivery
o f RH services in Eritrea.         There are 212 doctors (including 6 gynaecologists and 6
paediatricians), 993 nurses and 1576 associate nurses working for the MOH. Only 11% o f the
nurses are midwives. Human Resources for RH is therefore a major area o f concern and the
project will address it by supporting both pre-service and in-service training, taking into account
the contribution o f other development partners.         Planned capacity building activities are -
training includes, pre-service training for 200 new midwives, 20 anaesthetic nurses; and
extensive in service training in LSS, focused ANC, PNC, Amok and PAC for various cadres o f
staff (see Operational Manual for details).        Pre-service training will be coordinated by the
R&HRDwhile the RHUwillberesponsible for in-servicetraining.

Inlinewiththe MOHpolicy, training ofsemi-skilled communityhealthworkers suchas TBAs
will continue andtheir activities closely integratedwith localhealth facilities. TBA activities are
also eligible for funding from the community component o f HAMSET. The specific role o f
TBAs needs special attention. Given the shortage o f skilled providers/midwives and prevailing
cultural practices, communities will continue to trust and use TBAs for the foreseeable future.
Recognizing what research has shown regarding their effectiveness in reducing maternal
mortality but bearing in mind the reality o f the situation in Eritrea, the project will support
training o f a number o f TBAs to recognize obstetric emergencies and promote early referral.
They will be integrated with the health system, including allowing them to accompany the
womento the facilities hospital andparticipation inmaternalmortality audits

All the training activities will be harmonized and integrated to minimize duration o f absence o f
staff from their duty stations.

Infrastructure. The project will not support major infrastructure development. It will however
support selective minor renovations and construction deemed to be o f directly relevance and
benefit to RH, especially inimproving qualityof care. This includes renovations for EmOC (e.g.
improvement of theatre facilities or additional space); renovations for skilled attendance (e.g.
extra space and privacy for delivery or management o f pre-eclampsideclampsia) and modest
installation o f utilities such as water and electricity. Maternity waiting rooms are not included in
this package andwill be considered under the community component. Needs assessment will be
conducted to inform selection o f projects to be supported and priority will be given to rural



                                                    80

facilities in the most deprived areas and to the health centres being upgraded to Community
Hospitals. It i s noted that most health facilities inEritrea are inreasonable state andother donors
are supporting infrastructure improvement.

Eauipment. drups and supplies: The project will procure specific equipment and supplies to
facilitate delivery o f appropriate maternal and newborn care. Eritrea has recently received RH
equipment from other donors and the project intends to fill the critical gaps, identified by the
needs assessment process. Pharmaceuticals and other consumable supplies will also be covered
by the project, including antibiotics, analgesics, intravenous fluids, anaesthetic drugs, oxytocics,
Diazepam, Magnesium sulphate, Ferrous sulphate, Folic acid and Vitamin A. Contraceptive
security i s another important consideration. UNFPA i s currently supplying all the contraceptives
as well as MVA equipment for PAC. With increasing demands for FP, support at current levels
may soon be insufficient. To cater for the uncertainty and avoid any shortages, the project will
provide an allocation for both FP andPAC commodities. Such funds will be used to cover other
pharmaceuticals and supplies ifnot needed for the intended purpose.

Focused ANC requires improved laboratory services.              Currently, syphilis screening, blood
grouping andHb are not routinely done inANC. It is estimated that 4% o fEritreanpopulation i s
Rhesus negative, indicating that considerable rhesus iso-immunisation may be takingplace but i s
undetected. The project will therefore support improvement o f laboratory services as detailed in
the work plan, to ensure that all Health centres and hospitals can do urinalysis (uristicks for
protein), Blood group/Rh and haemoglobin. The Global Fundwill provide adequate test kits for
syphilis.

Behaviour change and community mobilization. There a range o fphysical, cultural and financial
obstacles that prevents women and communities from using available maternity services.
Women's low status, lack o f education and income, and limited rights and freedoms also affect
their ability to seek and receive quality care. Bringing these barriers down requires a strategy
that goes beyond information and awareness creation. The project proposes to apply Behaviour
Change Communication, an informed approach for promoting and sustaining behaviour change
in individuals and communities, implemented through the development and dissemination of
specific health messages using a variety o f channels. This should make it possible to achieve
strategic and measurable behaviour change because it will be based on in-depth qualitative
understanding o f knowledge attitudes and values o f communities; it will identify current
behaviour among women, community leaders and men and promote desired behaviour that is
feasible; it will identify and address barriers and constraints to behaviour change; it will also
identify external barriers such as perceived poor quality o f services and staff behaviour that
discourage utilization o f maternity services by communities.           The five core issues to be
addressedby BCC are

    e    Attitudes o fhealth providers
    e    Birthspacing andfamily planning
         Safer sex (ABC),
         Safe motherhood (ANC, Skilled care and obstetric emergencies) and,
    0    Harmfultraditional practices (FGM, early marriage, adolescent pregnancy, gender-based
         violence, feedingpractices andnutrition).



                                                    81

Multisector activities will be supported under a different component o f HAMSET. Itis clear that
many factors influencing maternal and newborn outcomes lie outside the health sector. Harmful
traditional practices and gender issues fall in this category. The key sectors for RH include:
Education (Family Life Education programs); Labour (Culture and gender concerns); Local
Government (Community mobilization and coordination); Information (information, education,
communication, advocacy and community sensitization); Transport and Communication (Roads
and emergency referrals) and Agriculture (Food security and nutrition). All these sectors have
extensive outreach that will be mobilized to supplement RH activities by the health sector. The
project will buildon the success o f HAMSET inthis endeavour, linking closely with HIV/AIDS
andMalaria andharmonizingthe messages and activities.

Role o f other donors. The role and extent o f other development partners to RH in Eritrea is
summarized in Annex 2. The project design has taken these activities into account, to ensure
complementarity and reduce overlaps and avoid duplication. Great care has been taken to
harmonize and coordinate HAMSET I1supported activities with others and ensuring that the
MOH and PMU are in the driving seat, playing the critical coordination role. This will be
supported by the joint supportive participation o f the RHCoordinating Committee, consisting o f
all donors working inRH, which meets once a month. Joint supervision o f activities will also be
encouraged.

Monitoring Progress. In line with the National Sexual and Reproductive Health Policy and
Guidelines, the RH component o f HAMSET I1is planned and will be supervised, monitored and
evaluated within the context o f the overall PrimaryHealth Care (PHC) program. This bottom-up
approach will be augmented to satisfy project specific requirements and in conformity with the
national integrated supervisory strategy. For this to be effective, the Reproductive Health unit
will be strengthened with technical support from UNFPA andUSAID. This will be followed by
enhancement o f supervisory and monitoring capacity at the Zoba and sub-Zoba levels. A
comprehensive supervisory work plan will be developed by the RHU and the Zobas, in
collaboration with other stakeholders and will be integrated with integratedwith other HAMSET
components.

HealthManagement Information System. The project will support review and standardization o f
existing data collection tools and encourage analysis at the point o f collection to influence
decisions and change o f practice.     Special attention will be given to data collection at the
community level, which is currently weak or non existent, as well as household and community-
level factors that influence the utilization o f maternity services and attitudes to harmful
traditional practices. BCC interventions will be monitored through qualitative approaches, using
rapid household surveys or focused groups at the beginning and towards the end o f the project.
This will focus on key behaviors o f interest and appropriate indicators to measure changes in
knowledge attitude andbehaviors.

Maternal Audits. Making information available to policymakers has been shown to generate
commitment and positive reaction. While maternal mortality levels are difficult to measure,
innovative efforts will be employed to assess the extent o f maternal and newborn morbidity and
deaths. First, matemal mortality is to be declared as notifiable inEritrea. This will be followed



                                                 82

by establishment o f a maternal audit system to be phasedinnationwide. There will be two types
o f audits: Clinical audits to be conducted on all maternal and neonatal deaths that occur within
health facilities, and Community audits for deaths occurring in the villages. The clinical audits
will bemandatory inall hospitals andwill critically analyze the quality o fmedical care provided
and lessons learnt on prevention.       Linking clinical and community audits will facilitate
systematic exploration o f the `road to death 'that individual women take, including the accounts
of families and health care providers. The project will support formation and operations o f
maternal Audit teams at both national and Zoba levels, with strong participation o f health
professionals, communities, local government and women's groups. Participation and leadership
o f staff and students o f Orotta Medical School and Nurse training colleges in the audit process
will be actively sought.

Operations research. In addition to the above the project will support a selected number o f
operations research activities. One o f them will be a Reproductive Age Mortality Study
(RAMOS) to estimate the maternal mortality at the end o f the project. Maternal mortality data
from the study conducted by Ghebrehiwet in2005 will be used as baseline.

Tarnets and Indicators. Project performance will be monitored and assessed against specific
milestones and targets. The project will be centrally coordinated by the PMU while service
delivery on the other hand, will be monitored by technical departments in close collaboration
with the PMU. It is importantto note that the project is also supporting the overall improvement
of the National Health Information Management System that will improve data collection
analysis and feedback at all levels. Every effort has been made to ensure that the targets are in
line with the RH policy and strategic guidelines which are currently in draft form. The targets
also take into account and the human resource situation, the resource envelope, role o f other
partners and the duration o f the project. HAMSET is not the only donor supporting RH in
Eritrea and the activities o f all the other components o f HAMSET contribute to the RH
outcomes. These considerations also inform the choice o f indicators, ensuring that they are in
line with the policy guidelines, are measurable and appropriate surrogates o fthe project.

Inview ofthe above, the monitoringandevaluationframework doesnot intendto reinventthe
wheel and has picked core indicators from the National guidelines and the relevant sections o f
the MDGs. The selected indicators o f the RHcomponent are given inAnnex 3.

Tracking progress toward the MDGs: Although assessing progress toward the MDGs can be
complicated by uncertainties and differences on how indicators are designed and which
measurement instruments are used, the project intends to track a few specific indicators for this
purpose as summarizedbelow.

    0    Goal 4: Promote gender equality and empowerment o fwomen. Target -Promote
        positive attitude andpractice by community leaders and heads of households to reduce
         gender-basedharmful traditionalpractices (FGM,early marriage and nutrition)


    0    Goal 5: Reduce child mortality. Target -Improve neonatal care and outcomes.

         Goal 6: Improve maternal health. Target -Increaseproportion of births attended by
         skilledproviders; Increase number of facilities with EmOC; Decrease casefatality due to


                                                 83

       direct obstetric causes; Improve maternal mortality reporting and monitoring; Reduce
       maternal mortality rate

   e   Goal 7: Combat HIVIAIDS, malaria andTB. Target -Halt HIV/AIDSprevalence among
       pregnant women; IncreaseITIV use among women attending; Increase TB treatment
       completion rate amongpregnant women.

In addition to the above, the following indicators will be monitored to confirm the pro-poor
orientation o f the RHcomponent o fHAMSET 11:

       Improved stewardship role o f the MOH and successful implementation o fRHcomponent
       o f HAMSET I1(% disbursement o f budget allocation to districts and health centers; %
       facilities supervised regularly by Zoba HealthManagement Teams.
       Increased geographical and physical accessibility o f quality RH services (% facilities
       with EmOC; Unmet need for EmOC; % births with skilled attendance; % facilities with
       PAC; % facilities with FP).
       Improved human resource situation and availability of essential inputs (comprehensive
       HRM plan; annual training output for skilled staff in LSS and; number of graduating
       midwives and anesthetists; % facilities without stock outs o fRHmarker drugs).
       Increased utilization of services by the poor and stronger community satisfaction,
       ownership and participation in RH activities (% institutional births; number o f Village
       Health Committees (VHCs) established and functioning; changing attitudes and practices
       to 5 core RHissues).

                     Annex 9: CommunityManagedHAMSETResponse
 ERITREA: HIV/AIDS/STI,TB, Malaria andReproductiveHealthProject(HAMSET 11)


This component will finance small-scale community subprojects that directly respond to
HAMSET diseases following a results-based framework and through the application o f
community-driven development (CDD) approaches. The two-fold objective o f the Community-
Managed HAMSET Response Program (CMHRP) are to: (i)finance subprojects that adopt
effective interventions for HAMSET diseases, use results-based approaches (such as RRI) and
that are especially suitable for direct management by beneficiary communities; and (ii)  build
human and social capital at community level        to facilitate informed decision-making and
collective action around common goals, with an emphasis on community participation, social
inclusion, and mutual accountability.

The CMHRP component builds on experience in HAMSET in channeling resources and in
applying participatory andresults-based approaches to strengthen stakeholder involvement at the
local level. Lessons from HAMSET and other World Bank financed community HIV/AIDS
components illustrate that subprojects which communities themselves identify, select and
manage are more likely to achieve results and promote ownership.        Communities will take
responsibility to ensure results and quality activities at the local level, using simple M&E
indicators and methodologies. The importance o f monitoring and evaluation, particularly in a
multi-sectoral operation such as HAMSET was emphasized in order to effectively monitor
outcomes and impact o f development interventions, and where needed, strengthen and/or refine
strategies and operational modalities based on timely feedback on lessons and experience gained
on the ground.      Lessons also reveal that subprojects which include activities that directly
respond to HAMSET diseases, are results-oriented, and that promote positive behavior changes
have higher value andhigher chances for sustainability.

The use o f RRItools in particular has had a significant impact in empowering members o f the
community to act and take charge in articulating and implementing their results-based goals to
address HAMSET diseases.            Short-term,  results-based activities can strengthen the
implementation and scaling up o f the local initiatives. With fewer resources available under
HAMSET I1there is need to rationalize the use of resources. To this end Behavior Change
Communication (BCC) programs that are evidence-based will be promoted rather than
investments in physical infrastructure.   Finally, more concerted efforts are needed to target
strategically interventions to support vulnerable groups. These lessons are incorporated in the
overall design o f HAMSET 11.

For HAMSET 11, a results-based framework closely aligned with national objectives and
priorities for addressing HAMSET diseases will be adopted. Within this framework, project
inputs and activities will be implemented at the community level, applying CDD approaches in
order to promote innovations and to give greater control over decisions and resources to
community groups and local level stakeholders, in partnership with local administration. This
component would also aim to more closely relate investments in subprojects with human and
social capital development. Learning and participatory processes included in this component




                                               85

aim to enhance and promote the sharing o f individuals' knowledge, skills, talents, attitudes and
values at community level.

Community subprojects will be planned and managed according to general principles governing
development programs that support CDD, namely:

       Ensuring that subprojects respond to informed demand, are directly linked to HAMSET
       diseases and that communities, with facilitation by local partner institutions as necessary,
       have the capacity to manage and sustain them and that capacity building and
       development are invested in at all levels. All CMHRP grants are to be managed by
       locally elected Community Management Teams (CMT).

       Strengtheningparticipatoly mechanisms for greater community control and stakeholder
       involvement throughout all phases o f the subproject cycle, and devolving responsibilities
       to communities andlocal stakeholders as capacity is developed.

       Strategically integrating capacity building at the local level along with the subproject
       cycle.

       Working towards greater social and gender inclusion with explicit socially-inclusive and
       gender-sensitive approaches built into social mobilization modalities.

       Maintainingflexibility in design and implementation, especially with regards to M&E in
        order that direct feedback fkom the community can feed into further strengthening and/or
       refining project approaches.

       Developing transparent and equitable criteria for resource allocation andtargeting.

       Establishing a basis for ownership and mutual accountability at the local level, around
       which community initiatives can be sustained.

       Strengthening linkages, coordination, and synergies between activities by all
        implementing partners at community level and community subprojects.

In order to achieve these objectives, the component will have two Sub-Components: Sub-
Component I - HAMSET Grants for Subprojects (US$ 3.4 M) and Sub-component 2:
Community Mobilization and Capacity Development (US$ 0.6M)

A.      Sub-component I:HAMSET Grants for Subprojects (US$3.4 million)

This sub-component will support small-scale, effective, and demand-driven community
subprojects that directly address HAMSET diseases and which are especially suitable for
management by beneficiary communities.          Particular emphasis will be given to support
community subprojects targeted to vulnerable groups.       This sub-component will support the
strengthening o f community groups, .inassociation with partner institutions operating at the local
level to identify, build consensus, plan, implement, monitor, and sustain community subprojects.


                                                86

CMHRP will adopt a results-based framework, and within this framework pilot a fairly open
menu along with a negative list in order to provide flexibility and allow innovations for
communities to identify and select their subprojects, based on their comparative advantage.

CMHRPResults-Based Framework (RBF). To assist communities CMHRP will operate with a
results-based framework, which provides guidance on targets and results as formulated under
national policies and strategies for HAMSET diseases. Key target results for each o f the
HAMSET diseases are described in the CMHRP Operational Manual, not prescribing specific
choices o f subprojects which can be considered for funding but providing flexibility and
allowing innovations for communities, based on their comparative advantage, to identify,
prioritize and select their results-based subproject to addressing HAMSET diseases.            The
implementation o f the open menu will be supported by "leaming by doing" and participatory
approaches, with flexibility for CMHRP to adapt the rules according to experiences gained and
difficulties identified duringimplementation.

The implementation o f the open menu will be guided by the following principles, ensuring that
subproject proposals:

   i. Genuinely reflect demand-driven community initiatives that communities identify,
        prioritize and select themselves and that they can implement and manage.                 In
        communities where capacity may be weak, the services o f relevant extemal support
  ..    agents operating at the local level may be recruited to help facilitate implementation;
  11.   Using RRItools, focus on results as described in the Results-Based Framework and that
        planned activities are in areas where communities have a comparative advantage in
 ...    implementing;
 111.   Are small-scale, effective, and can be managed by communities;
 iv.    Wherever possible, include either (i)      low cost and high impact community-based
         activities such as BCC interventions; or (ii)  effective and sustainable service-oriented
        interventions that directly benefit vulnerable groups (i.e. support for orphans and home-
        based care for PLWHAs, etc.);
  V.    Include, where appropriate, information describing community's plans for maintaining
        their subproject activities beyondthe subproject fundingperiod; and
 vi.     Indicate whether proposed interventions are o f a short-term or long-term duration (i.e.
        whether proposed activities will require multiple grants as may be the case for support for
         orphans andhome-based care for PLWHAs.

CMHRP will not finance the following negative items, namely: (i) civil works; (ii)
                                                                        new                   small
civil works over and above $500; (iii)   nutrition and food, except for specific target groups; (iv)
income generating activities, except for specific target groups; (v) purchase o f vehicles; (vi)
overhead costs over 10% o f total subproject costs; and (vii) drugs, medical fees (except for
home-based care).

Given the demand-driven nature o f subprojects to be financed under CMHRP, the types o f
subprojects cannot be knowninadvance. Inthe initial phase, three windows for providing grants
to community groups will be piloted.




                                                 87

Window "A": This includes subprojects with a value o f less than $300, to be appraised and
approved at village level with support from Village Health Committees and village
administration. Simplified procedures will be applied to encourage rapid implementation o f very
small-scale activities, without imposing too many restrictions.         The project will review the
implementation o f activities under this window to ensure that there are no conflicts o f interest
between implementing partners and approval mechanisms at the village level.

Window "B": This includes subprojects with values ranging from $300-$3,000, to be appraised
andapprovedat zoba level.

Window "C".      This includes subprojects specifically targetedto vulnerable groups, with a value
o f less than $5000, and appraised and approved at zoba level. Recognizing the stigma and
culturally-sensitive issues that make it difficult for some vulnerable groups to come forward
with their proposals and to negotiate their viewpoints, target beneficiaries will probably require
the services o f relevant external support agents to provide facilitative assistance inorder for them
to access the stream o f benefits under CMHRP. It is envisaged that subprojects targeted to
vulnerable groups will initially be co-managed by beneficiary communities and relevant partner
agencies collaborating under the Multi-Sectoral Component (i.e. BIDHO, FBOs, NUEWs, etc.)
untilthe capacityofthe former isdeveloped.

Financing o f community subprojects, particularly those from vulnerable groups that are within
the Result-Based Framework and comply with the guiding principles o f the open menubut may
require additional resources to achieve optimal results, or continuous assistance for a longer
period o f time @e. home-based care for PLHWAs, and support for orphans and vulnerable
children (OVCs), will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Subproject proposals exceeding
$5000 will require approval from central level.

The implementation o f the results-based framework and the open menu will be closely
monitored.     Where necessary and in consultation with IDA, operational modalities and
guidelines may be modified to better address the specific conditions o f Eritrea, increase
responsiveness, maximize results o f CMHRP interventions and incorporate lessons and
experiences during implementation and feedback from beneficiaries.

Target BeneJiciaries. Overall, CMHRP's interventions are expected to benefit communities as a
whole. Under HAMSET 11, however, greater emphasis will be given to support vulnerable
groups. These include women, including pregnant women and mothers,                    commercial sex
workers, HAMSET diseases affected or infected individuals and households, individuals living
inurban "hot spots", youths and adolescents (in- and out of- school), truck drivers, conscripts,
OVCs, PLWHAs, etc.). Relevant external support agents (civil society organizations, FBOs,
BIDHO, NUEWS, etc.) and local government would also benefit through their facilitative
collaborationwith beneficiary communities.

Resource Allocation and Targeting Framework.               The resource allocation and targeting
framework under HAMSET I1is under development with particular focus on targeting the most
vulnerable groups.




                                                  88

        Resource allocation and targeting will be undertaken in order to: (a) ensure that a
concerted effort is made to reachthose vulnerable groups who have not, so far, been able to fully
benefit from CMHRP; and (b) serve as a monitoring mechanism inorder to assess ifregions and
specific geographic areas are able to meet their targets and to offer assistance (capacity building)
where they are lagging.       Criteria for resource allocation will aim to provide that 50% of
resources be allocatedbased on population, and the other 50% be allocated based on poverty and
weightings o f epidemiological indicators inrelation to HAMSET diseases. Within each region's
allocation, 25% o f funds will be earmarked to support specifically targeted interventions for the
most vulnerable groups.

Subproject level targeting. Besides resource allocation, HAMSET I1will use various ways to
target vulnerable groups.       Some o f these are integrated in the project cycle processes.
Subproject-level targeting can take three forms:

Self-targeting: Communities will identify their own projects with emphasis on small-scale,
effective, and results-based interventions for which communities and sub-groups within a
community have a comparative advantage inimplementing.

Geographic targeting. Data on epidemiological indicators in relation to HAMSET diseases,
zoba-level poverty profiles where available, health services data and information from LQAS
and highrisk group mapping would collectively be usedto identify areas that are at ahigher risk.

Community-based targeting: Extended participatory rural appraisals would be carried out to
assist the process of ensuring that vulnerable groups benefit from HAMSET I1 resources.
Through the Capacity Development subcomponent, social mobilization campaigns and
awareness raising for local level stakeholders, including traditional institutions, community
leaders, local administration, village health committees, CMTs, etc. would improve community-
level targeting. These interventions would be reinforced through similar and complementary
interventions implemented at a wider scale under the Multi-Sectoral Response Component.

Appraisal and Approval.        Subproject proposals under Window "A" will be appraised and
approved with support from Village Health Committees and village administration. Subproject
proposals under Windows "B" and "C" will be submitted by CMTs to Zoba PMUs for pre-
screening (desk review), and appraised by Zoba HAMSET Technical Committees following
eligibility criteria and guidelines described inthe CMHRP Operational Manual. The portfolio o f
appraised subprojects under Windows "B" and "Cy' which are eligible for financing under the
CMHRP will be forwarded to the Zoba Administrator's Office or through the Zoba Steering
Committee where it exists for approval. The portfolio o f approved proposals in each zoba will
be submitted to HAMSET I1PMU-CMHRP (central level) for consolidation in HAMSET 11's
overall annual work program and budget. Subproject proposals that are within the RBF and
comply with the guiding principles o f the open menubut exceed the threshold o f $5,000 would
be reviewed and appraised on a case-by-case basis by the Zoba Technical Committees and
approved by the National Technical Committee.

Participatory Planning and Identification. Community-based participatory planning processes
will be strengthened in order to reinforce the capacities o f communities to take the lead in



                                                 89

improving their health, requiring upgraded facilitation, capacity building and methodological
innovations based upon participatory approaches, including use o f RRI tools piloted under
HAMSET I.Community subprojects are to be identified, prioritized, selected, and prepared by
beneficiary communities, led by Community Management Teams, facilitated by community
facilitators, with technical back-stopping support o f a range o f external support agencies,
including CMHRP, zoba-level technical staff, local administration and other intermediary
groups, as appropriate.

Subproiect Implementation. Community subproject launch workshops will be required, with the
participation o f all relevant stakeholders (CMTs, Peer Groups, Zoba HAMSET PMUs, local
administration,   community facilitators, VHCs, and intermediaries and/or local partner
institutions where appropriate).   These workshops are intended to build ownership, enhance
transparency o f the process and confirm amongst all stakeholders their roles, responsibilities and
reciprocal commitments for project implementation.

Supervision. Supervision will be an essential activity to ensure the quality and effectiveness o f
subproject implementation andmanagement. The Zoba PMUwill have overall responsibility for
supervision with support from CHMRP Facilitators and additional community support from
BCC Peer Educators, members o fthe Village Health Committees, and local govemment staff.

Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning. The project is a CDD endeavor based on simultaneous
capacity building and direct investment efforts.       As a CDD initiative, the project requires
multiplelevels o f monitoring and evaluation procedures ensuring its contribution to community
empowerment and capacity building to address HAMSET diseases in an integrated and
sustainable manner. The enhanced subproject cycle will promote community participation and
community ownership through the integration o f simple M&E mechanisms relevant for
community decision-making and monitoring results.

The M&E envisaged under the CMHRP Component is not only concerned with recording and
reporting on project inputs and outputs, but is also intimately related to how different
stakeholders, using participatory methods, can be facilitated in collecting and analyzing
information for their own use and for holding others to account on their performance. The
operational aspects o f CMHRP will continue to be monitored intemally and externally as part o f
posteriori evaluations, audits, mid-term reviews, andparticipatory assessments.

Completion. Formal handover to beneficiary community groups will be integrated in the
subproject cycle to signal their responsibility for maintaining subproject activities.

Sustainability. Participation o f community and local partner institutions (where appropriate),
including local administration are important prerequisites for achieving sustainability goals.
Participatory assessments, LQAS results, and other evaluation methodologies will be important
tools to assess performance and outcomes.

Post-evaluation. Post-evaluations will be carried out to assess whether communities are able to
maintain their activities, where appropriate, beyond the subproject fundingperiod.




                                                  90

Procedures to be followed for targeting, social mobilization, facilitation, appraisal, approval,
implementation andmonitoring o f subprojects are defined inthe Operational Manual.

B.      Sub-component 2: Community Mobilization and Capacity Development (US$ 0.6
million)

This subcomponent will assist HAMSET I1to intensify its efforts to enable genuine community-
driven development by enhancing community members' and their associated organizations'
skills in social promotion, community mobilization, participatory planning, and community
identification, prioritization, and management o f subprojects. It will pay particular attention to
collaborative facilitation, participatory monitoring and evaluation exercises to be carried out at
the local level. The bulk o f capacity development efforts under this subcomponent will be
strategically provided along the subproject cycle.

The focal areas o fcapacity development efforts are:

    a   Social mobilization, focusing on community-level activities towards mobilization o f
        stakeholders at community level for effective and results-based interventions, inclusive
        and equitable community subprojects.
    a   Delivery o f basic project management training to CMTs to develop their organizational,
        management, andbasic accounting skills.
    a   Development o fparticipatory planningandappraisal techniques to enable communities to
        effectively identify and prioritize their HAMSET-related needs, and to develop
        appropriate, equitable and inclusive interventions which communities can manage and
        sustain. The RRI approach, including extended P U S , would be used to facilitate the
        participatorypreparation o fresults-based subproject proposals.
     a  Development o f simple participatory monitoring and evaluation (PM&E) tools, suitable
        for community use, and relevant for decision-making and monitoring outcomes at
        community level. An illustrative list o f possible indicators which can be used to monitor
        CMHRP activities at community level has been developed and are described in the
        CMHRP Operational Manual.
     a  Development and/or strengthening of technical handbooks to strengthen sub-project cycle
        management.
     a  Training o f CMTs, CMHRP community facilitators and community coordinators, and
         local partner institutions in participatory planning and monitoring tools, subproject
        management and implementation, RRI tools, and on the use o f the CMHRP Operational
        Manual andvarious technical handbooks.
     a   Carrying out participatory assessments to obtain direct feedback from beneficiary groups
         on the overall quality and effectiveness o f interventions provided under CMHRP. These
         assessments also serve as a monitoring tool to validate community satisfaction with
         services provided under CMHRP.
     a   Documentation and dissemination o f information from beneficiary communities on the
         quality, overall satisfaction and impact o f their subprojects in addressing HAMSET
         disease, including lessons learned.




                                                  91

Capacity development activities will be delivered through a series o f workshops, training,
learning-by-doing and complemented by the development o f community technical handbooks,
and dissemination o f appropriate information which communities, for example, can use to
strengthen the linkbetweentheir subprojects andrelated health services. This subcomponent will
be managed by PMU-CMHRP, in collaboration with relevant technical staff at the zoba level.
Where appropriate, CMHRP will draw on the expertise o f relevant participating agencies (i.e.
MOH staff, local government, non-health line ministries , civil society organizations, NGOs,
FBOs, etc) collaborating under the Multi-Sectoral Response Component to strengthen multi-
sectoral linkages and to ensure complementary across capacity development activities financed
under this subcomponent, and those implemented by other partner agencies. CMHRP may
engage a limited number o f short-term technical assistance to provide support in specific areas
where capacity may not be available. All short-term technical assistance recruited to support the
activities o f CMHRP will be expected, as an explicit part o f their terms o f reference, to transfer
"skills andknow-how" to core staff inCMHRP-PMU.

Staffingsituation

Since independence in 1991, the Government has rapidly built up its workforce from a very low
base. Current data i s mostly only available on employees o f the MOH. With nearly 6,000 staff,
the Ministry o f Health is the largest employer of health workers. Other employers include the
Ministry of Defense, faith-based organizations and a small number o f non-govemment
organizations. The private-for-profit sector is relatively undeveloped.

* Ofthese 76 are expatriates

The majority o f trained healthworkers are low skilled (two years or less training) andAssociate
Nurses make up approximately 26% o f all trained staff. Doctor shortages are relieved by the use
o f expatriates who make up approximately 32% o f all doctors employed by the MOH. For a
country with a high maternal mortality rate, the 140 midwives (of which only 86 are located at
zoba level) are clearly inadequate to meet the workload. Regarding doctor and nurse to
population ratios, Eritrea ranks low in rest o f sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (41Stout o f 48 for
doctors and42ndout o f 47 for nurses andmidwives).

The majority o f formal healthworkers (69%) are working at primary care facilities. Referral
hospitals employ 26% o f staff, a 3% increase from 2003. Distribution of staff varies accordingto
zobas (see Table 2).

Little information i s available on staff performance, but the impression is one o f a motivated
workforce, but there is currently less assurance o f the quality o f its performance. Inaddition, at
the moment staff losses are relatively low, though it is uncertain how long this situation will
continue.

Professional staff are supported by an increasing number of non-formal andusually non-salaried
health care providers. At least 900 trained TBAs assist with antenatal care and deliveries33. The
malaria programme makes successful use o f over 2,000 Community Health Agents. The TB
programme is beginning to train and use TB promoters to help with DOTS.

Key challenges and current response
The major areas that needto be addressedrelating to the planning, management and
development o fhumanresources inthe health sector inEritrea are:

     1. The number o fstaff available to provide healthservices, especially inthe higher cadre
          categories (doctors, nurse midwives, etc.)
     2. The equitable distributiono f staff
     3. The quality andperformance of staff
     4. The capacity of the MOHandothers inthe sector to planfor, manage anddevelop
          appropriate staff to deliver the required health services.

A major constraint to expandingthe size o fthe healthworkforce to meet current andfuture needs
i s the training capacity. The Government i s addressing this challenge through various initiatives.

          It has recently established a medical school and currently has two batches of students
          enrolled.
          It is developing a college o f health sciences to upgrade skill levels o f health
          professionals.
          Training o f lower-level cadres is being decentralized to zoba level, thus increasing the
          catchment area for potential trainees.
          It has used bridging courses in the past to expand participation amongst groups that
          would not traditionally enter formal employment.
          Innovative forms o f training such as distance learning are being used and support from a
          number o f overseas institutions for curriculum development and the strengthening o f
          training.
          Individual programs have been providing much in-service training for specific skills,
          fundedby various programs including HAMSET.

Therefore, training output has been increasing and will continue to increase. However this has
been, to some extent, at the expense o f quality, as this expansion has been under resourced both
interms ofteaching staffandfacilities andequipment.

MOHstrategy

The MOH has started to develop Human Resources Strategic Plan. Work on this began with a
four-day retreat in April 2005 which was facilitated by technical assistance from the World
Bank. This work will continuewithwider stakeholders' involvement and the use ofstaffing data
for analysis and future projections over the coming months. The process has general support
across the sector andthe strategies so far developed are based on sound humanresource planning
and management principles. Leadership for development and implementation of the plan is the
responsibility o f the Research and Human Resource Development Department (R&HRDD)
department on behalf o f the Ministry o f Health. A system to manage staff performance through
individual annual appraisals has been developed and tested and is currently awaiting
implementation.

Donor support

Health human resources is supported by a number o f development partners including USAID,
WHO and the World Bank (through HAMSET and the Health Project) and others. Whilst there
are examples o f good initiatives to tackle the human resources challenges, these could have more
impact if they were better coordinated across the sector and more closely aligned to clear
strategic directions.

Approach of HAMSETI1

The human resource component o f HAMSET I1has been developed in tandem with the wider
HumanResources Strategic Plan and the Year 1action planis derived directly from this process.
Although the time frames differ by one year (the Human Resources Strategic Plan runs from
2006 to 2010), the overall objectives are virtually identical.

The aim of the HAMSET I1 Human Resources Component i s "to increase the number of
appropriately skilled, motivated and equitably distributed health service providers for Eritrea".
 This will be through the support for the development andimplementationo f the Strategic Planin
HumanResource for Health. The key areas which HAMSET I1will focus include:

    a   To develop a coordinated approach to human resources planning across the sector.
        This will include developing staffing targets based on an analysis o f existing staffing data
        and projections o f what i s feasible and desirable to support service needs. On this basis,
        the project will also support the finalization o f the Strategic Plan.

        T o increase numbers of staff in line with staffing targets developed. This will be
        done through expanding training output (increasing training places and numbers o f
        tutors). Efforts will be made to ensure training institutions are self-sufficient. A scheme
        to train and upgrade tutors will be developed and implemented. The project will support
        initiatives for (i)increasingnumber o f applicants for training courses and (ii)  improving
        ways o f attracting and retaining staff, in particular in the less well staffed remote rural
        areas.




                                                  95

0 To increase performance of existing and new staff. This will be achieved through
  improving the quality of pre-service training (improving curricula, facilities and
  equipment); improving the quality and cost effectiveness o f in-service training (program-
  specific components will be developing their own in-service training programs, but the
 humanresources component will aim to help coordinate these inputs); andbyproviding
  managers with tools and expertise for improving staff performance. Training materials
  (text books, learning equipments) for the training institutions will be procured.

0 To increase the capacity within the sector to plan for and manage human resources.
  This will be through general management development at all levels which will include
  the management o f staff. It will also include strengthening the capacity o f the R&HRD
  department in particular through the provision o f technical assistance and training in
  humanresourceplanningandmanagement related skills.

                              Annex 11: AnnualProgramReviews
 ERITREA: HIV/AIDS/STI, TB, Malaria andReproductiveHealthProject(HAMSET 11)

Rather than having each Partner have its own review processes and supervision missions, the
objective i s to have Joint Annual Program Reviews (JAPR), for the four HAMSET conditions,
led by the Ministry o f Health, supported by all interested partners, and carried out every year.
The JAPR will include the involvement and contributions from other ministries, civil society-
and faith-based organizations, communities andthe private sector. The JAPRbuilds on existing
and evolving approaches in Eritrea: the malaria control program has experience with this
modality and the HIV/AIDS program already has a detailed format for implementation support
for the national strategic plan. The purposes o f the JAPR are:


        0  First, to take stock o f the achievements of the Malaria, TB, HIV/AIDS and
           Reproductive Health programs during the previous year, as a necessary input for the
           preparation of the work plans, budgets and financing plan for the next year. Among
           the issues to be assessed i s the contribution to achievement o f the National Strategic
           Plan objectives, M & E indicators, results o f innovative projects and the Community
           Managed response, adequacy of institutional arrangements, evolving trends o f the
           epidemic inEritrea, best practices, innovations intreatment, lessons learned, etc.

           Second, to prepare the detailed workplans, budgets and procurement plan for the next
           fiscal year, based on achievements inthe preceding year.

The JAPR i s a management instrument, designed for both the Government and the partners, to
monitor progress in the implementation o f the programs and to verify that management and
policy responsibilities are met. Each year, it will focus on any priority area that may be selected
jointly bythe Government and the partners.

The JAPR will be carried out under the authority o f the Minister of Health. The preparation
process will start in October of each year and could include several steps: technical work, field
visits andpolicy dialogue. The actual meetingwill be heldbefore midDecember o f each year.

The format for the review will follow the national strategic plans for the different programs and
their related M&E frameworks, including reporting on progress inaddressing issues identified in
the previous year. The detailed annual workplans, budgets, expected results and/or targets will
follow the same format.

The issues identified in the Joint Annual Programme Review will form the agenda o f a policy
dialogue to take place from January each year onwards between the Government, partners and
other key stakeholders. Following the policy dialogue, the detailed workplans, budgets and
procurementplan for the following year will be finalized.

 ERITREA: HIV/AIDS/STI,TB, Malaria andReproductiveHealthProject(HAMSET 11)


Summaryof lessonsininstitutionalandimplementationarrangementsfromHAMSET

HAMSET I1 is built upon the existing implementation arrangements which have been
functioning satisfactorily for the duration of HAMSET. Lessons learnt from HAMSET include
the following:
     The multi-sectoral structure at the zoba level has been effective in galvanizing participation
     and commitment from various implementing agencies. However, implementers often lack the
     technical knowledge and information to adopt andimplement effective interventions.

..   The Ministry o f Healthis facing humanresource constraints at all levels.
      Supervision o f community subprojects andnon-health sector interventions has beenweak.
     Information flows on project activities are not consistent across implementing agencies and
      across the HAMSETdiseases.
      Community subprojects have been, in some cases, initiated and implemented by line
      ministries (notably the Ministryo f Local Government) on behalf o f communities.

Strategy and Oversight: Two high-level institutions have a strategic and oversight role inthe
control o fHAMSET diseases inthe country.

(i)TheNational HAMSET Steering Committee(NSC), chairedbythe Minister ofHealth,
provides strategic direction and approves the annual work program and budget o f the HAMSET
implementing partners. The Director General o f Health Services serves as secretary. Under
HAMSET 11, the NSC membership will include the Ministers o f Health, National Development,
Education, Defense, Labour andHumanWelfare as well as the six Zoba Administrators.

As a high level political and strategic body, the NSC can and should hold implementers
accountable for results. Under HAMSET I1the NSC will be strengthened in its oversight role,
and in holding implementers accountable to workprograms that are integrated and targeted
towards results. To this end, the type and quality o f reporting to the NSC will need to be revised
and made more results-oriented. The NSC will meet at least twice a year and share the minutes
o fkey issues discussed and agreed to all implementers and IDA.

(ii) GlobalFundCountry CoordinatingMechanism(CCM), chairedbythe Minister of
       The
National Development serves a similar function for the GFATMwork program inEritrea andhas
almost an identical composition- with the exclusion o f the Zonal Administrators and the
inclusiono fUNagencies34.




34  I t was felt by stakeholders during the MTRthat the two committees were appropriate for specific tasks, and
merging themwould not add value to either HAMSET or the GFATMwork program. Given that the membership is
 fairly similar, coordination will likely be de facto.


                                                          99

Implementation: The project will be implemented b the Ministry o f Health, selected non-
health line ministries, civil society organizations3< and community groups. A Project
Management Unit will facilitate the implementation o f the project. As a small country, Eritrea
has been very effective in decentralizing project implementation- with project Coordinating
committees (Technical and Steering) and Project Management Units represented at the central
and zoba levels. HAMSET I1 will build upon the strong implementation arrangements
established under HAMSET.

NationallevelCoordination& Implementation:

Project Management Unit: At the national level, a PMU which is accountable to the Minister o f
Health is responsible for various aspects o f project management such as financial management,
procurement andmanagement support to the implementing agencies. The PMU, under HAMSET
includes    a    Project     Director,    Program     Coordinator,       CHMRP           Coordinator       and  a
FinanciaVAdministrative Office with a senior Deputy Program Director, Procurement Officer,
and an Accountant. Under HAMSET 11, the project will recruit a Project Monitoring and
Evaluation Officer. The role o fthe PMUthus will be expanded to include project monitoring and
evaluation- compiling and reporting on the activities (outputs) from all implementing agencies
(particularly the multi-sectoral and community implementers). Reporting with simplified
Activity and Financial Management Reporting Forms will be compiled by the PMU and
submitted to the National Technical Committee. The PMU will also provide resources and
technical assistance inthe use o f innovative implementation tools, such as RRI, by implementers
at all levels.

Under HAMSET 11, the Community Managed HAMSET Response Program (CMHRP) will also
be managed from within the PMU. It is recognized that this is an unusual arrangement. To build
capacity within the Ministryo f Health, the PMU team responsible for the Community Managed
Response Program will establish close working relations with all o f the multi-sectoral
implementers andunits within the Ministry o f Health (including the HealthPromotion Unit).The
CMHRP unit will be managed by the PMUDirector and will be responsible for (i)                       ensuring that
the CMHRP activities comply with the Operational Manual, (ii)               providing technical guidance to
support targeted and effective community interventions, (ii)             collecting, compiling and sharing
information -with all implementing partners- on community activities, and (iv) supporting zoba
partners to identify and supervise community sub-projects.

National Technical Committee (NTC): i s the technical body responsible for reviewing plans and
activities of implementing partners and addressing strategic implementation and coordination
issues. The Director General o f Health Services o f the MOHchairs the N T C andthe PMUserves
as secretariat. Under HAMSET, the National Technical Committee (NTC) included key
implementing partners at the national level, and occasional participation o f the 6 Zoba Medical
Officers. In keeping with the need to target HAMSET interventions and streamline
implementationprocedures, the N T C for HAMSET I1will be downsized to fewer members, and
representatives to the NTC will be at least a Director General level. Under HAMSET 11,the NTC
will meet more regularly (at least quarterly) and be strengthened to support integrated planning


35Civil Society organizations refer to BIDOH(an organization o f PLWHA), NationalUnion o f EritreanWomen,
NationalUnion o f Eritrean Youth., NationalConfederation o f Workers and offices o f faith based organizations.

and supervision with a results focus- meaning that the activities within implementers' workplans
should be targeted to achieve agreed upon HAMSET results (outcomes).

To support the NTC inits mandate; a HAMSET Technical Working Group, comprising all o fthe
HAMSET focal persons in each o f the implementing agencies, with occasional participation o f
the Zoba Medical Offers, and will be expected to meet regularly (at least 6 times a year) to
ensure the smooth planning, implementation and monitoring o f activities. The Technical
Working Group i s expected to attend all N T C meetings, to support the members o f the NTC.

Non-Health Line Ministries and Civil Society Partners: As in HAMSET, the non-health
ministries and civil society partners will focus their activities on specific target groups (i.e.
National Association o f Eritrean Workers will focus on workers, Ministryo f Labour and Human
Welfare will focus on orphans and commercial sex workers, etc). In addition to implementing
their workprograms, multi-sectoral partners at the zoba level will have a role to play in
mobilizingand supporting CMHRP activities, as needed.

While all o f the multi-sectoral partners addvalue to the HAMSET I1project, some ministries and
partners such as the Ministryo f Defense, Ministry o f Education, Ministry o f Labour and Human
Welfare, and National Union o f Eritrean Women have more strategic roles to play. Other
implementing partners include BIDHO, National Confederation o f Eritrean workers, National
Union o f Eritrean Youth and Students, Ministry o f Local Government 11, Ministry o f
Information, Cultural Affairs Bureau, Faith Based Organizations, Ministry o f Transport and
Communication, and other partners that may become active duringthe life o fthe project.

Ministry of Health: Many o f the units o f the Ministryo f Health will be active inHAMSET 11,
and will be expected to (i)   implement health-sector HAMSET activities relating to HAMSET
diseases, (ii) carry out national monitoring and evaluation (Regulatory Dept.), and (iii)provide
technical guidance on non-health and community interventions,. Under HAMSET 11, attention
will be paid to strengthening the management o f disease programs and supporting broader
community participation. To improve program management, implementers within the Ministry
of Health will be able to access capacity building support for results based management, and
monitoring and evaluation (as supported under Component 4).

Zoba level Coordination and Implementation: HAMSET benefited from an extensive
decentralized system o f implementation arrangements, with most national coordinating, technical
andimplementing bodies beingrepresented at the Zoba level.



                                                101

Under HAMSET, a Zoba Steering Committee (ZSC) provided oversight and strategic direction
andwas ledby Zonal Administrators. The ZSC also approved zoba HAMSET budgets36.Under
HAMSET, only 3 Zobas had established a ZSC. Under HAMSET 11, maintaining or establishing
ZSC will be at the discretion o f the Zoba Administrators. If there is no ZSC, the hnctions o f
such a committee will be delegated to the Zonal Administrator who i s also encouraged to
convene ad hoc committees to support himher in this capacity. Membership o f such committees
may include heads o f departments, baito members (locally elected representatives), and/or civil
society organizations. The Zonal Administrators will be encouraged in HAMSET I1to guide
implementers in developing effective and integrated interventions. Inaddition to reviewing and
guiding integrated planning, the Zonal Administrator will also be encourage to hold Zoba level
implementers accountable to demonstrate the results (outcomes) o f their activities and
investments. Reporting on results and outcomes to the Zonal Administrator will be included as
part o fthe annual project cycle.

Zoba Technical Committee (ZTC) is chaired bythe Zoba Medical Officer andthe PMU serves as
secretary. It includes all HAMSET I1multi-sectoral and MOH implementers.                       However the
membership in the ZTC should be flexible and responsive to Zoba. In HAMSET, the Zoba
Medical Officer was overly burdened providing technical support to the ZTC and so under
HAMSET 11, the ZTC will be expanded to include more technical participation from the Zoba
Health Management Office (e.g. CDC Coordinator, Primary Health Officer, andM&E Officer).

The ZTC will be strengthened as the primary technical and coordinating body. They will be
responsible for (i)developing and supporting implementation o f Zoba level integrated
workplans- where all implementers plan their activities together to reach an agreed set o f
outcomes (these should be responsive to local targeting priorities as identified through highrisk
mapping and LQAS activities),             (ii)reviewing, approving and supervising community
subprojects, (iii)  reporting on HAMSET I1 activities to the Zoba Administrator (through the
PMU) as well as to their respective nationalbodies.

Zoba Project Management Units (ZPMU) report to the Zonal Administration (Zoba
Administrator's Office) and include a Project Officer (or Manager), CMHRP Facilitator and an
accountant. UnderHAMSET 11, the ZPMU will include an additional support staff (data entry or
secretary) and will be responsible for (i)supporting implementing agencies with project
management (Le. procurement, reporting, etc.), (ii)         coordinating capacity building activities for
non-health implementers and Community Management Teams, (iii)                coordinating programmatic
supervision and monitoring o f all implementers (with emphasis on community response), (iv)
carrying out Participatory M&E with Community Management Teams, and (iv) facilitating
information flows betweenZobas, andthe National Technical Committee.

Lessons from HAMSET suggest that the Zoba PMUCMHRP Facilitatorswere not being utilized
most effectively and in HAMSET I1 they will be re-trained in supervision and monitoring
(particularly inCDD approaches).




36The CMHRP budget is approved anddisbursed at the zoba level, whereas the Health, Multi-sectoral andPMU
budgets are submittedto the National Technical Committee for final approval.


                                                     102

Non-Health Line Ministries and Civil Society Partners: Multi-sectoral partners in HAMSET I1
will work with the Zoba Technical Committee (for local strategic and technical guidance) and
with their central ministry (for national priorities and sector specific guidance) to develop and
implement HAMSET workplans. Where community capacity is weak, it i s expected that multi-
sectoral partners will also provide facilitation support (in project preparation, etc.) to
communities. The Zoba Administration, which is considered one o f the multi-sectoral partners,
has a valuable role to play, with the Zoba PMU, in coordination between implementers and
outreach to communities.

Zoba Health Management Ofice: Inaddition to actively participating inthe ZTC, the units o f the
Zoba Health Management office (under the leadership o f the Zoba Medical Director) will be
coordinated to implement workplans that respond to local and national HAMSET priorities and
complement the activities on non-health and community implementers. The Primary Health Care
Officer and the to-be recruited M&E officers in each Zoba will be new players inHAMSET 11.
Where appropriate, emphasis will be placed on community participation- particularly through
sub-zoba health facilities. The Health Promotion Officer, through the BCC Peer Coordinators
supported by HAMSET37,have the additional functions o f (i)        coordinating the Behavior Change
Communication activities by establishing and facilitating Peer Groups and (ii)         providing, in
coordinationwith the ZPMU, support to the Community ManagedResponse Component.

Village Health Committees: operate at the village (kebabi) level and serve as interlocutors
between the zoba level and the community. Village Health Committees are flexible in structure
and usually comprise representative o f civil society organizations (Le. NUEW, NUEY, FBOs),
and community-based health agents (i.e. malaria agents, TB promoters) and community
members. Under HAMSET 11, the Village Health Committees will continue to play an important
role inidentifying andmobilizing communities to develop sub-projects.

Community Management Teams (CMT): comprise community members who plan, prepare and
implement subprojects for CMHRP. Under HAMSET 11, there will an emphasis on (i)              reaching
vulnerable groups and (ii)    scaling up and buildingupon the social capital o f BCC groups. These
C M T will benefit from additional capacity buildingunder HAMSET11.

Coordination between Implementing Agencies and Project Components: This is a priority
area for HAMSET 11, particularly to improve M&E and integration o f interventions. The
proposed improvements in Monitoring and Evaluation will require conducive implementation
arrangements. Strengthening both vertical coordination (from national to zone) as well as the
programmatic coordination (across components and Zobas) is important to minimize duplication
and maximize learning. While the HAMSET coordinating bodies such as NSC and N T C are
important, these should not replace the existing lines o f communication between levels- and all
HAMSET activities should be reported on within the appropriate sectors, as well as through
HAMSETmechanisms.

Multi-Sectoval Response (Component 1): In HAMSET 11, the multi-sectoral response
implementers will require technical support from the PMU and the MOH so that they can (i)


37As of 2005, there are 60 BCC Coordinatorsserving 15 Model Communities.Under HAMSET11,these willbe
scaledup.


                                                    103

make strategic use o f their comparative advantage, and (ii) activities that will target high
                                                              identify
risk groups with appropriate activities. Where community capacity is weak, multi-sectoral
implementers will also be partnersinmobilizing for CMHRP activities.

Health Sector Response (Component 2): The Ministry o f Health will need to work closely with
the PMU to integrate non-health and community interventions into the national HMIS system
andto ensure that epidemiological information gathered is effectively channeled to allpartners to
improve the quality o f targeting interventions. The M O H may wish to work with the PMU to
implement a system where local HAMSET priorities (and project outcomes) are communicated
as `Call for Proposals' that can help guide the activities o f multi-sectoral and community level
implementers.    In addition, the Health Promotion Unit will be tasked with supporting all
implementers, particularly at the community level, in developing appropriate integrated BCC
messages and interventions (that include Reproductive Health) and with monitoring the coverage
o fpeer-led BCC inhighrisk groups.

Community Response (Component 3): Given the emphasis in HAMSET I1 to focus on soft
interventions, particularly the scaling up o f BCC interventions, the CMHRP Program will be
closely linked with the Health Promotion Unit (inthe Ministry of Health) in terms of technical
guidance and supervision. To reach out to communities, the CMHRP unit will also need to rely
on the support on all Zoba level implementers (in the MOH, Ministry o f Local Government as
well as the multi-sectoral implementers) to help communities in identifying their sub-projects
andfacilitating their implementation(through technical support).

Project Coordination, capacity building and M&E (Component 4): (M&E i s discussed
separately in Annex 3). The Project Management Unit (at national and zoba level) will take
primary responsibility for this project management component. Project supervision, particularly
o f zoba level activities, was relatively weak in HAMSET. To improve this, under HAMSET 11,
the PMU(with additional staff support described above) inclose coordinationwith implementers
will support the (i)  implementation o f a more systematic MIS to track project activities/ outputs
and (ii) coordination o f more systematic supervision processes (utilizing integrated supervision
modalities already underway within the Ministry o f Health). The PMU will also be responsible
for making implementers aware o f available resources for (i)     innovation and research (Le. high
risk mapping exercise, Rapid Results Initiative) and (ii) related capacity building (i.e.
                                                              project
monitoring and evaluation, supervision skills,           results oriented management, financial
management etc.) with preference given to Zoba level implementers.

Planning: Under HAMSET 11, there will be an emphasis on integrated planning by all
implementers. For this to be effective, the project will emphasize the following: (i)All
implementers are provided with information- well in advance o f the planning cycle- on the
HAMSET priorities - and outcome targets (i.e. what are the expected outcomes after all o f the
plans have been implemented) - both nationally and by Zoba. (ii) Zoba level planning
                                                                       Before
commences, all Zoba level implementers are aware o f the priorities (and activities) o f their
central counterparts. (Given the planning cycle, it is likely that this may consist o f a strategic
document rather than a detailed workplan.) (iii)    The Technical Committees (at both levels) will
meet at least twice (ifnot more) during the planningprocess to ensure that proposed activities are
well integrated, reflect the local priorities andtargets, andmeet the proposal criteria and (iv) The

integrated workplans will be presented to the Zonal Administrator along with the expected
outcomes and the supervision and monitoring plan to measure progress. Plans should reflect
activities of all decentralized implementers (at zoba, sub-zoba andkebabi levels as appropriate).

             Annex 14: FinancialManagementandDisbursementArrangements
 ERITREA: HIV/AIDS/STI,TB, Malaria andReproductiveHealthProject(HAMSET 11)


This Annex summarizes the financial management arrangements in place for the proposed
Eritrea HIV/AIDS/STI, TB, Malaria and Reproductive Health (HAMSET 11) Project. The scope
o f the work i s set out in the "Assessment of Financial Management Arrangements in World
Bank-Financed Projects - Guidelines to Staf'     issued by the Financial Management Sector
Boardon October 15, 2003. Under the Bank's OPBP 10.02 with respect to projects financed by
the Bank,the Recipient and the project implementing agencies are required to maintain financial
management systems, including accounting, financial reporting, and auditing systems, adequate
to ensure that they can provide the Bank with accurate and timely information regarding project
resources and expenditures. The guidelines issued by the Bank's Operations Policy and Country
Services regarding Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs)             require adequate financial
management arrangements, including the ability to produce timely FMRs, to be in place by
effectiveness.

HAMSET I1 Project will use the existing HAMSET institutional framework as well as
arrangements in place for procurement and financial management. The coordination, planning,
financial management, and procurement at national level will be the responsibility o f the Project
Management Unit (PMU) set up for the Health Sector Project, the IDA credit which closed on
December 30, 2004.      The PMU is now responsible for the implementation o f the current
HAMSET Project.        The two projects, Health and HAMSET, shared the same control
environment inthe area o f financial management, beingmanaged by the same implementing unit
and subject to the same control mechanisms; similar arrangements will be used for both the
ongoing HAMSET as well as the proposedHAMSET I1project.

A financial management review of the current HAMSET project was carried out in February
2004 as part o f the ongoing implementation support. Project management had indicated their
desire for the HAMSET project to convert from the traditional transaction-based disbursement to
the more streamlined report-based disbursement. The review therefore focused on making a
determination as to whether the financial management arrangements in place met the Bank's
criteria for report-based disbursement.  To be eligible, the project needed to meet stringent
conditions set by IDA, including an adequate financial management system capable o f producing
FMRs. The project met the requirements, the only one to do so inthe Bank's Eritrea portfolio,
andnow benefits from the flexibility provided under the report-based disbursement mechanism.

A further financial management review was carried out in December 2004 to assess the
appropriateness o f the arrangements in place for the implementation o f both the Health and
HAMSET projects. The Health project's IDA credit was closing on December 31, 2004 and the
work was part of the Implementation Completion Review; the HAMSET project was undergoing
a mid-term review. The conclusion was that both projects were well managed in the area o f
financial management, thanks to the tremendous effort o f the project management, as well as the
accounting staff.    This in tum has had positive results in record keeping including the
enhancement o fthe projects' computerized accounting systems.


                                              107

 The conclusion is that the current financial management arrangements for the HAMSET project
 meet the minimum requirements to comply with the Bank's OPBP 10.02. These arrangements
 will need to be applied to the proposed project to achieve this, and an action planis included at
 the end o fthis annex.

 RiskAssessment

 The risk ratings below are showing low to medium, reflecting the sound financial management
  arrangements built up over the period o f implementing the Health and HAMSET projects.
 Capacity and experience at central level is already inplace to address identifiedweaknesses and
 provide the necessary expertise during project implementation. Mitigating factors to address
 identified risks are noted below. In addition, an action plan will be agreed with the project
 management to ensure that financial management arrangements are in place during the
 implementation o f the HAMSET I1Project.

  Country-Specific

  A Country FinancialAccountability Assessment (CFAA) has not yet beencarriedout. However,
  a number of other pieces o f diagnostic work have been carried out inrecent years and include a
  Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) and a Country Procurement Assessment Review
  (CPAR). Both o f these have dwelt on the limited capacity inthe country both in the public as
  well as private sector.  This is especially the case in the area o f accounting and financial
  management where there is no established accountancy profession and only a limited number o f
  professionally qualified accountants. The unresolved conflict with Ethiopia has had a further
  negative impact on the economic environment as well as the implementation capacity.

E ntity-Specific

The project will be implementednationally inall six zobas andthe implementationarrangements
will mirror those o fthe current HAMSET project, which have functioned satisfactorily. Overall,
a suitable environment exists for the proper operation o f the project: there i s support for a culture
o f accountability in Government, and staff are dedicated, committed and have a clear sense o f
responsibility. A PMU is in place for the sole purpose o f managing the implementation o f the
project.    This is staffed with a core team o f experienced professionals and is a sign o f
commitment on the part o f the Government to, as far as possible, remove any impediments to the
smooth implementation o f the project. The use o f a project-specific financial management and
accounting system also addresses the weak financial management and accounting environment
currently inthe public sector.

Project Specific

The project will be implemented by a number o f agencies o f varying degrees o f capability. The
project also involves numerous small transactions.       There i s therefore a need for effective
coordination by the PMU o f these agencies, especially on the use and accounting for the use o f
funds. A number o f lessons have been learnt from the implementation o f the HAMSET project
which will be brought to bear on the new project. This includes improving the monitoring and
evaluation function, o f which financial information will be a key input. The PMU will support
additional supervision and guidance activities, at both central and zoba-level, including clear
guidelines and definition o f roles o f the PMU, its staff and relationships to other agencies and
units.

Implementing Entity

HAMSET I1 will be managed by the PMU established within the Ministry o f Health, and
responsible for the implementation o f the current HAMSET project. The use o f an existing unit
i s justified because staff i s already in place and has gained experience over the years in the
implementation o f projects o f such nature, and also in the Bank's procurement, disbursement,
accounting and auditing arrangements. The PMUis headed by a Project Director supported by a
Finance and Administration Manager, Procurement Officer, and Accountant. In addition, the
PMUis supported by a network o fzobaPMUsproviding management support at the local level.

Funds Flow

RegardingIDA andthe State o f Eritrea funding, the PMUwould maintainthree bank accounts at
head office: a Special Account with the Bank o f Eritrea in United States Dollars to which the
proceeds from the IDA grant would be deposited; an account in local currency with a
commercial bank to which draw downs from the Special Account would be credited for project
financing and administrative expenses; and an account inlocal currency with the Bank o f Eritrea
to which counterpart funding by the Government would be deposited in respect o f any
expenditures o fthe project that may be provided for inthe financing agreement.




                                                 109

Transfers o f funds to the zobas and sub-zobas, as well as for activities to be carried out at
national level by implementing agenciedministries will be in the form o f advances based on
approved work plans. Fundingwould only commence once a bank account solely for project use
has been opened and successive advances would only be made after accounting for previous
advances. Once the necessary documentation is reviewed and approved by the PMU, funds will
be transferred to the zoba accounthmplementing agency's account. Details on surrender o f
advances issued to the zobashmplementing agencies, and accountability o f the funds i s
documented inthe Financial Procedures Manual.



The current staff complement o f the Finance department o f the PMU comprise a Financial and
Administration Manager; a Procurement Officer; and an Accountant. There is also an accountant
forming part o f the zoba PMU. The levels and numbers o f staff would need to be determined
taking into account the added responsibilities arising from the proposed project. Varying levels
of training would be required in financial management and disbursement, information systems
andcomputer applications; andprocedures relatingto utilization o f funds.

Accounting Policies and Procedures

The PMU has a written manual o f financial procedures that describes the accounting system,
intemal control procedures, basis o f accounting, standards to be followed, and policies and
procedures that guide activities o f the current HAMSET and ensure staff accountability. These
policies andprocedures have been adequate and have satisfactorily served the implementationo f
the current project; however, these will need to be updatedto reflect the specific requirements o f
the proposed project.

Internal Audit

The PMU has an intemal audit unit. The extent to which this unit is being used beyond routine
pre and post-auditing o fpayment vouchers will need to be determined.

External Audit

The Project would be a Government program and the Office o f the Auditor-General is mandated
to audit all Government programs, irrespective o f the sources o f funding. In general, the
Auditor-General has always sub-contracted this responsibility inrespect o f donor funded projects
and the indications are that this would be the case for this project as well.       In due course,
therefore, the PMU in consultation with the Auditor-General and IDA would appoint
independent auditors in compliance with the financial covenants that would be contained in the
IDAgrant agreement.

The audit work would be modeled on the new "Guidelines - Annual Financial Reporting And
Auditing For World Bank-Financed Activities issued by the Bank on June 30, 2003. This will
                                                 "
take advantage o f the use o f a single audit opinion and other flexibility provided under the new
guidelines. The following audit reports would be requiredto be submitted to the Bank:



                                                 110

Management Letter                              Six months after each fiscal year end

Reporting and Monitoring

The financial transactions relating to this operation would be recorded and monitored using a
project-specific computerized financial management and accounting system. The Finance and
Administration Manager would determine: the project's Chart o f Accounts as well as the format
and content o f quarterly reports and annual financial statements; the selection and adoption o f
accounting policies and accounting standards; and the need to include any supplementary notes
to the project financial statements inorder to enhance the presentation o f a "true andfair view ".

Subject to a decision being made, these reports would include financial statements (e.g. sources
and application of funds; expenditure classifiedby project components, disbursement categories,
expenditure types, and comparison with budgets). The reports would closely follow sample
formats that are given in the World Bank's `%i`nancial Monitoring Reports for World Bank-
Financed Projects: Guidelines for Borrowers ", copies o f which have already been made
available to PMU management. Similar reports are already being prepared on regular basis for
the current HAMSET project, bothfor monitoring as well as disbursement purposes.

Information Systems

The HAMSET project's financial management and accounting system i s sound and well
maintained. The system is capable o f and does in fact produce FMRs regularly. The system is
also capable o f producingannual financial statements fairly quickly after the end o f the year, and
the project continues to be one o f the first on the Bank's Eritrea portfolio to submit audited
financial statements to the Bank.

The accounting system is computerized using FINPRO accounting software and was recently
upgraded by the software vendor. However, the new version had not yet gone live at the time o f
review in December 2004 and was being tested in parallel with the current (old) version. This
meant that the enhanced features o f the new system were yet to be realized. There was need to
fully test the new system to obtain optimal performance so that anyproblems were identified and
rectified inreadiness for going live.

Disbursement Arrangements

The current HAMSET project meets the eligibility criteria for report-based disbursement
method, which includes an adequate financial management system capable o f producing FMRs.
Projects that meet these criteria still have a choice o f transaction-based disbursement, with the
FMRs being used only for reporting purposes, or report-based disbursement. The PMU
management already made a choice with regardto the disbursement method to be adopted under
HAMSET 11.

Next Steps

Detailed below are issues that will need to be addressed to cater for the proposed project.

   0  Determine the levels and numbers o f accounting staff for the proposed project both at
      head office and zobas;

   0  Establish a financial managementand accounting system, including a Chart o f Accounts,
      for the project.   The PMU would set up and maintain a separate, project-specific
      accounting, budgetary and financial management system. This would take the form o f
      computerized accounting software usingthe existing accounting software;


   0  Develop formats and contents o f the various periodic reports to be generated from the
      computerized financial management and accounting system. The financial reports should
      include quarterly management reports to monitor project performance; annual financial
       statements detailing sources and uses o f funds by expenditure, and comparison with
      budgets;


   0  Update the Financial Procedures Manual documenting the operations o f the financial
       management system for the proposedproject inso far as these are not already reflectedin
       the existing manual; and

                            Annex 15: ProcurementArrangements
 ERITREA: HIV/AIDS/STI,TB, Malaria andReproductiveHealthProject(HAMSET 11)

General

Procurement for the proposedproject would be carried out inaccordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated M a y 2004; and
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated M a y
2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The various items under different
expenditure categories are described in general below. For each contract to be financed by the
Grant, the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for pre-
qualification, estimated costs, and time frame are agreed between the Borrower and the Bank in
the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as required to
reflect the actualproject implementationneeds and improvements ininstitutional capacity.

ProcurementofWorks

Works procured under this project will consist o f minor renovations o f Health and Education
facilities including: selected health centers, Assab M C H electrical works; Maekel School;
Mendefera School; Ghindae School and the existing CNHT. All these renovations are expected
to cost less than US$ 150,000 per contract and they will be procured through shopping where
quotations will be sought from at least three reputable small contractors, or through community
participation. Any works estimated to cost more than US$lOO,OOO will be procured through
National Competitive Bidding. The procedures to be used for N C B and shopping, as well as
community based procurement will be described in the Procurement Manual which will be
prepared for use by beneficiaries and relevant stakeholders. A draft o f the manual has been
submitted to the Bank and comments made.           As far as Standard Bidding Documents are
concerned, the current SBD for NCB will need to be revised to make it consistent with the new
(May 2004) Guidelines. The revised SBD will be reviewed by the Bank. Inremote areas where
private sector contractors are few or not available at all, direct contracting or force account may
be used.

Procurementof Goods

Goods procured under this project would mainly include drugs; medical supplies and equipment;
mosquito bed nets; computers; office equipment and supplies; books; and motor vehicles. The
goods will be procured using procedures described in the HAMSET I1procurement manual.
Since most o f the goods to be procured would be imported, the threshold for ICB has been set
fairly low, at US$150,000. Procurement o f imports will be carried out at central level by the
PMU. In the case o f medical supplies and equipment, procurement will be carried out in
coordination with PHARMACOR. A I D S i H N related drugs and long lasting treated mosquito
nets may be procured through International Limited Bidding (LIB) since only a limited number
o f bidders can supply the WHO approved drugs and nets needed for the project Contracts
estimated to cost less than US$150,000 may be procured usingNCB. Contracts estimated to cost
US$75,000 and less may use the Shopping method or IAPSO. Other specialized UN agencies
such as UNICEF may also be used for procurement o f medical supplies. Direct contracting may


                                               113

be used when it can be justified that a competitive method would not yield better value for
money.

ConsultingServices andTraining

Consulting services to be procured under this project would include various studies and training
in the different components. Ingeneral, large consulting assignments will be managed by the
PMU and awarded under "Quality and Cost based selection" (QCBS) procedures with the
exception o f assignments o f a standard or routine nature such as audit assignments, design o f
non-complex works, etc. where well established practices and standards exist. For these least
cost selection (LCS) will be used. The bulk (in number) o f the consulting contracts will be
relatively simple assignments below the threshold for prior review, carried out at regional level
by different organizations under two o f the major components o f the project: the Community
Managed HAMSET Response Program (CMHRP) and the Multi-sectoral response program.
Consulting firms for services estimated to cost more than US$lOO,OOO would be selected through
QCBS. Consulting firms for services estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO may be selected
usingthe consultant's qualification method. Individual consultants will be selected on the basis
o f their qualifications in accordance with the Procurement Manual. Single source selection may
be used where it can be justified. Short lists o f consultants for services estimated to cost less
than $100,000 equivalent per contract may be composed entirely o f national consultants in
accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 o f the Consultant Guidelines. Inthe event that
there i s a need, for capacity reasons, UN agencies and NGOs could be selected to assist where
they have advantage over commercial firms.

Operating Costs:         The operating costs for HAMSET I1 shall consist o f office supplies,
operation and maintenance costs for vehicles and equipment, communication charges and utility
expenses among others. These will be procured using the procedures described in the
Procurement Manual.

Others: The procurement procedures and SBDs to be used for each procurement method, as
well as model contracts for works and goods procured, are presented inthe Procurement Manual,
currently under preparation.

Assessment of the agency's capacityto implementprocurement

Procurement under HAMSET I1will be carried out at three levels: centrally bythe national PMU
in the Ministry of Health; regionally by the regional PMUs and at community level by the
community management teams. An assessment o f the capacity o f the Implementing Agencies to
implement procurement actions at national and regional levels has been carried out in April
2005. The assessment reviewed the national procurement environment, organizational structure
for implementing the project and the interaction between the project's staff responsible for
procurement and for administration and finance. The key issues and risks concerning
procurement for implementation of the project have been identified and are discussed in the
following paragraphs. The corrective measures, which have been agreed are described in the
Action Plan.

Country Procurement Environment

A CountryProcurement Assessment (CPAR) was completedinJune 2002 and areport submitted
to the Government. The report incorporated an action plan for implementing recommendations
for reforming the procurement system in Eritrea. An IDF grant was approved in May 2003 to
assist the Government inimplementing these reforms. The expected outputs o f the IDF grant are
procurement legislation; procurement regulations, standard bidding documents; and guidelines
for establishing an institutional framework which is not adequate at the moment and needs
improvement. One o f the main findings o f the CPAR i s lack o f procurement capacity inEritrea.
A joint CPPR exercise conducted in December o f 2004 also confirmed that the overall
procurement capacity in Eritrea is still weak, especially at the Regional level, due to lack o f
skilled procurement staff. The CPPR identified four well performing IDA projects o f which
HAMSET i s one. HAMSET i s being implemented by a PMUwhich was initially established to
implement the HealthProject. The PMUhas therefore acquired a lot o f experience.

Since the recommendations o f the CPAR are still being implemented, an appropriate legal and
regulatory fi-amework, an acceptable procurement Regulations and Procedures and national
standard bidding documents are under development. HAMSET uses the Bank's SBDs for I C B
and a standard bidding document has been approved by the Bank for NCB. HAMSET I1will
continue using the Bank's SBDs for ICB contracts but for NCB a new SBD will have to be
prepared by the PMUand submitted to the Bank for review because the current SBD i s based on
the old Guidelines while HAMSET I1will use the new (May 2004) Guidelines. The same is true
for the Procurement Manual.

Institutional arrangements at central level

As mentioned above, HAMSET I1is a direct continuation o f two previous health sector projects
inEritrea, the Health and HAMSET projects. The proposed HAMSET I1project will therefore
be able to count on a well experienced PMU. The PMUconsists o f a coordinator and specialists
for different sectors (procurement, engineering, financial management and M&E) working
closely with a procurement agent, PHARMACOR which assures quality control on medical
supplies and equipment. In the case o f civil works the PMU, through its engineering staff
receives technical support fi-omthe Ministry o f Public Works. The PMUhas also close ties with
other relevant Ministries such as the Ministry o f Local Government and its six Regional
Administrations (which assist in the supervision at regional level) and Ministry o f Defense
(Medical services).

Staffing The PMU has a procurement office supervised by the Deputy Director in charge of
procurement, finance and administration. The office has acquired experience and implemented
HAMSET successfilly but still needs to be strengthened through continuous training in works,
consultancy and medical supplies. Inorder to promote clarity inthe roles and responsibilities o f
the staff who are involved inthe procurement process, terms o f reference have been included in
the OperationalManual.




                                               115

Institutional arrangements at regional level

Part o f the procurement will be carried out at regional level by participating agencies (PA) based
on a list of requirements and implementation schedule to be verified and agreed with the P M U
before the start o f the activity. There are no procurement specialists at the regional level;
procurement at this level, including Community sub-projects, would be based on simple
procurement methods and procedures. Procurement at this level i s carried out by purchasers in
Ministries after approval o f the evaluation report by the purchasing committee. These methods
and procedures will be described in the Procurement Manual, which is part o f the Operational
Manual, andwhich will be reviewed by the Bank.

Procurement Plan

The Recipient, at appraisal, developed a procurement plan for project implementation which
provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan was agreed between the Recipient and
the Project Team before negotiations and i s available at HAMSET's PMU offices inAsmara. It
will also be available in the project's database and in the Bank's external website. The
Procurement Plan will be updated inagreement with the Project Team annually or as required to
reflect the actual project implementationneeds and improvements ininstitutional capacity.

Frequency of Procurement Supervision

Inadditionto the prior review supervision, the capacity assessment ofthe ImplementingAgency
recommended supervision missions to visit the field to carry out post review o f procurement

                             Annex 16: Economic and FinancialAnalysis
 ERITREA: HIV/AIDS/STI, TB, Malaria andReproductiveHealth Project (HAMSET 11)

This proposed project is a follow-on to the ongoing HAMSET project in Eritrea. Detailed
economic and financial analysis has been conducted by the HAMSET project. The Multi-
Country HIV/AIDS Program (MAP) for the Africa Region also carried out an integrated
economic analysis on the MAP projects (Report No. 20727 AFR). This Annex provides (i)                         a
brief summary o f the economic rationale for investing in the HAMSET diseases and
reproductive health, based on previous analysis and evidence from literature; and (ii)financial     a
analysis on the fiscal impact o fthe project.

Economic rationale

The project will have positive effects on the country's economic growth,poverty alleviation and
cost-effective use of resources.

Economic growth: the adverse effect o f HAMSET diseases andreproductive healthproblems on
economic growth i s well documented. It i s estimated that an HIV/AIDS epidemic can reduce
GDPby up to 1.0 percent per year38;andmalaria by 1.3 percent per year3'. The potential cost of
lost productivity due to TB i s of the order of 4 to 7 percent o f GDP globally4'.                  Sexual and
reproductive health problems currently account for 18 percent o f the total global burden of
diseases and 32 percent o f the burden among women o f reproductive age41, which has become a
major barrier to economic development.

After gaining independence from Ethiopia in 1993, Eritrea went through a period o f rapid and
stable economic growth from 1993 to 1997, with an annual GDP growth rate averaging 7.4
percent. When the border war with Ethiopia broke out in 1998, GDP growth declined to less
than 1 percent in 1999 (IMF, 2001). An estimated 75 percent decline in crop production
combined with the destruction and loss o f physical capital caused a 9 percent decline inGDP in
2000. Currently, the economy is in a recovery mode and facing many challenges, including
recurrent droughts. Tackling of the HAMSET diseases and reproductive health problems will
improve the productivity o f the country's work force and give a boost to economic growth.

Poverty alleviation: Eritrea remains one o f the poorest countries in the world with an annual
Gross National Income per capita o f US$180 and 66 percent o f the population living inpoverty.
L o w income has constrained households from investing in optimal amounts o f health care.
Consequently, the poor, especially those living inrural areas, suffer the worst health problems.
One o f the great challenges facing Eritrea's efforts to alleviate poverty i s a high Burden o f
Disease (BOD) from communicable and preventable diseases.                        Around 71 percent o f the

country's BODis due to communicable diseases. Based on facility-based data, the top causes o f
adult mortality were the consequences o f HN/AIDS, TB and Malaria. This has resulted in a
tremendous loss o f productivity and opportunities, andhas created a vicious cycle o f poor health
and poverty. Investing inthe HAMSET diseases and reproductive health can ease the adverse
impact o f income inequalities. Malaria, TB and reproductive health problems are particularly
associated with low income levels because the poor have limited access to health services,
information andprotective measures. Although there i s no evidence to suggest that HIV/AIDS i s
disproportionately affecting the poor, the poor are the least able to bear the significant costs o f
treatment and the corresponding loss o f income resulting from sickness and death. By focusing
on these diseases or problems particularly affecting the poor, this project expects to ease the
burden o f diseases and to contribute to the country's poverty alleviation efforts.

Cost-effective use of resources: Investing inHIVIAIDS, malaria, TB and reproductive health i s
                                      .
proven to be cost-effective. The World Bank's 1993 World Development Report42presented an
"essential health package" that would make the most efficient use o f scarce health resources.
Prevention andtreatment o f HIV/AIDS/STI, malaria, andTB as well as maternal health care and
family planning are key elements o fthe package due to their highcost-effectiveness. An overall
economic assessment on HIV/AIDS carried out under the Multi-Country H N / A I D S Program
(MAP) indicates significant net economic benefits o f investing in HIV/AIDS with an internal
rate of return at around 30 percent'. The cost-effectiveness o f investing inmalaria control can be
an impressive US$2,672 per life saved or US$69 per Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY)43.
WHO estimates that every dollar invested in the TB DOTS program would lead to a US$55
return to the count$.     A recent UNFPA report claims that investing insexual andreproductive
health can result innot only the direct medical benefits but also tremendous economic and social
benefits4.

Based on the evidence above, the economic benefits o f the proposed project are manifold: (i)              it
would directly and indirectly help to improve Eritrea's macroeconomic situation and to boost
economic growth; (ii)      it would reduce the country's major burden o f disease; (iii) would       it
improve the country's human capital by reducing the risks imposed on the most productive
segment o f the population; and (iv) it would likely generate a high rate o f return from the
investment.

Financial analysis

The total cost o f the proposed project is US$ 26.5 million, including US$ 24 million grant from
IDA (90%), US$ 2 million from the Government o f Eritrea (2%), and US$0.5 million from the
community's contribution (2%).

The distribution o f project resources reflects a strategy of prioritizing software over hardware.
Civil works represent a very small fraction o f the total budget at 4 percent, covering only the
renovation o f existing facilities. No new construction is planned. The largest budget goes to a
software category-including      training, workshops, studies, and consultant services-accounting
for about 36 percent of the total project budget. Goods and equipment (including drugs,
condoms, bednets etc.) are the second largest expenditure category, with a share of 29 percent o f
the total project resources.

Although this is a repeater project and implementation systems in the country are well
established, the project plans to disburse only US$ 3.7 million (14 %) inthe first year (FY2006)
to avoid a heavy fi-ont-load and to allow some time for the country to implement the new
activities inHAMSET 11, such as reproductive health andhumanresources.

The proposed project will minimize counterpart funding inorder to ease the fiscal burden on the
country. The Government will only cover duties and taxes incurredby the project (about US$ 1
million) and part o f the operating costs, mainly salaries (about US$ 1million). The community
contributions o f US$ 0.5 million (about 15 percent o f the community sub-grants) are mostly in
the form o f in-kindmaterials and labor.

The above financial arrangements were made inorder to accommodate and reflect the country's
macroeconomic context, to ensure smooth implementation, and to sustain the impact o f the
project activities inthe longer term.

Eritrea is a country with a difficult macroeconomic situation andthe intensifying border situation
with Ethiopia casts many uncertainties on the country's economic growth. The country's total
debt reached 1.4 percent o f its total GDP in 200244. The difficult macroeconomic situation has
restricted the country from spending sufficient resources on health. Based on an estimate by
UNDP, public expenditure on health was only 3.7 percent of the total GDP in 200145. At this
time, Eritrea has not yet established its National Health Accounts; no detailed data on health
spending are available. WHO has estimated that Eritrea's total health spending was US$ 9 per
capita in2000. Ofthis, public expenditure was estimated at US$6 per capita. The largest project
disbursement i s expected in the second year o f the project at about US$ 7.2 million, which is
equivalent to 27 percent of the annual public spending on health in Eritrea (if the WHO-
estimated 2000 spending level persists). Therefore, the fiscal impact o f the proposed project is
likelyto be significant.

The recurrent cost required after the project support is estimated at about US$ 1.4 million, which
includes maintenance, supervision, continuation of training activities, etc.         Although this
recurrent cost amount i s small in absolute terms, it is not trivial when compared with the total
recurrent expenditure o f the MOH in 2004, which is only US$ 9 million. In principle, the
Government is expected to assume the responsibility for sustaining the project activities. During
negotiations, it was agreed that a plan to ensure sustainability after project implementation would
be prepared.

Despite the difficult situation facing the country, the health sector has shown good absorptive
capacity and a good track record o f project implementation. The HAMSET project invested a
total of US$ 50 million, twice the size o f the proposed HAMSET I1project. The HAMSET
funds will be fully disbursed before its closing date o f March 2006; it has become a star
performer among the Bank's projects inthe country and the MAP projects inthe Afiica region.
Inaddition, the project team andGoEhave initiateddialogue with other donors andthe GFATM
to harmonize support to project activities and coordinate efforts for sustainability.

 ERITREA: HIV/AIDS/STI,TB, Malaria andReproductiveHealthProject (HAMSET11)


The proposedproject has been classified as a category "B" for environmental screening purposes
given the risks associated with the handling and disposal o f medical wastes. As a repeater
project, HAMSET I1will make use o f the existing arrangements for addressing safeguard issues
which have been successfully implementedunder HAMSET. A Health Care Waste Management
Plan (HCWMP) and an Environmental Assessment (EA) for insecticides were developed and
approved by IDA under HAMSET. Both documents were re-disclosed inEritrea and at the Bank
InfoShop prior to Appraisal o f HAMSET 11.

Environmental Assessment

MOH has complied with the recommendations made by the EA. Under HAMSET, an EA was
undertaken to review elements o f the National Malaria Control Program that might lead to
negative environmental impact unless properly planned and managed, namely the use o f
chemicals. A Pesticide Management Plan (PMP) was prepared following the EA conclusions
and recommendations. It has been determined that the EA adequately discusses pesticide use
andmanagement issues and mitigation measures. Inlieu o fpreparing a new vector control plan,
the project re-disclosed the EA anduse provisions o fthe same instrument as guidance.

The proposed project will finance insecticides for malaria control activities, although the overall
use will be relatively small (e.g. for impregnation o f bed nets) and only safe compounds
approved by the World Health Organization Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) will be
used, namely temphos (a larvicide) andpyrethroid. DDT will not be procuredunder the project

Health Care Waste Management Plan

The HCWMP has been under implementation since October 2004. The Ministry o f Health has
established a task force to ensure dissemination o f the HCWMP as well as compliance by all
health facilities in the country with day-to-day implementation being the responsibility o f the
Environmental HealthUnit inthe Ministry o f Health.

Supervision o f HAMSET confirmed that the two regional hospitals financed by IDA were in
compliance with HCWMP requirements           A successful Rapid-Results Initiative to improve safe
injection practices and management o f sharps and medical waste has been scaled up to referral
hospitals infive out o f six zobas.

The HCWMP provides recommendations for the improvement o f HCWMP within the healthcare
facilities o f the country. It also contains a National H C W M plan to be implemented by MOH.
The Action Plancontains the following actions according to objective:

IDA'SSupervision Plan

The supervision and implementation support o f the proposedproject will be conducted from the
World Bank Asmara office, the Nairobi office, and from Headquarters. As under HAMSET, it
will include other development partners involved in the fight against HAMSET diseases in
Eritrea. Partners will be invited to participate in the implementation support missions to ensure
the complementarity o f interventions, foster strong partnerships, and facilitate cross-fertilization
o f experiences. Other HD Bank staff visiting the region may also provide implementation
support, inparticular staff working on other HD sector projects inEritrea (e.g., IntegratedEarly
Child Development Project, and Education).

The project will require intensive supervision given its fast-track preparation, innovative
approach, its multi-sector and multi-agency nature, the wider span o f activities than a regular
MAP,andto provide guidance onanyrevisionsto the institutional arrangements.

Inparticular, M&E needs attention due to its mixed progress under HAMSET. Therefore, the
finalization and implementation o f a national M&E framework and system will require
substantial technical support, and will require significant implementation support from M&E
technical experts. The project will continue addressing the HAMSET diseases, and will expand
by allocating substantial resources to addressing reproductive health (RH). RH indicators in
Eritrea are abysmal, while other health indicators are encouraging. Therefore, an RH specialist
will provide extensive support inorder that this component receives the same level o f attention
duringsupervision as the other HAMSET diseases. TB also needs close implementationsupport,
as progress could have been better under HAMSET The community and public sector response
will adopt a more targeted and focused approach, in order to provide much needed support to
vulnerable populations. This new approach will also require assistance, making sure that access
criteria are developed ina participatory andtransparent manner, and enabling the Government to
allocate scarce resources where they will achieve the most impact.

It is envisioned that two (2) implementation support missions will take place annually (typically
inJanuary andJuly ) andthat the January visit willbe to undertake the annualjoint Government
and development partners review.     .Technical   experts will on an ad hoc basis and depending on
the need, visit Eritrea to provide technical support. Procedures for IDA supervision will follow
the recommendations o f the CPPR.

Multipleskills for supervision will be needed on a regular basis, while others will be requiredon
an ad hoc basis. A core supervision team will comprise staff addressing the major interventions
financed by the project. The core team will include the following: i)TTL; ii)malaria expert; iii)
TB specialist; iv) RHexpert; v) HIV/AIDS specialist; vi) the community response specialist; vii)
financial management specialist; viii) procurement specialist; ix) humanresources specialist; x)
andM&E specialist. Non-core members, or technical experts that will be required on an ad hoc
basis include: i)implementation specialist; ii)M&E (for specific aspects, such as MIS, LQAS,
etc.); iii)BCC/communications; and iv) other related HD sector specialists.
