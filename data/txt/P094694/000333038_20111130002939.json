for the Second HIV/AIDS/STI,\n            Tuberculosis, Malaria, and Reproductive Health (HAMSET II)\n            Project for Eritrea were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, Bank performance was satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: value of repeater projects. Because the\n            first HAMSET project \"invested\" substantially in\n            establishing guidelines and processes and policies, HAMSET\n            II could use existing systems (and improve them), putting\n            the project on a fast-track to realizing gains. Also,\n            because the repeater followed so quickly on the previous\n            project, the government and Bank team were also able to\n            build on the momentum and cumulative experience of the first\n            project's implementation. Bank and client working\n            together as partners during project preparation improves the\n            quality of implementation. This helped to ensure that the\n            project was appropriately designed, feasible, understood by\n            all stakeholders, and owned. In the words of the client:\n            'implementation is easy when you understand it from the\n            beginning'. Continuity of staff and systems in the PMU\n            makes a difference: By HAMSET II close, most staff in the\n            Project Management Unit (PMU) had worked together on HAMSET\n            projects for 10 years. They were very familiar with Bank\n            processes, had honed their own operational skills and\n            procedures, and had become a closely-knit and effective\n            team. There was continuity between the staffing of HAMSET\n            and HAMSET II, with both Task Team Leaders (TTLs) of HAMSET\n            II preparation having led or worked on HAMSET. This\n            contributed to a high degree of trust and ease between Bank\n            and client. The project was implemented using a step-wise\n            approach where annual work plans and budgets were set based\n            on a review of the previous year's activities and\n            performance. This gave the borrower more flexibility to\n            respond to changing conditions and resolve problems as they\n            arose, thus also mitigating risk. The project set long-term\n            objectives to guide implementation, but planned activities\n            over the short-term."}, "docdt": "2010-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
