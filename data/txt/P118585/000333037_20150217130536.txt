2. CONTEXT

5.     The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to prepare the Ghana Statistical Service
(GSS) for institutional reform and to ensure timely and extensive analysis and dissemination
of census data.

6.          The project components are:

     (i)       Legal and institutional reform – financing legal and institutional reform at the
               GSS to promote statistical production and coordination across the National
               Statistical System (NSS);
     (ii)      GSS capacity building – finance strengthening of the capacity of GSS requiring
               both long term technical assistance and training and the adoption of new
               information and communication technology;


                                                [1]
      (iii)   Improve the quality and dissemination of statistical products and harmonizing
              standards and methods according to international standards across NSS; and
      (iv)    Supporting the 2010 Census post enumeration activities including the analysis and
              dissemination of the census data results and the implementation of the Post
              Enumeration Survey.

3. KEY FINDINGS/PROGRESS OF IMPLEMENTATION

Overview

7.      The MDTF is a two year $7m project closing end December 2012. At the project’s
inception, the project’s two donors (EU and DFID) contributed $3.5m in financing and
committed to make an additional $3.5m available as the project progressed.

8.      There has been little evidence of progress on the project during its first year and only
$1m of project funding has been disbursed. As a result, both DFID and EU were concerned
about performance to date and GSS’ ability to spend the entire $7m in available funding
within the project’s timeframe.

9.      The mission team raised their concerns regarding the lack of performance, and the
potential inability for the GSS to effectively spend the full amount committed to the project
with Ghana’s Government Statistician at the outset of the mission. Shortly thereafter, four
specific options that could guide the project’s evolution were discussed with the other
members of GSS’s senior management. Throughout the course of the mission, project’s
progress to date was assessed with the objective of discussing with GSS’s management and
Board which option seemed the most sensible course of action. The four options were:

      (i) Evidence suggests progress - continue the project as before;
      (ii) Evidence suggests no/slow progress - Introduce a time-bound action plan for short
            period with a small number of triggers to be met and review progress at end of this
            period;
      (iii) Evidence suggests no/slow progress - DFID/EU would not make the second $3.5m
            installment available to the MDTF. EU indicated that rather, it would redeploy its
            contribution to other development projects in Ghana. However, DFID was not clear
            as to what would happen with the funds. The project’s funding balance ($2.44m)
            plus investment income of US$30,670, would continue to support the MDTF; and
      (iv) Evidence suggests no/slow progress - DFID/EU would not make the second $3.5m
            available and request the unspent funds to be returned. This amount of US$5.98
            million would then probably be redeployed to other development projects in Ghana.

10.     At the end of the mission, the team agreed to discuss pursuing option three with GSS.
The team had planned to de-brief the Deputy Government Statisticians (the Government
Statistician was absent due to an international commitment) on the 18th January 2012 and the
GSS Board on the 31st January 2012. Given the mission findings and the likely option to be
pursued, the GSS Board were invited to attend the de-brief on the 18th January 2012. On
Wednesday January 18 2012, the team presented the mission’s findings which provided the
evidence and rationale for pursuing option three. The Board and the mission team then
discussed what steps/ evidence would be required, and what key issues would need to be
addressed, to complete the project under the second option to ensure the original amount of
$7m would remain available. The meeting concluded by agreeing to give GSS two weeks to

                                               [2]
propose actions to respond to the key issues before making a final decision.        Should the
proposed actions fall short, option three would be pursued.

Achievement towards the Project Development Objective (PDO)

11.     The likelihood of achieving the PDO is moderately satisfactory. Since effectiveness,
 th
7 February 2011, there has been some progress against the overall PDO. GSS has
developed a strategy for institutional reform with identified key activities and a timeline for
implementation.     Discussions with the Ministry of Local Government and Rural
Development (MLGRD) on inclusion of statisticians in the decentralization programme are
advanced. The new organogram for GSS has been disseminated and a timetable in place for
allocating current personnel to positions in the organogram with aim to complete by end
March 2012. This is however far behind the schedule outlined in the Government’s strategy
paper for reform. Any delay by the GSS in making clear decisions about retrenchment and
the numbers affected will have implications for timely completion of the process in an
election year.

12.     Specifically on legal reform, a draft Statistics Bill has been prepared with the
assistance of a legal drafter. The draft Act is being circulated for comments and a cabinet
memo is under preparation.

13.     Post enumeration activities of the 2010 Population and Housing Census are
continuing, though slower than initially envisaged. The Post-Enumeration Survey data
collection was completed in April 2011 about 4 months later than international guidelines
advocate. Data matching (PES and census) is nearing completion and reconciliation,
validation and analysis are planned for February and March 2012. Main census forms have
been checked, coded and edited prior to scanning. Scanning only started in July 2011, with
22% scanned by the time of mission in January 2012. Provisional results of the census have
been released, but there are concerns about the release of the full census results as scheduled,
with implications for the PDO.

14.    During the July 2011 ISM there was evidence of good progress on 2011 project
milestones. However, progress has now stalled with direct implications for achievement of
the Project Development Objective.

Implementation progress

15.    The overall implementation progress is rated unsatisfactory. While there has been
some progress in a few key areas, there has been very limited project expenditure, and
procurement for planned activities is extremely slow (see paras. 46 & 49). The ISM in July
2011 noted serious concerns about overall coordination between the top management,
technical leads, procurement and project management, which was impacting upon
procurement and disbursement. Steps were taken then to address what were considered
process issues. However, there has been no improvement in progress or speed of
implementation.

16.    There has been notable progress in some areas (legal reform, institutional reform)
without project inputs. This is to be commended as it promotes internal ownership and
commitment. However, this has not been communicated to the Bank team and the allocated
resources not been programmed. Strategic forward planning needs to be strengthened to

                                              [3]
ensure actions take place as planned and are completed as scheduled. There is little evidence
of active monitoring of progress on project milestones.

17.    The mission identified other issues which seem to have impeded project execution.
These include: (i) the need to foster, across the organization, a culture of taking responsibility
and following up on actions; (ii) improving the effectiveness and engagement of Directors
leading MDTF areas; (iii) further developing a culture of delegating decision-making
responsibility to relevant staff to accelerate project execution; (iv) fostering the culture of
innovation and creativity to quickly address execution bottlenecks.

18.     Underpinning many of these issues appears to be a concentration of decision-making
authority which affects the speed of project execution across a range of activities: for
example, drafting and finalizing terms of reference resulting in delays in procurement and
clearance procedures requiring the head of agency.

Project management

19.    The overall project management is rated as unsatisfactory.

20.     There is a team with clear responsibility for project coordination - Program
Development and Management Group (PDMG), who have continued to provide timely
monthly and quarterly progress reports. PDMG have developed a strong working
relationship with the Bank and demonstrate commitment to successful delivery of the project.

21.      However, there has been very slow overall progress on the 2011 work plan. While a
number of key activities have been started, and there is evidence of progress under each
component, there is a lot less progress than would have been expected at the halfway stage of
the project. There continues to be a risk where procurement is required that other planned
activities will not commence on time, jeopardizing completion of project activities by end
2012. The issue on project management seems to be related to the issues outlined in para. 17
above – staff are unmotivated or uncommitted and still do not clearly understand their roles
and responsibilities, lack of follow up by technical teams once Terms of reference etc. are
submitted, all underpinned by a slow approval process driven by centralized management.

22.    Since the project is in the middle of its lifespan, it is imperative that these bottlenecks
are urgently addressed. There is the pressing need to consider existing internal
implementation structures to see if they can be made more efficient and effective and to
ensure appropriate delegation, accountability and responsibility among the different parties.

Component one: Legal and institutional reform

23.      This component is rated moderately unsatisfactory. In July 2011, this was rated
moderately satisfactory with evidence of progress, particularly on institutional reform. The
foundational and orientation training were held in the last quarter of 2011, Personal History
Forms (PHF) have been completed by all staff, and discussions with MLGRD on integrating
statisticians within the MMDAs are advanced with a cabinet memo being prepared.
Management are in the process of assigning people to the directors positions in the new
organogram, a process expected to be completed and presented to the GSS Board on January
31st, 2012. The Directors will then assist management to assess and place staff in their
respective directorates, with aim to complete this process by end of March 2012.

                                               [4]
24.      However the government timeline for implementing the reform is off-track with key
activities due to be completed by end December 2011 unlikely to be so until at least May
2012. GSS have continued to do much of the work themselves which builds internal
ownership and commitment. However, there still seems to be indecision on which
consultants are needed, when and for how long. Many of these, for example the change
management consultant, should have been in place to advise on the reform process and
communication with staff but terms of reference are still subject to revision.

25.     On legal reform, GSS did much of the groundwork. They constituted a small team to
review existing laws in Ghana that refer to statistics, to review laws from a range of other
countries (e.g. Mexico, Canada, South Africa and Uganda) and to propose content of the new
law. A legal drafter was then recruited to assist GSS in translating their draft into a draft
Statistics Bill. This is near completion. The draft Bill has been circulated for comments and a
cabinet memo is under preparation.

Component two: Strengthening the capacity of GSS

26.    This component is rated moderately unsatisfactory. No progress has been made on
this component since the last mission in July 2011. Some Technical specifications and Terms
of References (TORs) have been drafted but this component is far behind schedule on
implementation.

27.    The training included under this component has not progressed, with consultants not
yet recruited. There are plans to develop training programs to meet the needs of different
groups of staff (e.g. below HND level) and on both statistical and non-statistical issues.
However, this is without the comprehensive training needs assessment being completed
(consultant not even recruited). It feels that there are a number of separate training activities
being planned without an overall training strategy or plan and appropriate sequencing. Recent
discussions have led to a review of the training consultancies and further revisions have been
made, with, for example, proposals to separate IT training from the non-statistical training.
Unless final decisions are made soon there will be will further delay to the procurement and
completion of activities.

28.      The upgrading of IT (including local and wide area networks) was planned for 2011
to benefit from MOFEP plans to upgrade the IT infrastructure in GSS. However the
procurement process initially planned for August 2011 has yet to start and there remains a
lack of clarity on the different ICT elements and ensuring appropriate sequencing of
activities.

29.     There has been no progress since July 2011 on upgrading Geographic Information
System (GIS) with either equipment or staff. Any steps taken were thwarted by demands of
the census for office space and staff time. Equipment deemed urgent in July 2011, and to be
procured through shopping are still not in place and there has been little additional progress
on digitizing the regions, with only four and a half regions now digitized compared with three
and a half in July 2011.

30.    This component of the project accounts for about 23% of the overall budget (US$1.36
million). If procurement advanced quickly this has real potential to provide quick turnaround
in terms of project implementation and disbursement.

                                               [5]
Component three: Improving the quality and dissemination of statistical products

31.     This component is rated moderately unsatisfactory. A key element of this component
– the production of manuals in ten subject areas was always scheduled for 2012, but steps to
procure the consultant are behind schedule and there are notable delays to the work plan for
this activity. The lead Director for this work has convened a team and work has begun on
compiling definitions and concepts and identifying the ten areas for the manuals. Working
groups have been identified for each of the ten areas but have not yet met. Terms of
reference for a consultant are not yet finalized.

32.     The review of publications and assessment of quality and scope of products and
services, scheduled for 2011, is now planned to begin in February 2012. The initial plan was
to procure a consultant to lead this work, with procurement scheduled to start in August 2011
and final report due November 2011. It was decided more recently to undertake this work
through a peer review process – with representatives from other national statistical offices
coming to Ghana to work with GSS on this. However, there did not yet seem to be a clear
rationale for which agencies should be invited and what their individual comparative
advantage is. The TOR for the workshop is still under development. The team was advised to
undertake background research on the potential countries: Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria and
South Africa and their comparative advantages to ensure they meet the needs of GSS. The
team was also advised to consider timing of the event and prepare a budget given change in
approach from previous budget for this activity.

Component four: Supporting the 2010 Census post enumeration activities

33.     This component is rated moderately unsatisfactory. This component accounts for
US$2.4 million or 40% of the total budget. The Post Enumeration Survey was undertaken in
April 2011 – later than the three to four months advocated in international guidelines. The
matching of the PES with the main census is nearing completion (expected 28th January
2012) and reconciliation is scheduled to start on 30 January 2012. This is however almost 18
months after the main census data collection and 9 months after the PES was undertaken. It is
expected that the PES report will be completed by March 15, 2012. A consultant is being
recruited to facilitate with the PES report.

34.     Provisional census results were released February 2011. There have however been
substantial delays on census data processing, implying a delay in the release of the full census
results (due 31 March 2012). In addition, none of the 50 staff to be trained in census data
analysis1, 15 staff to be trained in data processing, and 30 staff to be trained in data
dissemination were trained, and there is no concrete plan for when this training will take
place.

35.      The support to other post enumeration activities – publication of final results and
drafting of analytical and thematic reports is scheduled for later in 2012. However these
activities will be delayed and their completion within the lifetime of the project threatened if
the data processing is not completed on time. Additional resources have been provided from
Government to ensure release of the full census results by March 31, 2011. At the time of the
1
 UNDP funded training in data analysis in 2011 including 29 GSS staff, 2 of whom were funded from the
MDTF. This training was more general than the proposed census data analysis training included in the MDTF
and which GSS consider still relevant.

                                                    [6]
mission only 22% of the scanning had been completed. Calculations by the mission team,
based on figures given to the team in meetings and the proposal sent to the Minister of
Finance, suggest that scanning cannot currently be completed by end February 2012 as
planned to ensure March 2012 release of data.

Legal covenants

36.     Progress in this area is satisfactory. All dated legal covenants required to be met
within six months of project effectiveness have now been met, although not within six
months of effectiveness. The last covenant, recruitment of external auditors, was only
recently met, some 11 months after effectiveness.

Fiduciary Performance

37.     Overall the Financial Management (FM) arrangement of the project is rated as being
satisfactory and there has been no adverse change in the arrangements as documented in the
PAD. There are adequate systems including competent staff within the Accounts department
who has proved their competence in providing reliable and credible financial data together
with adequate supporting documentation.

38.    Disbursement: The project was declared effective in February 2011 but the initial
withdrawal application only submitted in May 2011 for an amount of US$1,000,000. A
second withdrawal application for US$805,314.72 was submitted during the mission (total
funds in the project are $6,007,417).

39.     During the mission the team reviewed expenditure incurred by GSS and paid for
using GoG funds and assisted the Project Accountant to prepare an SOE to claim
reimbursement. Total amount of expenditure eligible for reimbursement (using GoG funding)
is approximately US$250,000 whilst expenditure paid directly from the designated account is
US$597,000. The review noted that generally all expenditure had been duly authorized and
approved in line with the various guidelines as per the PIM and Government of Ghana
procedures. A sample test of transactions noted that all the expenditures are eligible and in
line with the objectives of the project.

40.     Financial Management (FM): Most of the issues arising from the financial
management assessment appear to be management related and do not have a direct bearing on
financial management capacity.

41.     As part of the FM team’s routine supervision to assess the adequacy of systems, the
Bank conducted a review of the financial management systems/arrangement at the Ghana
Statistical Service. The review noted:

         Need to automate the accounting function - the current accounting function is based
          on manual system and ledgers and this does not ensure efficiency in terms of resource
          allocation, time management and the turnaround time for preparing reports. The
          current system is an outdated version of Topaz and is not reliable and so not being
          used. In view of this, the recommendation is for the GSS to engage a consultant to
          review, design and install a suitable accounting package for the GSS and its regional
          offices;


                                               [7]
         Lack of firm commitments – concern that GSS could not provide substantial
          commitment schedule for first quarter 2012. It is recommended that monthly project
          monitoring review sessions are held between the Bank and GSS top management to
          help track implementation; and

         Poor Coordination - The issues of slow disbursement could be due to ineffective
          coordination within GSS to support implementation and possible administrative
          challenges limiting the effectiveness of the Project Coordinator.

42.     The FM Risk rating is assessed to be Moderate and has not changed as documented in
the project Appraisal Document (PAD). Based on the review the FM team concludes that the
existing arrangements for the continuing adequacy and reliance of the financial management
systems for the project as reviewed are adequate and meet the minimum requirement for
financial management under OP/BP 10.02.

43.    No issues of fraud or misappropriation or corruption came to our attention and a
review of the internal control procedures including the different levels of authorization and
approvals should minimize any such risk.

44.    It appears that the challenges in implementation are not a consequence of financial
management or procurement but mostly administrative and bureaucratic. Until this issue is
resolved the project risks being evaluated as unsuccessful.

Procurement:

45.     The overall procurement performance of the project is rated as Moderately
Satisfactory. Though several procurements have been initiated, these are behind schedule.
Out of the 14 items under Goods procurement, in the most recent revised procurement plan
made available during mission, 9 are yet to start; 4 on-going but behind schedule, and 1
completed. Similarly out of 29 items under Consultancy, 15 are yet to start with 4 behind
planned schedule; 2 on-going and 5 just started but behind planned schedule; 3 not planned
for; and only 2 completed.

46.     Procurement Capacity: The procurement unit is staffed with four (4) permanent staff,
two temporary staff on short contract basis, and a recently recruited Procurement Advisor (a
seasoned procurement specialist) who assumed office on 15 November 2011. The head of
the Procurement Unit is an M. Sc degree holder, while two of his assistants have B.Sc and the
third a higher national Diploma (HND). Together they carry out procurement of Goods,
Consulting and Non-consulting services. Two of the officers attended the GIMPA-run
procurement workshops on Goods, Works and Services organized in October, 2011 while the
other had attended a similar workshop earlier in 2010.

47.     The Procurement Advisor will lead, advise, participate, follow-up, monitor, review,
etc. procurement under the project in accordance with the stipulates of the legal agreement,
PAD and Project Implementation Manual (PIM) as well as provide support, training and
mentoring of the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) staff of the Procurement Unit.

48.    Review of Procurement Plan. The latest procurement plan obtained during the
mission when compared with the previous approved Procurement Plan (September 2011)
shows a shift of the scheduled planned activities. This is attributed to little procurement

                                              [8]
activities since the last ISM in July 2011. Furthermore this review has shifted a lot of
procurement activities forward giving a semblance of procurement on-course. However over
50% of such procurement on the project are yet to start, while almost over 80% are to be
implemented this year. Indeed by the earlier procurement plan almost all consultancy and
goods procurements should have been started by end Dec 2011. This indicates that the total
planned procurement on the project has been significantly delayed. Changing dates in the
procurement plan does not necessarily mean that systems are now in place to ensure that
these dates are adhered to. No further delays can be entertained if all the procurements
planned are to be completed before the project closure of 31 December 2012. GSS
procurement has been advised to take a zero tolerance approach to missed deadlines (for
example, in submitting TORs), with technical teams made aware they may lose that goods/
consultancy.

49.    The mission discussed and agreed that the Procurement Plans must be revised and
continuously updated (with actual dates) to ensure that planned contracts will be completed
before project closure and to reflect procurement status accurately. A revised and updated
procurement plan should be submitted to the Bank for review and no objection by end
January 2012.

50.    Furthermore the Procurement Advisor with the procurement unit should draw up
individual Action Plans for all the outstanding procurements and accordingly distribute to all
responsible personnel who are to take action at certain stages of the procurement.

51.     Since no slippage in the planned activities can be tolerated at this stage of project
implementation, the mission is holding the team to the planned schedule dates as presented in
the current procurement plan made available during the mission.

52.     Procurement Processes pending issues - Single Source Selection. The coordinating
team drew the mission’s attention to the proposed sole source selection to engage Information
Technology (IT) services providers to design and implement statistics analysis system, email,
and messaging and Intranet system for GSS. Although this procurement was to be done
originally under Consultant’s Qualification Selection (CQS) the coordinating team is
considering harnessing experience at Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MOFEP)
system and ensuring GSS implement a coordinated system with MOFEP. The mission
advises the coordinating team to be mindful of paragraphs 3.8 and 3.9 on Single Source
Selection of Consultants2 in the Banks Guidelines dated January 2011.

53.    Given the explanation provided during the mission for the sole source selection, the
coordinating team is advised to stick to the original plan of using CQS method, and the
consultant who undertook the MOFEP work is welcome and advised to compete as well.
2
  . [3.8 Single-source selection of consultants does not provide the benefits of competition in regard to quality
and cost, lacks transparency in selection, and could encourage unacceptable practices. Therefore, single-source
selection shall be used only in exceptional cases. The justification for single-source selection shall be examined
in the context of the overall interests of the client and the project, and the Bank’s responsibility to ensure
economy and efficiency and provide equal opportunity to all qualified consultants. 3.9 Single-source selection
may be appropriate in the following cases, and only if it presents a clear advantage over competition: (a) for
tasks that represent a natural continuation of previous work carried out by the firm (see next paragraph); (b) in
exceptional cases, such as, but not limited to, in response to natural disasters and for emergency situations both
declared by the Borrower and recognized by the Bank; (c) for very small assignments; or (d) when only one firm
is qualified or has experience of exceptional worth for the assignment.]


                                                       [9]
Please refer to paragraph 3.7 on Selection based on CQS in the Bank’s Guidelines on
selection and employment of Consultant3, January 2011.
54.     Post Procurement Review (PPR). The mission informed the Project Coordinating
Team (PCT) that a PPR of the project procurement activities will be carried out after the
mission in early February 2012. The report will be shared with GoG and PCT. Informal
discussions will be held with the PCT to explain the PPR findings and recommendations as
well as solicit the PCT comments on pertinent procurement issues arising from the PPR.

55.     Use of Procurement Tracking System (PROCYS). The mission scheduled PROCYS
training for GSS project staff and this took place on Monday 23 January 2012, to ensure that
the project staff can process their request through PROCYS-WB e-procurement system-
which is mandatory. Following the training GSS have been tasked to process their prior
review procurements to the WB through PROCYS.

56.     Procurement Risk Rating. The mission recommends the current procurement risk
rating to be the same as previous; that is, MEDIUM-LOW (M-L). Although the project has
recruited a Procurement Advisor, his impact is only just beginning to have an effect on
procurement. If by the next mission, it is ascertained that procurement is back on track; and
as scheduled, effectively and efficiently, then the rating will be changed to Low.

Monitoring and Evaluation

57.     Overall, monitoring and evaluation is rated as moderately unsatisfactory. During a
mission in April/May 2011 it was agreed that PDMG would provide monthly progress reports
to the Bank. Monthly progress reports have been received and within a few days of the end
of the month and report progress against activities. However, there is little evidence of
forward work planning that would identify key tasks to be undertaken and when and
resources required and on which subsequent progress could be assessed. In addition, there
does not seem to be an active mechanism in place for monitoring progress on the MDTF
annual milestones.

58.    Monitoring of the MDTF was discussed with GSS. Agreement was reached for the
Bank to work with the Monitoring and Reporting team within PDMG on this. In addition,
monthly meetings will be held between the Bank and GSS top management to discuss the
monthly progress reports, review progress and agree activities for the next month.

59.      The Results Framework was reviewed and progress on 2011 milestones updated.

  [3.7 This method may be used for small45assignments or emergency situations declared by the Borrower and
recognized by the Bank for which the need for issuing an RFP, and preparing and evaluating competitive
proposals is not justified. In such cases, the Borrower shall prepare the TOR and obtain expressions of interest
that include information on their experience and qualifications, eventually through an REOI as may be needed,
from as many firms as possible, and at least three qualified firms with relevant experience. Firms having the
required experience and competence relevant to the assignment shall be assessed and compared, and the best
qualified and experienced firm shall be selected. Only the selected firm shall be asked to submit a combined
technical and financial proposal and, if such proposal is responsive and acceptable, be invited to negotiate a
contract. Both technical and financial aspects of the proposal may be negotiated. If the negotiations fail with the
selected firm, the provisions of paragraph 2.30 apply. The minutes of negotiations shall be prepared and signed
by both parties. Awards of contract shall be published as per paragraph 7 of Appendix 1 ]

 The denominator of this indicator will change from year to year. This is because not all publications will be released on an annual basis (e.g. household surveys) and GSS aims to produce a
greater number of publications over time (e.g. resume production and publication of the Quarterly Digest of Statistics).
