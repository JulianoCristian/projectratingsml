                         There has been notable progress in key areas, including towards achieving the PDO and in respect of 2011 targets/ milestones most of which have been met or are likely to be met.
                         However, there has been no expenditure from the designated account and procurement for planned activities is slow. Implementation delays seem to have resulted from a range of

                         factors including: poor overall coordination between the technical leads, procurement and project management; lack of awareness across GSS of the MDTF and activities it's
                         supporting; lack of clarity on individual roles and responsibilities (e.g. between technical teams and procurement unit); and a slow approval process. These are process issues that
                         should be easily addressed. GSS has already taken action having recently convened a three-day workshop to address these issues. They have also proposed a number of other
                         actions to strengthen project management, coordination and implementation.
