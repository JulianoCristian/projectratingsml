                         progress across all four project components but in particular in strengthening GSS capacity (component 2) and in the post-enumeration activities of the census (component 4). Work

                         on elements of institutional reform (component 1) has continued but not made as much progress as envisaged by GSS due to extended stakeholder discussions with Public Services
                         Commission (on the organogram and staff assignments) and Local Government Service (on integration of statisticians at district level). Staff engagement on the reform process
                         continues. With the Human Resource, Change Management and Industrial Relations consultancies now recruited GSS are well placed to complete the reform activities supported by
                         the MDTF. On strengthening GSS capacity work on the ICT elements has started and advanced quickly with LAN almost complete at HQ, the user hardware and software contracts

                         awarded, the enterprise architecture consultancy complete and the GIS unit now fully equipped, staffed and trained. The Statistics Trainer has completed their assignment and
                         undertaken a number of training courses with GSS staff. Other training consultancies will be taken forward in 2013. The review of statistical products (component 3) was completed
                         through a peer review process and an action plan developed based on the peer review recommendations. While there have been challenges in recruiting the consultant to support
                         GSS in the preparation of the manuals of standardized concepts etc, GSS have established manual drafting teams and undertaken a lot of preparatory work. The project has
                         additionally been able to support work on the re-basing of the Consumer Price Index. The User Satisfaction Survey is being finalized for publication. The final results of the census
                         (component 4) were released in May 2012. The Economic, Demographic, Social and Housing report and the National Demographic Report are almost complete and the writing of the
                         Regional Reports advanced. The Post Enumeration Survey analysis is now complete with support from an international consultant and the report being finalized for publication. Staff
                         have completed training in census data analysis and training on IMIS is planned for December 2012 and on data dissemination in early 2013.

                         In addition there continues to be evidence of strengthening of project processes including procurement (with many goods procurements completed and most consultancies in place or
                         completed), financial management including disbursement (with monthly submission of withdrawal applications and 58% of funds now disbursed), project management and
                         monitoring and evaluation.
