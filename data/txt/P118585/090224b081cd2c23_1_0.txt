                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The MDTF implementation has continued its positive trajectory since January 2012, with substantial progress on implementation in particular since May 2012. A number of key
                         activities are at an advanced stage of implementation and are on track to be completed by the close of the project. In addition there continues to be evidence of strengthening of
                         project processes including: procurement, financial management (including disbursement), project management and monitoring and evaluation.

                             The World Bank                                                                                                                                         Report No: ISR10392




                         The MDTF was designed as support to the implementation of the Ghana Statistics Development Plan (GSDP) (Ghana's National Strategy for the Development of Statistics) and the
                         program level indicators from the GSDP were included within the MDTF. It was expected that while the MDTF does not deliver directly on any of the program indicators, the MDTF
                         along with the SRF/IDA Ghana Statistics Development Project would contribute to improved performance on these indicators. The delay in Parliamentary approval of the SRF/IDA

                         project has had an impact on the combined support to achieve the GSDP program indicators. The proportion of GSS staff with professional qualifications is currently 38% and lower
                         than the end target of 50%. Achieving this target has been affected by delays in the implementation of institutional reform that would have reduced the number of staff without a
                         professional qualification. The Statistical Capacity Index score has fallen from 61% in 2011 to 59% in 2012 reflecting lack of recent poverty data, time since the last agricultural
                         census, completeness of the vital registration system and time since the last re-basing of the Consumer and Producer Price Index. The MDTF was not directly supporting any of
                         these activities but has provided support to the CPI re-basing which was launched in June 2013. GSS undertook a User Satisfaction Survey in March 2012, overall the report shows
                         stakeholders are satisfied with GSS statistical products and services although there is, however, more room for improvement e.g. the GSS website, timeliness of release and access
                         to the statistics. The indicator on proportion of publications publicly available in line with the release calendar has been met with 7 out of 9 publications (PPI, CPI, National Accounts,
                         Prime Building Cost, MICS-summary report, 2010 Census Summary Report, 2010 Census Final Report ) published as planned. The implementation of the census and survey
                         program has not been met with delays to a number of surveys due, in part, to funding constraints. The MDTF did, however, directly contribute to the achievement of the last program
                         indicator on the development of a compendium of standardised concepts. This has been completed for 23 subject areas and was disseminated nationally and regionally in June
                         2013.

                         In terms of the Project Development Objective there are two main elements: (1) Institutional reform and (2) timely and extensive analysis and dissemination of the census data.
                         Based on the PDO indicators in the results framework the institutional reform element has been partially met and the census data element met.
                         (1) Institutional reform: there has been progress on legal reform with the Statistics Law drafted and submitted to Cabinet for onward submission to Parliament. On reform of the GSS,
                         a restructuring strategy for the GSS has been developed and agreed by the GSS Board. However, other elements of the institutional reform have made variable progress with the
                         functional review not completed, the training program not developed and it unlikely that the Performance Management System will be fully operational by the end of the Project,
                         although HR consultants are in place an d HR policies and procedures have been developed. While it is expected that the PMS will be in place by end June 2013 it will need
                         approximately 12-18 months to be fully operational. Challenges in procurement of consultants for the functional review and the training program have led to these activities being
                         dropped from the MDTF and to be considered under the SRF/IDA project. The project had planned to support GSS to implement a financial management system, but with
                         Government plans to implement a Government-wide financial management system, GSS have been asked to wait for this to be in place before deciding on any additional system.
                         (2) Census data: the provisional and final results of the 2010 Population and Housing Census have been released and the indicator targets have been met.

                         Specifically on project components, of the twelve intermediate results indicators in the results framework, six have currently been met, five partially met and one not met. Of those
                         that have not yet been met it is expected that another two will be met by the end of the project with the remaining four partially met.

                         (1) Component one - legal and institutional reform:
                         The draft NSS law has been presented to the Attorney General and is currently with Cabinet for review prior to submitting to Parliament. The election in December 2012 delayed
                         submission to Parliament and it is now unlikely that the NSS Law will be amended by Parliament or receive presidential ascent by Project closure. The strategy for restructuring was
                         approved by the GSS Board and an organizational structure has been prepared and is being finalized between the GSS Board and PSC. An organogram has been developed and
                         an initial allocation of staff to post, done. This is now ready for implementation as soon as the GSS Board and PSC agree on the organogram and funds from the follow-on project

                         become available. There are additional elements to this component, not reflected in the results framework, that have progressed well, including work on the integration of statistical
                         officers within the districts (under the decentralization program of Government) which will ensure that each district assembly has a district statistical unit. GSS have established strong
                         working relationships with the PSC and Local Government Service that has ensured progress on the integration and other project activities. Communication with staff has also
                         improved through the use of staff durbars to keep staff informed of reform activities and other work of GSS.

                         (2) Component two - GSS capacity building:
                         There have been challenges with the training element and the comprehensive training program will not now be developed under this Project. Other training activities, including senior
                         management training in leadership and project management and ICT training, have been completed. Also under this component while the Intranet, Internet and email are not yet
                         operational at all offices in GSS HQ, the work on the installation of local and wide area network and of Microsoft technologies is advanced and these targets should be met by the end
                         of the Project. The GIS element of this component has been successfully achieved with the GIS unit equipped with hardware and software and all staff trained to undertake mapping
                         and dissemination activities. The team have completed the Census Atlas - mapping census results at the district level. The GIS is being used in the Ghana Living Standards Survey

                         and will be used in the Agricultural Census; MDAs also have access to GIS in GSS.

                         (3) Component three - improving the quality and dissemination of statistical products:
                         The comprehensive manual of standards and methods (Compendium) has been developed and covers 23 rather than 10 subject areas and includes additional elements such as

                         wording and response options of standardized questions and derived variables. This was developed in consultation with key data producers and users, with strong MDA engagement
                         and support for the manual. This should ensure its ownership and therefore compliance across Government. The assessment of the quality of statistical products was undertaken by
                         peer review with colleagues from statistical offices in Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. An action plan and implementation plan was also developed. Implementation of the
                         action plan has been variable, particularly as many actions are dependent on the establishment of the Resource and Data Center which will done once the new organogram/ structure
                         is in place. The project also supported the User Satisfaction Survey which has been finalized and will be disseminated alongside the Compendium. Overall the results were very
                         positive on user satisfaction with the quality of official statistics. The Project also supported GSS in some aspects of the re-basing of the Consumer Price Index - particularly focusing
                         on quality issues and stakeholder engagement. The re-based CPI was la unched i June 2013.

                         (4) Component four - supporting the 2010 census post enumeration activities:
                         The majority of targets for this component have already been met and the one outstanding is likely to be met by the end of the Project. The Post Enumeration Survey (PES) was
                         undertaken although outside of the recommended three months after main enumeration. The PES results have been validated and reconciled and the report printed and
                         disseminated in June 2013. GSS benefited from the support of a consultant who reviewed the report and analysis. Feedback on the work done by GSS was very positive. The
                         provisional and final results of the census have been released. The analytical reports (national, 10 regional demographic, census atlas and Demographic, Social, Economic and
                         Housing reports) have been finalized and the national report disseminated. Dissemination events are planned for the remaining reports in June 2013.

                         A number of the indicators in the results framework and their associated targets lack clarity in definition and explanation causing GSS challenges in reporting and differences in
                         interpretation. Weak capacity for M&E at GSS constrained their ability to fully engage with the design of the results framework and to define the indicators and targets. A longer
                         implementation period would have justified a review of the results framework and some revision of the indicators to ensure that key elements of the project were fully captured,
                         indicators were well defined and processes established for timely monitoring of progress.

                         Over the length of the project there have been improvements in project management, procurement and financial management (disbursement and reporting) and in monitoring and
                         evaluation. There continue to be improvements in project management and an increased appreciation of the different elements to effectively managing projects and of the
                         importance of planning and forecasting. Monthly progress reports have improved and continue to be delivered on time. The 2012 Annual Report was an improvement on the 2011
                         annual report and included an assessment of progress against milestones and has been published on the GSS website. However, the annual reports are yet to be presented to the
                         GSS Board and the M&E Sector Working Group. Lessons learned during the implementation of this project will be useful in managing the SRF/IDA project when it becomes effective.
