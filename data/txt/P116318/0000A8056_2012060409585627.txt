                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed financing would support the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) to undertake Phase II activities that fulfill objectives outlined in the original Project Appraisal
                         Document (Report No. 31989, April 2005). The development objective of the NBI SVP Water Resources Planning and Management (WRPM) project is to enhance
                         analytical capacity from a basin-wide perspective to support the development, management, and protection of Nile Basin water resources in an equitable, optimal,
                         integrated, and sustainable manner. Phase II will emphasize the development of a basin-wide Decision Support System (DSS) for water planning and management.
