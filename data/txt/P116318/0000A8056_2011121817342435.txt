                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed financing would support the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) to undertake Phase II activities that fulfill objectives outlined in the original Project
                         Appraisal Document (Report No. 31989, April 2005). The development objective of the NBI SVP Water Resources Planning and Management (WRPM) project is to
                         enhance analytical capacity from a basin-wide perspective to support the development, management, and protection of Nile Basin water resources in an
                         equitable, optimal, integrated, and sustainable manner. Phase II will emphasize the development of a basin-wide Decision Support System (DSS) for water
                         planning and management.

                         Implementation of the WRPM project is satisfactory and the project is expected to achieve its development objectives. The Nile Basin Decision Support System (DSS), under
                         development, is already recognized by experts to be a world class tool in terms of its growing functionality and potential for generic application. As such, the DSS is an important and
                         valuable asset for the NBI, bringing the ability to analyze and optimize multiple scenarios for water resources management and development.
