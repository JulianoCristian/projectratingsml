WATER RESOURCES PLANNING", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Second Phase of the\n            Water Resources Planning and Management Project (WRPMP) for\n            Africa were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Grantee performance was satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: lessons emerged from the WRPMP are\n            related to: project rationale; Decision Support System (DSS)\n            development; and sustainability. At project rational\n            following lessons were learned: the project was conceived\n            and designed on the assumption that countries need to have a\n            commonly accepted knowledge base and analytical tools to\n            enable improved understanding and informed discussions about\n            water resources management and development opportunities,\n            challenges, and trade-offs. This builds trust and\n            confidence, breaks myths through sound analysis and\n            information, and forms the technical knowledge platform for\n            advancing cooperation. Capacity and knowledge is linked to a\n            fourth risk, namely the ability to act in the best interest\n            of the country without constraints, making decisions\n            independently (sovereignty and autonomy). It is the\n            application of the DSS over the next few years that are\n            expected to reap the substantial benefits for cooperative\n            management and development of the Nile basin. As a highly\n            technical exercise by specialists, the development of a DSS\n            runs the risk of being isolated and separated from its\n            rationale. To avoid this, development of the DSS was a\n            highly participatory process involving the riparian\n            countries and in particular a key design feature of the\n            project was to support capacity building for DSS use at a\n            national level. This aimed to ensure understanding as well\n            as relevance of the DSS to riparian issues. Public access to\n            the tools and data is important to spread and maximize\n            knowledge and understanding across the basin beyond the\n            riparian governments. At DSS development lessons learned\n            are: the business process for water resources decision\n            making is at once an important starting condition but also a\n            product of the project itself. Development of the DSS as a\n            participatory process enabled technical interaction across\n            all of the Nile basin countries for the first time.\n            Developing data and information sharing protocols is\n            critical and can be helped by global public data sets and\n            development of the DSS itself. It thus requires adequate\n            long term resources, appropriate team skills-mix, and\n            attention to continuity of staff. Role of the basin\n            professionals compared with international consultants should\n            be carefully considered. Role of the basin professionals\n            compared with international consultants should be carefully\n            considered. A DSS should be inclusive of the range of\n            development concerns and priorities, adopting a triple\n            bottom line scope. The DSS should embed as early as possible\n            in the long term institutional host. Lessons from\n            sustainability include: the development of a DSS should be\n            seen as part of a long term process and one part of the\n            overall engagement with a basin. A DSS is a living asset\n            that requires ongoing adaptation, refinement and software."}, "docdt": "2013-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
