                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed financing would support the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) to undertake Phase II activities that fulfill objectives outlined in the original Project
                         Appraisal Document (Report No. 31989, April 2005). The development objective of the NBI SVP Water Resources Planning and Management (WRPM) project is to
                         enhance analytical capacity from a basin-wide perspective to support the development, management, and protection of Nile Basin water resources in an
                         equitable, optimal, integrated, and sustainable manner. Phase II will emphasize the development of a basin-wide Decision Support System (DSS) for water
                         planning and management.
