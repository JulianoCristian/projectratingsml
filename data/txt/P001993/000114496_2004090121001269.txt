Excellency,
     We refer to the Development Credit Agreement, dated April 5,
1991 (the Agreement), between the Republic of Niger (the Borrower)
and the International Development Association (the Association), and
to your request of March- 10, 1993 to have the amount of the
Authorized Allocation specified in the Agreement for the purposes of
the Special Account increased from its present level to an amount
corresponding to the executing agency's projected expenditure for a
four months' period.
     We are pleased to inform you that the Association accedes to
your request and agrees, accordingly, to amend the Agreement by
deleting, in paragraph 1 (c) of Schedule 4 thereto, the amount of
"350,000,000 CFAF" appearing therein, and substituting therefor an
amount of "500,000,000 CFAF".
     Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment, on
behalf of the Borrower, by signing and dating the confirmation form
on the enclosed copy of this letter and returning it to us for our
records.
               This amendment shall become effective upon receipt by
