Restructuring\n            Project for Romania were as follows: outcomes were\n            unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was unsatisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also unsatisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the bid evaluation process\n            appeared excessively cumbersome and slow, due to large\n            evaluation committees composed of too many persons\n            representing different agencies. An equal level of\n            transparency and fairness, while making the process more\n            effective, can be reached with smaller evaluation committees\n            composed mainly by agency representatives. This approach was\n            successfully followed in the second half of project life.\n            The government should take into account the declining demand\n            for some of the railway lines, and provide the railway\n            infrastructure manager with the necessary authority and\n            incentives, when alternative transport services are\n            available for the population, to close those lines to make\n            the operation of railway infrastructure financially and\n            fiscally sustainable. In Romania, major floods causing\n            country-wide, serious damage to transport infrastructure and\n            frequent political changes that started soon after project\n            implementation, should have provided a red flag, alerting\n            Bank management that it needed to pay special attention to\n            the impact of those factors on project implementation."}, "docdt": "2010-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
