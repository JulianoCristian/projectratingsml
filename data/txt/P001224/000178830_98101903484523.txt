KENYA
EDUCATION PROJECT
SUMVRY
i.       'In February 1965, the Government of Kenya discussed with the
Internationaal DSveLopment Association the possibility of a credit for ex-
pansion of the secondary school system. In July and August 1965 an IDA
appraisal mission was in Kenya to review the project.
ii.       Kenya is faced with an urgent need for more high level manpower
to support economic and social growth, and to replace expatriates as
educated and trained KCenyans become available.  In this country of <2 million
persons the recognized, state-supported general secondary school system now
enrolls onLy 26,000 students and has room for only 4,400 of them to finish
the four-year course. Form V and VI education, which is required of most
University entrants, is now available to only 1,660 students or less than
one-half ofE those wiho finish four years of secondary education.  Secondary
level educaition in industrial technology is available to only a handful of
Kenyans, too few to meet the needs of the growing economy.   Primary school
teachers at present are trained in 34 small, poorly equipped institutions
with places for 4,1300 students.
iii.      The proposed proiect will cost US$9.7 million equivalent during
a construction period 1966-1969. It provides for building 16 new, and
for expanding 19 p:resent Forms I-IV secondarv schools to accommodate 11,000
additional students and to increase the annual output by more than 2,700
at a cost of $3.8 million. Form V and VT education will he increased bv
over 800 places andi annual output will be raised by over 400 by spending
$0.  million to imporove ten sehools.  Techniea1 seonr1n-mr PA_io on wil:L
be improved by constructing two and reconstructing seven schools by an
expenditurP of $0.Q mnilliom tn tincreas the num.ber of plhac  yr 1,250l and
the annual output by 270. Primary teachers' training colleges will be con-
cer.trated in 1_8 cof the 34, preser.t sites, nadding 95 OK() a  andr in-ncrainc
the annual output capacity by 485 at a cost of $1.2 million. Staff housing
amoulnts to $2.0 million and contingencies to 1.3 minllion.  Thus hv an,
expencliture of approximately $9.7 million, 13,900 additional places for
post- riarystu ents would be added nd the nvi.in        - i.rase in output wond
be more than 3,900.
iv.       The secondary school curriculum will be broadened by the provision
ofL agricu-'tura.l, indusuriail, co.m.mercial and ho.m.eZ Mcn.i  ntut  Ona
optional subjects.  Terminal educaticn will thus be provided for secondary
sudents appropiate to Kernya's labor   arket conditions.
v.        Thse ianpower requiromiente of the aondstu   developu nt plan Justifies
this increaseb in educational investment and student OUtpUte



-ii. L-
Vi.       Kenya will have to continue to rely upon expatriate teachers for
some years to come but United Kingdom and U.S. support is available to
supply the numbers needed and the supply of African teachers is increasing.
vii.      Kenya is budgeting sufficient funds for recurrent costs of this
project within the economic developmenlt plan forecasts.
viii.     Iesign and construction of the buildings and procurement of the
equipment can be carried out with sat-isfactory procedures and at reasonable
costs.  Foreign exchange requireme:nts are approximately 81.9 million and
local currency costs about $7.8 million. Most of the schools to be built
will have to provide boarding facilitiLes due to the scattered population.
Similarly, housing for teachers will be provided because the overwhelming
majoritv of the teachers including exnpatriates are from areas sther than
those in which they are to teach, and houses are not available.
ix.       'he expansion of the secondary school system is necessary to the
fii filmentf of Kenn'r eon       developm..en.t plan.  S ,lrr  to the recom.lenda-
tions and c:onditions set forth in paragraphs 104 and 105, the project is
suitable for an IDA. cre-jt in the a-o1 t of US$7 million or 73 percen.t of
the total cost of the project.

3.        The Kenya Education Commission in 1964 expressed the opinion that
a shortage of professional, administrative and skilled workers threatened
to delay Kenya's economic development.  The Commission gave first priority
to expanding secondary schools.
4.        The proposal to IDA reflects the recommendations of the Education
Commission and should meet the dermand expressed in the Economic Development
Plan.
5.        An IDA appraisal mission, comprising IMessrs. George Tobias, Mats
Hultin, Peter Oltmanns and J.C. Jones (consultant) visited Kenya during
July and August, 1965, and this report is based upon their findings and the
data provided in the Economic Development Plan and the Education Commission
Report.
II. BACKGROUID
GeoRraphy
6.        Kenya's 225,000 square miles make it about the same size as
France. Straddling the Equator, lCeixya is broken into east and west halves
by the Rift Valley. Rising from a ccast line along the Indian Ocean,
Kenya has a long range of uplands crossing two-thirds of the country from
west to east, abundantly watered and giving the highest agricultural out-
put with tne ereatest potential for erowth amonz Kenva's areas.
7-        For tl,p rest of the con-trv- a narrow fertile belt of tropical
vegetation along the coast offers pot,ential for agricultural development.
Almrot. the entir  nnrm.hPrn hlf of the roniintry is in arid wasteland. The
most fertile area, the highlands, has been taken up by Europeans for agri-
clstural developmnnet sin.ce the beginning of the +.hta r ry. Wh.ile some changes



in ownership now characterize agricultural development in the rich lands,
heavv inupetm.ent mnay haue to be mnne ton hrina in Aianifinant additional
agricultural production.
Kenya's People
8.        The 9.5 million people of Kenya are 97 percent of African origin,
A4 .- A,A i.to~- four... r~4., .or an   as r.r   a.s lOO , r.ir^   +s,,,.al n.d trib21 groups.
While perhaps two-thirds of Kenya's people are Bantu in origin, they in

tu.-Lt ar c;;ue Sudvided into -LW11Z erous c-LuAlua"  LL ".L J_  L%,  s v6r
communication is somewhat limited.
9.        Two and one-half percent of the population is of Asian origin,
controlling trade and commerce, anid has served as the country:s middle class
in both public and private employnent. The remaining one-half of one percent
is European.
10.       The 97 percent of the population which is African remains pre-
dominantly rural. The African's economic role has been almost entirely in
subsistence agriculture on small hoiclings, contributing little to tne market
economy. Even villages remain uncommon in rural Kenya, with a pattern of
settlement representing only a few homesteads clustered together. Probably
fewer than ten towns in Kenya have more than 10,000 inhabitants and only
one, Naircbi, more than 200,000. While in some districts of best farming
poterftial there are as many as 1,000 persons to the square mile, less than
5 percent of Kenya's population lives in the vast expanses of the northern
province occupying 40 percent of the country.
11.       The population is growing at an estimated 3 percent per annum..
This birth rate indicates that Kenya may- have 11 million people by 197C'.
12.       Substantial changes in the migration pattern have occurred in the
last five years with a net loss of Europeans every year since 1960 due to
emigration, and a loss in the Asian population in 1964. The movement suggests
an opening: up of higher level occupations to Africans.
III. THE EDUCILTION SYSTEM
Backgrouncd
13.       In the past, Kenya's education consisted of separate systems for
Europeans, Asians and Africans, each system separately financed and staffed,
with separate objectives and standards for the students.
14.       Until 1560, there had been almost no communication between th.e
three. European education was on a different material standard and served
to produce graduates for governmentaL, cornmmercial or financial activities
where univrersitv orenaration in most cases was desirable. Asians anticinating
a career in trade and commerce were educated with emphasis in that direction,
but Asian edueatiAon was fuirther com'plicated hecaiise of l anguage and religpious
separatisrn.



-3.-
15.       African education was provided almost entirely by the Christian
missions with usualy a more restricted target than the European and Asian
education.. Since Independence the emphasis of the Government has been to
integrate the three school systems, to admit more Africans and to expose
more African child3ren to a type of instruction that would fit them for
higher level positions.
Primary Education
16.       Kenya is now reducing primary education - a responsibility of the
local authorities - from eight years to seven, terminating in a common
examination for all primary schools as a prerequisite to secondary school
entrance. The coumtry is also planning to expand primary enrollment by
four percent per annum which is one-third faster than the rate of population
growth.  ]?rimary school children pay fees of 60-65 shillings per year.When fees
were raised in 1963, a drop in new enrollments followed.   It is necessary,
however, that fees continue to be charged because it is not yet possible
to raise sufficient revenue from the cormmunities.
17.       Only 65 percent of primary school children are taught by qualified
teachers, which reduces the efficiency of primary education considerabl.y.
More than 80 percent of Kenyats children learn a tribal dialect as their
first language.  On entrance to primary school this 80 percent is taught
Swahili.  English is offered in Standard 4 as the child's third language.
The low percentage of qualified primary teachers adversely influences T)ro-
gress in E'nglish and thereby lowers the standard in the secondary schools
whpre Png'lish is the teaching mediiirm-
18.       Tn 1Q65  when 1 700-00C) W.nrnran e-hileirr TTere eliaihbl  for nr-ir
education, (aged 6 to 12) a little more than 1,C00,000 were in school (61%).
Fewer' th: t.wo pe:rcent of the eli >_b1e chilrh'en were evv?'olled in the No'h
east while in Nai:robi practically every child was in school.  Moreover, as
every Diropean lh:4ld was in shool nd       Of) 9 ercer.t of +he Ain-s  a
smaller percentage of the Africans was ienrolled than would be implied by
t+f-l to-tall figures.  TheA -apout rate 4is high = -ut of' '140,000 c1-ildren -ho
entered Standard 1L in 1956 40,000 remained in Standard 7 by 1962 (Annexes

of self-help primary schools are springing up all over the country.   These
so-called ::Harambee" schools, buiLt by iocal iabor with iocal materiala
have grown to the point where only a few can be staffed with teachers of
adequate quality and in sufficient numbers.
General Secondary Education
20.       Students wno complete primary education may proceed to primary
teacher training, four or six years of general secondary education, or
three or four years of technical education.  There are also opportunities



-4-
for students to take up teacher training or vocational education after t.wo
years of general secondary education (Annex 4).
21.       Maintained and assistedl/secondary schools have grown in number
from 148 in 1963 to 185 in 1965. Unaided schools have grown from 43 in
1963 to 1140 in 1965, with the result that in 1965 schooling of some kind or
other is offered at the secondary leval in buildings ranging from adequate
to primitiv7e in a total of 325 locations. Among the maintained and assisted
schools, about one-tenth were form.er 'European schools, one-fourth Asian
and Arab schools, and two-thirds former African schools.
22.       A number of "Harambee"l schools have also been constructed at the
secondary Level. Once the schools are built, the Central Government is
asked to supply teachers, books. and teaching materials, and finds it
difficult for political reasons to refuse to do so. Hence the total number
of secondary schools has been rising by substantial numbers each year while
the quality has been falling.
23.       In terms of size, quality and investment per child, the former
African schools are the poorest    Tt is to build up those schools into sizes
that afford educational quality and variety that the country now seeks to
expnam1 its seron-darv school systemn.
24       (Of the school age group of 13 to 1R9 eStAmated at 1.2 milliOn
persons, about 31½ percent are enrolled in secondary schools, representing

failing examinations due to sicKness, nervousness or other reasons may not
receive a leaving certificate even if their earlier achievements have been
good. This overvaluation of examinations has led to an emphasis on those
parts of the curricula which can be controlled by tests while other parts

govern the curriculum in an unfavorable way. There is an almost complete
absence from the curriculum of music and fine arts,  Very few schools have
offered practical courses but changes are now in progress and it has bc-en
decided that all general secondary schools will offer one or more courses
such as agriculture, commerce, industrial arts and hom_ cconomics in
addition to the academic ones.  Textbooks suited to Kenya's background are
in short supply duLe to a general sho)rtage of authors acquainted with Kenya
and the country's need.
26.       The absence of practical education has not been attributable to
resistance on the part of the pupils to taking practical subJects. A Year
ago US AID provided six secondary scihools with facilities for agricultural
studies as nart oi' the Cambride Certificate course..  Cambridge recomnition
of the courses was perhaps the deciding factor but the courses were fi].led

BoardinR
30.       The 1964 Education Commission concluded that with the population
scattered it is difficult for African children to attend a secondary day
school. Daily bus transportation is not feasible for most of the rural
children.  The Education Commission recommended that boarding schools be
provided now, and. that even if they can later be converted to day schools
as the population, grows and roads improve, there will continue to be a. need
to feed the children at least one meal per day in the secondary schools to

bodies large enough to justify full curricula can be assembled in a given
school only if it has boarding facilities.
32.       Boarding schools are also a means of mixing pupils from variouls
groups in order to diminish tribal tensions.
33.       The boar(ling school system requires a certain amount of staff
housing for supervisors of the boarders. In addition, there is a general
shortage of' houses suitable for teachers in many areas of Kenya.
34.       There are some areas in Kenya where it should be possible to
introduce a day school system with bus transportation. A cost comparison
of boarding, versus day school with buses shows that, for recurrent costs per
student over a fifty-year period, day schools are about 7 percent cheaper.
The initiaL capitaL but not necessarily the total cost of buses would be
less than the cost of hostels. Hcowiever, the replacement of buses at in1;er-
vals might have disadvantages in requiring new loans or absorbing some of
the country's foreimn exchange.. Furt'her. the intrmdnictinn of bus services
would also involve unknown factors of reliability and safety. Taking a7l

Higher Education including Secondary School Teacher Training
35.       The highest level of education in East Africa is that provided
by Uthe U         U1vJSly 0E  Africa, r,Uo[,ld-L-Ly a sngle J.11ZUbior -Ar.L1 i± t]uJe
campuses at Kampala in Uganda, Nairobi in Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzcmia,
each with specialized faculties (Annex 4).
36.       ;tudents successfully completing four years of secondary education
may enter into architecture, art, domestic science, surveying or adminiistra-
tion courses., After six years of secondary education the University offers
engineering science, arts or vetexinary courses.
37.       Outside the University higher education is offered at the Kenra
Poytechnic, the Medical Training Center and the College of Agriculture.
38.       The trainiing of secondary school teachers in East Africa has imtil
recently been done in the Kampala section of the University. To meet the
demand created by the proposed secondary school expansion several training
schemes have now been launched within K'enya.  There are three-year courses
for school certificate holders and one-year courses for higher school
certificate holders in operation at Kenyatta College in Nairobi (Annex ta).
With Swedish aid a Science Teacher Institute has started. The total yearly
output of teachers from these two institutions will be about 200. In 19?66

a yearly intake oI- 25-50 ior suuuents recently reiurned from aDroad wil.l
also be offered by the new Department of Education at the Nairobi section
of the University.
Organization and Supervision
39.      TChe administration of Kenya;s education is in the process of
change. The intention is that local authorities and school boards of
governors shall progressively take over the responsibility for teachers'
salaries, teacher appointments, etc.  The Central Government, however, will
still cont.inue to exercise the real auathority. The Government's financial
support is followed by firm recommendations and inspections. As most
teachers are expatriates recruited. from abroad, teacher appointment is a
task for the Ministry.  The Ministry recommends timetables, equipment and
textbooks. School construction has, however, been decentralized. The
organization of tho Ministry is shown by Chart Annex 5, which shows that.
there are at presernt no units for planning, statistics or school construction.
4o.       Many key positions in the Ministry are filled by expatriates, the
length of whose stay in Kenya is unce:rtain.  It is important that African
counterparts for these expatriates should be found as soon as possible.
Particularly important is the formation of a planning and statistics uni.t0

oent of itlS Er-operan popln2tion. are engaged on the lnand.  Tn traditiona:l
African society, tiny plots of land were farmed, using simple techniques.

Economic Planning
43.       Kenya leadership has long been aware of the need for economic
planning. Upon Independence, a development plan for the years 1964-70 was
set in motion with the assistance of foreign experts which remains the target
plan for economic, manpower and educational development. A Directorate of
Planning in the Ministry of Economic Planning and Development has as one of
its centrELI functions the development of manpower plans. These plans include
the settine of eoals and oblectives for the educational svstem.
±dL.      KenyaIs Economic Devalopment Plan has as a maior obiective the
fulfillment of employment and manpower goals. The plan builds its 1970
target for economi=c development on tlhe assumntion that the familv incore
will increase from ii70 in 1964 to i6200 in 1970. By 1970 Kenya's 11 million
people will comprise 1, 800,000 famililes or h00,OO0 more than at the beginning
of the plan. To provide for the add'Ltional families, the G.D.P. must in-

growth rate of 3.]. percent.
EMployment
45.       Between 1960 and 1963, there was a serious decline in the paid
emuploy-welerU1; leVeJ. JLI1 ,Ln Rend, W±IO about 90,uuv fUewer woIrker  U1P±lj.Vy-eu at the
end of the period than at the beginning. The year 1964 showed a minor
upturn, but Kenya s employment is still below the 1960 level.  The situation
for Africans was isomewhat better, as Europeans and Asians departed, but; it
may be hard to employ many Africans unless they can be educated and tirained.
46.       rhie dec:iine in agricultural employment resulted from the conversion
of large-scale farms to settlement schemes and the conversion of formerly
employed farm workcers to self-employed subsistence farmers.  The shift from
employment to self-employment status and the decline in the number of
employed persons are factors which should be taken into account by educational
planning.
47.       As a part of the Economic Development Plan, Kenya arranged for the
Ford Foundation to make a manpower survey.  The resultant analysis shows
high level occupations in four categories. Category 1 contains those occu'
pations requiring a university degree or equivalent. During the plan period,
5,600 additional such workers are needed, with the visible supply estirn ted
at 4,600. The principal shortfalls are in those teaching posts which require
university degrees but agricultural growth will also call f6r s 6bMtantial
increases in the number of agricultural professional worditis



-9.-
48.       Category 2 occupations are those which require two to three y,ears
of formal education and training after secondary school Form IV completion.
Nearly 24,000 of this category will be needed in the plan period, with fewer
than 19,000 estimated to be available from present post-school training
facilities. The bulk of the requirements is in Government and formal train-
ing is to be provided in Government M4inistries. The greatest single shortage,
of some 3.200. in this categorv is pnropArlv trained Drimarv school teachers.
49.       Categonr 3 occunations are those which reouire a seeondarv school
education.. Kenya estimates that the plam period will require 25,000 such

The Africans in Categories 1 and 2 were mostly in the Civil Service. The
majority of Africans were in jobs calling for more education than they
actually had.
53.       The manpower survey showed that a secondary school output of at
least 57,000 over the period 1964-1970 was necessary. If an inevitable
"fdrop-out"l is taken into account, the conclusion of the Education Commission
that a secondarv school intake of 66.000 students is needed seems justified.

new schools woi I'.d be. bOu'Lilt and . would be .L. -proved or e-r,ded.



Forms I to IV
56.      S'ixteen new structures are for Forms I to IV, adding 48 streanms of
secondary education, in wnich 6,720 students can find places.    In 19 other
localities present structures would be improved, expanded, or better equipped,
adding 30 streams or 4,200 places.   The total cost will be $3.74 million.
Altogether., 11,000 places would be ad(ded, increasing the pre-project enrollment
by 42 percent and increasing the Form IV enrollment (graduates) by more than
2,700 (Annexes 7 and 8).
57.       Seventeen of the additional streams are for the education of girls
and 61 for boys. IFive of the Forms I.-IV schools included are for day students
only, ten are for boarding students only, and 20 will accommodate both day
and boarding students.   Fifty percent of the places added by the project are
for boarding students. The boarding counts for 29 percent of the cost cf the
project. Hroever, by 1970 at the completion of the project only 39 percent of
all secondary school students would be boarders, compared with 47 percent in
1964.
58.       Tn addition to accommodations being provided by new construction
or the purchase of new equipment, 1,2930 places will become available through
expanding the sizes of the classes and the better utilization of facilities
already in place.
59.       Ifn every one of the 35 schools included in the proposed project,
students 'would have the option of fol:Lowing an agriculture, commercial,
industrial or home economics specialization. to acQuaint them with the
applied practices of modern societies, on the land, in the home, in work-
shops. and in offices.

assist  --n..-  otb.rc  with addi+tonal -b-c-.rr -ar. +ennclg equip-r. t .-  I'hr
total cost would be $0.90 million.   An additional 1,250 boys will be able to

add4it-nl- places wA.ill Ibe for bo._Ar,- student.



62.       Heretofore, the technical schools have been able to train 2,300
students. The new emphasis in Kenya's technical education will provide an
extended period of classroom, laboratory, and workshop instruction followed
by related on-the-job training in the same fields of work.   The project-
assisted technical schlools would be closely geared to industry and provi:de
instruction in courses to supplement employers' training efforts in pre--
paring boys for "jumior technician" jobs in the metal trades, mechanical
trades,and electrical trades.
Teacher's Training Colleges
63.       There are3 now 34 small, primary teachers' colleges in Kenya. The
proposed project would provide better equipment and teaching for more students
in 18 of those 34 colleges, at a cost of $1.18 million.   The project would
add 950 places, increasing the enrollment by 20 percent and increasing t4he
output by L8t teachers per vear. These additions are needed to increase the
number of qualified teachers to take care of expanded primary school enroll-
ments.  The nrolect-axnanded colleges woild meet 70 percent of nrimarv
teacher training needs, with the remainder to be met in the other colleges
not be.ing, increased in enrollImPent..  The teacher training colleges are operated
as boarding schools (Annexes 13 and l4).
Teacher Requiremaents and Sup,ply

65.       Kenya has at present 1,880 teachers in secondary schools and teacher
training co-lleges0  Nearly all of them are qualified. The demand in second-
ary schools will, according to estimates done by the Education Commission,
increase from 1,70C in 1965 to 2,950 in iY9U.   rne proposed projech woulu
absorb about 550 cf this increase.   Ulew Kenya teachers can be developed to
a total of 1,250 cduring the period (para 38), Excernal sources expect to
keep at least 600 teaching posts fiLed, partly as replacements, partly as
new posts.  There is, therefore, a balance between demand and supply or
perhaps a surplus. The surplus may be available for unaided secondary
schools.
66.       The prirmry teacher training colleges would require about 85 new
instructors. There should be no difficulty in recruiting these as posts in
teacher training colleges are usually easier to fill than in secondary
schools.



Staff Housing
67.       The provision of staff housing has characterized Kenya's educ-a-
tional system as long as it has existed. Other ministries provide pro-
fessional and executive personnel wiith housing as a fringe benefit at a. more
or less uniform st-andard according to the level and status of the perscnnel.
Staff housing is needed so long as Kenya's civil service is made up mainly
of expatr:iates, but staff housing may have to be provided for school teachers
permanently because housing is generally very short especially in rural
areas,
68.       The pro ject provides that $2.04 million will be spent on staff
housing, including necessary profess-Lonal and supervision services. This
sum represents 24 percent of the total cost, reduced from about 40 percent
in the original Kenya proposal. The saving thus achieved has been used to
produce m.ore places in schools.
69.      IDA has reviewed the standards and adequacy of housing which would
be designed and built under this credit. The Government of Kenya will make
detailed suggestions for staff housing for the approval of IDA within agreed
standards.
Construction Costs
Basis of Estimating
70.       The construction cost estimates are derived from costs of building
per square foot, based on standard designs and recent building experiernce.
For each 1type of structure to be put up. recent costs were taken and adjusted
upward or do-minward to account for modifications that are to be worked into
the nfTw buildings!
Cont i n  .ni es

its undertaking may have an effect on cost.

Quality of Design
7b0       Architectural design and construction vary considerably, with
excellent quality to be seen in the Nvairobi area, where in recent years
80 percent of building activity has been concentrated.  The rural areas
have a lowrer quality of design and construction, depending on the architect
and contractor used, whose choice haS been at the discretion of the local
school authorities.
75.       Schools have followed standiard designs prepared by the Architectural
Branch of the M4inistry of Works, Communication, and Power. The structures
are simple and bare. Any local school authority which chose to use a private
architect has been permitted to do so and special allowances have been made
in the grant of ftmds by Goverrment for such professional services. Some
schools constructed in this way are attractive and still within the cost
ceilings allowed by Government.
76.      TIhere are 14 architectural firms in Kenya, many of whom are able
and eager to undertake the work involved. As the Ministry of Works does not
have sufficient staff of its own to cope with the size of the project,
private architectS in collaboration with the Ministry of Works should be
used.
77.       The sum of $398,COO has been allowed for professional services,
including desien. architectural engineerin8 services, quantity surveving and
supeaivision by government building inspectors, with respect to the educational
and boa.rdinp faci-Lities. The Ministrv of Works is nrenaring new standard
drawings in collaboration with one or two private architectural firms.  These
stanHard dirawings would hb used as a hasis for all of the sehools in the
project.  Additional architectural firms as needed would be used for adapta-
tion and site plnanning.

80.       Kenya's normal procedure is to call for competitive bids from a
selected 'List of approved contractors; unrestricted public bidding has
proven unsuccessful because of the sharp difference in the quality of con-
tracting :Firms. Standard contracts with bills of quantities and specifica-
tions are generaLly used. Combined with the working drawings, they consti-
tute the contract documents. Paymenlb is normally made monthly against
certificates of completion issued by the quantity surveyor, private architect
or government official supervising the project.  These procedures follow
normal andi acceptable practice.
Basis of Procurement of Supplies and Equipment
81.       The Govornment established its own Department of Supplies in 1955
and incorporated this office into the Ministry of Works. At the same time
a Tender Board was provided which services all ministries and departmerLts
for the procurement of commodities. The task of the Board is to make
recommendations concerning the acceptance of tenders. The final decision as
to whether a particular tender should be accepted lies with the account.ing
officer o:F the Hlinistrv or TlAoartM.eArb for which the sunnlias are recuired.
82.       The procureme.ntof sun1ippl4e.s and equiinnmAn.t fnr nehoo1ln has, herAto-
fore, been decentralized to local authorities.  It was, therefore, not possible
to provide for international competttion.  That practi            resi1 tAed in
higher costs than would be the result of mass purchasing by a central office,
but this Clatter sJystem is now to be instituted.

W4.       All indents for purchases from overseas are submitted to the
Central Tender Board for review before being sent to the purchasing agent.
in tille case oI tne proposed project thnis review could be UondU-teU by Adte
Supplies B3oard of the Ministry of Works which in this respect is a sub--
ordinate body of the Central Board. Tne Supplies Board would hancle aii,
international ten(iring and procurement through the Crown Agents in London.
Diplomatic and consular representatives in Kenya of governments who are
members of the Bank, plus Switzerland, would be notified about the proJect
and about the tendering and procurement procedures through the Crown Agents
in London. Similar notifications wi:1l be sent to the diplomatic representa-
tives about the construction contracts.
85.       The Government Supplies Board is well staffed and efficient and
should be able to deal with the workload of the proposed IDA project.

86.       The cost of equipment and furniiture in the proposed project Is
estimated at $1,3(0,000 with an additional $70,000 set aside for insurance,
freight and installation. An allowance of 15 percent is being added for
price increases oIr specification changes during equipment procurement.

90.       The funds of the project will be disbursed mainly over a three-
year period as th(3 construction will be phased in three stages, each for
approximately a onle-year period.  Before the actual construction startS,
an estimated expenditure of about $0.2 million will be incurred (for sLte
surveys, professional fees, etc.).  The Kenya Government intends to spend
on construction in the first staze about $3.7 million. in the second stage
$4e5 million and during the last year about $1.2 million. After practical
comoletion an amount of 0.1 million should be withheld for the defects and
liability period of nine months. During the three stages of construction,
monthly navments ij11 be made to the contractors according to their certified
progress and the rate of disbursement during the three years can be expected
to be fairly even (see Apmnex 18).
Project Office
91.       At least five separate divisions within the Ministry of Education
are responsible for one or another part of this project. In addition, the
Treasury, Ministry of Works, Ministry of Planning and the President's Office
each has its own responsibilities that bear upon the completion of this
project. It will, therefore, be necessary that at a fairly high level of
government a project officer be designated to assure coordination and inter-
change of information between the several officials concerned. The Kenya
Government has agreed that such an officer will be designated in the Ministry
of Education.

VI, FINANCINl3 EDUCATION
1960-1965
92.       Primary education is now almost entirely the financial responsibility
of local atuthor+tins. Tn earlier vyears - the total cost of EuroTean and Asian
schools and two-thiLrds of the costs of African schools were charges of the
Central Cover.^ +. --t Th.escosts to thel j* r.trQ  50.e* 1fr.Int a e  mnre thnn
I, 3 5 million per amnum during the fisca:L years 1960/61 to 1962/63 and have
been reduced to oan eastim.ated T 13210  l in 1965/66 due to +he shift to local
authoritie:s.  It will be necessary for the indefinite future to maintairL
fees +o fiA.r ,e thes     A    n seco,ndar  so  y;. rngrvn  allgnni i ar $6j4r
per year in a boarding school and $29 per year in a day school.
93.        In fiscal year 1961/62 the LKenya Central Government spent about
7. miLul:.Lon on tub recurrenb cots of± eQucation, which figule deC±iiuu to
I 5 .2 million in the current fiscal year 1965/66, as costs of primary
educatiLon iLncreaLJiug±yY hl-ave to be met by local authorities.  Fees have
sharply declined from nearly ; 0.9 mi:lion in 1960/61 to an estimated
b ±0(U uuu Lor Zi±5`6o6 as a source oI revenue to the Central Government. In
1961/62 the overail public e:;-. -ditura3 on educ-ation amounted to about one-
sixth of the total government expendiibure of X 4303 million.  In the current
fiscal year 1965/66, less than one-tenith of Kenya's total public expendi.-
tures, estimated at E 55.8 mill ion, is for educational purposes, which
implies that there is some latitude for increasing the Central Government
contribution to educational expenditures.
94e      ]During the period 1960/61 to 1965/66 the total capital expenditure
on education rose from less than ; 700,000 to E 1,500,000 with the general
revenue of the Treasury being relied upon to supply practically all of it
(Annex 16).
1965-70
95.      'The development plan of Kenya provides that Central Government
total recurrent expenditures for secondary and higher education, almost
exclusively accounting for the overal:L increase, will rise to ; 8 million
by the end of the plan period (Annex 1L7).
96.       In the period between 1961 and 1970 Central Government recurrent
costs on secondarv general education will more than double from T 1.6 mlllion
to E 3.5 million.  Similarly, the Central Government expenditure on techmical
education will almost double from ; 3160.000 to ; 680;000 and the samne annTies
to the trend of teacher training costs rising from E 750,000 to b 1,320,000.
Admini stration oosti will neArly trinple while Kena'sq onnl-uihnt-nn to the
costs of h:Lgher edtucation will more tihan double (Annex 17).
970       Kenya's past and prospective expenditures on education, when con-
sideredras a fracton of probable total available revenues, are within t.he
limits which most inderdeveloped countries have found themselves able to
reachnl.

VII. CONCLUSIONS
98.       During the period 1964-1970, Kenyafs requirements for high level
manpower call for an additional 57,000 persons who should have secondary
education plus training to carry out the jobs to be performed (para 53).
99.       The necessary expansion of secondary education can be achievod by
increasingn the nwuber of pupils per class, by adding new classes to existing
schools and by constructing new schools.
100.      There is a shortage of secondary school teachers in Kenya but
the supply is expected to be sufficient to cover the demand caused by the
planned expansion (paras 65, 66).
101.      Klienya students would have to be provided for the most part with
boarding facilities (paras 57, 60C 61, 63).
102.      There i,9 an adaouate number o:f comnetent contractors in Kenya
to carry out the :project. Costs may increase above the levels on which
the DrAsent estimates were computed and a contingrenev allowance has been
includied to cover those cost increases ,as well as to cover the costs of
adap~tingt standard desirn'.q of buiildings to'the inil.rirhil sites~ on iwhio
they are to be built (paras 71, 79).
103.      The list of equipmrent to be procured is adequate.  The procurement

ii)  Investigate examination procedures and content of secondary
schol. level wl±i a view io their mouuLlizatUloH (para 25)J.
1U5       As conditions for the granting of the Credit the Government should
take the following actions:
i) In designing the schools to be built under this Credit,
Ken,ya should engage private architects to supplement
its own civil service staff (paras 75, 76).



ii)  A full-time project of'ficer satisfactory to the Association
should be designated t,o coordinate the several divisions
of the Education Ministry and the several ministries con-
cerned with carrying out this project. He should be
located in the office of the chief education officer of
Ken.ya (para 91).
iii)  The Central Government; should through the project officer
and his pronict unit take full resnonsibilitv for the
impilementation of the project (paras 39, 91).
106.      Subject to the foregoing conditions, the project forms a suitable
basis for an IDA Credlit of $7 'nilliony enuivalert co.ring 73 prcent nf the
