{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Human Immunodeficiency\n            Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)\n            Prevention and Control Project for Guyana were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: a regional Caribbean approach to training\n            fiduciary and management staff is recommended when qualified\n            human resources are in short supply and when training\n            fiduciary staff for each donor supported project will be\n            expensive as this issue was faced by most of the Caribbean\n            HIV and AIDS projects. It is important for small states to\n            have costed national AIDS strategic plans that allocate\n            funds appropriately and that flexibly can reallocate\n            resources if faced with unforeseen economic and financial\n            challenges. Bank assistance helped raise political\n            commitment, create or strengthen AIDS institutions, enlist\n            nongovernmental organizations, and prioritize activities.\n            Political commitment and capacity, however, need to be\n            nurtured as priorities change in countries that attract many\n            donors. Creating new services and support systems under a\n            vertical disease project should and can benefit the\n            efficiency of the organizational unit in which the project\n            is located such as the technical and fiduciary capacity\n            developed in the ministry of health (MOH) through the health\n            services development unit (HSDU) as the project implementing agency."}, "docdt": "2010-12-20T02:24:03Z"}
