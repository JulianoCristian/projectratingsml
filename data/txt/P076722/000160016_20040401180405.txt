A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The proposed  project intends to slow the increase of or reverse the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic  
by: (a) preventing and controlling the transmission of HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs); 
(b)  prolonging and improving the quality of life of people living with AIDS; and (c)  mitigating the 
negative impact of HIV/AIDS on persons infected and affected by the disease. 
 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
Component 1.  Institutional Capacity Strengthening, Monitoring, Evaluation and Research (~ US$ 
-2.68 million).
  The project will support strengthening institutional capacity for coordinating and 
managing the Government’s National HIV/AIDS Program.  It will support the newly established 
Presidential Commission on HIV/AIDS (PCHA) created in the Office of the President to coordinate the 
national response and ensure an appropriate policy and legal environment; the  Project Management Unit 
(PMU) which will provide operational support to the PCHA and oversee program implementation and 
ensure monitoring and evaluation of the program; and the National AIDS Program Secretariat (NAPS) at 
the Ministry of Health.  The project will also support strengthening program monitoring and evaluation

strengthening the HIV/AIDS/STI case management and surveillance system; and, strengthening the 
Communication Network.  The project will also support the revision of several legislative documents and 
the preparation of new health legislation and research studies. 
 
Component 2.  Scaling up HIV/AIDS response by line ministries, Civil Society Organizations  and 
the Private Sector  (~ US$ 3.13 million)
.  The project will support Line Ministries to expand initiatives 
in accordance with priorities in the National Strategic Plan and annual work plans for their clients as well 
as their own staff.  The project will support activities for  prevention of HIV/AIDS and STIs through  
training, education and behavior communication, condom distribution, information dissemination; 
treatment and care for the infected and infected families; work place policy formulation including 
reduction of stigma and discrimination, HIV/AIDS impact assessments.  The project will also focus on 
the external clients of the respective ministries which include youth (in and out of school including street 
children), orphans, cultural groups, professional groups such as teachers, various associations such as 
parents/teachers associations, trade union groups, farmers,
 
women’s groups and other groups that line 
ministries can identify.  A number of Ministries to take the lead include: Ministries of Youth, Sports and 
Culture; Human Services, Labor, and Social Security; Home Affairs; Amerindian Affairs; Education; 
Local Government; Tourism. 
 
Civil society groups such as Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs), community based organizations 
(CBOs) faith-based organizations (FBOs)  and the private sector have access to different groups 
including difficult-to-reach groups that are particularly high risk (commercial sex workers, men having 
sex with men, prisoners, truck drivers) and vulnerable groups (orphans and youth).  Civil society groups 
will receive grants to support their subproject for HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care and 
mitigation.  Activities that could be implemented by non-state organizations are inter alia behavior 
change activities, support to orphans, provision of care for PLWHA, distribution of condoms. 
 
Component 3.  Expanding  Health Sector Prevention, Treatment and Care Services for HIV/AIDS 
(~ US$ 5.19 million).
  Prevention interventions to be supported in the health care system include: 
development of  a comprehensive information, education and communication/behavior change 
communications (IEC/BCC);  Blood safety; voluntary counseling and testing; prevention and treatment 
of sexually transmitted infections;  prevention of mother-to-child-transmission;  training of health 
workers on proper handling of infectious waste and providing equipment for disposal and sterilization of 
medical waste at  the regional level. 
 
The project will support strengthening of care and treatment by strengthening the continuum of care from 
the time of HIV diagnosis even before development of AIDS and includes access to basic routine and 
unstigmatized care, psycho-social counseling, nutritional support, prophylaxis against opportunistic 
infections such as tuberculosis, diagnosis and treatment of complex opportunistic infections and 
antiretroviral treatment.  Specifically, the project will support: management of opportunistic infections 
including tuberculosis; and,  antiretroviral therapy (ART).  The project will support the development of 
an expanded and rigorous protocol; provision of drugs; implementation of an adequate clinical and 
laboratory monitoring infrastructure; training of clinicians and nurses; training of medical technologists; 
procurement of laboratory equipment; development of clinical care monitoring software; and 
strengthening of the materials management and logistics.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe 
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The proposed project has a Category “B” environmental rating. Overall activities under the 
project are not expected to generate adverse environmental effects, and a significant proportion of 
them will be preventive activities.  Some medical waste is expected to be generated under care 
and treatment.  An environmental assessment was conducted during project preparation to review 
medical waste disposal, infrastructure and practice.  The assessment makes recommendations 
which the Government has adopted in order to mitigate the environmental risk of this and other 
projects.  They include:   strengthening of the regulatory framework; increasing the capacity of 
health facility workers in management of medical waste disposal through training, and adoption 
of key practices such as segregation of waste, and purchase and installation of equipment, 
including appropriate incinerators. 
 
An indigenous peoples assessment was undertaken during project preparation and provided the 
basis for the  indigenous peoples development plan (IPDP) which will be implemented by 
Government.   Poor and marginalized groups are forced to cope through mechanisms that render 
them susceptible to infection.  Among the poorest groups are the Amerindian people who live in 
isolated rural communities in regions 1, 4, 7, 8 and 9.  These regions are currently low HIV/AIDS 
p
revalence areas.  However, a number of factors render Amerindians vulnerable to HIV/AIDS:  
they are the poorest group,  have a high teenage pregnancy rate; do not easily access services due 
to remoteness of locations as well as certain cultural traditions.  The project would support the 
empowerment of people, communities and institutions to deal more effectively with them.  The

different populations, aims to ensure that specific needs of different groups and of the general 
population are addressed. Services including the Comprehensive Information, Education 
Communication/Behavior Change Communications (IEC/BCC) will be designed and 
implemented to deal with these social challenges.  Specific health interventions for prevention, 
treatment and care will target the indigenous peoples.  The Government  plan includes strategies 
for reaching the remote groups with health and other social services.  The Ministry of Amerindian 
Affairs which co-led the preparation of the consultation with the  indigenous peoples is one of the 
key ministries that will implement the project.  It will monitor the direction of interventions to 
indigenous peoples and also proactively support NGOs working with indigenous peoples.

An Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  was formed in 1996 under the Environment 
Protection Act (1996) and currently reports to the Office of the President. 
 
This Agency has the responsibility for: (a) establishing regulatory frameworks and enforcement 
for the reduction of litter and the discharge of waste generation; (b) development of design 
criteria for the construction, operation, maintenance and monitoring of facilities for the control of 
pollution and the disposal of waste; (c) governing the location and classes of disposal sites; (d) 
governing and regulating the management of waste and prescribing standards for waste 
management systems; (f) public awareness and education programs and the dissemination of 
information that can enhance effective waste management practices; and (g) permitting 
permission for landfill sites, incinerators etc. 
 
The Ministry of Health also provides some technical advice regarding waste management.  This 
is done through the Environmental Health Units, which are each given responsibility for a 
number of public health districts. The environmental health officers are responsible for approving 
sanitary facilities (septic tanks and on-site disposal facilities).  The MOH has a signed 
Memorandum of Understanding (M.O.U.) with the EPA to handle matters pertaining to 
environmental health. 
 
Conclusions and Action Plan for Improving Biomedical Waste Management Practices 
 
The assessment of the health facilities in Guyana shows that there is an adequate level of 
segregation, in-house handling, treatment and ultimate disposal of most biomedical wastes, 
although there are gaps in management, equipment, incineration and treatment that present risks 
to the integrity of the overall system. This results in part from the system being derived from the 
application of general infection control practices, and not seen as a specifically targeted or 
regulated area of attention.  
 
Improving the situation, and mitigating the risks will be addressed through a set of system-wide 
interventions as follows: 
 
Page  6
 
 
(a) 
Improving the legal and regulatory framework: consultants will review the legal and 
regulatory framework that exists and propose improvements in definitions, management 
arrangements, scope of coverage of regulation to include the transportation of wastes and residue 
and site disposal. 
(b) 
Codification of practices: in consultation with facility management and with the support 
of outside experts, practices and procedures will be codified, to ensure that all steps in the system 
were specifically covered, and that international standards were applied. 
(c) 
Clarification of management responsibilities: from practice and regulations, facilities will 
reinforce and/or establish biomedical waste management responsibilities in clear personnel 
assignments. 
(d) 
Staff training and development: the MOH should organize and conduct a program to train 
and familiarize employees in all of the 173 facilities with the new guidelines and protocols that 
have been developed. It will then continue to monitor the application of these under the authority 
of the revised regulatory framework. 
(e) 
Upgrading facilities and equipment: the application of new practices will be supported 
with a complement of small equipment and specific site improvements and/or equipment repairs 
as necessary for their application (protective gear, trolleys, bins and containers, monitoring and 
recording equipment, fluid waste containers and piping, etc). In addition, consultants will review 
the system demands for inter-site transportation of wastes, incineration and disposal, leading to a 
recommendation for investments in new incineration and disposal technology. These investments 
will also be financed. 
 
The MOH will manage the implementation of the above action plan to be supported under the 
project’s Component III (a full description of the above action plan is in the project files).   
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Consultation on environmental assessment was conducted in cooperation with authorities and 
staff of MOH, municipal authorities, health care facilities at all levels, the Project Implementation 
Unit (PIU), as well as NGOs and Community Based Groups.  Field visits were conducted to:  
health facilites including the main tertiary hospital in Georgetown, regional and district hospitals 
and health centers;  key waste disposal cites including the main Goergetown Landfill, the 
Georgetown incinerator and sites used by health facilities.  The project was discussed with these 
groups and recommendations developed for Government’s consideration. 
 
Consultation with indigenous peoples was led by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of 
Amerindian Affairs and was assisted by a consultant.  A core team which included the Minister of 
Amerindian Affairs visited  indigenous peoples communities and health facilities  in two regions 
of the hinterland (I and 9).  They also held consultations with representatives of  indigenous 
peoples organizations in Georgetown: they met 65 indigenous people, representing 23 villages in 
Regions 1,7, 8,9 and 10 residing in the Amerindian hostel in Georgetown; 40 final year students 
at the Cyril Potter College of Education; the Rural Women’s Network (an umbrella organization 
for 60 local women’s groups in the 10 regions in the country) and two Amerindian NGOs (the 
Amerindian Action Movement of Guyana and the Guyanese Organization of Indigenous 
Peoples).   Disclosure of the project involved presentation from the  Government officials of the 
project and accompanying Government health policy and plan, the HIV/AIDS plan and the 
indigenous people’s policy.  This was followed by focus group discussions during which the 
indigenous peoples presented their understanding of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, their perception of 
services and the recommendations for actions by the Government and the communities.
