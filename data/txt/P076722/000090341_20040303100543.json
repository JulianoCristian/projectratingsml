total population of 800,000.\n            The Amerindians, as the IP are known, belong to 9 distinct\n            groups or tribes who make up the majority population in the\n            interior region of the country bordering Surinam, Brazil and\n            Venezuela. Most Amerindians live in about 131 highly\n            scattered communities, many of them sparsely populated. The\n            indigenous people of Guyana are disproportionately\n            disadvantaged socially and economically. The overall poor\n            state of health is reflected in low life expectancy, with\n            less than 5% of Amerindians living to be 55 years or older\n            compared to the average life expectancy for Guyana. Until\n            recently, there were no  mechanisms to ensure a coordinated\n            approach to education programs for Amerindian communities.\n            Although HIV/AIDS prevalence is still low in the interior\n            regions, the potential exists for the problem to escalate if\n            actions are not taken now to prevent the spread of the\n            disease in the indigenous populations. The Ministry of\n            Amerindian Affairs is one of the Ministries that is included\n            among selected ministries to implement the Guyana HIV/AIDS\n            Prevention and Control Project. The Ministry will undertake\n            specific activities for indigenous peoples; serve as a\n            catalyst for ensuring that civil society organizations are\n            encouraged to undertake activities for indigenous peoples\n            through the demand driven component, and liaise with other\n            ministries especially the Ministry of Health and Education\n            to ensure that the activities that they undertake focus on\n            the special needs of indigenous peoples."}, "docdt": "2004-02-20T00:00:00Z"}
