environmental assessment for\n            the Guyana HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project, which\n            presents existing data and information on the general\n            characteristics of health care waste management system in\n            Guyana; reviews and analyzes the institutional, legal, and\n            regulatory health care system framework; and finally\n            identifies problems and alternative solutions. The\n            assessment of the health facilities shows that there is an\n            adequate level of segregation, in-house handling, treatment,\n            and ultimate disposal of most biomedical wastes, although\n            there are gaps in management, equipment, incineration, and\n            treatment that pose risks to the integrity of the overall\n            system. This results in part from the system being derived\n            from the application of general infection control practices,\n            rather than practices that are specifically targeted or\n            regulated. The situation will be improved and the risks\n            mitigated by 1) improving the legal and regulatory\n            framework, and expand the scope to include waste and\n            residues transport and site disposal; 2) codifying practices\n            to ensure that international standards apply; 3) clarifying\n            management responsibilities; 4) training staff and\n            developing their expertise in applying the new guidelines\n            and protocols, and monitoring application; and 5) upgrading\n            facilities and equipment (providing protective gear,\n            trolleys, bins and containers, monitoring and recording\n            equipment, fluid waste containers and piping, etc.); and\n            reviewing need for inter-site transport of wastes,\n            incineration, and disposal, to determine recommendations for\n            investing in new incineration and disposal technology."}, "docdt": "2004-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
