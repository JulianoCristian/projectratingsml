                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Economic Empowerment (Component 1): A Mid Term Review of the project was conducted in May 2011. In general, implementation activities of sub-projects are progressing well.
                         Current estimates for the total number of sub-project beneficiaries stand roughly at 7,300, although these numbers may be revised after validation from future site visits. Income
                         generating activities cover a broad range of industries including agriculture, poultry, tailoring, brick making, restaurant and hotel services, and micro-credit. Of the sub-projects visited,
                         most organizations appear to be carrying out the activities originally proposed. Several associations with agriculture production sub-projects have already completed one harvest
                         cycle. Several poultry projects have also begun to sell chickens and eggs. Profits generated from the sale of produce have been distributed to members according to their priorities.

                         Several groups have described how proceeds have been given in part to individuals to pay for varying personal expenses (e.g. school fees), and partially reinvested in additional
                         productive activities both as a group activity and individually by the participating women. For example one association visited during the MTR directed farm profits toward the creation
                         of a poultry pen and fish pond, both of which are intended to generate additional income to sustain the groups# agricultural activities beyond the project life. Another association
                         distributed seeds to members for individual farm production, supporting an increase in productivity for the group members. Of the original 109 organizations awarded funding under

                         the economic empowerment component, 105 received 70% of their funding between August and October 2010. All sub-projects are under implementation and include both farming
                         and non-farm activities. Based on preliminary site visits to select sub-projects, financing appears to have contributed to improving food security and increasing access to
                         supplementary incomes for participating women and their families. The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) has received financial reports from 61 sub-projects, of which 5 have
                         satisfactorily met the documentation requirements and have received their final payments. Seven organizations are nearing final approval. Forty-nine organizations submitted
                         unsatisfactory or incomplete documentation and will be required to supplement their reports with additional information. Monitoring activities are also well underway. Baseline surveys
                         have been received from approximately 1,200 beneficiaries with more anticipated (though there may be some problems with polluted data). Use of this data, and how best to extract
                         meaningful information on project impact, is a critical issue that will require continued attention. The PCU M&E officers also continue to conduct monitoring sites visits across all 10
                         States. At the time of the review, 62 site visits had been completed. The M&E team also conducted 19 interviews with the heads of the implementing CBOs they were unable to
                         reach while in the field either in person in Juba or over the phone. The team intends to visit or interview as many of the remaining 27 organizations as possible, with particular focus
                         on Jonglei, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Warrap and Western Bahr el Ghazal. Since the MTR mission, the M&E team has visited Jonglei, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Warrap and Western
                         Bahr el Ghazal, bringing the total coverage to 100% (covering all ten States). Site visits serve a valuable verification role to ensure project funding is directed toward the activities
                         originally proposed. They also provide sub-project organizations with an opportunity to present accomplishments and raise potential challenges and concerns directly with
                         representatives of the Ministry of Gender and the focal person from the State Ministries of Social development. The M&E team did caution however that validating the reports of sub-
                         project groups can be difficult, particularly given translation challenges and the short duration of the field visits. These challenges, combined with high travel costs and poor
                         communication continue to hinder effective oversight. Improving monitoring activities, therefore, remains a high priority.

                         Ministry Construction (Component 2): The construction of the Ministry building has experienced some delays, most recently related to the approval of the bidding documents prepared
                         by the authorities that oversee construction of public offices in Southern Sudan. The bidding documents were finally issued in April and the bid opening took place on May 5, 2011.
                         Nine bidders submitted offers. The bid evaluation report was submitted to the Bank by end July, 2011. While there are no technical problems in the report, there is a financial short
                         fall of USD 60,000 in the final bid. Pending the confirmation of $60,000 to cover the contract, the Bank has provided the go ahead for signing the contract with the client.

                         The Contract for the Country Gender Assessment was signed on September 6, 2011.

                         Institutional Development (Component 3): The project has made significant progress in institutional capacity building since project inception, despite the challenges and other
                         activities it had to face (referendum and limited staff). The project is the first of its kind and size that the Ministry has managed. Most Ministry staff is now housed in a better working
                         environment, with improved communications, mobility and equipment and the Ministry now has more space to allow for further recruitm ent. Prior to the project, the Ministry had no
                         office space and only had a handful of staff. Focal points at State level have been designated and have received training, as well as material and financial support (travel allowances,
                         equipment, communications and transport). Most positions in the Ministry have been filled and capacity for project management has considerably improved through hands on learning
                         from the project. Training on gender concepts and mainstreaming, project management, financial management and budgeting, among others, was provided to 40 officials and staff of
                         the Ministry of Social Development and other sector ministries in all 10 states. Twelve other senior executives and staff of the ministry attended the pilot module in Juba. While it is
                         too early to assess the impact of the training, interviews with participants indicate high appreciation for the training. Experience developed through pairing of Ministry staff with the 3

                         key consultants on Financial Management (FM), Procurement and M&E has also provided significant learning and capacity for project management. The focal persons from all ten
                         states have now received motorcycles and monthly allowance to improve monitoring of the sub-projects. The improved understanding of the sub-project implementation by the focal
                         persons coupled with their mobility at the state level will result in the much needed technical support by the implementing CBOs and will significantly improve the overall results of the
                         sub-projects.
