follows:\n            outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was substantial; Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and grantee performance was also moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: In a setting\n            such as South Sudan, with extremely weak institutional\n            capacity, continuing post-conflict insecurity and serious\n            accessibility challenges due to the lack of infrastructure,\n            project teams and Bank management should resist government\n            pressures to provide nationwide coverage. Ensuring the\n            buy-in of state authorities is a challenge when they are\n            considerably weaker than central institutions and the\n            project or parallel donor activities do not include tangible\n            incentives for their participation and leadership. In such a\n            low-capacity environment as South Sudan, Bank management\n            should not give in to pressure to meet completely\n            unrealistic physical construction timetables. Capacity\n            cannot be built with one three-year project-in any setting,\n            but especially in a new country such as South Sudan where\n            donors are starting almost from scratch and capacity needs\n            to be cross-sectoral and imbedded in a new Ministry."}, "docdt": "2013-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
