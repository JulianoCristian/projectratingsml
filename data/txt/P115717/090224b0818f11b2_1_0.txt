                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Economic Empowerment (Component 1): This ISR covers the implementation period from May2012 through October 2012. There have been 2 supervision mission in the past year,
                         a supervision mission of the project was conducted in March/April 2012 and October l2012. All sub-projects are under implementation and include both farming and non-farm
                         activities. Generally, implementation activities of sub-projects are progressing well, 45% of the women perceive an increase in income as opposed to 20% expected and indicated in
                         the results framework. Current estimates for the total number of sub-project beneficiaries stand roughly at 7,300,although these numbers may be revised after validation from the

                         services,and micro-credit. Of the sub-projects visited, most organizations appear to be carrying out the activities originally proposed. Several associations with agriculture production
                         sub-projects have already completed one harvest cycle. Several poultry projects have also begun to sell chickens and eggs. In some cases profits generated from the sale of produce
                         have been distributed to members according to their priorities, though most sub-projects seem to be reinvesting in the income generating activities. The sub-projects have a multiplier

                         effect on the neighboring community groups. This is evident from the many requests for support that the implementing CBOs& NGOs and the Ministry of Gender is receiving from
                         multiple communities that see the immediate impact on the lives of the participating women. All projects that had been approved for the second tranche of funding were visited in the
                         two states, this includes ten sub-projects in Western Bahr el Ghazal and eleven in EasternEquatoria. Given that many sub-projects have activities indifferent locations, the field teams
                         were not able to visit and see all the activities first hand due to difficulty of mobility and time constraint, and had to rely on the information provided by the chairperson. In total, six of
                         the twelve project sites inWestern Bahr el Ghazal were visited, as were fifteen of the twenty-eight in Eastern Equatoria. Meetings with beneficiaries were crucial, as they helped to
                         confirm or refute the impact of the sub-project as provided by its leader.Twenty-two women were interviewed in Western Bahr el Ghazal and fifty in Eastern Equatoria. One of the
                         major lessons from the on-going sub-projects is the issue of fragility and sustainability of the project impacts gained through the investment in crop, vegetable production and other
                         non-agricultural investments.

                         In addition to the Bank team's field visit, the project team has undertaken a comprehensive monitoring & evaluation of the sub-projects in April/May2012. This M&E report validates
                         the concern that it can be difficult to attribute the results the team was shown directly to GSDP funding, especially when the funds were used to expand existing and on-going
                         activities prior to the GSDP funding. Second, the impacts realized so far are often small. The average benefit accrued to those that benefited after a year and a half amounted to
                         SSP250-500. In some cases, successful projects have reinvested all of their earnings back into project activities instead of distributing them to members.This shows the interest and
                         commitment of the women to continue with their economic activities as a group. In some cases individual women have received no benefits despite the fact that the project is
                         performing well. This also shows one of the limitations of the evaluation.

                         There were many challenges for component 1, the M&E report points these out to recommend improvements for future projects. The most common limiting factor was the
                         implementing organizations’ lack of engagement with the beneficiary women themselves. Almost none of the many women the team talked to during the project were aware of the
                         size of the project. Only few were involved in the planning of the project. Future projects would do well to consider holding workshops involving all, or a sub-set of targeted members.
                         Other over all challenges include difficulty in disbursing money given the under developed banking structure, a lack of capacity within the organizations, especially with regards to
                         preparing financial reports, insecurity and transport.

                         Out puts from component 1 are quantified in order to provide a deeper examination of the results (M&E ReportJuly2012,TableES6). This analysis, conducted through an extensive
                         review of financial documentation as well as through field visits, shows a gap in the operations and maintenance of the tools bought under the sub-project. A lack of local expertise to
                         fix them, as well as a lack of spare parts and fuel, was the most common cause for an item to be in disrepair. The report shows that there are many indicators of success for funding
                         community based projects. The report makes the qualitative observation that projects that provide a clear incentive structure to their members are more likely to succeed than those
                         that do not. It also demonstrates through statistical analysis that choosing organizations that have been around for a longer period , have a head office and submit financial
                         documentation with their proposal have a higher potential for success than others.The amount spent per beneficiary and an organization's experience with donors,on the other hand,
                         are not great predictors of an organizations chance of succeeding. A better way to incentivize focal persons would p robably lead to a higher chance for organizations’ success. The
                         quarterly allowance paid to the focal persons to undertake monitoring activities has in most cases served as a welcome incentive to monitor the sub-project activities. Given the
                         importance of close follow-up, future projects should consider either using dedicated staff at state level or designing a different incentive structure.

                         The Ministry Construction: The Construction contract for the MoGCSW building was signed on 27th September 2011. The effective commencement date of the contract was 28th
                         November 2011 when mobilization guarantee was provided by the Contractor – Mellech Engineering & Construction Limited (MECL) of Kenya. The completion date in the contract
                         was stipulated to be 30th June 2012, which allowed a construction period of just over 7 months. However, the work progressed very slowly. The poor progress of construction as well
                         as quality of supervision by Kagga & Partners Consulting Engineers (KPCE) of Uganda raised concerns during the Oversight Committee meeting. The Joint Donor Team (JDT)
                         offered to provide an independent External Consultant (EC) to assist the Ministry in their supervision of the two contracts (works as well as consultancy).
                         Despite all the efforts by the donors and the ministry, the building still remains at 31% completion. The slow progress of the construction of the building has been discussed
                         extensively at various fora, such as project coordinator’s IWG and the Oversight Committee meetings. It has been made clear to the ministry that all MDTF-SS funds must be utilized
                         by December 31st, 2012 and that any unused funds would have to be returned to MDTF donors, and that the government will have to look for alternative resources to complete
                         construction. The Bank has also consistently advised the client to undertake seek alternative source of funding and take urgent actions to pursue the contractors to expedite the

                         number of issues and provided recommendations, including the need to have a clear Gender Mainstreaming Policy for the Ministry as well as a Strategic Plan for the Directorate of
                         Gender and Child Welfare - the key directorate charged with working on gender concerns in the Ministry.

                         Based on the recommendations the ministry was able to update the draft Gender Policy Framework into a full- fledged National Gender Policy. Gender Policy is currently pending
                         presentation to the Legislative Assembly by the Ministry of Gender, Child and Social Welfare. In addition to the gender Policy, the World Bank, UN Women and the Joint Donor Team
                         are supporting the Ministry of Gender in the development of a National Strategic Plan for the implementation of the Gender Policy; resulting in sector action plans. The CGA is also
                         currently being used to update and align the 1325 Study undertaken by the Joint Donor Team.

                         The project's contribution to the improvement of the policy environment and institutional capacity of the Ministry has been well appreciated. The training was completed for 45 officials
                         and printing of three modules of training manuals used in the training for the ten states was completed. It also provided a strong basis for other follow up trainings that were provided
                         to the Ministry of Gender staff at the national and states levels. The training manuals are currently being used at the States level to conduct trainings to other staff on various
                         administrative and gender mainstreaming issues. The gender assessment and various institutional building activities supported by the project have become an anchor for the
                         Ministry’s current reorganization effort, strategy and program development. The work of the project under this component has also attracted the attention and support of other
                         development partners, who are now using the study as bases for their support to the Ministry.
