                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Economic Empowerment (Component 1): The project has funded 109 sub-projects in two phases, of which 93 CBO/NGOs have received 70% of their funding. This brings the total
                         disbursement of Component 1 to approximately 3.9 million USD out of a total of USD 4 million. All sub-projects are under implementation and include both farming and non-farm
                         activities. Based on preliminary site visits to select sub-projects, financing appears to have contributed to improving food security and increasing access to supplementary incomes for
                         participating women and their families. Ministry Construction (Component 2): The supervision consultants for the construction of the Ministry of Gender, Child and Social Welfare
                         have been selected. The design of the Gender Ministry has been approved by the Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning, the bidding documents require clearance by the
