The project\n            aims at utilizing these basic inputs for production of\n            calcium carbide, mainly for export, to help Bhutan earn\n            much-needed foreign exchange revenues for its economic\n            development. The project would augment the country's\n            limited industrial base, increase financial self-reliance\n            and help train manpower in industrial production, mining and\n            forestry. The project, with a capacity to produce 22,000\n            tons per year of calcium carbide, would be located at\n            Pasakha in Southern Bhutan. The project would include: (i) a\n            calcium carbide plant; (ii) limestone mining; (iii)\n            forestry; and (iv) charcoal plants. In addition, the project\n            provides for necessary infrastructure, technical assistance\n            and training."}, "docdt": "1985-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
