MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Bhutan
Calcium Carbide Prolect (Credit 1596-BHU)
Attached, for information, is a copy of a report entitled "Project
Completion Report on Bhutan - Calcium Carbide Project (Credit 1596-BHU)" prepared
by the Industry, Trade and Finance Division, Technical Department, South Asia
Regional Office.
The original project objective of constructing a calcium carbide
producing facility based on indigenous limestone and charcoal supplies has not
yet been achieved. Excessive appraisal optimism regarding Bhutan's high grade
limestone reserves and inadequate feasibility analysis of the charcoal production
component underlie the shortfalls vis-a-vis the original targets.   SDR 3.8
million out of the approved credit of SDR 9.4 million was cancelled.
Nevertheless, the project has had satisfactory overall results with
the economic rate of return at completion estimated at about 11% by the Region,
compared with 211 estimated at appraisal.
Institutional building aspects have been reasonably successful. The
company has been well managed and profitable despite 'higher than expected
production costs and strong market competition. Over half of the shares have
been acquired by private individuals and financial institutions.
Improved arrangements for domestic raw material supplies are crucial
to sustainability and justify continued follow up of the project by the Bank.
This will also enhance the foreign exchange earnings from this export oriented
investment whose inputs are at present largely imported.
No contribution to the PCR was received from Bhutan. An audit of the
project may be carried out at a later date because it is the first in the
industrial sector in Bhutan and its sustainability raises interesting and
important issues.

CALCIUM CARBIDE PROJECT
(CREDIT 1596-BHU)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Calcium Carbide
Project in Bhutan, for which Credit 1596-BHU for the amount of SDR 9.4 million
was approved on May 16, 1985. The credit was closed on June 30, 1991, but
disbursements were continued against commitments made before the closing date.
The total credit disbursement was SDR 5.57 million and the undisbursed amount of
SDR 3.67 million was cancelled. The last disbursement under the credit was on
July 31, 1991.
The PCR (Preface, Evaluation Summary, parts I and III) was prepared
by the Industry, Trade and Finance Division of the Asia Technical Department,
based substantially on information provided by the Borrower and the Beneficiary
Company. The Bank sent the Borrower and the Beneficiary Company Parts I and III
for their comments, and for them to prepare Part II, but this did not prove
possible within the time available.
Preparation of the PCR was started with the information provided by
the Beneficiary Company in late 1991 in response to the Bank's letter to the
company in August 1991. This was followed by a project completion mission to
Bhutan in January-February 1992. The PCR is based on the Staff Appraisal Report,
Credit and Project Agreements, the supervision reports, information provided by
the company and discussions during the project completion mission.

CALCIUM CARBIDE PROJECT
(Credit 1596-BHU)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
1.         This was developed as the first Bank operation in industrial sector
in Bhutan. The project objective was in line with Bhutan's plans to set up
capital intensive, relatively large, export oriented industries utilizing the
country's natural resources, where it has competitive advantage. In view of its
land locked location and its special relations with India, these enterprises are
to aim their products mainly at the large Indian market and help to reduce the
large trade gap between the two countries. The Bank group involvement in the
Project was expected to help Bhutan develop skills and capabilities in planning
for, preparing and implementation of such projects.
2.          Against the above background, the Project has aimed to produce
calcium carbide - a basic inorganic chemical with varied uses, mainly for export
to India. The Project was based on identified pockets of acceptable quality
limestone in Bhutan. Firewood available from logging operations in Bhutan's
forests was planned to be processed to charcoal, supplemented with wood from the
proposed captive plantation. The Project also aimed to use power from the Chukha
hydel station - otherwise exported to India.
Implementation Experience
3.          Tha appraisal and actual completion dates  of the Project are
presented in para 4 of Part III and reviewed in paras 5.02 to 5.05 of Part I. Due
to realistic assumption of zero dates in the SAR, the credit processing did not
result in any project implementation delays. The Carbide Component of the Project
was completed in time, within cost estimates, and commissioned successfully. The
plant operations stabilized soon and average capacity utilization of 71% could
be reached for the seven months of operation in 1988. Drilling and sampling work
carried out on the two main identified sources of limestone at Hauri Khola and
Kaleshwar concluded that the above deposits cannot provide sustained limestone
supplies to the Project. Investment on the Limestone Component was, therefore,
suspended and a search launched to identify alternative supply sources. The
Company has not yet identified a suitable source. The Project had envisaged the
setting up of seven charcoal plants by the Company - promoting another seven
plants in the private sector, under the Charcoal Component. Experience with the
demonstration plant  set up by Tashi Commercial Corporation,  the project
promoters, showed that such large charcoal plants are not feasible in Bhutan due
to inadequate labor availability and high cost of assembling and transporting



- iv -
required quantities of firewood to the plant. The Company, therefore, decided to
abandon the Charcoal Component. The Project included a Forestry Component under
which the Company was to develop 1000 ha of forest plantation near the plant
site. The Government could so far release only 324 ha away from the plant site,
in East Bhutan. About 275 ha has been cleared and planted and about 100 ha is
ready for harvesting. There has been no further progress with this component.
Results
4.          The project results are summarized in para 6 of Part III and reviewed
in paras 6.01 to 6.05 of Part I. The carbide facilities have been in continuous
operation from June 1988. The production levels were at little below 80% of the
rated capacity in 1989 and 1990. The Company has succeeded in raising the
production level to 112% of the rated capacity in 1991 and expects to sustain
production at about this level. The Company's marketing arrangements have been
adequate for marketing the entire output at good prices, maintaining inventories
within reasonable levels. However, the economic rate of return of the project has
declined to 11.7% against the SAR estimate of 20.7%, mainly as a result of the
(i) higher costs of labor due to overall labor shortage and impact of RGB's wage
and immigration policies, (ii) purchase of limestone and carbon materials from
distant sources, necessitated by the inability to obtain supplies from own local
sources, and (iii) the higher economic cost (Nu 0.27 per kwh) of power now
assumed compared with the SAR (Nu 0.20 per kwh). For same reasons the present
estimated financial rate of return is 12.5% (before tax) against the SAR estimate
of 23.5%.
Sustainability
5.          Various factors relating to Project sustainability are reviewed in
paras 7.01 to 7.06 of Part I. With continuance of the present management
arrangements, the Company should be able to maintain production at a little over
rated capacity and market the entire output. However, the Indian carbide market
has been growing at a slower rate than was envisaged in the SAR. India also has
large idle capacity. Potential for export to other neighbouring countries is
limited and may not be competitive against present imports from China.
Competition can, therefore, stiffen further. At present the plant depends for
most of its raw material requirements on imports from India involving both supply
uncertainties and high transportation costs. The present power tariff, which is
below its economic value, may have to be revised upwards and will further reduce
profitability. To ensure sustained successful operation of the plant and to
further improve its viability, it is, therefore, necessary for the Company to
develop and implement a well defined plan - with the full support and involvement
of the RGB, for obtaining economic supplies of limestone and charcoal from within
Bhutan.
6.          This plan should include, in the case of limestone, (i) continued
mining at appropriate levels at Hauri Khola, (ii) developing working arrangements
on obtaining limestone supplies from Kaleshwar, (iii) working closely with the
RGB on obtaining and testing limestone supplies from Rongri and (iv) continuing
to look for other possible sources within Bhutan. In the meanwhile, the Company
will have to supplement local supplies with purchases from India, carfully
planned to minimize costs without facing undue supply risks.



- v -
7.          In the case of charcoal,  it is fully recognized that the only
feasible option is for the Company to develop a large enough plantation which
will provide adequate firewood on a sustained basis for conversion to charcoal.
RGB has recognized this position and has, in principle, agreed to allocate 8,500
ha, considered adequate for the purpose. However, this decision has not been
adequately supported by RGB's Forest Department, who are yet to identify and
allocate the land. The Forest Department appears to be reluctant to place such
a large area of forest land outside its control. RGB is being urged to instruct
the Forest Department and the Company to work out an appropriate program and
inform the Bank.
Findings and Lessons Learned
8.          The Project has brought out the difficulties of planning smaller
projects based on raw material sources to be developed specifically to meet the
project requirements and, therefore, the need for additional caution during
appraisal. The components for developing these sources are relatively small and
do not receive the same degree of scrutiny as in the case of larger captive
resource based projects. They are, therefore, subject to considerably increased
risks. While in the present Project, the Company has managed to maintain
production at good levels using supplies from other sources, the higher costs of
these supplies have reduced project viability. The Bank will have to maintain
continuing pressure on RGB and the Company to develop and implement well defined
plans for improving raw material supplies.

Country                  Bhutan
Sector                   Industry
2.    Background
2.01        Bhutan is a small land locked country located in west Himalayan
mountain ranges between India and the Tibetan region of China. More than half of
Bhutan is covered with forests. Bhutan also has relatively large mineral
deposits, especially limestone and dolomite. The deposits include cmall
quantities of high quality limestone at several locations. In addition, Bhutan
has large hydroelectric power generation potential. A large 336 MW hydroelectric
project has been completed at Chukha in Bhutan in 1985/86 with Indian assistance
and the surplus power from this project - after meeting Bhutan's own limited
requirements, is exported to India.
2.02        Bhutan's economy is essentially based on agriculture, which provides
employment to about 90I of the population. Industrial activity in Bhutan is very
limited and at present the IDA financed Calcium Carbide plant is the largest
industrial enterprise in the country. As the relatively small local population
is already engaged mostly in agriculture, Bhutan has opted for capital intensive,
relatively large size export oriented industries utilizing the country's natural
resources, where it has a competitive advantage. In view of its land locked
location and its special relations with India, these enterprises aim their
products at the large Indian market. This would help to reduce the large trade
gap between the two countries. The Calcium Carbide Project (Project) was
conceived and implemented in the above background.
3.    Project Objectives and DescriDtion
3.01        Proiect Obiectives:      The main objective of the Project was to
produce - for the first time in Bhutan, calcium carbide, a basic inorganic
chemical with varied uses, mainly for export to India. The Project was to obtain
its main inputs - high grade limestone, charcoal and electric power from within
Bhutan. The Project was based on identified pockets of acceptable quality
limestone in Bhutan. Firewood available from logging operations in Bhutan's
forests was planned to be processed to charcoal, supplemented with wood from the



- 2 -
proposed captive plantation. The Project also aimed to use power from Chukha
hydel station. The Project was planned to develop Bhutan's natural resources and
improve financial self reliance through exports to India and other neighbouring
countries.
3.02        Proiect Description:    The Project has been planned with annual
capacity of 22,000 tons of calcium carbide based on limestone and wood charcoal.
The project included the following components.
(a)   The Calcium Carbide Component, which included a 12 MVA calcium
carbide submerged electric arc furnace with associated facilities,
a 100 tpd lime kiln, raw material storage and handling facilities
and other utilities, infrastructure and service facilities.
(b)   The Limestone Minina Component, to develop mining, testing and
transportation facilities for limestone at the identified deposits.
(c)   The Forestry and Charcoal Component, to set up seven 1000 tpy
capacity charcoal plants in selected areas, to promote privately
owned charcoal plants and to develop a 1000 ha forest plantation
near the carbide plant at Phuntsholing.
3.03 Except for a technical assistance credit (Credit 1416-BHU) in 1984 under
which drilling and sampling work on limestone deposits in Hauri Khola and
Kaleshwar were financed, the Project was the first IDA operation in industrial
sector in Bhutan.
4.    Proiect Design and Organization
4.01        The Project was prepared by Tashi Commercial Corporation (TCC) - a
well managed private corporation in Bhutan. Bhutan Carbide and Chemicals Ltd.
(BCCL) was formed by TCC jointly with the Royal Government of Bhutan (RGB) to
implement and operate the Project, TCC was assisted in project preparation - on
the carbide component, by Industrial Consultants Bureau Private Ltd. (ICB) - an
Indian engineering and consultancy company. TCC was supported in the preparation
of the limestone component by the Department of Mining and Geology (DMG) of RGB
and the Geological Survey of India (GSI). Both were already engaged on mineral
exploration and drilling in Bhutan - with emphasis on limestone and dolomite. TCC
was supported on the forestry component by the Bhutan Forest Department and on
the charcoal component by an Indian consultant. Based on information provided to
the World Bank missions during appraisal in June 1984 and post-appraisal in
September 1984, the conceptual basis for the project was appropriate. However,
while the carbide component has been implemented efficiently and is operating
successfully, the limestone, forestry and charcoal components have faced
difficulties, as further described in later sections. As a result adequate
supplies of limestone and charcoal from within Bhutan are yet to be developed and
the Project now relies heavily on their imports from India and other countries.
4.02        BCCL was assisted in project management by Shriram Projects and
Engineering Services (SPES) of the DCM group, an established Indian company with
extensive operating experience in calcium carbide production. The calcium carbide
component of the project was implemented under two main contracts. The furnace



contract was awarded to Elkem of Norway and financed with a Government of Norway
grant of 35 million Norwegian Kroners. Following competitive bidding, the
engineering contract for the carbide component was awarded to ICB (India) and
financed with KFAED funds. The above arrangements for the carbide cmponent proved
satisfactory.
5.    Prolect Implementation
5.01        Credit Effectiveness and Proiect Schedule:         When   the   Board
approved the credit on May 16, 1985, SPES - the technical advisors, were already
in position. BCCL has also signed the contract with ICB - the engineering
contractor. The furnace contract with Elkem of Norwy has also been signed, but
it became effective in June 1985, when the Norwegian credit was approved. Signing
of the IDA credit on May 23, 1985 and its effectiveness on July 8, 1985 ensured
that the credit processing schedule did not result in any project implementation
delays.
5.02        Carbide Component:        The SAR had envisaged completion of the
carbide component in 36 months from the date of effectiveness of the contract
with the engineering and furnace contractors. Based on July 1, 1985 as the
project zero date, the carbide component was completed and commissioned in June
1988 - well on the SAR schedule. (Annexure - I). There was a delay of about four
months in completing the placement of orders and about eight months in completing
the civil and structural works. However delivery of equipment and supplies was
completed about five months ahead of SAR schedule. As a result, erection could
be completed and the plant commissioned in time. The plant operations stabilized
soon and average capacity utilization of 71 percent could be reached for the
seven months of operation in 1988.
5.03        Limestone Component:    While  Bhutan has  very  large  limestone/
dolomite reserves, material suitable for calcium carbide production is quite
limited because of special properties required, such as high CaO, low MgO, Low
S and P and good thermal stability. Such limestone occurs in Bhutan in different
small scattered pockets. Given the small annual project limestone requirement of
less than 50,000 tons, detailed investigations and development of mining plans -
normal in larger mineral based projects, was not completed before appraisal. The
project was appraised on the basis of proven reserves of about 600,000 tons of
limestone in four nearby deposits - Hauri Khola, Purbia Khola, Kaleshwar and
Mirchang, and the expectation that the above deposits may provide a total of
about 1.4 million tons of limestone adequate for 27 years of operation. While
detailed drilling and sampling work has been carried out at Purbia Khola and
Mirchang, work started in Kaleshwar and Hauri Rhola only by end of 1984 under an
IDA financed technical assistance credit. The above work concluded that the above
two deposits cannot provide sustained limestone supplies to the Project. BCCL,
therefore, suspended its investment program on the limestone component and
launched a search for other suitable sources in Bhutan. An adequate domestic
source is yet to be identified.
5.04        Charcoal Component:       The SAR has envisaged that the Project will
meet its entire charcoal requirements - amounting to about 14,260 tons at 90Z
capacity utilization, from within Bhutan and will supplement with other carbon
sources from India as required. It was envisaged that seven charcoal plants, each



- 4 -
with a capacity of 1000 tpy, will be set up by BCCL under the Project. These,
along with the expected private sector plants (one by TCC and six by others),
were to meet the full charcoal requirements of the Project. Experience with the
TCC plant, however, showed that large charcoal plants are not feasible in Bhutan
due to inadequate labor availability and high cost of assembling and transporting
required quantities of firewood to the plant. BCCL, therefore, decided to abandon
the Charcoal Component.
5.05        Forestry Component:       The Project includes a forestry component to
supplement available sources of fuel wood for charcoal production. This component
had envisaged that BCCL will develop a 1000 ha forest plantation close to the
carbide plant at Phuntsholing. This area was to be planted with short rotation,
high yielding and self-renewing species. Work on this component was to start in
June-July 1987 with clearing and replanting of 100 ha each year. However, as
adequate forest land was not available near the plant site, RGB leased 1000 ha
of forest area in Bhangtar-Samdrupjongkhar (Eastern Bhutan). RGB has, however,
so far released only 324 ha of land, of which 275 ha has been cleared and
planted. The first 100 ha was ready for harvesting in October 1991 but has not
been harvested due to the present politically disturbed conditions in Bhutan. RGB
has not progressed further with leasing additional forest land to BCCL.
5.06        Procurement:       Even though,  the Project was the first large
operation in the industrial sector in Bhutan, BCCL and its consultants were
responsive to the Bank group procurement guidelines. As a result, procurement of
goods and services financed with IDA funds for the carbide component proceeded
satisfactorily and generally in conformity with the Bank Group guidelines.
Procurement for the other componests suffered for reasons not related to the
procurement procedures.
5.07        Proiect Costs:    The final project cost (para 5 of Part III) was
about Nu.249 million (US$18.81 million at average exchange rate of Nu.13.25 per
US$) against the SAR estimate of Nu.311 million (US$23.94 million). The lower
project cost was mainly due to poor progress with the limestone (US$0.43 million
against SAR estimate of US$0.82 million), charcoal (US$0.06 million against SAR
estimate of US$1.32 million) and forestry components (US$0.17 million against SAR
estimate of US$2.24 million. The actual project cost for the carbide component
was US$16.63 million against the SAR estimate of US$15.56 million (including
physical and price contingencies). The increase of about 7Z was mainly due to
increased employee housing facilities now provided. Because of poor progress with
three of the components, the IDA and KFAED funds could not be fully utilized. At
the request of BCCL and RGB, part of the surplus funds were utilized for the
import of steel sheets and anthracite coal.
5.08        Disbursements:    The appraisal and actual credit disbursements are
given in para 3 of Part III. The actual disbursements have been significantly
lower than appraisal estimates. Even with the financing of steel sheets for drum
making, the total disbursement was only SDR 5.57 million against SAR estimate of
SDR 9.40 million. The credit effective date was July 8, 1985 and the original
credit closing date was June 30, 1991. A GOB request in late 1991 for extension
of closing date was not agreed to by IDA. Disbursements were, however, allowed
upto October 31, 1991 for eligible expenditures incurred before the closing date.
The outstanding credit amount of SDR 3.83 million has been cancelled.



- 5 -
5.09        Loan Allocaton: 'The original allocation and actual disbursements
for the credit are shown in para 5C of Part III. An amount of SDR 96,000 was
reallocated to the forestry component in August 1985. A request was made in
August 1989 by the RGB that funds remaining unutilized under the IDA credit be
reallocated for the purchase of CRCA sheets and anthracite coal. Following a
supervision mission in early 1990, an amount of SDR 3.4 million was allocated on
April 23, 1990 for the purchase of CRCA sheets and coal.
6.    Proiect Results
6.01        Proiect Obiectives:      The Project has met successfully only a part
of its main objectives. The industrial facility for the production of calcium
carbide has been successfully implemented - within schedule and cost estimates.
The facility has been succefully commissioned and is operating at good production
levels. BCCL has succeeded in achieving a share of about 30% of the Indian
market, selling in 1991 about 24,000 tpy of carbide - corresponding to about 110
percent of its rated capacity, mostly in North and East India. Except for small
exports to land-locked Nepal, BCCL has not succeeded with exports to other
neighbouring countries, which could enable Bhutan to earn hard currency for
servicing the foreign exchange loans. This is mainly due to the low prices at
which imports are made in these countries, in the past from Poland and now from
China. The SAR had envisaged that the basic inputs - limestone, charcoal and
electric power, will be obtained from within Bhutan. It was estimated that these
inputs will constitute about 44% of the total variable costs. However, due to
difficulties in implementing the limestone, forestry and charcoal components, the
present local share of the total variable costs is only about 16%. As a result,
the net earnings to Bhutan arising from carbide sales to India is significantly
lower than was envisaged in the SAR. The company has, however, shown a marginal
profit even in its first year of operation as a result of good production levels
and efficient marketing.
6.02        Physical Results: Erection of the carbide production facilities was
completed in June 1988, but trial operation of the carbide furnace was begun even
earlier, in May 1988. By September 1988, the capacity utilization was about 79%.
The average capacity utilization in 1988 was 71%, againt the SAR estimate of 45S.
The capacity utilization increased to 78S in 1989 and 79S in 1990 - both
comparable with the SAR estimates. Production in 1989 was lower than the
potential due to annual turnaround and a few mechanical constraints. Production
in 1991 was about 24,740 tons, corresponding to 112% of the rated capacity. BCCL
has targetted for a production of 24,000 tons in 1992. Performance review of the
various facilities indicate that it should be possible to operate them at
marginally over rated capacity on a sustained basis.
6.05        Economic and Financial Rates of Return:   Appraisal   and   actual
economic rates of return (ERR) of the Project are summarized in Tabel 6B of Part
III. The actual ERRs relate only to the carbide plant component, since the other
components have not been completed. The actual ERR has been calculated using the
export border price of calcium carbide to India - the main market for the BCCL
product. The economic cost of electric power from 1992 onwards is assumed to be
Nu 0.27 per kwh, the present tariff at which Chukha power is sold to India.
Production has been assumed at actual levels upto 1991 and at rated capacity from
1992. The actual ERR for the project is 11.7% against the SAR estimate of 20.7%.



- 6 -
At the expected annual production level of about 24,000 tpy, the ERR wil improve
to 13.2% The lower actual ERR is due to (i) the higher costs of labor, (ii)
purchase of limestone and carbon materials from more distant sources and (iii)
the higher economic cost of power now assumed. Calcium carbide from China is
being marketed in neighbouring countries at about US$400 per ton - well below
actual production costs and, therefore, not reflecting full economic costs. If
the above price is used as economic value, the project will have a marginal ERR
of 3.7%. The SAR and actual FRRs of the project are summarized in Table 6C of
Part III. The actual FRR at above levels is 12.5% (before tax) against the SAR
estimate of 23.5%.
6.06        Financial Performance:  The  SAR  estimated  and  actual  financial
performance of BCCL from 1988 to 1991 are summarized in Annexure - IV. 1990
profits declined to Nu 1.87 million from Nu 3.62 million for 1989 due to cost
increases which have not been offset by production and price increases.
Profitability has improved significantly in 1991 to about Nu 29 million (based
on preliminary balance sheets) mainly due to considerably improved production
level, but was still much below the SAR estimate of about Nu 75 million. While
sale realisations are at about SAR levels, production costs are much higher
(Annexure - V). Present wages in Bhutan for both local and Indian personnel are
much higher than were envisaged in the SAR due to overall labor shortages and RGB
wage/labor policies. This also impacts on costs of locally procured limestone and
charcoal - both labor intensive operations. Cost increases are mostly due to high
delivered costs of limestone and carbon materials procured from India. SAR had
expected that a large share of these inputs will be produced captively by BCCL
with nominal investments. The 1992 company budget projects a profit of about Nu
42 million - the increase mainly the result of more rational plan for procuring
inputs. Further profitability improvements will be possible only if lower cost
sources for limestone and charcoal are developed within Bhutan.
6.07        Impact of Proiect:        The project has created confidence that
medium size industrial projects can be planned, implemented and operated
efficiently in Bhutan. The project has demonstrated the soundness of RGB policy
on industrial ownership under which enterprises  are initially promoted with
significant government equity, but are privatized over time when they become
commercially successful. BCCL was initially promoted with share capital of 802
by RGB and 20% by TCC. By April 1990, RGB has already sold 43.7% of the total
share capital to private Bhutanese individuals and later a further 10% was sold
to Bhutanese financial institutions. Present RGB share holding in BCCL is only
26.3% of the total BCCL equity. Following the success of the carbide project, a
large ferroalloy project - based on similar technology, is being promoted near
the present plant location with proposed equity participation of RGB (25%), TCC
(20%), Marubeni (20%), BCCL shareholders (25%) and the public (10%).
7.    Project Sustainabilitv
7.01        The carbide production facilities can continue to be operated and
maintained efficiently on sustained basis with continuation of the present
management arrangements. However, the financial and economic performance of the
company can improve further only if less costly local sources are developed for
limestone and charcoal. Cost reduction measures are also essential to sustain
BCCL's present market share in India. BCCL's market in India will depend on



- 7 -
continuance of the present special arrangements between Bhutan and India and
restrictions on free import of carbide into India. Exports to other countries -
to earn free foreign exchange, may be possible only with Bangladesh and Nepal and
will be limited due to small demands - not likely to grow fast, in these
countries. Also, BCCL material has to compete with imports at the low
international prices.
7.02        As against SAR expectation that all the required limestone will be
obtained from own mining within Bhutan, only about 50,100 tons - from several
different locations, could be obtained out of total purchase of about 200,700
tons (Annexure II) upto end of 1991. When it was concluded (para 5.03) that Hauri
Khola and Kaleshwar cannot provide limestone on sustained basis, BCCL expended
considerable effort and resources searching for other suitable reserves at
Gidakom, Rongri, Geylegphug and Sha Bhel. Limestone from these reserves - while
of high chemical purity, are crystalline and form excessive fines during
calcination. Studies to use the fines by adopting hollow electrodes in the
furnace or after briquetting have not confirmed feasibility. At present, the only
assured local source of limestone is Hauri Khola from which BCCL plans to mine
about 12,000 tons in 1992 and about 15,000 tons per year for another five years.
Following the finding that Kaleshwar cannot support sustained mining, the
reserves have been leased to a mini cement plant. However, if selective mining
techniques are adopted as in Hauri Khola, Kaleshwar could provide about 15,000
tons per year for about five years. This requires BCCL to enter into a swapping
arrangement with the cement plant providing it with cement grade limestone from
an appropriate source against supply of carbide grade material. According to DGM
investigations, Rongri deposits have a belt of suitable quality limestone with
about 0.8 million tons of reserve. BCCL has obtained about 2000 tons of Rongri
material - reportedly not from the above belt, and finds that it forms about 35
to 40Z of fines during calcination. DGM and BCCL will now jointly obtain fresh
samples from the identified belt and study further. Till an appropriate source
in Bhutan is identified, the gap in supply will have to be met through purchases
from Meghalaya and Katni in India.
7.03        With the BCCL decision to abandon the Charcoal component (para 5.04),
private contaractors were encouraged to produce charcoal using traditional ways.
After some initial enthusiasm, several local contractors have abandoned
production. As a result, local charcoal supplies, which were 3575 tons in 1988
declined to 1451 tons in 1991 (Annexure III). In 1992, BCCL expects to purchase
about 8000 tons of charcoal from Tamilnadu (5000) and Meghalaya (3000) in India.
Both BCCL and RGB agree that it will be possible to develop assured local
charcoal supplies only if about 8500 ha of forestry plantation is developed by
BCCL. But RGB is yet to identify and release adequate areas of suitable land. The
development and implementation of an adequate forestry component with the full
support of RGB is essential for providing assured charcoal supplies to the
Project.
7.04        The Project continues to pay Nu 0.20 per kwh for  power used under
an agreement with RGB valid for five years. With the increase in tariff on power
exports to India and the average local tariff of Nu 0.40, there are questions on
the present appropriateness of the tariff to the Project. RGB has conveyed its
intention to revise the tariff when it comes up for review in 1993. IDA is having
a consultant study carried out on power tariffs in Bhutan, which is scheduled to



-8-
be completed by May 1992. The power tariff to the project- is expected to be
revised in 1993 taking into account the recommendations of the study. This report
uses a tariff of Nu. 0.27 - in 1992 constant terms, the rate at which power is
now exported to India. Typically, the higher tariff will reduce BCCL'S
profitability in 1992 from Nu 42.12 million to 35.57 million.
7.05        The SAR has estimated that the Indian demand for calcium carbide will
grow from 96,000 tons in 1984/85 to 141,895 tons by 1989/90. According to BCCL
estimates, the 1990/91 demand was only about 120,000 tons. The lower demand has
been due to slower growth in demand for dissolved acetylene, the decline in
demand for acetylene black due to declining demand for dry cells and the
continued use of imported desulphurisation compound by the steel industry.
Electric arc welding is the preferred metal welding technique and gas flame is
used only in a limited way for brazing non-ferrous metals, metal cutting, welding
thin sheets and for applications requiring low gradients of temperature to avoid
cracking, as in welding of cast iron. For some of these applications - especially
welding of the the thinner sheets, LPG is a competitor to acetylene. Local
production of desulphurisation compound requires close coordination between the
carbide supplier and the user steel plants, which has not developed so far. BCCL
is discussing with Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO) the possibilities of
setting up production facilities to supply TISCO requirements. While the growth
rate of carbide demand will remain limited, India will continue to depend on
carbide for the above applications.
7.06        The Indian carbide industry has an installed capacity of about
150,000 tpy in larger plants. In addition, there are several smaller plants on
which reliable information on capacity and production are not available. Three
of the larger plants, with a combined capacity of 52,000 tpy, are now closed. It
is reported that high capital costs due to poor implementation, management
problems and uncertain power supply have been responsible for the closures.
Plants are also switching between carbide and ferroalloys depending on relative
profitability. BCCL's ability to market its entire output of over 24,000 tons in
1991 at attractive prices indicates that an adequate market existed for the
efficient producers.
8.    Bank Performance
8.01        The IDA missions played an important role during project preparation,
especially on major areas like (i) raw material, (ii) project management, and
(iii) project cofinancing. During implementation, IDA missions have been
responsive to various implementation problems and have assisted in arriving at
and implementing appropriate solutions. The missions have conveyed their concern
to RGB on several occassions on the poor progress with development of limestone,
charcoal and firewood sources from within Bhutan. When BCCL was concerned that
poor quality of Indian CRCA sheets could adversely affect possible exports, IDA
agreed to reallocation of part of the credit savings for import of CRCA sheets.
On the other hand, IDA missions, BCCL and its project consultants were unduly
optimistic and failed to fully recognize the problems in developing Bhutan's
limestone, fuelwood and charcoal potential - given the quality requirements of
the project and development problems specific to Bhutan.



-9-
9     Borrower's P-rformance        1
9.01        BCCL's association of TCC - who had substantial understanding of
Bhutan, has been of considerable help in the planning, implementation and
operation of the Project and in maintaining close coordination with RGB. BCCL
management Has been responsive to various suggestions of the IDA missions in
building up an efficient project implementation organization. This has enabled
the timely implementation of the carbide component of the project at reasonable
costs. BCCL management was always cooperative and provided IDA with all the
requested for information in time.
10    Proiect Relationship
10.01       IDA's relationships with RGB and BCCL on this Project were quite
cordial. BCCL has also maintained good relationship with RGB and its various
consultants and contractors. As a result, project related discussions were
constructive and positive.
11.   Consulting Services
11.01       The Projet utilized the following major consultancy services:
Puruose                  Comoanv                               Country
Technical Advisor        Shriram Projects & Engineering        India
Services (SPES) of DCM Group
Engineering Contractor  Industrial Consulting Bureau (ICB)  India
Furnace Contractor       Elkem Technology A/S (ETA)            Norway
On the overall, the above three firms provided the sevices contracted
for efficiently and in the best interests of the Project resulting in timely
completion of the Project within reasonable costs.
12.   Proiect Documentation and Data
12.01       The Credit documents for Credit 1596-Bhu have been adequate and
appropriate for achieving the project objectives in all the key areas. The staff
appraisal report - along with the documentation in the project files, BCCL
provided information and mission reports have provided adequate background
information for effective review of project implementation. BCCL has provided the
requested additional information on the Project - prior to and during the
completion mission. This Project Completion Report has been prepared by an IDA
mission in January 1992 consolidating the above information.

d)  Charcoal            July 1987     Abandoned      -
-----------------------------------------------------------------__
(i) The calcium carbide component, which accounted for about
80% of the total investment was completed well within time and at
close to estimated costs and commissioned successfully in May 1988.
(ii) The limestone component was initially delayed due to delays
in completion of drilling, sampling and analysis and preparation of
the report. Since the report concluded that the earlier identified
sources cannot be relied for sustained supplies, other locations
have been studied but no suitable deposit has yet been identified
for development (iii)  The forestry component has been delayed
since the RGB is yet to identify and release the full 1000 ha of
forest land for plantation. (iv) The charcoal component has been
abandoned since it is now considered not feasible to economically
collect and process 5000 tpy of firewood in each of the plants.

The actual total installed cost of about US$17.3 million is only about
US$1.7 million or 11 higher than the SAR estimate for the carbide component
alone of about US$15.6 million. This was due to some expenditure incurred on
other components - without significant progress, and additional worker housing
provided under the Project.

Capcity utilization is assumed at actual levels upto 1991 and at levels indicated
from 1992. The carbide price of US$480 per ton corresponds to the present netback
on exports to India. The price of US$400 corresponds more closely to
international prices. Costs and benefits are based on actuals upto and including
1991 and on 1992 budget for the subsequent years. The 1991 production and 1992
budget correspond to about 110Z of capacity. Conservatively, sustained production
at rated capacity is assumed for the future years. Economic power tariff is
assumed to be Nu 200 per mwh (in current terms) upto 1991 and Nu 270 per mawh (in
1992 terms) beyond 1992. In view of the relatively low share of local costs, no
conversion factor has been applied to local costs.
