i.        Up to the early 1950's Paraguay's road transport system was relatively
undeveloped and a factor retarding economic growth.    The Government has since
pursued programs in the transport field mainly aimed at building a basi.c infra-
structure..  Since 1951 the Bank Group has played a major role in assisting
these programs through five loans and credits for four projects involvi.ng roads
and a port, and totaling about US$ 14 million equivalent.    It also served as
Executing Agency for a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) study of ag-
riculturaL potential and road needs in Eastern Paraguay.
ii.       The transport system is now fairly well developed;   however, railway
operationis are uneconomic. and the nearlv eight-fold exDansion of the road net-
work since 1950 to its present 6,300 km length has not been matched by the main-
tenance effort, with thAe result that most roads are in poor condition and trans-
port costs are high.    Initial steps toward remedying the road maintenance prob-
lem were tak-en in the first road construction aMd maintenanne pnoject (Credit
12-PA/Loan 396-PA), under which some of the most urgently needed maintenance
er1inrnmi. uvan --,+hansed a1nd.a ma,st, r..air.+enar.ce plar. was prepared=  L f n- I-
year maintenance program (1970-1973) was recently developed from this plan and
is the ba:is for the Grvvernmentls request for a second highway r.+n7te.vifsO loan.
iii.   Theproposed project crsists of 4the foryar h-i.hw-      ma-inr.-r.ce
program wlhch is to be implemented with the help of consultants, and which pro-
vikdes for t=,e1 4,,.rove.-,en,t of' ma-nr.enance operatirs .eprhs  ofP .=;in4en=
ance, shop and other equipment, the extension and improvement of workshops and
twhe trainring of personrel.  The total capital cost of the program is estimated
at US$ 6.3 million equivalent toward which the Bank would provide US$ 6.0 mil-
lion equivalent, representing the foreign   exchange component, and the u(vern-
ment the remainder.    Over the four years of the program (1970-1973) the Gov-
ernment would also provide a total of about US$ 7 million equivalent in ear-
marked revenues from specific taxes to meet recurrent maintenance expendlitures.
Execution of the project will be the responsibility of The Ministry of rublic
Works and Communications (MOPC) through its National Highway Department (Viali-
dad).   The proposed project will provide a suitably staffed and equipped or-
ganization capable of maintaining the existing and future road network under
the MOPC;s responsibility and thus of reducing overall road transport costs.
The economic rate of return for the maintenance program, in terms of reduced
vehicle operating costs alone, is estimated to range from 18% to 51% depending
on the assumptions made regarding the estimated traffic growth and the extent
of unit vehicle operating cost savings.
iv.       While, on the basis of the purchasing schedule of equipment and its
economic life a shorter term would be warranted, the proposed term of *the loan
of US$ 6.0 million would be 20 years including a four-year grace period, on
country economic grounds.

i.  ±NTROD±CTION
1.01      The Republic of Paraguay has requested a loan to help finance a four-
year prograim to improve highway maintenance.  This would be the fifth project
of the Ban]/IDA in the transport sector in Paraguay and the second for highway
maintenance.
1.02      The first Bank loan of US$ 5 million to Paraguay in 1951 was mainly
for an agriLcultural project, but it provided about US$ 1 million for equipment
to construct feeder roads.   In 1961 an IDA Credit of US$ 6 million (12-PA)
was made for the reconstruction and paving of the Asuncion - Encarnaciorn road
(330 km), the purchase of the most urgently needed road maintenance equipment
and the preparation of a master road maintenance plan.   This Credit was sup-
plemented in 1964 by Loan 396-PA of US$ 2.2 million to cover increased construc-
tion costs.   The master maintenance plan, prepared in 1967 under this Loan and
Credit and updated subsequntly by the Government, has been the basis for the
four-year maintenance program which constitutes the proposed orolect.
1.03      A road loan in 1966 of US$ 2.1 million (413-PA) is hA1nino to finnncA
the recanstruction and paving of the Coronal Oviedo - Villarica road (43 km)
and feasibilitv studies of about 45O km of roads.  The roads for study were
identified under a UNDP study which was carried out during 1964-67 on the agri-
cultural potential and road neA& of rastern Paraguay, the B.nk acting as Exe-
cuting Agercy.
1.04      In 1965, a loan of US$ 2.8 million (437-PA) was made for the port of
Asunnion.   ThiA prnvnct, has: beer. Adelayed .+vil recntl   byporotrctr

2. BACKGROUND
A. The Country and Its Econonw
2.01      Paraguay is a landlocked country in the middle of South America,
bordering on Bolivia to the north, Argentina to the west and south, and Blrazil
to the east., It is about 00,000 km2in area, i.e. about three-quarters of the
size of France. The country is divided by the Paraguay River, which is un-
bridged and crossAe Paraguay frnm north to south, Joining the Parana River at
Corrientes in Argentina. The two rivers constitute Paraguay's most important
tranansrt lI nk to the sea - West of the Psraigay Ri ver is the Ghaco;  a snarselv
populated region (245 000 km2) which, except in its desert-like northern part,
serves mostly for cattle raising and some agricultural production.East of the
river (160,000 km2) are the major population centers. About 80% of the country's
population of 2.2 million and most of the country's economic activity are lo-
cated in the "Triangle" roughly defined by Asuncion, the country's capital,
Encarnacion and Puerto Presidente Stroessner. The country is mostly flat or
gently rolling, the soil is generally good, with the exception of the northern
ChaGs. and the climnate allnws evar-rntind cnltivation.

in the 1960's. Paraguay' s f-uture developmlenb pruspects are considered to be
relatively grood, with the overall economic growth estimated to continue at a
rate oI about 5%.
B. The Transport Sector
2.03      General:  The provision oI adequate transportation facilities will
continue to be important for the economic development of Paraguay. In view of
the uneven dlistribution of population in the country, the Government has pur-
sued an intensive internal colonization policy, and major transport links have
been provided to support these efforts and to integrate scattered centerS of
agricultural and industrial production into the national economy. As a result,
the transport sector has received the largest share of public investments in
recent years, and a solid core of transport infrastructure now exists. Empha-
sis is now to be given to the productive sectors of the economy, and care is
needed to select future transport investments in concert with specific develop-
ment programs, particularly as the Governmaent's financial resources are limited.
2.04      Road transport is the main mode of internal transport for goods and
passengers. Railway traffic has decreased continuously since the early 1.950's.
Internal river transport is unimportant except for timber rafting and some cab-
otage shipping on the Paraguay and Parana rivers. Domestic air transport is a
useful complement to surface transport, especially to outlying towns.



2.05      The main international transDort outlet is the Paraguav-Parana river
system which, under favorable water level conditions, can be negotiated lby small
Ocean-0oirng vnSsRl9 tim to the nort of AsirnGioni.  Most goodsn  htj-,v,r. have to
be transshipped at Buenos Aires (1,600 Km from Asuncion) which leads to high
transport costs.   About q95  of in+Arn"tirnnqa +traeide i8 qhinnti via this rtAo_+

Brazil to the Atlantic port of Paranagua has provided a new link to the sea
which r,may become competitLie  With the river route, e.g. for  gh-value perish-
able export goods.
2.06      Highways: Paraguay's road network has grown nearly eight-fold since
lY>U.   It totalled 6,;250 In in 1968, of which aDout 650 IKm were pavea, L:,U0 
gravelled and 4,600 km earth surfaced.    Details of the highway sector are given
in Chapter 3.
2.07      Railways:  The state-owned Presidente Carlos Antonio Lopez (PCOAL) rail-
way crosses the Triangle from Asuncion to Encarnacion (376 km) and links with
the Argentine railway (General Urquiza) by ferry boat.    The PCAL has a branch
line from San Salvador (about 170 km from Asuncion) to Abai (63 km).    Ilt is run
by a semi-autonomous Government agency under the responsibility of MOPC. Traf-
fic on the POAL railway has decreased continuously during the last two docades.
Passenger traffic has fallen from over 2 million per year in the early 1950's to
an average of about 170,000 annually in the period 1966-1968.    Goods traffic,
about 180,000 tons in 1959, averaged about 85,000 tons in 1967/68.    Operating
deficits have risen over the years to a level of nearly US$ 0.8 million equiva-
lent in 1968.
2.08      There appears to be little prospect of improving the railway's situ-
ation, given the short haul distances involved, low traffic volumes, and compe-
tition from parallel highways.    There has been recognition of this for some
years and expenditures have been limited to maintaining minimal services.     The
economic viability of the railway relative to road transport is now beinlg stud-
ied as part of the highway feasibility and engineering studies included Ln the
second road project under Loan 443-PA (para. 1.03 and Annex).    These should be
finished before the end of 1969 and are exDeted to provide a sound basis for a
decision to be taken by the Government on the future of the railway.    The Gov-
ernment has apreed that it will oonnslt with thA RAnk on thA finrdinos of thA
railway studies and on the implementation of any recommendations resulting

C.   Transport Coordination
2.12       Paraguay has not developed a comprehensive transportation poILcy, and
existing institutional arrangements for transport coordination are inadequate.
The Centra'l Planning Office (Secretaria Tecnica de Planificacion), which re-
ports directly to the President of the Republic, is responsible for ove:raLl
economic p'lanning, but is inadequately staffed and organized to serve as a co-
ordinating agency for the transport sector.     14OPC is responsible for roads and
also, in principle, for coordinating the activities of the semi-autonomous gov-
ernment agencies under its authority in other sub-sectors of the transport sys-
tem;  however, no coordination is apparent.     The statistical and planning of-
fices recently established by MOPC are poorly organized, understaffed, and do
not receive sufficient funds; at present they deal mainly with questions re-
lated to road transport and lack adequate information on the use of the various
transport modes.
2.13       Major investments in the transport sector that have been finalced by
external lendine institutions have been put to prior tests of economic feasi-
bility.   However, other investments are generally not subjected to suC]1 ana-
lysis.   A number of transport investments proposed by the Government are
questionable, particularly the continued extension and major improvement of the
Igiehway network into areas of little economic activitg, and the extension of
airport facilities.    In addition is the problem of the PCAL railway.
2.14      At the Bank's recommendation, the Government has agreed to seek tech-

northernr part of Paraguay t0o the nraZil anl border, aUnd tLe Trans-ChcUU roVd
from Asuncion to the Bolivian border at Mendoza.  Most other roads branch off
these arteries.   in addition, there are a few hundred kilometers of m_unci,al
roads and feeder roads within development areas, under the jurisdiction of local
authorities.   Provision is made in the project to complete and update road in-
ventories (para 4.09).
3.02      Mlost paved roads have been constructed in recent years, and they are
in good condition.   Most of the earth and gravel roads, which constitute the
bulk of the system, were originally built as tracks and, therefore, are poorly
aligned, Lack adequate drainage and are difficult to maintain; with the ex-
ception of those most recently constructed, they are in bad condition due to
inadequate maintenance.   Many gravel and earth roads are either impassable for
long periods after rain or are closed until dry to minimize damage to surfaces.
B.   Characteristics and &orwth of Road Traffic (Tables 2 and 3)
3.03      Data on highway traffic in Paraguay are scarce.  Only in 1966 and
1967 were systematic traffic counts on a number of major highways carried out.
Other data on individual road projects were developed in connection with feasi-
bility studies.   This information shows that in 1967 average daily traffic was
between 200 and 700 vehicles on the trunk roads from Asuncion to Puerto Presi-
dente Str(Dessner and to Encarnacion, and between 1,000 and 4,000 vehicles on
the aonroaches to Asuncion.   For the rest of the network, where data are avail-
able, traffic averaged less than 70 vehicles per day.
3.04      In the absence of systematic traffic counts over prolonged periods,
assumrtions about the past growth of highwav traffic have to be based on indi-
cators such as the evolution of the vehicle fleet and the consumption of gaso-
line anti dipqpl flile  Paragmay's vnbhinlh flAet (sAA Tqhlh 2) grerw at a rate
of 9.7% annually between 1957 and 1965, the only two years for which reliable
data-r a  available=  Grewth in 1966 nn 1QA7 is estimated to have beehn even
higher.   Gasoline and diesel fuel consumption (see Table 3) showed an annual
average iinvac ae of 10.3% betw+v.een 1955 and 1968.  Overa ll highway traffic has
probably jgrown at a rate of 9-10% annually.
3.05      The total vehicle fleet in 1967 was estimated at 18,000;  of these,

the city of Encarnacion, and the remaining 20% in the other 13 departments.
The fleet growth rate in these latter departments has been mLuch faster in re-
cent years than in the Central Department which reflects the growing need for



motor transport in the outlying areas that were recently opened to new settle-
ment and development. Trucks range in size from 3 to 8i tons; with more thaun
half about ' tons. Although some very old vehicles are still in use, the aver-
age age of the vehicle fleet is probablv under eight years. The present fleet
represents an average of one vehicle to 122 persons, compared to 33 for the
whole of South America, and 11 for Argentin-n=
3.o6      Bus transport is highly competitive.   Bus companies are required to
be licensed and are run by individual owners or cooperatives. There are no
Gfovernment restrictions on. the number of truck'ing or bus cos'nies that c. be
established or fleets owned. Trucking for import and export traffic is large-

hands of a few small Paraguayan firms and individuals.
C. Highway Administration and Management
3.07      The responsibility for planning national roads lies with Vialidad
er. th,e OrG   For- manterarLce, the system is divided into five districts
(see Chart, hap and Table 1), four of which come under the responsibility of
Vialidad, while the fifth (the Chaco) is in the hands of a military unit called
the "Commando de Ingeniera" (CI).   Of the 6,250 km of roads comprising the
rnaioral network in 1968, Vialidad thus maintains 5,000 km.
3.08      Vialidad;s administrative procedures are cumbersome, and responisibili-
ties are not adequately established. It has insufficient staff due to poor
pay and working conditions. Accounting procedures are limited to recording
budget allocations and expenditure, and there is no performance or cost control.
Existing regulations limiting vehicle weights and dimensions aredn general
satisfactory, but they are not adequately enforced, due to the absence of a suit-
able organization, an appropriate schedule of penalties and sufficient weigh-
ing scales.  The Government, aware of these problems, assured the Bank during
negotiations that it would establish a schedule of penalties sufficiently
high to deter violation of the regulations and strengthen the organization
to enforce them. Additional scales will be purchased under the project.
3.09      Under the first road maintenance project, consultants made recojmmenda-
tions for correcting the above deficiencies, including the reorganization of
Vialidad; the Government and the Bank subsequently endorsed the recommen(iations.
The passage of legislation to bring about the reorganization was a prereqcuisite
to Bank consideration of the proposed project, and in July 1969 appropriate
legislation was enacted. In January 1969, as a first step in the reorganiza-
tion process recommended by the consultants, existing staff were repositioned
and some salary scales were improved. However, the lack of funds, as describ-
ed in the Section D below, has prevented augmentation of staff to the des:Lred
strength. During loan negotiations the Government gave assurances that it
would provide adequate funds and recruit suitable staff as described in paras.
3.14, 4.07 and 4.16.
D. Highway Planning and Financing (Table 4)
3.10      Construction of major modern highways started in 1960 with the im-
provement and paving of the Asuncion - P.P. Stroessner road under an AID loan,
followed by the paving of roads under Bank/IDA finn-noed road projects. Conn-
currently, anld in many cases with financial assistance from AID through



- 7 -
PL-480 programs, low standard earth roads were also constructed to serve and/
or open u) new settlement areas and to extend the network to bordering countries;
the most notable of these are the Trans-Chaco road (about 800 km) and the
Colonel Oviedo - Bella Vista road (about 400 km).
3.11      The 1964-1967 UNDP Study (para. 1.03 and Annex) was a first step to-
wards comprehensive transport planning, at least on a regional basis. Feasi-
bility ancd detailed engineering studies of Drioritv roads identified ur,der the
study are now being carried out under Loan 443-PA and could provide a basis for
additional  Bank lending for roads in 1971.  Cln a country-wide basis; major
bottlenecks to proper planning are the absence of a transport data collection
system ancl a suitable office to collect and analyze such data.  The assist-
ance requested from UNDP (para. 2.14) would help to improve this situation, and
to identifv nriorities in the highway secto  for +he nerviod 1071 -19   The
Governmenti has agreed that it will establish and maintain a suitably staffed
and eqe-Apped office to co,llect an.d analyrye infnr- +J r. for t.e pro pr plair.g
of the national road network.
3.12      Expenditures for road construction in 1966 were 6 630 million
(TTSc 5~ rl]ior. --i-alert) an.d are exected to be d 8-77 rlITTni (uS7.2 r^L,l

lion equivralent) in 1969; maintenance expenditures for the same years, ex-
cl.Aud. ing mi&aJor equ.ipment pp-Urchases wh-iL UWL  Ich.hve been LLnarLiceu fro,n externaL sources,
are 6 121 million (US$ 1 million equivalent) and d 73 million (US$ 0.5 million
equivalent).   While construction expenditures on  new additions to the nat-
ional network have risen sharply over recent years, maintenance expenditures
declined and fell far short of meeting requirements.  Average annual mainte-
nance expenditures per km (including depreciation of equipment) are less than
US$ 200 equivalent,but would increase to about US$ 400 equivalent under the
four-year maintenance program, which would be more in line with the needs.
3.13      Construction has been financed by external borrowing (about 50%) and
the revenues of earmarked taxes, principally the 5% general surcharge on im-
ports.   Plaintenance has been financed from annual budget appropriations.
Revenues from the main road user charges, i.e. fuel taxes and road tolls, ex-
ceeded highway maintenance expenditures and met a substantial part of construc-
tion expenditures in recent years (see Table 4).  There are also high duties
and other charges on the import of vehicles and spare parts, a portion of which
could be considered as charges on road users.
3.14      A significant portion of public expenditure is financed through the
earmarking, of revenues from specific taxes or duties.  Projects or programs
which are not financed in this manner are' plagued with problems,as they must
compete for the limited amount of non-earmarked revenues.  Maintenance pro-
grams have been in this latter category,,and cases are known of maintenance
equipment lying idle due to lack of funds to purchase fuel.  Earmarking arranee-
ments (as outlined in para. 4.16) are therefore needed to ensure the provision
of the Government's share of cost of the proposed project.
E.   Highway Design and Construction
3.15      All engineering studies, designs and supervision for the construct-ion
of major road projects financed by external lenders have been done by foreign
consultants: some local staff have also been trained unmder these projects.
Engineering performed by Vialidad on other projects has been inadequate due to



- 8 -
the lack cf qualified staff and engineering equipment (e.g. for surveying,
drafting and soil investigation).   The loan provides for the purchase of such
equipment which will also be used in connection with maintenance operations
(para. 4.05)-
3.16      The design standards in use are satisfactory, but they call for the
application of triple bituminous surface treatments to low traffic roads.   A
double treatment would suffice,but in 1963 Vialidad adopted this practice to de-
fer the need for major maintenance by several years until its maintenance orga-
nization could be strengthened.   This practice will be eliminated with the im-
plementation of the proposed project.
3.17      Construction of all major highway projects financed from external
sources is carried out hv foreign onn        tm-rider unit price contracts aw.ard-
ed after competitive bidding;  international bidding has been used for Bank/IDl
projects.   There is a smnll local cmtracting indus-r w.Those work is 1:Lited

which was provided by AID under PL-480 programs.
F.   Highway Maintenance
3.18      Highway maintenance is the responsiblity of Vialidad and the CI (para.
3.07). Vialidad maintains its roads exclusively by its own forces controlled
from headquarters through four maintenance districts (see Map).   The Govern-
ment is considering the transfer of the Cl's responsibility for highway main-
tenance in the Chaco area (District 5) to Vialidad.   Although no specific
schedule has been proposed, the consultants to be engaged under the proposed
loan will help to determine the maintenance requirements for District 5 in prep-
aration for such transfer.   The discussion below is limited to the four main-
tenance districts now under Vialidad's control.
3.19      Prior to the first highwmay maintenance project in 1961, coord:ination
and control were ineffectual.   Operations in the districts were carried1 out in
a random fashion mainly by hand labor, and the 2,500 km network was virtually
not maintained.   There was no cost accounting, the limited workshop and repair
facilities available urgently needed improving and expanding, and maintenance
equipment was seriously lacking.   The equipment provided 'Under the first main-
tenance project helped to improve maintenance operations but was intended to
meet only the most urgent needs and is now almost at the end of its economic
life.   Despite a lack of sufficient funds and personnel, Vialidad has been able
to maintain a total of 3,900 km out of 5,000 km of roads in its charge at the
present time, although only to minimum standards.   In January 1969, Vialidad
used the 1,967 master maintenance plan prepared by consultants under the first
maintenance project (Dara. 2 of Annex) to develon a founr-year maintenanne pro-
gram (1970-1973).   The program establishes the updated requirements for con-
sultine services, equipment, perso-nnn-el; nhonn fiindR and suitabThle stana.irds of
maintenance for the different types of road under varying traffic volumes, and
climatic conditions; and is the basis for the proposed seco   hhd w.h WWay mM.ainnte-
nance project.

tinuation, improvement and expansion of maintenance operations on national
roads in four of Paraguay's five laintenAnce districts.   The program wouid be
implemented with the assistance of consultants and would include the purchase
of a.inten.ace, shop anXd other equipment, workshop extension and improvementt,
and personnel training.
B. Background
4.02      The four-year program which comprises the proposed project woluld pro-
vide training and assistance in developing a highway organization capabLe of
performing all the technical and administrative functions necessary for adequate
highway maintenance.   There is an urgent need to maintain properly the entire
5,000 km of national roads in the four maintenance districts now under Itialidad's
responsibiLity.    A further 1,000 km of roads (comprising new works and trans-
fers of existing local roads in these four districts) will require maintaining
by the end of 1972.   The project would provide for this extended maintenance
task as welU as for the equipment, workshop facilities, and consultingservices
necessary to strengthen Vialidad's reconstituted maintenance organization (para.
3.09) and to apply modern highway maintenance practices.   A four-year period
should suffice to develop the organization and to train local personnel in main-
tenance skills.   A subsequent project to extend improved maintenance procedures
to the fifth maintenance district (para. 3.18) may be developed from experience
gained under the proposed project.
4.03      The aim of the program is to develon the highway mainntenannce effort
so as to allow (a) the wearing surfaces of most roads to be reinstated, includ-
ing some betterment works (drainage;. reaal-ignment), thuls enahling routinre main-
tenance to be carried out; (b) roads which are now impassable for long periods
after rains9 to be kent onen in all butll. nr+,M. jweather;  and (c) deferred
maintenance to be reduced, and reconstruction of roads to be postponed ty pre-
ventive maintenance.   A total of 6;oo km of road wouTld be properlyr maintained
in 1972, comprising about 900 km of paved roads, 1,100 km of gravel roads and
h.000 km of earth roads.   At the completion of th.e pn"nt7m. it iS - - -ted c   t.-
Vialidad personnel will be capable of maintaining all roads under its juris-
di cti on witshoit. suhs+.a+   +ec.rical assistance.
C. fRlluiremen.ts (Table 5)
n).OL     Mair.tr-a4 and Workshop Euipm,ent, p-are Parts and    terials:
T'o imrove th,e le-vel of muintenanuce, majur equipment is required of
which motorgraders, tractors, loaders, trucks, a stone crushing unit and spare
parts are the Mai-n elemen.ts.  Since mosbt of the existing major equipment is in
poor condition and near to retirement, Vialidad intends to rebuild it with new
spare parts to carry out Ute heavy maintenance work required to reinstate gravel
and earth roads to their original conditions (para. 4.03 (a)).  In this w'ay, the
.hea-vy wear and tear on equipment caused by this type of work would be confined
to the old equipment.   The reinstatement work will be carried out during the
first two years and much of the old equipment used for this purpose will have to



- 10 -
be replaced under the four-year program.    Vialidad has taken eight years as
be avura e econoMarac  fe for -neu- equipmen1t; this is sa±iSfacbory.  The rew
equipment* and spare parts for new and old equipment would be provided under
the loan.
4.u)      Workshop facilities are inadequate in respect of 'buildings, inachinery
and tools.   For the workshop equipment which would be provided under the pro-
ject, the Government is extending and improving the main shop in San Lorenzo
and the three district shops at its own expense (about 0 25 million or US$ 0.2
million equivalent).   Work is nearing completion on the main shop and has been
started on the others.   These works are phased with equipment purchases and
all shops are expected to be in satisfactory condition by mid-1970 to receive
the first new equipment.   Miscellaneous equipment for district maintenance
crews, as well as engineering equipment and weighing scales (paras. 3.0)8 and
3.15) to :improve the control of maintenance operations, would also be provided
under the loan.
4.o6      The above requirements are reasonable;  details are given in Tables
5 and 7.   The estimated foreign exchange cost (to be financed from thet loan)
of the road maintenance and shop equipment, and spare parts is US$ 4.8 million
equivalent, excluding contingencies.
4.07      Local Personnel:
Vialidad has estimated its nersonnel needs and the years in which
they will be needed (Table 6).   The requirements are reasonable althouglh diffi-

4.09      Consulting Services:
The Government will employ consultants to assist Vialidad in carrying
out the four-year maintenance program.   Tne consultants, among other things,
would help to:
(a) improve equipment and workshop operations;
* about 70% is additional equipment and 30% replacement for obsolete equipment.



- 11 -
(b)  establish an adequate cost accounting system;
(c)  improve budgetary methods and programming;
(d)  set up local training facilities for technical and
administrative personnel, a program for training staff
abroad, and a materials testing system;
(e)  establish up-to-date inventories of roads and main-
tenance equipment;
(f) determine the maintenance requirements for roads in
District 5 in the event a decision is taken to trans-
fer the responsibility for the maintenance of these
roads to Vialidad; and
(g)  prepare highway legislation, as may be needed, on such
matters as jurisdiction and land acquisition.
4010      Up to six maintenance specialist are required for varying periods
from the beginning of 1970 through mid-1973.   The total cost of these services,
excluding contingencies, has been estimated at US$ 450,000 equivalent of
which the foreign exchange component of cost would be about US$ 350,000 equi-
valent and provided under the loan.
D. Execution
4.11      MIOPC would be responsible for the program, and the detailed execution
would be by Vialidad assisted by consultants.   The Government has givena assur-
ances that all national roads, maintenance shops and equipment under the juris-
diction of NOPC (including the equipment provided in the project) will be oper-
ated, maintained and repaired in accordance with sound highway engineering
Dractices.   Equinment and snare narts would. to the maxi-mum extent practical.
be procured on the basis of international comnpetitive bidding in line with the
Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.   There are a number of individual items or
groups of similar items (largely workshop tools, engineering equipment and
spare parts to rebuild existing equipment) whose cost will not exceed U.S$t 5;000

4.14      The Government will provide d 853 miLlion (US$ 6.8 million equivalent)
for recurrent expenditures   on the maintenance program.    These estimatred ex-
penditures cover the cost of administration, personnel, fuel, lubricants and
materials and are based on a detailed forecast by Viaiidad in January i969; the
estimates do not include allowance for depreciation of equipment and are reason-
able.   Tie Government agreed during negotiations that a suitable accoumi;ing
format, including provision for maintenance equipment depreciation, will be es-
tablished for Vialidad which wilL reflect the true cost of maintaining roads
and provide the basis for evaluating maintenance equipment requirement;s.

5.  ECONOMIC EVALUATION
5.01      Objectives:  The objectives of the proposed project are to reduce the
cost of transport on Paraguay's highway network and to prevent future increases
which would become unavoidable if highway maintenance continued at its present
level.  Road transport is the main mode for moving goods arnd people in Para-
quay, and low costs of road transport are therefore of primary importance for
the country's economy.
5.02      Network to be Maintained:   Vialidad is presently maintaining only
about 3.900 km out of the 5.000 sm of roads for wlhich it is responsible (paras.
3.19 and 4.02). However, over the coming four years, tha netiAfu-k under Viali-
dad's resDonsibilitv will increase to about 6,000 km.   The annual network
lengths to be maintained by Vialidad under the four-year maintr.ance program
are given below   nn maior additions are pres_ntly foreseen aftEer 1972,. with
the possible exception of the Chaco roads now maintained by CI (para. 3.07).

2.03      Tra'fic: _____ 1way trcUL.LU is  ±L1LaU ,ut to dvu ro,UW1s at an arUnLua±l
rate of 9-10% in recent years (para. 3.04). The generally favorable develop-
ment prospects of Paraguay and the improved level of road maintenance as a
result of this project would tend to justify the assumption that traffic growth
-wo-uld continue at about the same rate.  However, in view oI the lack of reli-
able traffic data a conservative growth rate of 7.5% up to 1975 and 6% there-
after was used in tne economic analysis.
5.0o4     The limited traffic counts carried out in 1966 and 1967 covered most
of the roads that are now paved or will be paved by the end of this year.    For
the remaining paved roads it has been assumed that average traffic volumes
were the same as for the paved roads on which counts were taken. This is
probably a conservative assumption since all the roads which were not covered
by traffic counts are in the area close to Asuncion where traffic volumes are
generally high. The gravel and earth roads for which traffic data wiere col-
lected are the more important roads of this category but represent only about
one-third of the entire unpaved network. It has been assumed that traffic
volumes on the roads for which no data are available are considerably lower,
on average by about 50%, than on the roads covered by the 1966/67 traffic
counts.
5.05      Methodology:  The execution of the maintenance program under the
proposed project would yield the following benefits:
(a)  the substantial improvement in the present condition of
the gravel and earth roads will reduce vehicle operating
costs and prevent further deterioration of these roads which
would have resulted in increased vehicle operating costs;
and



- 15 -
(b)  the adequate maintenanice of paved roads, which are
relatively new, will prevent increased vehicle oper-
ating costs in the future.
Other benefits which have not been quantified due to lack of sufficient data
are savings in reconstruction costs resulting from the lengthening of the econ-
omic life of the roads and time savings due to better riding conditions.
5.06      To evaluate the benefits attributable to the project, the future pat-
tern of vehicle operating costs with and without the project has been analyzed;
the difference in costs under the two alternatives are the benefits that can be
obtained by carrying out the project.
5.07      The benefits are the result of the combined effects of investment in
equipment and of additional recurrent maintenance outlays such as labor, fuels,
naterials, etc. Therefore, both capital andi nrirlition al recurrent costs are
included in the economic arnalysis. Without replacement of existing equipment,
whi.Lch is included i,n the project, maintenance work would suffer seriously mnd
-vehicle operating costs would rise more than the amounts shown in Table 8.
-o--e-erno----        calculation of the benefits directly attributable to the
replacement equipment has been made and the rate of return, consequently, urnder-
states hUe be;Qafits of± tle project. .
5o        The average econorlmic _ life of the equipmaent to be purchased under the
-n;posed project will be about eight years (para. 4.04) and, therefore, bene-
fits and costs have been calcculated for this period 1970=7?). Sin.ce the
maintenance equipment will be purchased in the first four years of the program
some of it wiLl have one to three years of remaining -life in the eighth year.
An appropriate salvage value was applied.
5.09      Vehlele Operating Costs:  There has been no study of the effects of
-i.nproved road maintenance oni vehicle operating costis in Paraguay. The analy-
sis therefore had to be based on findings of studies that have been carriedl out
eloewhere and on assumptions comparable with those used in other recent Bank!
'iJN. maintenance projects.
,f.10     The following assumptions with regard to vehicle operating costs on
~;.e different categories of roads, with and without the project, have 'eer usedu
(a) Paved Roads:   The greater part of these roads were
constructed recently and are in good condition. With-
out the project, the equipment and maintenance effort
presently deployed could not maintain them properly and
their condition would deteriorate gradually. It is
assumed that by 1977 vehicle operating costs would have
increased by about 10% above present levels. T.Iith the
project, all paved roads will be kept in good condition
so that vehicle operating costs will remain at their
present levels.
(b) Gravel and Earth Roads:   The unpaved roads are gener-
ly lnii poor condition and many are not maintained.
Present vehicle operating costs are estimated to be



- 16 -
about 20% above those on well maintained earth
.nd aravel roads.  IMoreover, without the project,
road conditions would probably worsen due to in-
cases in traffirG and additions to the network to
be maintained by Vialidad, and many of the roads
woU,ld becom.e imnnA nhe for Irncevr npriods than at
present.   To account for these effects, it is

Table 8.   Table 93 s-gumarizes the data used in tuhe calc-ulautLon of the rate of
return.
5.11      Results of Economic Analysis:  With the above assumptions, the econ-
omic rate of return on an incremental basis for tne maintenance prograi to be
financed by the proposed project would be 51%.   The rates of return fcrr the
different categories of roads would be:
Paved roads   :   42%
Gravel roads  :   53%
Earth roads   :   62%
5.12      In view of the uncertainties that exist concerning the effect c° di°-
ferent levrels of road maintenance on velhicle operating costs in general., and
in view of insufficient data on traffic growth and transport costs in Paraguay
in particular, the economic justification of the proposed project was tested
under considerably lower assumptions than those used in the above analysis. If
traffic oIn the national highway network were to grow at only 6% annually up to
1975, and at 5% thereafter, the economic rate of return on the program would
be 35%.   If the estimated savings in vehicle operating costs are reduced by
25%, the rate of return would be 32%.   If both reductions are applied the rate
of return would still be 18%.   The proposed project is therefore economically
justified.

6.RECOI<UE11 LTIONQ
6xi0      During loan negotiations, satisfactory assurances were provided 'cj
the Governnient on the following principal points:
(a) consultation with the Bank on tne -findings of the rail-
way study and on implementation of recommendations
resulting therefrom (para. 2.08);
(b) the provision of technical assistance for the iprov-
ment of planning in the transport sector (para. 2.14);
(c) the recruitment of suitable personnel for the project
(paras. 3.09 and 4.07); and
(d) the earmarking of specific tax revenues to cover the
Government's share of the project's costs (paras. 3.14
and 4.16).
6.02      The conclusion of a satisfactory contract with consultants for t,he
imnlementation of the project (para. 4.12) is a condition of effectiveness of
the loan agreement.
6.03      Ihe project provides a suitable basis for a Ban-k loan of US$ 6.0 mil.-
lion equivalent.   The pnurchasing schedule for the equipment and its economic
life would justify a term of ten years; however, on country economiic grounds,
a 201-year term including a four-year period of grace would be appropriate.

Bank/IDA Projects in the Transport Sector
and other External Assistance for Highways
1.        The first Bank loan to Paraguay in 1951 of US$ 5 million equivelent,
was mair.ly for an agricltura project, but it provided about uS"$ 1 million
for equiprnent to construct some feeder roads. This equipment was well utiliz-
ed and the project wvas satisfactorily completed.
2.        Trie first road project as such was a Credit for construction arid
maintenance equipment in 1961 (Credit 12-PA) amounting to US$ 6 million equi-
val ent or the reconstruction and paving of the Asuncion - Encarnacion Road
(330 km), construction of a major bridge, the purchase of the most urgently
needed maintenance equipment and the preparation of a master maintenance plan.
Hiaher costs and delays resulted from a redesign of the road and bridge to pro-
tect them from extreme flooding, such as occurred during the final design. stage
in 1963.  This led to supplementary financing in 1964 (Loan 396-PA) of US$ 2.2
miilion equivalent to cover the highway costs, and a four-year extension of the
project's Closing Date to December 31, 1969.  Execution was hampered by poor
initial marnatgement of the work, and damages due to further floods in 1965 and
1966 increased project costs by almost 25%. The road works are being carried
out by Hochtief (Germany) and shouald be satisfactorily completed before the
Present Closing Date of the Loan; the major bridge was satisfactorily cc,mple-
ted in 1968 by Chacofi-Albano (Argentina). Consulting services for the pro-
ject works are being provided by Geotecnica (Brazil) who also helped with. the
purchase of maintenance equipment for which US$ 1.1 million was allocated. in
and disbursed from the Loan/Credit.  In 1966 the US consultant, Brown and Root.
was engaged to prepare a master maintenance plan which was available in 1.967,
but only partially implemented in 1968. due to the lack of sufficient Pelipime-nt;
..unds and personnel. The plan was recently updated and a four-year program
developed (1970-1973) for the continued improvement of maintenance operationst
3.        The third project in the transport sector was a UNDP grant totalling
almost US$ 600,000 equivalent for a study carried out during 1964-1967 of agri-
cultural potential and road needs in Eastern Paraguay. The Bank acted as!
Executing Agency and US consultants Aero Service and Gannett, Flemming, Corddry
and Carpenter undertook the work. A maior result was the identification of
some 450 km of roads in need of improvement, which are now being studied for
feasibility (see Dara. 5).
4.        The fourth oDeration -was a Bank loan in 1965 for Mv$4 2.8 mi"licn equi-
valent to improve port facilities at Asuncion (Loan 437-PA). Difficulties in
Gov,ernment-contractor-consultant relationships developed in 1968-969 and have
hampered the execution of the project; however, these are largely resolved,
and the project is ep)ected to be satisfactorily completed by Septerter 30,
1970, the Closing Date of the Loan.
Loan 443-PA in 1966, amounting to US$ 2.1 million equitalent, was the
f'ifVi BRunk operation and the second road project.  It is -elping to



A 17-WE'V
Page 2
finance thei reconstruction and paving of a 43 km road section (Coronael Oviodo-
Villarrica), feasibility studies of the 450 km of road identified under the UNDP
study (para. 3), and detailed engineering of up to 2% Km of these roads fo-lrmd
to have thet highest priority for early construction.  After considerable Govr-
ernment delay in the selection of a consultant, these latter studies were ini-
tiated in January 1.969 by Louis Berger (US) and will probably be completed two
months afteir the December 30, 1969 Closing Date of the Loan.  The construction
work is being carri.ed out by Chacofi (Argentina) and supervised by Brown and
Root wdho had designed the project road.  Due mainly to the unpredictable ef-
fect of the' 1965-1966 floods on sub-surface soil conditions and partly to faulty
design, addlitional work was required and has increased total project costs al-
most 25% over original estimates.   The additional work has delayed project ex-
ecution, but completion is expected before the Closing Date of the Loan.
6.        F'inancial. assistance for highways has also been given by the US Gov-
ernment through thei Agency for International Development (AID) and its PL-480
programs.   Two loans totalling about US$ 10 million (1960 and 1967) were made
to reconstruct and pave the Asuncion - Puerto Presidente Stroessner Road.
(about 300 km); the PL-480 programs have been oriented toward the construction
and im-rovement of agricultural roads and have involved the provision of' con-
struction equipment and local currency financing in amounts that are dif'ficult
to ascertai.n, altholugh these may be substantial.  Assistance is also being
provided by the Canadian Government for some highway feasibility studies, with
the Inter -Americnn Development Bank acting as Executin- Agence.
