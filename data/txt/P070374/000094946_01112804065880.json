Family Strengthening and Social Capital Promotion\n            Project (PROFAM) is to test and monitor a social capital\n            approach to address the vulnerability of the poor by\n            targeting families as comprehensive units and promoting\n            gender equality. The project has three components: The first\n            has two sub-components that implement the \"Programa\n            Equidad,\" a demand-driven grant program for developing\n            small sub-projects which promote and strengthen the capacity\n            of families to actively function within their community; and\n            support the strengthening of existing networks or\n            associations of community-based organizations and other\n            civil society organizations through capacity building and\n            technical assistance, and in some instances the provision of\n            basic equipment such as computers or printers. Priority will\n            be given to those networks that demonstrate innovative\n            approaches to family strengthening, facilitate the\n            participation of the family, and promote more equitable\n            gender relations. The second component promotes\n            awareness-raising and communication strategies at a\n            micro-level that seeks to directly impact the project target\n            areas to further enhance\n            government-civil-society-community-family relationships,\n            respect for non-traditional gender roles among youth and\n            children, etc. The third component provides technical\n            assistance and capacity building for the project\n            implementation unit (PIU) staff and consultants."}, "docdt": "2001-10-30T00:00:00Z"}
