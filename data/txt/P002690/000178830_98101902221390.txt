REPORT AND RECONENDATION OF THE PRtSIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
FOR A CASHEW NUT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.   I submit the following repnort and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the United Republic of Tanzania for the equivalent of US $21.0
million to help finance a project for cashew nut development. The
loan would have a term of 20 years, including five years grace, with
interest at 7-4 percent per annum. About $19 million of the proceeds
of the loan would be relent to the Cashew Nut Authority of Tanzania for
20 years, including five years grace, with interest at 8-½ percent per
annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
General
2.   The last full Economic Report on Tanzania (AE-26) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on May 22 and June 22, 1972. This was
followed by an Economic Updating Report (30-TA) which was distributed
on December 11, 1972 and which was especially prepared for the East
African Consultative Group Meeting on Tanzania of January 1973. An
agriculture rural development sector mission visited Tanzania during
September/October 1973; its report is expected to be issued ahout the
middle of 1974. During 197h, we shall undertake a mission to study
the industrial and mining sectors.
3.   Tanzania celebrated its first decade of independence in December
1971. In the past 11 years gross national product increased in real
terms by some 65 percent to the present level of about $1.5 billion.
During the same Deriod, life expectancy at birth increased frcr, 35
to 41 years, infant mortality declined from 250 to lO6 per thousand
live births, maternal mortality declined from 4.7 to 2.7 per thousand
deliveries, and the primary school enrollment rate increased from about
28 to 37 percent of the relevant age group. While this sample of
economic and social indicators shows that significant progress has
been made, it also gives some idea oi the magnitude and difficulty
of the development task facing the country. For example, while GNP
grew at 4.7 percent per annum in real terms during these years,
these gains were to a large extent offset by the growth of population,
with the result that per capita income increased at only 2.L percent
per annum. Tanzania is one oL the 25 least developed countries.
L.   Tanzania has a one-party system which is embodied in the con-
stitution. The party, the Tanganyika Africa National Union (TANU),
is a well organized mass party and is actively engaged at the grass
roots in the promotion of popular involvement in the national development
effort, and within the party democratic principles are being strictly



- 2-
adhered to.  In econoimic )olicy making, the long-terM objectLve of
social equality preva;ls over eccno8LLc nterests of m--inority groups;
scrne progress towards reducing inequality of incoine distribu-iton within
the category of empj:loyedi workers has been -made, but large gaps continue
to exist between urban and rural standards of living.
Economic Performance and Resource Mobilization
5.   Tanzania s economic perflorniance in recent years has been
chiaracterized bj high m.arginal savings, relatively low returns on
investment, and rapid institutional change.   The growth of production,
however, has been modest in rnost sectors, esoecially in agriculture.
The combination of moderate production growth rates and a very anbitious
investm)ent oro7ra.- has led tc severe oressure on resources.  This oressure
has been partly alleviated by steadily increasing external capital irflows
and, until recen-ly, by an in rovement iri the countrys ter;s of trade.
Although- favora'ile current worlud aarket )rres fur several cf' Tanlzan-iaI s

to rise to about 20 percent in the next five years, and the IDA share to
remain about the same. The share of debt service payments to the Banlc is
at present about 10 percent of total debt service payments; the correspond-
ing share for IDA is about 2 percent. These two figures are projected to
rise to about 20 percent and 3 percent, respectively, by 1980. Most
capital aid to Tanzania is made available on very favorable financial
terms, although about 50 percent of the total is tied to procurement in
the donor country. Supplier credits have been kept to the minimum. In
addition to seeking as favorable a blend as possible and the minimum of
tying, the Government has attempted to secure donors' agreement to
simplify the procedures associated with the use of committed aid. For
example, Swedish assistance is now given within the terms of a frame
agreement, which allows the Government to set its own priorities in the
use of SIDA funds and allows considerable flexibility in the switching of
such finance between the various projects and programs. The overall debt
service ratio has declined in recent years owing to buoyant export ear-
ings; it is currently about 5 to 6 percent and is expected to remain
below 10 percent at least until 1985. In view of this low debt service
ratio, there is scope for a modest amount of lending to Tanzania on
conventional terms, particularly if such lending is for export promoting
or import substituting activities.
7.   Tanzania's high rate of investment during the last five years
has not been reflected in high growth in production -- at least not
as yet -- partly because there was a heavy bias towards social and
economic infrastricture with long gestation periods. A substantial
proportion of total investment has been umndertaken to provide a viable
alternative outlet to the sea to neighboring landlocked Zambia after
Southern Rhodesia!s TJnilateral Declaration o: Independence of 1965.
Economic and political ties between Zambia and Tanzania are growing
stronger every year. As a consequence of the lower than expected growth
rate, the Govermment has decided to shift its investment e=,hasis
to more productive quick yielding investments, particularly those
which generate increased export earni-.gs. The effects of these new
policies can already be seen in the rural sector and in the Banlc
GlroupIs own lending program.
8.   The budgetary position which has been adversely affected by
sluggish economic growLth in recent years counled with high levels
of developmqen. and recurrent expenditnre, remains extremely tigh,t.
The Goveniment does not have many remaining possibilities to increase
revenues.  In view of the already high marginal sav-ngs rate, the scope
fDr additional taxation is very limited. Even with a decline in
the rate of' investment, with the escalation of fuel Drices, Tanzania
will still require a continued capital inflow in excess of the foreign
exchange component of high priority projects v  it is to achieve
its developmenit targets; financing of local expenditures will therefore
be justified.
9.   Financial discipline in the regions, Central Governxnent Ministries,
and many state corporations remains a problem, probably because
scarce accounting and auditing skills are now even more thinly spread.
There is a general serious shortage ot' many professional skills. The



situation has been aggravated by the departure of many Asians and the
Government's reluctance to recruit abroad. However, this reluctance
is now diminishing as part o: an effort to accelerate project pre-
paration and implementation.
10. President Tlyerere recently announced that following a review,
the Government has decided to move the capital of Tanzania from
Dar es Salaam to Dodoma. By moving the capital city to the center
of the coumtry and so closer to the bulk of the rural poDulation,
it is the expectation that the Government will become more responsive
to the needs of the rural sector. The Government presently plans
to make the move over a ten year period. No accurate estimates of
the total costs involved are yet available but in view of the scarcity
of investment resources in Tanzania, it is likely that the transfer
of the capital will take much longer than planned; in addition, the
number of Government offices moved may be fewer than is presently
envisaged.
11. The administrative structure and many of the functions of
Goveniment were decentralized to the regions in July 1972. This
was done to make the Government more responsive to the needs of rural
development. It is still far too early to assess the success or
otherwise of thiis decentralization. As expected,  problems of
coordination between the center and the regions have occurred, and
the transfer of high ranking officials from Dar es Salaam to the
rural areas has had its inevitable, but one hopes only short-term,
effect on the smooth functioning of Central Government. Some dis-
location in project implementation has also been experienced. In
some regions the new Government structure is already showing its
potential to be more responsive and relevant to the needs of the
rural sector. Several rural development programs are now being
prepared in the regions and Bank Group finance is being sought for
some of them. It has become apparent that the severe shortage of
regional technical expertise will inhibit the ability of the new
decentralized authorities to plan and execute rural projects; progress
in regional development will, therefore, inevitably be patchy, re-
flecting the local availability of the required expertise.   Ways in
which the Bank Group and other donors might assist in alleviating
these constraints are currently being explored with the Government.
Expropriations
12. In April 1971 legislation (The Acquisition of Buildings Act)
was enacted empowering the President on behalf of the state to acquire
any rental or commerial property the construction cost of which was
over 100,000 Tanzanian Shillings ($14,000). About 3,000 pronerties
were acquired under the Act. About 500 claims, including less than
10 percent on behalf of foreign owners, were lodged in respect of the



- 5 -
actual acquisition itself or on the amount of compensation. These
claims, including the foreign cases, have either been settled or are
in the process of being settled in accordance with the provisions
Of the Act. The Government has recently expropriated about 50 large
scale farms in the Moshi-Arusha area of northern Tanzania. The
Government is presently making an assessment of the value of these
properties and negotiations on coipensation are expected to commence
soon.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TANZANIA
13. Tanzania joined the Bank, IDA and IFC in 1962. Beginning with
an IDA credit for education in 1963, it has so far received 15 credits
and three Bank loans amounting to $172.1 million. In addition, Tanzania
has been a beneficiary of nine loans, totaling $229.8 million which
have been extended for the development of' common services operated on
a regional basis by Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda through their association
with the East African Community. The only IFC investments in Tanzania
to date, totaling $4.)4 million, were made in the Kilombero Sugar
Comparn in 1960 and 1964. In 1969, IFC and other investors sold
their interest in the Company to the Government. Annex II contains
surmaary statements of Bank Loans and IDA credits in Tanzania and
the East African Community Organizations as of March 31, 197 and notes on
the execution of ongoing projects.
14. Our lending program, reflecting the emphasis the Tanzanian
Government attaches to agricultural development, has increasingly focused
on directly productive activities in the rural sector. Up to the
end of FY72, 10 out of 14 loans and credits had been made for in-
frastructure. All but one of th_ loans to the East African Community
Organizations, of which Tanzania is a beneficiary and co-guarantor,
had been extended for improvements in transportation and communications.
However, the approval by the Executive Directors of the Flue-Cured
Tobacco Project,(Credit No. 217 TA)in October 1970 opened a new phase
in our lending for such directly productive activities. The Smallholder
Tea Development Project (Credit No. 287 TA) and a Second Livestock
Project (Credit No. 352 TA) were approved in March 1972 and in April
1973, respectively. A Cotton Development Project (Credit No. 45 TA)
was approved earlier this year and the project presently under considera-
tion constitutes the beginning of a major effort to expand cashew nut
processing and production.  A proposed rural development project and
a proposed sugar project were appraised in October an: December 1973,
respectively. Preparation of a proposed dair project, a second rural
development project and a forestry project are underway.
15. Our Regional Mission in East Africa was involved in the pre-
paration of six of the above projects. Our capacity to provide such
assistance has proved to be particularly valuable in a countrry where



-6-
project preparation capacity is, and for some time will be, limited.
Tanzania is developing an institutional structure, stressing greater
regionalization and development of ujamaa villages, designed to promote
and respond to development initiatives.  These institutioa-s are still
in their formative stages, and related organizational and staffing
difficulties have sometime resulted in the project delays referred
to in Annex II. Bank Group staff have held discussions with the
Government on ways in which these implementation bottlenecks can be
alleviated. The Government has taken steps to speed up recruitment
of needed expatriate technical expertise and instituted a high level
monthly review for all externally aided projects.   In addition, we
hope to intensify, via our supervision, our assistance in project
implementation. As a result of these efforts, it is expected that
project implementation should now improve.
16.  Tanzania's education and training programs are expected to solve
the manpower problem in the longer run, but meanwhile there will
continue to be a need for technical assistance in planning and imple-
mentation if the difficulties in executing projects are to be overcome.
We are exploring with the Government how assistance of this kind can be
strengthened and best fitted to Tanzania. Through participation in
their projects we have supported Tanzania's new development institutions
at an early stage.  Our supervision of the projects has resulted in
bringing to light, earlier than might have happened otherwise, that
some of these institutions are facing significant difficulty in execut-
ing the projects they have undertaken. Because of our involvement, we
have been able to help the Government in its consideration of how to
overcome this problem whose solution is fundamental to rapid development.
17. A proposed urban sites and services project which will be submitted
to the Executive Directors for consideration shortly, would be the Bank
Group's first lending to Tanzania for urban development. The credit for
the Tanzania Investment Bank (Credit No. 460-TA) approved in February 1974
was the Bank Group's first lending in the industrial sector in Tanzania.
A proposed project for textile developmtent is presently under preparation.
Other projects outside the agricultural sector which are expected to be
ready for consideration in the near future include a proposed highway
maintenance project and a proposed supplementary- loan to complete the
Kidatu Hydroelectric Project (Loan No. 715-TA). Although no projects
are planned in the near future for the common services organizations of
the East African Community, the Bank, through its supervision missions
of ongoing operations, is discussing further assistance for telecommunica-
tions, industry amd port developmento Additional loans to the East
African Railways Corporation, however, will have to await resolution of
the financial and operational problems being encountered by that Corpora-
tion. The main operational problems consist of an inadequate tariff
structure, inefficient use of rolling stock, and differences between the
Partner States about how the raiiways should be managed. The Partner
States are very much alive to these problems and have arranged to
engage consultants to recommend solutions. The Bank expects to work
closely with them. Meanwhile, the f'inarcial p-roblem stemming partly
from these operational difficul.ties but more directly from inadequate
arrangements for transferring to the Corporation's Headquarters revenues



-7-
accruing to the regional offices have caused the Corporation to be
delinquent in making debts service payments due to the Bank under
Loan 428-EA. The Bank has pressed the Corporation for payment, has
called upon the Partner States as guarantors of the loan to meet this
obligation and has discussed the problem fully with them. They have
made arrangements to provide the Corporation's Headquarters with
sufficient funds and payment is expected shortly. Pending receipt of
the amounts due the disbursement on Loan 674-EA, the latest loan to the
Corporation has been suspended.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
General Background
18. Agriculture and related activities constitute the largest single
sector in the Tanzanian economy. Roughly 40 percent of GDP is derived
from the sector of which 50 percent constitutes subsistence production.
Agricultural exports, which account for 80 percent of total exports,
include mainly sisal, cotton, cashew and coffee. About 94 percent of
the population live in rural areas, usually in small isolated communities
and 90 percent of the economically active people are engaged in agriculture.
19. Most production is from smallholdings, and using family labor. Large
scale agriculture is represented by a small number of private estates and
some state farms producing sisal, coffee, tea and wheat, and state farms,
mainly producing wheat, rice, sisal and livestock0 Estate production has
diminished in importance particularly as sisal has declined, and the state
farm program remains small. Tanzania's national herd, the second largest
in Africa, is grazed extensively over the 40 percent of the country which
is free from tsetse fly infestation. It is largely managed along tradi-
tional lines. There is limited use of oxen for cultivation, mainly in the
western cotton areas. Tanzania is largely self-sufficient in staples, but
about 10 percent of total imports in 1971 were foods among which dairy
products, wheat and maize were major items0
Agricultural Development Strategy
20. The Government recognizes that agriculture will continue to be the
main source of employment for a long time and has been trying to devise
a strategy which will bring about improvement in output, incomes, and
the living conditions of the agricultural population0 The policy for
agricultural and rural development which has emerged from these deliberations
has been adopted as a central part of Tanzania's second Five-Year Plan.
21. The major aia of the Plan is to make significant progress towards
socialist organization of rural activity, based on ujamaa cooperatives and
maximization of the use of labor. State farms fill a need for larger scale
production units, but the approach to mechanization is to be cautious and
in general based on proven viability. A similar caution is expressed
toward irrigation development. Agricultural production is to be increased
within a framework of crop priorities based on production possibilities,
market prospects, and a desire for increased self-sufficiency. High
priority is given to raising nutritional standards in the country, and to
the expansion of selected export activities including cotton, livestock,
flue-cured tobacco, and cashew nuts, the first three of which are already being



-8-
assisted by IDA credits. A vigorous policy for the development of vertically
integrated single crop authorities, dealing with all aspects of production,
processing and marketing, is being pursued with cooperatives playing a
central role.
22. Several other types of farming and commodities also have scope for
expansion. These include dairying, and horticultural production, sugar,
pyrethrum, oilseeds and forestry products. Projects designed to develop
these are in various stages of preparation.
23. Tanzania has had some success in formulating and implementing the
single crop development programs mentioned in paragraphs 21 and 22 above.
However, they have typically involved relatively high cost per farmer, and
have affected only a small proportion of the rural population even when
developed along labor intensive lines. Tanzania has recognized these
shortcomings and is attempting to design and plan broader based rural
development projects.  Our Regional Mission in Eastern Africa has been
assisting the Government in this effort and helped to design and prepare
such a project in Kigoma region in western Tanzania. This region has
considerable potential but has so far been bypassed by more traditional
development programs.
24. The Government of Tanzania uses price regulation both as an alloca-
tio, mechanism and as an instrument to achieve its welfare goals. However,
some relative prices, particularly in the agricultural sector have been
kept too low and distortions in the market have occurred. In some cases,
supply has been depressed and farmers have been reluctant to invest in
particular activities. The Government has become increasingly aware of
these issues and recently significantly increased some producer prices (on
beef, wheat and maize for example) as a first step toward evolving a more
rational price structure.
25. As Bank Group involvement in the agricultural sector has grown,
Bank staff have participated in a continuing dialogue with the Tanzanian
Government over agricultural potentialities, priorities, and policies.
As part of this effort, an agriculture sector survey mission visited
Tanzania in October 1973 and its report is expected to be finalized
around mid-1974.
Technical Services
26. Research presently being carried out in Tanzania is generally of a
good standard although some strengthening in particular areas (e.g.
cashew) is needed. However, there is a gap between research and its
application at farm level. About 2,500 field staff in Tanzania are
engaged in field work associated with crop production. Owing to its
inadequate dissemination of new techniques, limited material, poor
logistic support and the fact that staff have been spread too thinly,
the extension services have been rather ineffective in introducing
improved techniques to farners except when organized along project
lines. In designing new programs care is now being taken that these
shortfalls of the past will be avoided.



-9-
The Cashew Nut Industry
General
27. The cashew tree, which grows on poor sandy soil, produces an
annual crop of nuts which are attached to an apple-like fruit. The
cashew nut itself has a hard outer shell as well as a brittle inner
shell which protects the kernel. Cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL)
which is used commercially for paints and varnishes, is produced from
the resin between the two shells.
28. After Mozambique, Tanzania is the world's second largest producer
of cashew nuts and her exports of this dessert nut in 1971/72 rep-
resented about 28 percent of the world's total. Over 75 percent
of Tanzania's production, which is based almost entirely on small-
holders, is concentrated in the southeastern part of the country
(see map). Due to poor husbandry and lack of extension services
yields are generally low. They average only about 325 kg. per ha.
as compared with yields of over 1,000 kg. per ha. which could be
achieved from improved practices.
29. At present, Tanzania has a capacity to process only about 27,000
tons of raw cashew nuts (6,200 tons of kernels) per year, or about
22 percent of total production, the remainder being processed overseas,
mainly in India. About 75 percent of domestic processing is mechanized.
The remainder is processed by hand but this method operates at a finan-
cial loss and a poor economic return due to low labor productivity
and low quality of production. Although attempts have been made to
improve quality control in the labor intensive process in Tanzania
these efforts have not met with success. Despite its obvious
employment advantages, hand processing is not therefore seen as a
realistic alternative.
Development Strategy
30. Tanzania's development strategy for the cashew nut industry
is basically two-fold. Firstly, by making efforts to expand processing
of domestic production, Tanzania hopes to increase local value added
and hence export earnings. Secondly, and in conformity with the country's
policy of distributing the benefits of development as widely as possible,
it is hoped that by establishing and developing an effective extension
and grading service, increases in production and incomes of the small
rural producers will be realized.
31. Tanzania has decided to concentrate its effort in the main pro-
ducing areas in the southeastern part of the country including Lindi,
Mtwara and Ruvuma regions (see map). The area, which has a population
of about 2 million and is one of the poorest in Tanzania (per capita
incomes are about US$38) has so far been bypassed by most of the
Government's development programs.



CahwNtAtoiyo               azri  (CATA)
32. In order to help achieve these objectives, the Government
established the Cashew Nut Authority of Tanzania (CATA) in 1973
as a statutory authority designated to coordinate all aspects of
production, processing and marketing of cashew nuts. CATA's
headquarters will be based in Mtwara (see map) close to the
main cashew nut producing area. The Act establishing CATA gave
the Authority virtual   monopoly powers  over the cashew nut
industry. When fully operational, CATA will purchase nuts
from the cooperative unions for its processing facilities and
arrange for the export of kernels as well as all unprocessed
nuts. CATA is also assuming responsibility for maintenance of
an extension and grading service and for cashew research. CATA
is already administering those activities of the National Agri-
cultural Products Board (NAPB) related to the purchase and sale
of raw cashew nuts. The National Development Corporation (NDC)
still owns the National Cashew Corporation (which operates some
hand processing units at a financial loss) as well as 85 percent
of the equity of Tanita Company, which presently mechanically
processes about 12,000 tons of raw nuts per year and 50 percent
of the equity of the Mtwara Cashew Company. CATA is expected to
take over these investments. NAPB has accumulated substantial
current net liabilities from its past operations and it is
expected that a portion of these, about TSh 11 million (US$1.6
million), will be transferred to CATA. CATA's future subsidiaries
have also incurred current net liabilities, about TSh 9 million
(US$1.3 million), from their past operations. In order to ensure
that CATA's operations are not jeopardized by the financial
condition of its predecessors, the Government has decided to
make funds available to CATA so that the consolidated current
assets of the Authority and all its subsidiary companies shall
be at least equal to the consolidated current liabilities of
CATA and all its subsidiaries within two years (Section 4.03 of
the draft Loan Agreement).
33. As a first stage towards implementing the Government's policy
in this sub-sector, CATA presently plans to increase domestic process-
ing capacity from 6,200 tons of kernels to about 18,200 tons of
kernels by 1981 at which time about 55 percent of Tanzania's
production would be processed locally. Although the program is
an ambitious one, involving the establishment of new factories
using relatively sophisticated machinery, in fairly remote areas,
it is realistic. CATA also has responsibility for establishing an



-11-
effective research and extension service. Although Tanzania's past
experience with cashew extension is extremely limited, some initial
efforts by TANU to establish a system designed to effectively communi-
cate relevant advice to the traditional farmers have been moderately
encouraging.
Price Policy
34. In recent years, the controlled farm gate price of cashew nuts
has in practice been fairly closely aligned to the world price after
making appropriate adjustments for processing and marketing costs.
In keeping with its policy of distributing the benefits of develop-
ment as widely as possible and also to encourage cashew nut produc-
tion, the Government has decided to continue this practice as a matter
of policy. As a result, a significant proportion of the benefits
accruing to the country from the planned increases in domestic
processing are expected to be passed to the traditional producer
in the form of higher prices for raw nuts. The present grading/
pricing system has however resulted in poor quality control and
given inadequate incentive to farmers to produce nuts of a high
standard. By revising the relevant price differentials and
improving the administration and enforcement of the grading system,
CATA plans to improve the overall quality of production. The
Government has agreed that, within two years, it will establish and
maintain a pricing structure for cashew nuts based on the grading
of such nuts and closely relating world prices to farm gate prices
less appropriate processing and marketing costs (Section 4.02 of
the draft Loan Agreement).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
35. An Appraisal Report entitled "Cashew Nut Development Project -
Tanzania" is being distributed separately. A Credit and Project
Summary is provided as Annex III to this Report.
36. The project, prepared with the help of the Regional Mission in
Eastern Africa, was appraised in the field in October 1973. Nego-
tiations for the proposed credit were held in Washington in April
1974. The Tanzanian delegation was headed by Yr. A. Mushi, Principal
Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture.
37. The proposed project would support the major part of CATA's
next five year development program (1974/75 - 1979/80) to increase
cashew nut production and processing in Tanzania. The project would
provide for the construction of five processing factories to be



-12-
located in the southeastern part of the country, port storage
facilities for cashew nut shell liquid, office and housing
facilities for CATA; the maintenance of farm access roads; the
establishment of a cashew extension and grading service; the
improvement of cashew research facilities; the construction of
improved water supplies and education facilities in selected
villages within the cashew nut producing areas; and technical
services.
Costs
38. The total cost of the project, including import duties of
US$120,000 but net of other taxes, is estimated at US$30.3 million.
Factory development and project administration, including
technical services, are expected to total $11.8 million and $3.7
million, respectively, excluding contingencies. Price contingencies
totalling $9.6 million and physical contingencies amounting to $1.9
million have been included in the cost estimates. The large
component for price escalation is explained by the fact that it is
thought prudent to allow for price increases of 15 percent per
annum over the project period and because project investments
would be phased over the whole development period rather than
being concentrated in the early years. The proposed Bank loan
of US$21.0 million (69 percent of total project cost) would
finance the total estimated foreign exchange component of US$15.8
million (52 percent of total project costs) as well as US$5.2
million equivalent of local costs. The breakdown of project costs
is given in Annex III.
Organization and Execution
39. The Cashew Nut Authority of Tanzania (CATA) (paragraph 32 above),
would be the principal project executing agency. The General Manager
would assume overall responsibility for the project including factory
coordination and control, marketing, finance, extension, grading and
research. Day-to-day administration would be the responsibility of
the relevant department heads. All five project factories would be
owned and operated by CATA.  Most extension and. grading staff would
be hired directly by the Authority; however, some would also be
seconded to CATA from the Ministry of Agriculture. Cashew research
would be carried oult by a special unit attached to the Mtwara
Research Institute and would be directed and supervised by CATA's
Chief Agricultural Officer who would also direct extension
activities and the grading services. By establishing a direct
link between research and extension, it is expected that advice to
cashew farmers on husbandry practices can be made more relevant than
it has in the past (paragraph 28 above). The grading service woula
complement the extension service as, in addition to testing the



quality of the units, it would also identify those farmers and
groups of farmers who could most benefit from extension activities.
A Project Agreement would be concluded between the Bank and CATA; its
authorization or ratification would be a condition of effectiveness
of the loan (Section 8.01(a) of the draft Loan Agreement).
40. To allow for the orderly manufacture and installation of
equipment and in order that full advarntage can be gained from
the less6ns of experience of initial project implementation,
construction work and subsequent commissioning of project factories
would be staggered over the five year development period. In
addition the Borrower would, during the construction period of the
project factories, consult with the Bank before approving the cons-
truction or expansion of any cashew nut processing factory in
Tanzania not included in the project (Section 3.03(a) of the draft
Loan Agreement).
h1. To the extent practicable, and in line with the country's
overall development strategy, which recognizes the broader aspect
of development, an attempt has been made to identify other develop-
ment needs in the project area. A dispensary would also be constructed
at each factory. Support for a limited amount of water and educational
facilities designed to directly improve the welfare of participating
farmers and their families has therefore been included in the project.
The siting, construction and operation of the water facilities would
be the responsibility of the regional authorities and the Ministry of
Water Development and Power. The Ministry of Education would in
general be responsible for supervising the construction and subsequent
operation of the Community Education Centers (CEC). Where convenient,
e.g., where a CEC is being constructed in close proximity to other
project work, CATA would supervise construction on behalf of the
Ministry of Education. The proposed design and location of the water
and educational facilities would be submitted to the Bank for approval
(Section 3.02(d) of the draft Loan Agreement). The Borrower would make
available such funds as are needed for recurrent expenditures for the
water and educational facilities (Section 3.03(d) and (e) of the draft
Loan Agreement).
Onlending
42. -Approximately $19.0 million of the loan to support factory
development, extension, grading and research services, project
administration and technical assistance, would be onlent to the
Cashew Nut Authority by the Government of Tanzania at 8.5 percent per annum
for 20 years, including a five year grace period. This rate
reflects the commercial cost of long term capital for the agricultu-
ral sector in Tanzania and is the same as the oniLending rate for
recent Bank Group operations in the sector. The conclusion of a
subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and CATA would be a
condition of loan effectiveness (Section 8.01(b) of the draft Loan
Agreement). The remaining $2 million of the loan would be employed
by the Government directly to assist in financing rural water develop-
ment and Community Education Centers associated with the project.

Training and Technical Services
43. The program to expand cashew production and processing and the
organization of CATA is considered to be sound and well conceived.
However, this is the first time that a comprehensive cashew nut
development program has been impleniented in Tanzania.  The
management and coordination of the processing facilities to be
provided under the project, while not being unduly sophisticated,
will not be a simple exercise. The proposed loan therefore
includes provision for technical support coupled with training.
CATA has agreed to consult with the Bank before making future
appointments of CATA department heads and senior research
personnel (Section 3.02 of the draft Project Agreement).
Procurement
44. Contracts for the factory plants (including machinery, equip-
ment ana civil works), totaling $9.5 million (excluding contingen-
cies) would be awarded on a turnkey basis following international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines
(Para A2(a) of Schedule 1 to the draft Project Agreement). Four years
service of a manufacturer's representative to CATA, who would be
acceptable to the Bank, and three years service of each of five
assistants to this representative, who would be seconded to each of
the project factories and selected after consultation with the Bank,
would be included in the contracts (Part Al(b) of the Description
of the Project set forth in Schedule 2 to the draft Loan Agreement).
A turnkey contract is considered essential as there are only a few
manufacturers of cashew nut processing equipment and the technical
nature of their products is such that each factcry would have to
be fully equipped with one type of machinery to ensure an efficient
operation. In addition, there is a need for close coordination
between the installation of the equipment and the associated civil
works. CATA would employ consultant;s, in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines, to assist in preparing the bidding documents
and evaluating the bids for the turnkey contract (Section 2.02
of the draft Project Agreement). Other machinery and equipment
and motor vehicles totaling US$0.8 million (excluding contingencies)
would be procured under international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. Local manufacturers would
be allowed a preferential margin of 15 percent or the existing
rate of import duties, whichever is the lower. In order to avoid
unnecessary delays, items and equipment not suitable for bulk
procurement would be purchased in accordance with the Government's
normal procurement procedures in cases where individual contracts
were less than US$30,000 ( Para   A3(a) of Schedule 1 to the
draft Project Agreement). Construction of staff houses, CATA



-15-
Headquarters, the educational and water facilities and other
civil works totalling US$2.4 million (excluding contingencies)
would be carried out by contractors following local competitive
bidding or, subject to agreement by the Bank, by force account
( Para A3(b) of Schedule 1 to the draft Project Agreement).
International competitive bidding is not cousidered appropriate
to those items since they are small, remote and widely dispersed
and are not expected to be attractive to international bidders,
ana in some cases not even to local bidders. In evaluating bids,
local civil works contractors would be allowed a 7-1/2 percent
preference. (Para Cl of Schedule 1 to the draft Project Agreement).
Disbursements
45. A schedule of estimated disbursements is included in Annex
III. The Bank loan of $21.0 million would finance approximately
69 percent of project costs. The Bank would disburse 100
percent of foreign expenditures and 95 percent of local expenditures
under the turnkey contract, 100 percent of foreign expenditures
and 95 percent of local expenditures for technical services, 100
percent of foreign expenditures and 75 percent of local expendi-
tures for equipment and vehicles; 90 percent of total expenditures
for the construction of buildings, schools and other civil works;
and 25 percent of the salaries and wages costs of the extension
and grading components of the project. No disbursements would be
made for the incremental working capital required by the Froject.
It is expected that disbursements under the project would be
completed by 1980.
Benefits
46.  The five factories to be constructed under the project would
process an incremental annual output of about 9,000 tons of cashew
kernels and 2,500 tons of cashew nut shell liquid representing
40,000 tons of raw nuts. This compares to Tanzania's current
processing capacity of 6,200 tons of kernels. It is estimated that
as a direct result of extension services under the project, which
are expected to reach about 75 percent of the cashew farmers in
the project area, annual cashew nut production in the project
area would increase by 20 percent (about 19,000 tons raw nuts). No
difficulties are expected in marketing the increased production.
The improved grading services should also result in a higher
proportion of the higner grade nuts. Farm family cash incomes
are expected to increase by about 24 percent under the project.
Although the increases will be modest in absolute terms (an
increase from US$41 to US$51 per annum) they are important as



-16-
the project farmers are amongst the poorest in Tanzania.   The
economic rate of return to the project is estimated at 39 percent
over 20 years. The return on the extension and grading element
exceeds 100 percent and on the processing component is estimated
at 29 percent. The project is expected to provide, by full
development, an additional 5,000 jobs in processing, extension,
grading and research and incremental annual net foreign exchange
earnings of US$7.3 million. The water, education and health facilities
would provide public health and social benefits to the population
of the project area which is presently very deficient in such
amenities.
47. The project is well conceived and the project organization
is decentralized and adapted to the decentralized Government's
administrative structure (paragraph 11 above). The inclusion of
the provision of advisory services and training as part of the
turnkey contract for the factories (paragraph 44 above) should
ensure the availability of adequate technical expertise, both
immediate and in the future, and timely construction of the
processing facilities. In addition, the economic rate of return
to the project is relatively insensitive to modest changes in the
costs and benefits of the project. No adverse ecological effects
are expected to result from the project.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTIONI/
(As of March 31, 1977Z
There are currently 11 projects under execution.
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
Credit No. 217 TA - Tobacco Project: $9.0 Million Credit of October
9, 1970; Closing Date - September 30, 1976
Although this Project continues to experience difficulties, its
prospects appear to be improving. Farmer recruitment has improved
now that more farmers can cultivate tobacco on an individual as well
as a collective basis; however, there is still a shortfall of the
revised planting targets. The village water supply situation which
has caused severe recruitment problems in the past has greatly improved.
The financial managemant of the Project remains weak and arrangements
are being made to recruit a suitably qualified and experienced financial
controller for the Tobacco Authority.
Credit No. 287 TA - Smallholder Tea Project: $10.8 Million Credit of
March 3, 1972; Closing Date - December 31, 197D
This Project has experienced a number of delays. Although problems
relating to farmer recruitment have eased as the Government's col-
lectivization policy has become more flexible, the Project has experienced
a number of implementation difficulties reflecting shortcomings in
Project management. The Government and the Tea Authority are now
considering ways of strengthening management to assist the
Authority in solving those difficulties.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors
regarding the progress of projects ini execution, and in particular
to report any problems which are beina encoumtered, and the actions
being taken to remedy them. They should be read in this sense,
and with the understanding that they do not purport to present
a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project
execution.

Credit No. 382 TA - Second Livestock Development Project: $18.5 Million
Credit of May 23, 1973; Closing Date - December 31, 1979
The Credit was declared effective on September 28, 1973. The
Government is recruiting the necessary staff to implement this Project.
Plans for the first phase of procurement are presently being finalized.
Credit No. 454 TA - Geita Cotton Project: $17.5 1Million Credit of
Januery 17, 1974; Closing Date - December 31, 1982
This credit was declared effective on April 5, 1974. The Govern-
ment and Cotton Authority are proceeding with recruitment.
POWER SECTOR
Loan 'No. 715 TA - Kidatu Hydroelectric Project: $30.0 Million Loan
of December 14, 1970; Closing Date - June 30, 1975
This Project has encountered major cost overruns. The latest
cost estimates exceed the original (US $59.0 million) by about one-
haL-T. The two main factors responsible for the overruns were (i)
the unexpectedly high cost escalations inside and outside Tanzania
since appraisal in April 1970 and (ii) the unexpected bad rock cond-
itions encountered during escalation of the underground facilities
which make up the major part of the main civil engineering works.
CIDA of Canada has provided Can$13.0 million to cover a large portion
of the overruns. Discussions are currently taking place between the
Bank, the Government and SIDA with a view to covering the residual
(about $ 9 .5 million). A supplementary loan would be necessary to ensure
the completion of the Project as originally scheduled; such a proposal is
shortly expected to be submitted to the Executive Directors for their
consicderation. In spite of these cost overruns, the Project still remains
the most attractive alternative to other possible development including
thermal, in the power sector.
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
Credit, No. 460-TA - Tanzania Investment Bank Project: $6.0 Million Credit
of February 13, 1974; Closing Date - June 30, 1978
This Credit was declared effective on April 18, 1974.

TRANSPORTATION SECTOR
Loan No. 586-TA - Second Highway Project: $7.0 Million Loan of
February 24, 1969; Original Closing Date - December 31, 1972:
Revised Closing Date - June 30, 1974
Construction work on this Projeict has been completed, but out-
standing claims by contractors are substantial. The Government and the
contractors have been negotiating these various claims for some time;
these negotiations are still continuing.
Credit No. 265-TA - Third Highway Project: $6.5 Million Credit of
August 6, 1971; Closing Date - December ,1, 1974
After long delays by Government. in completing tender
arrangements, an award of contract for thLe improvement of the
Mtwara-Masasi Road has been made. However, owing to the increase
in world prices for civil works since the appraisal in 1970, the bid
price for improving this Road is now more than double the appraisal
estimate. Work by two betterment units on the improvement of about
475 km. of agricultural feeder roads in the Geita district and Mara
region has commenced. Consultants for the preinvestment studies
to be funded under the Project have been selected and contracts are
being negotiated.
EDUCATION SECTOR
Credit No. 149-TA - Second Education Project: $5.0 Million Credit
of May 29, 1969; Closing Date - December 31, 1975
Progress has improved recently. All civil works contracts
have now been awarded and although it is not expected that lost time
can be made up, all elements of the project should be completed in good
order within a 24 month extension of the Closing Date.
Credit No. 232-TA - Third Education Project: $3.3 Million Credit
of February 5, 1971; Closing Date - June 30, 1975
Bids for the construction of all lj project institutions
were received in May 1973 resulting in the contract award for four
institutions but due to high quotations and poor response, the
remaining nine were retendered. Although the new tenders were still
higher than anticipated, all civil works contracts have now been
awarded. Although the lost time cannot 'be made up, project progress
has now improved.

Credit No. 371-TA - Fourth Bducation Project: $10.3 Million Credit
of April 13, 1973; Closing Date - June 30, 1978
The Credit was declared effective July 2, 1973. The
P:roject Coordinator has been appointed and after some delays,
technical assistance specialists to assist in Project implementation,
provided by the Danish International Development Agency, have
been recruited and are now arriving in Dar es Salaam.
