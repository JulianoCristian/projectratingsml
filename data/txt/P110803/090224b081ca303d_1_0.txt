                         The project was declared effective on 5 November 2009. The original Project closing date was July 31, 2012 but was extended by 24 months and revised to July 31, 2014 to allow for
                         completion of project activities.

                         Overall, while some indicators such as ‘direct project beneficiaries’, student : teacher ratios, and ‘textbooks purchased’ show some improvements, several core indicators such as
                         GER for S1-S4, transition rate to S1, student to classroom ratio show little or negative progress. In addition, while competency levels in core subjects (English, Biology, and

                         Project implementation progress is mainstreamed into the Ministry of Education and Sports’ agencies and responsibilities. Although this has led to gains in capacity, implementation
                         of the Project has faced challenges due to a combination of factors including lack of familiarity with Bank procedures and constrained capacity within the MOES; lack of preparedness
                         to handle procurement at the local school level, and (iii) inadequate supervision and coordination by MOES.

                         Currently, 659 schools (217 schools under Phase 1 and 442 schools under Phase II) have ongoing contracts for civil works. So far civil works have been completed in 150 schools
                         and furniture has been supplied to only 44 schools. Another 48 schools are more than 90% complete. Remaining schools are in various stages of completion. Since there is
                         considerable delay in the completion of the civil works contracts, the remaining construction works need to be closely monitored to ensure timely completion. This issue has been
                         discussed at length with MOES and agreements reached to expedite implementation

                         Procurement and delivery is completed for: science kits, chemical reagents, and the first round of textbooks. Procurement is underway for the second round of textbooks. As a result
                         all USE schools have benefitted from science kits and student: textbook ratios have improved beyond project target at the time of delivery. The second round of procurement for text
                         books is ongoing, which is expected to further improve textbooks availability. The curriculum reform process is progressing on schedule although it faces challenges of coordination
                         and financing of complementary activities. UNEB has been supported for capacity building to undertake assessments. Impact evaluations have been conducted for informing
                         Government’s policy on public private partnerships, and double shifting for lower secondary education. A BTVET strategic plan, Skilling Uganda, was prepared and adopted by the
                         Government. The Teacher Development Management System is under preparation. The needs assessment of two National teacher Colleges is on-going.
