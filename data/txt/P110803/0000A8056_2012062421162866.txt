                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was declared effective on 5 November 2009. The project suffered major delays in procurement. These delays occurred due to lack of preparedness, lack of familiarity with
                         Bank procedures, and constrained capacity within the MOES procurement unit. Two additional contractual staff positions were approved and the Project team reviews project
                         progress on a regular basis, holding monthly meetings to follow up on progress and addressing bottlenecks as they arise. Most major contracts have been cleared and are in process
                         of execution. Significant progress has been made n the delivery of text books and science kits to USE schools and the pace of construction of school facilities has also picked up.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         In 2010, the project was threatened with a likely violation of procurement guidelines in relation to textbooks. This was investigated further and through consultative efforts and with
                         support from the management team, the matter was resolved.
