                         As of June 30, with the project closing just one month away, the project has enabled Government establish the foundation for sustainable expansion of quality lower secondary
                         education for Uganda both at the school and national level. At the school level, the following have been achieved: (a) gender and disability friendly expansion of 575 schools of the
                         759 needy schools that participate in the delivery of the Universal Secondary Education (USE) for Uganda; (b) reduced student to textbook ratios at the lower secondary education
                         level from 11:1 in 2008 to not more than 2:1 to date; (c) internationally certified skills enhancement in management and pedagogical leadership for all 922 head teachers of the public

                         USE schools for Uganda; and (d) 759 school management teams that are equipped with financial and procurement skills for improved school level governance. At the national level,
                         the following have also been undertaken for education systems strengthening for quality education: (a) a revised lower secondary curriculum framework and grade specific syllabuses
                         aimed at improving secondary education quality and relevance in the near future; (b) strengthened capacity of the Ministry of Education and Sports (MoES) to assess learning
                         achievement at the lower secondary level and also oversee large scale projects; (c) a national 10 year skills development strategy for the vocational education sub sector – ‘Skilling

                         Challenges
                         Despite the above achievements for the education sector, four project development outcome (PDO) indicators have not been met and only one of the three intermediate outcome
                         indicators has been met. This resulted from amongst others, the following factors. First of all, the project design was anchored on the overall Universal Post Primary Education and
                         Training (UPPET) program with nationwide coverage of project activities, as well as national program outcome indicators (gross enrollment ratios – overall and for girls & boys,
                         transition rate, student to classroom ratio, student to teacher ratio and student to textbook ratio)- which was more than what could realistically attributed to project activities.
                         Secondly, the targets were informed by assumptions drawn from enrollment statistics generated by the Education Management Information System (EMIS) for the years prior to
                         2011, which could not hold when changes in EMIS reporting were effected from 2011. The changes also subjected project reporting to two EMIS regimes -(prior to 2011, and after
                         2011) yet respective regimes had different trend patterns for enrollment growth.

                         Further, significant implementation challenges compromised the delivery of intended outcomes as planned including: the delayed start of major activities like school civil works;
                         delayed disbursement of funds to schools for timely contracting processes; delayed procurement processing of major contracts; and late financial reporting by schools. Significant
                         improvements in implementation progress have been registered in the one year prior to project end, resulting from capacity development efforts and intensive supervision of project
                         operations with support from World Bank management.

                         Disbursement.
                         As of July 1, 2014; US$136,665,831.90 had been disbursed representing 89.3% of the credit. Absorption of the remaining US$16 million is not likely in the remaining few weeks of the
                         project. Funds not used will be canceled.

                         Incomplete activities.
                         At the time of compiling this ISR, activities pending completion include: supply of printer for the Uganda National Examination Board (UNEB); supply of furniture to 148 schools; and
                         provision of metallic lockable cupboards to all USE schools. Government committed to complete activities that will not be completed by the end of the project.
