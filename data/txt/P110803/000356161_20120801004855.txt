1.      The Closing Date for the Uganda Post-Primary Education and Training Project
(the Project) will be extended by 24 months from July 31, 2012 to July 31, 2014.

2.      Key Project achievements to date include (i) the reduction of Student: Textbook
ratios to 1:3 compared to the target of 1:4; (ii) the reduction of Student: Classroom ratios
to 44:1 compared to the target of 72:1; (iii) development and Cabinet approval of a 10
year Strategic Plan for Business, Technical, Vocational Education and Training; and (iv)
the development and implementation of the Strategy for Upper Secondary Education.
Project performance is currently rated Moderately Satisfactory for Implementation
Progress due to unforeseen delays in some implementation activities. On the Project
Development Objective, the Project is rated Moderately Satisfactory due to declining
trends in learning outcomes in key subjects as well as in transition rates from primary to
lower secondary education. The declining percentages are a consequence of the
introduction of the universal secondary education policy. This policy has been successful
in sharply increasing enrolments, as well as the absolute number of students who are
achieving better learning outcomes. However, due to inadequate readiness to address
quality issues, several results have not yet been achieved. In particular, the values of
indicators which measure trends in quality have declined. For example, between 2008
and 2012, the transition rate to secondary education fell from 68 percent to 65 percent,
and the share of students achieving the minimum competency level in Mathematics
declined from 69 percent to 34 percent. Completion of project activities is expected to
help reverse this trend once the impact of project inputs (such as textbooks and
classrooms) on the quality of education materializes, which is expected to occur during
the project extension period.

3.   Progress of major activities under the Project by project component is
summarized below.

4.     Component 1: Increase access to lower secondary education. The Project
supports the provision of additional facilities in 759 lower secondary schools. For ease of
management and supervision, construction in schools under the Project is being executed
in three phases. In phase 1, which covers 217 schools, approximately 75 percent of
schools are in final stages of construction and are expected to be completed by September
31, 2012. In phase 2, which covers 442 schools, construction has commenced in 287
schools. Contracts for the remaining 155 schools are in process. Contracting for the 127
schools to be covered in phase 3 is expected to commence in October 2012, and be
completed 12 to 16 months thereafter. Progress in Phase 1 was affected by the
unprecedented inflation not anticipated at the time of contracting. The rest of the phases
are expected to proceed more quickly given the experience built and lessons derived from
phase 1.
5.      Component 2: Improve the quality of lower secondary education. The project is in
the process of completing delivery of textbooks, having reduced textbook ratios from the
targeted 1:4 under the project to 1:3 overall and 1:2 in the seven core subjects. Science
kits are in final stages of delivery to more than 1,340 schools across the country.
Procurement for a second lot of textbooks is underway and delivery is expected to be
completed by June 2013. A comprehensive review of the lower secondary curriculum is
ongoing. Procurement for a needs assessment of two National Teacher Colleges is at the
final stage and will be executed during the period of proposed extension, along with the
planned rehabilitation of one National Teacher College.

6.      Component 3: Enhance the enabling environment for post-primary education and
training. A strategic plan for Skilling Uganda was prepared and approved by the
Cabinet. The study for the flow and use of capitation grants

7.      The project was optimistically designed for implementation within a three-year
period, particularly considering that it contains a large construction program. Government
capacity and time required for implementation preparedness was underestimated. This
resulted in delays at start-up. Additionally, some activities have experienced unforeseen
delays, in particular: (i) execution of civil works was delayed due to the extensive
planning and capacity-building activities undertaken prior to contracting; and (ii) a
number of procurements (such as text books, and technical assistance for curriculum
reform) also experienced delays due to capacity constraints.

8.     Despite initial delays, the pace of activities has picked up and, to date, the project
has disbursed $72.23 million (48%). Nevertheless, various project activities, including
construction of schools and procurement of the second batch of textbooks, will not be
completed by the current Closing Date. The extension of the Closing Date is required to
not only complete these activities (as is reflected in the revised procurement plan for the
proposed two year extension), but also to enable utilization of key inputs by teachers and
schools in order to improve educational quality, which is part of the Project Development
Objective.

9.      Ideally, the project would have been restructured at the same time as this
extension. However, due to time constraints the project is being extended by the current
closing date of July 31, 2012. This will provide sufficient time by the end of September
2012 to undertake an extensive review and do an appropriate restructuring. Such a
restructuring would include not just physical completion of the schools but make them
fully functional and focus on learning outcomes and quality aspects; revise the results
framework to include intermediate or project level indicators; and reallocate some of the
funds from the last phase of the school construction program to quality aspects if these
schools cannot be completed within the 24 month extension period.

10.      At this time, this extension is the first restructuring of the project and does not
entail any change in: (i) the project development objective; (ii) the results framework;
(iii) the description of the project or components of the project as described in the
Financing Agreement; or (iv) the safeguards category. The Task Team confirms that the
requirements of OP/BP13.30 (Closing Dates) have been met, specifically, (i) the project
objectives continue to be achievable; (ii) the performance of the Borrower is satisfactory;
(iii) the team has received an implementation plan as well as an updated procurement
plan from government to complete the project within the revised closing date; and (iv)
there are no outstanding audits, or IFRs for the credit.
