moderately unsatisfactory outcome with a substantial risk to\n            development outcome. Both the Bank and the Borrower received\n            moderately unsatisfactory performance ratings. The project\n            was restructured twice, July 18, 2012 and August 9, 2013. In\n            neither restructuring was the PDO changed. The initial\n            restructuring was to extend the project by two years with a\n            new closing date of July, 31, 2014. The second restructuring\n            revised the Intermediate Results indicators and reduced the\n            scope of civil works in Component 1 and reallocated IDA\n            proceeds from Categories 2, 3 and 4 to Category 1. There\n            were six lessons learned from this project and are as\n            follows: (1) Project teams must understand and document\n            indicator definitions as well as constantly monitor the\n            reliability of project data that depends on national data\n            systems. The development of monitorable indicators designed\n            in the context of the specific project is important. (2)\n            Project teams designing projects which focus on government\n            programs as opposed to individual projects must develop and\n            use project specific indicators and data sources to deal\n            adequately with issues of attribution. (3) Inclusion of a\n            strong capacity development component is essential for\n            projects that mainstream implementation in a decentralized\n            system. (4) Implementation readiness is essential to\n            ensuring that project implementation proceeds as designed.\n            (5) Strategic use of technical assistance within the\n            implementing agencies\u0092 teams significantly enhances\n            capacity. (6) Project implementation period chosen during\n            design must be commensurate with the projected project activities."}, "docdt": "2015-01-12T00:00:00Z"}
