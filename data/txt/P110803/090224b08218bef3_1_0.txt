                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the first ISR since restructuring process concluded in August 2013 which aimed to: (i) recalibrate project indicators consistent with the project; (ii) re-allocate funds including
                         savings from exchange rate gains; (iii) introducing measures for greater use of instructional materials; and (iv) strengthening supervision and management of the civil works sub-
                         component for timely completion including modification of procurement modalities for the school based civil works. As part of the restructuring process, the World Bank and
                         Government agreed to reduce the expansion of school facilities from 759 to 659 schools, and also drop the expansion of two national teacher training colleges (Mubende and
                         Kabale) due to insufficient funds.

                         As of November 22, 2013, a total of US$116,205,971.82 had been disbursed constituting 76.8% of total project funding, which shows significant improvement from the last ISR of
                         June 2013, when disbursement was at 67%.

                         Achievement of the PDO is rated moderately unsatisfactory due to improvements in data collection measures by Government since 2011, arising from the demand for more accuracy
                         and reliability of the Education Management Information System (EMIS) data with specific reference to enrollment statistics where reporting by private schools is about 64%
                         compared to almost 100% of public schools. The improvement in data quality has resulted in lower enrollment numbers than previously projected by the MoES. For the years 2011 &
                         2012 the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) and Ministry of Education (MoES) agreed that a trend analysis for overall enrollment based indicators would be resumed in 2013 after
                         stabilization of EMIS data; and 2013 enrollment statistics would serve as a baseline for future years. As such, the GER appears to have dropped but the Project's baseline and targets
                         data were inflated. Further discussions with Government will be held and a supplementary ISR submitted in mid January 2014. The intermediate indicators have however, been met
                         because they draw from the public schools data where reporting is almost 100%, validated by the annual head count exercise undertaken in all public schools. Four of the 5 triggers
                         have also been met, with a high likelihood that the fifth trigger will be met by the close of the project.

                         Overall implementation progress rating is still Moderately Unsatisfactory mainly arising from the late roll out of the school based civil works procurement reform instituted by the
                         sector. Persistent challenges include:
                         1. Delays in civil works completion. Despite the significant gains made in the completion status for civil works in schools since the last ISR (376 of 659 schools are either ready for
                         handover or at defects liability period of 6 months while another 164 of the 659 are rated 70-89% complete pending furniture supply. It is therefore, projected that civil works in 540
                         (82%) of the 659 schools will be fully completed by March 2014, and at various stages of the 6 months defects liability phase prior to contract closure. However, civil works in 23
                         schools is still below the 70% completion mark and being intensively monitored, while contracts for civil works in 96 schools were terminated following poor contractor performance
                         and are currently being re-bid by the MoES. Of these 96 schools, facilities in 18 schools were assessed to be at foundation level with completed slabs, facilities at 42 schools were at
                         wall plate level, facilities at 15 schools were roofed and partially plastered with no fittings, 11 schools had roofed facilities and fitted with door and window flames, and 10 schools had
                         facilities complete with fittings but without glass and not painted. Ensuring completion of civil works in these schools is necessary to safeguard against likely reputational risk for the
                         Bank and non-realization of the planned development impact in these schools while the Government's capacity to complete the facilities is also low due to national resource
                         constraints. Centralized procurement of contractors to complete facilities in these schools has thus been initiated, with 57 of the 96 schools at bidding stage, with contract awards
                         projected for February 28, 2014. Compilation of the bills of quantities (BoQs) for the remaining 39 will be completed by December 5, 2013 to enable preparation of bidding documents.

                         2. Delays due to changes in staffing. A full time deputy coordinator focusing on civil works was appointed in June 2013, and field presence of education sector's engineering staff
                         instituted by August 30, 2013. However, there has been a recent turn over of key staff with a new project coordinator appointed on November 21, 2013 while the new head of the
                         procurement unit reported in October 2013. This may cause additional delays in conclusion of fiduciary processes including resolution of procurement decisions by the sector's
                         contracts committee. However, the deputy coordinator will support the bridging period.

                         3. Fiduciary concerns. Intensive actions are currently ongoing to ensure improvements in school level adherence to established financial and procurement guidelines, with an aim of
                         reducing unaccounted for balances and ineligible expenditures at the school level. The Inspectorate of Government has also been engaged by the education sector to work with
                         school level management teams for both preventive and punitive strategies as need arises. Delays in procurement processing persist resulting from changes in procurement staff but
                         ongoing capacity development by the Bank team will greatly remedy this area in the near future. These efforts will be sustained through the life of the project.

                         An action plan detailing out steps to be taken to improve implementation was discussed with the MoES during the mission wrap-up meeting on November 1, 2013, with special focus
                         on ensuring completion of civil works, improving compliance to fiduciary standards, improving response time to contractor issues, and timely submission of financial reports from
                         schools. A mini-assessment will be undertaken by the World Bank team by December 18, based on which overall implementation progress will be re-assessed. A complementary ISR
                         will be submitted follow up to the mini-assessment by January 25,2014.
