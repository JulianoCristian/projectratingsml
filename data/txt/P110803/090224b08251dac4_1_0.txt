                         The Project has laid a foundation for sustainable delivery of quality lower secondary education for Uganda. As a result of this project, the education systems boasts of gender friendly
                         learning environments in 513 of the 759 needy schools that participate in the delivery of the Universal Secondary Education (USE) for Uganda; reduced student to textbook ratios at
                         the lower secondary education level from 11:1 in 2008 to 3:1 to date; 759 school management teams that are equipped with financial and procurement skills for improved school level

                         The project is currently rated unsatisfactory despite the significant contribution of the project to the secondary education sub sector. The four project development outcome (PDO)

                         indicators have not been met, and only one of the three intermediate outcome indicators have been met. This is due to inflated targets at design coupled with changes in the
                         Education Management Information System (EMIS) since 2011. This is compounded by low data validity. The baseline values reported in the project restructuring paper and the
                         original project appraisal document are different from the values derived from the EMIS system. A restructuring to change the indicator targets is not possible at this stage as over
                         80% of project funds have already been spent.

                         As the Project winds up, Government through the Ministry of Education and Sports (MoES) is urged to ensure sustainability for the results made including operation and maintenance
                         of civil works, ensuring effective use of instructional materials, and full integration of curriculum review process in the sector operations.
