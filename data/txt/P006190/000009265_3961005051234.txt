INTRODUCTION
(1)         Fostering the role of mun:.cipal governments io achieve national economic
development and welfare is a centmal objective of the newly elected Government of Bolivia. To
this end, the Government is committed to undertake a major effort to improve the administrative,
financial and development capabilities of municipalities. The priority attached to this objective
rests aun the Government's awareness that only a well-performing system of muimcipal
governments can ensure sustnable democrcy, effective decentalzation, balanced regional
development, and a fuller development of the country's human and economic potential.
(u)         Government municipal development efforts are led by the Ministry of Human
Development (MHD) and its Sert'miat for Urban Developmient (SUD). In the fofront of
municipal development is also the 'Fondo Nacional de Desanrollo . egional (FNDR)", which is
responsible for financing municipal infrastructure investments. Moreover, Bolivia has been very
successfil at mobilizing foreign assistance for municipal development. Multilateral and bilateral
agencies is well as numerous NGOs support most government activities or directly assist speci4 c
municipalities. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has been instrumental to the
development of FNDR and municipal credit.
(ill)       In spite of considerable achievements, the results of past government municipal
development efforts were hampered by inadequate coordination between the interested agencies
and the lack of a framework to capitalize on the assistance of internaional rganizations and
foreign donors. Moreover, most municipal development activities, including credit, were
focused on a limited number of large cities. Aware of the above issues and missed
opporunities, the Government relies on th.e Bank to help coordinate its activities, create a
framework to harmonize them with those of exterl donors, and expand them to small and
intemdate municipalities.
(iv)        IlDA assistance, along with that of other investors and donors, is expected to
enable muiicipalities to progressively meet the responsibilities devolved to them by the
Government's decentralization plans and fulfill the resulting administratve and public service
obligations. The achievement of this objective calls fc,r the implementation of integrated
progams to progressively improve the civil service, strengthen managerial capabilities and
expand the provision of services at municipal level. These programs need to be tailored to the
development level of the various municipalities. Moreover, they need to be phased according
to the priority of their development needs, their potential for improvement, and their absorptive
capacity.



L THE SECTOR
A. Urban Growth and Demmand for Munici1 Srvis
Urban Structure and Urbanization Trends
1.01       During the last the decades te disparity in urban and rural growth rates has
dramatically chaned Bolivia's demographic profile. With urban areas growig four times faster
than rual areas, 58% of the Bolivian population is now urban based compared to 42% in 1976.
Given the stuctua, eonomic and demographic charactiscs of the country, there is no reason
to bdieve that this trend will be reversed in the near future. It is projected that by the yeat '000
over 65% the of the population will be living in centefa larger than 2000 inhabitants, implying
a doubling of the urban population in le&- than three decades.

absence of a strong industrial base, the migration towards urban areas has been propelled by the
opportunities offered by commercia and service activities in the main centers of the Altiplano,
the Valley and the Eastern Lowlands regions. La Paz/El Alto with 1.115.403 inhabitants, Santa
Cruz with 694.616, and Cochabamba with 404.102 account for 63 % of the total urban
population in 1992.
1.03        Migration has changed the physical and ecornomic environment of urban aeas.
The sudden arrival of large numbers of poor and unsilled workers with their families has
resulted in the proliferation of unauthonzed peri-urban settlements lackdng basic inftastructure
and servces. It is estimated that approximately 30% of the Bolivian urban population lives in
these settlements. Urbanization has also resulted in the growth of informal sector advities.
These provide some 90% of the private commercial and service jobs, which, in tum, account
for 66% of total employment.
Status of Municipal Services
1.04       Under the pressure of rapid population growth, substantial public investnent to
expand city services and to pursue orderly urbar development are becoming an urgent necessity
everywhere. Table 2 shows the coverA,,e of public services in twenty-one selected
municipalities. With an average coverage level of only 36%, it appears that the availability of
sanitation facilities constitutes the main urban problem. t :nong the larger cities, this problem
is particularly acute in Santa Cruz, El Alto and Cochabamba where more than 50% of the
population does not have access to these facilities. In Trinidad and other smaller centers the
sewerage system is simply non-existent. Cochabamba. Santa Cruz and Potosf are the
departmental capitals with the worst percentages of access to drinking uater. With the exception
of Sucre, Viacha and Oruro less than 50% of the urban roads are paved. Access to electricity
has become wide-spread.
1.05       Existing data on the availability of services concern coverage ratios and do not
reflect the state of maintenanree of the facilities nor the quality of the services. The comparison
with the situation in 1988 shows that the availability of water supply connections and sewerage
services has fallen in some cities as a result of demographic pressure or specific management
problems. The problem of exteding the coverage of basic infrastructure and urban services is
compounded by the fact that new immigrants are only marginaly contributing to municipal fiscal
resources because of their low incomes and the informal nature of their adtvities. The lack of
basic infrastructure and urban services assumes more serious dimensions in small urban centers
as a result of their limited managerial and financial capabilities.

B. Insttutional Framework and Municipal Sector Orgnization
Government Structure
1.06       The government system of Bolivia is presently organized in two tiers: fte Central
Govemment, with its ministerial departments and local administrative extensions; and the
municipal goverments. At central level, the Miga of  :    Devlpmn (MHU) with its
Criat of Urban Develogment (SUD) is the main ministry concerned with municipal and
urban development. The Ministry f Financeand Ecgnomic Development (MOF) is responsible
for monitoing public financing flows from both domestic and foreign sources. TMHD/SUD
guides the implementation of housing and urban development policies. In the past, central
government activities in the sector have been constrained by limited staffing and resources. As
a result, cental government assistance to municipal and urban development was often camed
out as a reflection of immediate pressures rather than according to a national strategy. Urban
and housing development policies were generally ineffectual in addressing the needs of local
populations.
1.07       In the absence of a developed market for long-term credit, local govemments have
mostly depended on official lenders to finance infrastructure investment. The Na al Fund
R=gW - Devel-menit (FNDR) (Section III) operates as a financial intermediary lending or
administering resources mobilized by the centml government. Te Social Investment Eund
(FIS), tovides grants for investment projects with high social justificaton, using forign
donations or concessional loans. These include water and sewerage facilities in smal urban
centers and in low-income areas, as part of the effort to improve health.
1.08       Nine Regional Development Corporations (RDCs) are responsible for promoting
economic development within their teritorial junsdictions (departments). They operate under
the supervision of the Ministry of Sustainable Development (MSD), though with a significant
degree of autonomy stemniing from independent sources of income, mostly royalties from the
exploitation of natural resources. The developmental capabilities of the RDCs vary greatly
according to these sources. Santa Cruz's RDC (CORDECRUZ) is by far the strongest
corporation with an annual income of US$47 million in 1991. Oruro's RDC (CORDEOR) is
the poorest corporation with an at nual income of US$4.6 million. In the absence of a clear-cut
division of labor between the State, the RDCs and the municipalities, urban investment varies
gready between the regions, with occasional overlapping of responsibilities and duplication of
efforts. Sometimes the RDCs directly carry out urban investments in cities where the
municipalities are financially weak.
1.09       An important role played by the RDCs is that of both guarantors and resource
allocators of FNDR's loans to the municipalities and the utilities. Indeed, FNDR generally lends
to the RDCs which, in urn, on-lend or donate their loan proceeds to the project beneficiares.

The RDCs also assist FNDR in managing loan disbursements and collecting repayments. Tbis
activity is carried out by their Unidades Crediticias I Financieras (IME), that operate as semi-
autonomous entities.

1.10        To promote national economic development and local population welfre, the
Bohivian Government is planning to foster the political and administrative role of municipalities.
In particular, it is planning to oraniwze the entire territory of the State into municipal
jurisdictions -at present, municipalities are responsible for the administration of urban areas
solely, while rual area are under the jurisdiction of central government-, to enhance municipal
administrative capabilities and financial resources, and to transfer to municipal governments the
responsibility for the provision of selected education and health services. Moreover, it is
planning to promote a greater participation of the local population and indigenous groups in local
government activities and the provision of local services. These promcsses will be assodated
with a revision of the nature and role of government at departmental level and, within this, of
the functions of the RDCs. These decentralization plans are expected to improve the present
inter-governmental organization and fiscal relations. The Bank will be advising the Governnment
on decentraization through the ongoing Economic Management Strengthening Operation
(EMSO), supported by the IDA TA Credit 1977-BO, this proposed operation on Municipal
Sector Development, and the proposed National Civil Service Reform and Education Reform
Loans.

Municipal Operations and Responsibilities
1.11        Municipal government is regulated by the Organic Law of Municipaltes (OLM)
of January 10, 1985. The OLM introduced municipal council elections, held every two year.
Voters elect thteen councilors and an equal number of alternates. The mayor is chosen by the
council among its members. In spite of its many merits, the law allows for different
intpretatio  of the respective role of the mayor and the municipal council, an issue which
needs to be addressed to improve municipal maragement. Moreover, the brevity of the electoral
term, which is meant to ensure that local govemments remain responsive to fte needs of their
constituents, leads to political discontinuity and exacerbates the problem of the municipalities'
weak administative capacity (par. 1.26).
1.12        The OLM vests the municipalities with very broad powers including coordinatng
all public sector activities in urban areas, regulating and delivenng public services, and, in
general, improving the quality of life in urban centers. ITe gap between the role assigned to
them and their actual ability to perform it is generally considerable. Although the OLM includes
"public services and their regulation" among the functions of the municipalities, it nonetless
makes clear that the services need not be delivered by the municipality itself. Privatization of
selected municipal services such as power distribution, water supply and solid waste colection,
is currently under way in several municipalities. This process is however hampered by the lack
of precise privaization policies, technical assistance to the municipalities, and regulatory
capacity at both central and local level.
Municipal Organization and Staffing
1.13        With the partial exception of la Paz, no municipality has a well developed
orgnizational structure or a sufficient number of qualified administrative and tecbnical staff.
In 1993, in the departmental capitals, the size of technical personnel varied between 2 to 8% of
the total staff. Low wages and the absence of career incentives discourage qualified
professionals from pursuing a career in the municipalities. Frequent elections and a tradition
of patronage contribute to civil service decisions determined by political rather than efficiency
considerations. The number of municipal personnel varies greatly among municipalities. Most
large municipalities tend to be over-staffed as a result of political patronage in their personnel
recruitment activities. Small municipalities are generally under-staffed because of lack of
financial resources as well as a clear understanding of their responsibilities.
Mlunicipal Sector Istutions
1.14        Since the establishment of elected local governments in 1985, municipal power
has become more and more representative of local interests. Two associations (Ajgiacn de
Gobiernos Municipales Aut6nomos de Bolivia and Asociacidn Boliviana de Munici,alidades de
Provincias) awe currently trying to gain national political status on the base of this local
identification. Both associations are negatively affected by scarce financial and technical
resources, political divisions among their members, and the absence of a long term municipal
development strategy. However, there are signs that their role is expanding, as a result of the
greater commitment of municipal governments in promoting the cause of local inteests at the



.7-
national level. The possibility of merging the two associations into a single insitution is als
being considered.

1.15        Several public and private institutions as well as NOOs provide training services for civil
servants. Because of their origins and sponsors, public institutions often limit their training activities
either to a specific sector or to a specific geographic location. Although ptivate institutions and NGOs
do not face similar limitations, they act independendy without coordination. On the other hand, many
of these institutions, public and private, present considerable potential in terms of humar. resources and
facilities. In addition, they appear to be ready to provide their sevices to the muncipalites in a
competitive setting. The main issue is matching the demand for TA and training of the municipalities,
with the supply of the relevant services. During recent years, many government officials hve
recommended the creation of a municipal development institute (paras 1.27 and 2.20) to address this
issue.
C. Municipal Finance
Public Sector Financing and Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations
1.16        The tax reform law of 1986 sets forth six basic taxes on personal income, value added,
ual land, consumption of specific items, urban real estate, and vehicles. The first four taxes are
shared between the State, local governments and other selected entities in a system called "co-
pation". The Treasury withholds 75% of their revenues and redistributes the rest to municipalities
(10%), RDCs (10%), and Universities (5%). Property and vehicle taxes are administered direcdy by
the municipalities. These are also empowered to mobilize income from business licenses, fees for
municipal services, leases and sale of assets. Fiscal revenues from the co-participation system have
experienced a steady annual growth. On the contrary, revenues from the taxes adminis  at local
government level have fallen or remained unchanged.
1.17        Notwithstanding the merit of the fiscal reform in expanding the national tax base and
simplifying the tax strucure, the co-participation system reflects long-standing significart distortions
in favor of La Paz, Cochabamba and Santa Cruz (table 6). The VAT, the most important source of
municipal revenue, is collected where businesses are registered, notably the above three cities, rate
than where production or consumption actually takes place. Measures to review the co-participation
system have been already undertk ewith the result that El Alto received a share of La Paz's 1992
revenues.  Additional corrections are expected in the context of the general revision of inter-
govemmental fiscal relations that will follow the implementation of the decentalization law. As already
mentioned (para. 1.10), the Bank is expected to assist in this process.
Structure of Municipal Revenues
1.18             The revenues from the co-participation system are the most important source of
income for larger municipalities. Medium size municipalities rely to a greater degree on their ability
to generate resources, mainly through fees and licenses. In 1991 capital inflows for many

Structure of Muicipal Expenditure
1.19                                 The  expenditures of individual municipalities reflect the bias
observed in the revenue-sharing system. The joint expenditure of La Paz, Santa Cruz and
Cochabamba accounted for approximately 80% of total municipal outlays in 1991. On the other
hand a city such as El Alto, with an urban populaton of 404,367 and a growth rate of 9.2%,
was able to spend US$4,587,00 in 1991 compared to US$14,098,000 in Cochabamba, which has
an equal population and a growth rate of 4.3%.

1.20         In 1991, current expenditu   amounted to 64% of the total outlays of the major
municipalites (table 9). In Cochabamba, Oruro, Tarija and Potosf, these exceeded 80% of thdr
total outlays. The high level of current expenditures can be explained by the generalized lack
Of financial management and by the existence of employment practices which led to redundant
staffing. Payroll payments accounted for 43% of total municipal expenditue in 1989, 44% in
1990 and 45% in 1991. Non-personnel expenditure, transfers to the non-financial public sector
and consumption of final goods are the other most important components of current expenditure.

1.21          Capital expenditures are significant only in La Paz, Santa Cruz, Sucre and El
Alto. Art. 90 of the OLM legislates that municipalities should earmark at least 50% of their
income to investment, with the remainig 50% to be used for operating expenditiures. This
provision is disregarded by most municipalities. In addition, investments are usually undertakn
in resPonse to emergency situations or to political pressure, rather than on the basis of a clear
and coherent investment strategy.

1.23         FNDR has recently estimated the level of borrowing capacity of the largest
municipalities during the 1993-2002 decade. This estimate tkes into account a number of
factors such as the expected economic growth, irflation rates, the enlargement of muimcipal
fiscal bases, and increases in the VAT revenues. Except for Trinidad and Sucre, the incidence
of the modernization of the cadaster on revenues has not been taken into account. According
to this estimate, the municipalities with the higher borrowing capacity are those of La Paz, Santa
Cruz, Cochabamba and El Alto. The assessment of the debt service capability of other
municipalities is discouraging. This capability is expected to increase with the development of
fiscal cadastre and the improvement of financial management practices.

D. Sector Development lssues and Prospects
1.24        Since embarkng on a new political and economic course in 1985, BolivW a has
made remarkable progress in developing a more democratic society and pursuing economic
stabilization and adjustment. Urban communities were the most important contributors to this
progress, recipients of the associated benefits and bearers of the associated socioeconomic costs.
Improving the efficiency of municipal management and the ability of large and small urban
centers to provide adequate services to their inhabitants and generate productive economic
activities is a prerequisite to continued macro-conomic stability and the achievement of
sustainable growth. It is also a prerequisite to the fulfillment of the critical government
objectives of promoting effective decentralization, balanced regional development, prvate sector
investment, and, in general a fuller actualization of the country's economic and human
resources.
1.25        In the face of the above challenge, municipal and urban development are affected
by an array of political, financial and managerial problems. The weakness of the municipal
administration and civil service systems, the inadequate institutional setting for the provision of
technical assistance to municipalities, ineffectual local fiscal resource mobilization, and marked
regional disparities, compounded with geographic concentration of investment financing,
represent critical constraints to municipal and urban development whose alleviation could
produce great returns.
1.26        Municipal Administration and Civil Service System. The brevity of Bolivia's
local government cycle coupled with political patronage generates a significant turnover of
personnel each time a new administration takes office, resulting in frequent municipal
development policy shifts and poor institutional memory. This undermines any serious attempt
by incumbent adrninistrations to plan on a medium/long-term basis and reduces the benefits of
municipal strengthening activities and staff training. The Govemment is considering amending
the Constitution in order to extend the duration of municipal govemments and help enhance their
administrative performance. However, this prxcess will require time. Meanwhile, it is of the
utmost importance to enhance the efficiency and productivity of the municipal civil service by
improving its organization, operations and staffing. The management policies, recruitment
practices and the terms and conditions of employment of municipal personnel need to be
overhauled to promote higher levels of performance and accountability. This includes protecting
municipal staff from dismissal unrelated to objective performance criteria. An additional
challenge relates to the need for designing municipal salary scales that will permit the
recruitment of qualified technical staff without increasing the salary of existing unqualified
personnel. Improving the municipal civil service will complement government effort to reform
the national civil service. This effort is supported by IDA through the EMSO Project (para
1.10) and a proposed Civil Service Project, being prepared.
1.27        Technical assistance to municipalities. Bolivia lacks an effective system for the
de'ivery of technical assistance to the municipalities. In the past, the Ministry of Planning and
Coordination, the Ministry of Urban Affairs, the RDCs, FNDR and international agencies
provided technical assistance without any systematic coordination, often duplicating their efforts.



- 14 -
This proces was generaly characzed by a top-down approach, political interference and
inter-agency conflicts. The National Service for Urban Development-SENDU, under the
supervision of the Ministry of Urban Affairs, was the agency responsible for coordinating tie
delivery of TA. SENDU was discontinued after a short existence, mainly because of lack of
resources and political considerations. To be effective, TA to municipal govemnments must be
ied to a global vision of how all the responsible institutions should function and what should be
their role in the sector.  As already mentioned, the creation of a 4ecialized municipal
development institute, sponsored by the municipalities themselves and the other agencies
involved in the sector, could respond to the need for protinotng and coordinating TA activities
to municipalities. This institute could also help Central Govenment define municipal and urban
development policies and monitor municipal investment actvities, FNDR promote investment
credit, and foreign donors deliver technical assistance to the sector.
1.28        Local resource mobilization.  Municipalities are ineffective in mobilizing
resources through the fiscal instruments tht they administer, notably real estate taxes and
vehicle and business licenses (para 1.16). At present, revenues from these taxes and licenses
account for less than 20% of municipal total income and are collected with administrative costs
often greater than their yield. This is particularly troubling for the real estate taxes which
present considerable fiscal potential and could help enhance municipal borrowing capacites.
Fostering the yield of these taxes requires modernizing/creating municipal fiscal cadsters,
revising tax assessment procedures, adjusting rates, and improving billing and collection
procedures. With the assistance of UNDP/HABITAT, the previous Ministry of Urban Affairs
established a Cadaster Department in charge of defining cadaster standards and promoting their
application by the municipalities. This Departnent, now under the responsibility of the
MHD/SUD, needs to coordinate its activities with the institutions responsible for the legal
cadastre (property titles) and rural land. A proposed IDA Land Administration Project, being
prepared by LA3AG, is supporting the establishment of a new institutional system for the
registation and titling of agricultural land. Municipal fiscal and legal cadasters should be
extended from this system and jointly constitute the base for a future integrated land information
system.
1.29        Regional disparitles. Bolivia is chaactrized by geographical diversity, low
population density, and uneven territorial development. Its complex topography divides the
country in separate regions (altiplano, valleys and lowlands), which are largely isolated by lack
of communications. As a result, urban conditions vary greatly among and inside each region.
This calls for differendated urban development programs, custom tailored to the specific needs
of eah region and municipality. Their implementation is generally hampered by the negative
effects of the geographic, demographic and economic factors on local absorptive capacities and
development costs.   The RDCs, or any  future renewed  form  of departnental
governmentladministration, should play a criical role in addressing these issues.
1.30        GeographicaBy Concentrated Invesment Fnancing. FNDR is performing the
very useful function of lending for investment projects implemented by municipalities and local
udlites and to make sure that these projects are technically sound, financially and economic
viable, and feasible in terms of their benefciaries' capabilities. FNDR lending is presently
cafried out through a two-tier process with the intermediation of the RDCs (para 1.09). This



- 15-
system presents the merit of optimizing the human and financial resources of the Corporations
for the preparation and implementation of municipal investment projects. However, it
discriminates against the municipalities under the jurisdiction of poor RDCs, thus furthering
regional disparities. It also discourages fiscal accountabilty by the municipalities and their
utilities which could have direct access to credit. It is desirable that the present system be
modified to permit creditworthy muinicipalides and utlities to borrow directly and to make sure
that priority projects in poor municipalities and regions are financed through transfers from the
National Treasury.
E. Government Plans
1.31        The Government is aware that promoting municipal development and improving
mumcipal management is a prerequisite to the achievement of effective decentralization, balanced
regional development, private sector investment, and, in general, a better development of local
huma. and economic resources. Responding to most immediate needs, government efforts to
foster municipal development have mainly focused on helping municipalities and their utlities
provide essential public serces sucli as water supply and sanitation. In addition to financing
the construction of the required facilities, the previous Government promoted the establishment
of a National Direction for Basic Sanitation (DINASBA) in the Ministry of Urban Affairs, the
creation of a National Association of Water Supply and Sewerage Enterprises (ANESAPA), and
the development of speialized TA Units for water supply and sanitation within the RDCs. The
provision of these services in small urban centers remains a major probiem insofar as the limited
number of users does not allow for the establishment of viable enterp.ises. This issue could be
solved by creating regional water enterprises or establishing innovative systems of enterprise
muual support. A study to this effect is being prepared with financing of the Three Cities
Water Supply Project (Credit 2187-BO). It is expected that the study, to be completed by mid
1994, will also provide useful recommendations on the role of DINASBA, ANESAPA and the
regional water supply and sanitation TA units, within the present government administrative
strcture.
1.32        During the last three years, the previous Government considerably expanded the
scope of its developmental action in the sector. Capitalizing on technical and financial assistance
provided by multilateral and bilatal international agencies (UNDPIHABITAT; IDA; IDB;
German, Japanese, and Dutch Governments), it has initiated programs to help municipalities
increase resource mobilization through real estate taxation (cadaster), improve their accounting
and finmcial management systems and practices, and restructure/develop solid waste
management activities. Originally conceived as experiments limited to pilot cities, these
programs are now poised to be carried out in a more permanent form and to be extended
nationally. Their implementation will be combined with that of broader TA programs to
improve the municipal civil service, notably the organization of municipal governments and their
personnel management functions. These activities will support the implementation of the
Government's decentralization poLicies and plans (pam. 1.10). They will encompass a review
of the Organic Law of Municipalities (paras. 1.11 and 1.12), a general overhaul of fte present
tax revenue shaing system ("coparticipaci6n") para. 1.17), and a possible extension of the
electoral niandate of mayors and municipal administrations (pam. 1.11). A strengthened SUD



-16 -
in the Ministry of Human Development, FNDR and the proposed Municipal Development
Institute would be :nstrumental to the achievement of this agenda.  Through FNDR, the
previous Government has also established a system of financial incentives (matching grants to
investment loans) to promote municipal investments in piority areas such as water supply and
sanitation and for priority low-income beneficiaries. This system is expected to be expanded to
include grants for environmental projects and to cover the totality of investment costs for priority
projects in poor cities.
1L THE PROJECT
A. Prior Bank Experience In the Sector in Bolivia
2.01        Past Bank assistance to municipal and urban development includes two operations.
The first (Credit 1489-BO) was implemented between 1977 and 1986 and helped provide basic
shelter and urban facilities to low-income households in La Paz; the second (Credit 1842-BO),
in progress since 1988, is intended to strengthen this city's institutional capacity and fiscal base
while addressing critical infstructure, public service and environmental deficiencies. Project
compleon is exected on schedule by the end of 1995.
2.02        Overall, the implementation of both projects has proved successful and each
proect achieved, or is achieving, most of its expected results. The first project helped provide
basic shelter and urban services to low-income households, expand job opportunities for artisans
and small-scale entrepeneurs, and improve institutional coordination. The second has already
addressed critical infrstructure deficiencies, fostered a better organization of solid waste
coLection and disposal, and helped protect environmentally critical areas from flooding and
landslides. Institutional building components, yet to be fully completed, are aimed at enhancing
the administrative capacity and fiscal base of the Municipality.
2.03        The experience drawn from these operations shows that the objectives most
difficult to achieve are those related to institutional development. This is mainly due to the lack
of a well established mur.icipal civil service system. In addition, short electoral mandates and
local political constraints hamper the implementation of municipal reorganization and personnel
management progams.
2.04        In urban areas, the Bank has also financed 3 water supply projects aimed at
extending the coverage and improving the provision of such services by the local utilitiesl. The
experience drawn from these operations confirms that institutional issues, such as enterprise
autonomy in setting tariffs, are the dominant constraints to successful project implementation.
1.     The first project (Loan 1324-BO) was implemented by CORPAGUAS, a now defunct
national agency reporting to the former Ministry of Urban Affairs, and provided for the
construction of water systems in 70 small urban areas. The second project (Credit 948-BO), in
Santa Cruz, also comprised sanitation works. The third project (Credit 2187-BO) benefits La
Paz, Santa Cruz and Cochabamba. The responsibility for managing its implementation has been
transfered to FNDR, dunng project execution. FNDR acts as a local financial intermediary.



- 17-
2.05        With the exception of the first water supply project, past Bank Group operations
in the area of municipal and urban development benefitted the capital city or very large urban
centers. As municipalities operate in isolation from each other with no institutional framework
to provide a permanent vehicle for exchange of experiences and consultation, these operaions
had little impact on the municipal and urban development activities of other cities.
2.06        Learning from past experiences and in line with present government orientations,
the Bank strategy in the municipal and urban development sector calls for setting municipal
strengthening activities in the context of a generl improvement of the municipal civil service
and the institutional system supporting and coordinating municipal and urban development.
Moreover, it calls for broadening the scope of its technical and financial assistance from the
main cities to a larger spectrum of urban centers, including intermediate cities and small
provincial capitals.
B. Project OrWns and Preparation Process
2.07        As part of its work program for FY92, LA3IN prepared a Municipal Development
Strategy Assistance Paper aimed at assessing the status of municipal development and finance
in Bolivia. The discussion of this Paper with the Government, at the beginning of 1992, set the
stage for project preparation.
2.08        A PPF Advance, in the amount of US$1.5 million, sponsored the implementation
of essentdal studies, surveys and diagnoses, for which no other sources of funding were
available. These activities include: (i) a study to help define the meares that central and local
authorities should take to improve the Local Civil Service; (ii) consulting services to identify and
prepare institutional development programs and priority investment projects in 26 municipalities.
hese services were performed by 4 teams of 6 sectoral experts each, located in La Paz,
Cochabamba, Santa Cruz and Sucre; (iin) consulting services to prepare feasibility and
engineering studies for water supply and sanitation projects in poor peri-urban areas, with local
community participation in their implementation; and (iv) a feasibility study on the proposed
Municipal Development Institute (para 1.27).
2.09        The PPF program to identify and prepare institutional development programs and
priority investment projects in 26 municipalities was designed as a self-contained exercise,
leading to operational results even in the absence of any subsequent Bank lending opeation.
This approach proved to be effective in strengthening local commitment to the implementation
of the program.
C. Rationale for Bank Involvement
2.10        The Bank assistance strategy in Bolivia calls for continued support to government
plans to: (i) maintain macroeconomic stability, in association with the implementation of
structual reforms fostering economic growth; (ii) improve the efficiency of public sector
management, while disengaging the State from productive and service activities; (iii) promote



- 18 -
the development of human capital and alleviate poverty; and (iv) develop a national policy for
sustainable development incorporating prudent environmental management. This assistance
strategy is carried out through a selective progm  of lending operations covering most leiding
sectors.
2.11        By fostering efficient management, fiscal responsibility, environmentally sound
infrastructure development, and the provision of essential services to the poor at municipal level,
the proposed Project expands the Bank's assistance strategy from central to local government
level and critically contributes to its ,full achievement.
2.13        The Bank will share its involvement in the sector with other multilateral and
bilater institutions. The Bank's intervention is critical to the solution of policy and institutional
development issues. Financially, the intervention is justified by the magnitude of the sector
investment needs and the complementarity of IDA resources to those mobilized by other
investors and donors.
D. Project Objectives
2.14        Broadly speaking, the Project aims at enhancing the efficiency of municipal
governments and improving the provision of public services to urban dwellers. More
specifically, the Project aims at promoting:
(a)  effective decentralization by enhancing the management, development and
regulatory capabilities, as well as the resource base, of municipalities, local
utilities and service enterprises;
(b)  resource mobilization and allocation for priority municipal investment ojects by
strengthening financial intermediation in the sector and developing an investment
incentive system based on matching grants; and
(c)  poverty reduction and balanced regional development by encouraging the
financing of municipal infrastructure in un-serviced peni-urban areas and in
secondary cities.
2.15        The pursuit of the above objectives responds to the long-term strategy of enabling
all Bolivian municipalities to fulfill the political, administrative and public service responsibilitis
already mandated to them by the Constitution and the present Organic Law of Municipalities,
and the furnher responsibilities that the Govemment intends to assign to them under its
decentralization plans. Challenging this achievement is a municipal situation charactiz  by
an incipient stage of political and administrative autonomy and great disparities in the local
availability of human and financial resources. The municipalities of La Paz, Cochabamba and
Santa Cruz can modernize rapidly, capitalizing on their privileged geographic position,
infrastructure links and expanding economies. Possibly another dozen provincial capitals and



- 19-
border cities present promising growth prospects over the next decade. With appropriate
support, they can successfully undergo a process of gradual municipal development and
improved municipal management. Finally, the majority of the other cities are severely hampered
in their development quest by structural problems denving from geographic isolation,
underpopulation or a faltering economic base.  Only time and the associated regional
demographic and economic transformations will ereate the conditions for a major improvement
of municipal services and liv:ig conditions.
2.16        In the short run, the proposed Project will help the Govemment promote
municipal development by supporting the implementation of appropriate programs to improve
the municipal civil service, strengthen municipal management and expand the provision of
municipal services. These programs will be selectively targeted and designed to acheve full
modernization of municipal management and fuli administrative and financial autonomy in La
Paz, Cochabamba and Santa Cruz, a self-supporting process of improvement of the
administrative and financial capabilitie.s of the dorn cities with growth prospects mentioned
above, and the development of basic administrative capavities and basic municipal senrices in
intermediate and small cities, starting with those with greater administrative significance and
potential for economic development. Fizially and most importantly, IDA should help the
Government establish the institutions and mechanisms that will make the above activities self-
supporting and permanent.
E. Project Description
2.17        Consonant with its objectives the Project will support the following activities
(project components):
Intitutional Development Component
2.18       This component focuses on improving the Municipal Civil Service, as a
prerequisite to efficient municipal management, and establishing a Municipal Development
Institute as a means to assist municipalites in their development efforts in a coordinated,
effective and autonomous fashion. Moreover, it supports the implementation of TA activities
to strengthen the policy making and operating capability of MHD and its SUD.
2.19        Municipal Civil Service. The proposed Project will help the Govemment develop
appropriate measures Oegislation, norms, incentives) to improve the organization, functioning
and personnel management of municipal administrations. This will include the revision of
present personnel recruitment criteria and processes, and the development of terms and
conditions of employment for higher and intermediate level staff. Moreover, the Project will
help 10 pilot municipalities implement modern organizational structures, review the size of their
staff, establish effective personnel management systems, and update salary scales. These cites
will be selcted based on the outcome of the project preparation studies (pam 2.08) and the
willingness of the municipal administrations concerned to reform their civil service. The Project
will finance expenditures for consulting services, promotional activities, and legal advice. Part



-20-
of these expenditures will cover general purpose activities (e.g., preparation of draft legislation,
publication of guidelines, execution of seminars and conferences); part, the implementation of
civil service reform activities in the selected municipalities. The latter will be combined with
municipal strengthening and training programs (paras. 2.22 - 2.24).
2.20        Municipal Development Institute. The proposed Project will help establish and
support the initial operations of MDI. In July 1993, legal steps were taken to create MDI as a
non-profit orgarization, politically independent, and constituted as a partnership among
municipalities and other stakeholders in municipal development, including central government
agencies, specialized institutions and professional associations. Its main function will be to assist
municipalities to identify their development needs in priority areas such as municipal
administration and finance, fiscal resource mobilization, infrastructure development, and physical
planning. On request, it will also help the municipalities prepare and implement programs to
meet the above needs. In implementing such programs, including studies and training activities,
the Institute will rely on specialized public entities, non govemment organizations and private
firms or individual consultants. The Institute is expected to be a very lean and focused
institution. Its basic operating costs will be funded by its stakeholders. However, since it will
charge for the provision of services to municipalities, over time the Institute is expected to
become largely self-supporting. ANNEX I provides a more detailed description of the proposed
juridical nature, statutory objectives, organizational structure, and establishment and operating
costs of the Institute. The proposed Project will fund selected expenditures related to its three
first years of operations. These include the costs of the services of foreign and national
consultants to advise and support its permanent staff, the rental of office space, and the
acquisition of office equipment, furniture and supplies.
2.21        Technical Assistance to the Ministry of Hlnian Development. The proposed
Project will help MHD carry out policy studies, technical investigations and other activities
(e.g., seminars, publications, information travels) related to the implementation of the
Government's decentralization and 'municipalization" plans (para. 1. 10). Moreover, it will help
MHD's SUD strengthen its policy maldng, regulatory and advisory functions in the area of
urban development, particularly urban planning and environmental protection and control. This
latter objective will be achieved through the financing of staff training activities (i.e., in-house
courses, participation in specialized seminars in Bolivia and abroad, secondment in foreign
specialized institutions), consulting services for the preparation of policy and technical documents
(e.g., norms, manuals and terms of reference for urban development plans; regulations for
environmental protection and control), and promotional activities (e.g., preparation of specWalized
publications and documents, organization of conferences). The activities sponsored by the
proposed Project will be complementary to and coordinated with those of other technical
assistance programs sponsored by UNDP/HABITAT (e.g., cadaster) and the German
Government/GTZ (e.g., decentralization, fiscal reform, regional planning).
Municipal Strengthening Component
2.22        This component supports the implementation of specific progrms for improving
municipal accounting systems to the national standards defined in the SAFCO law, developing



- 21 -
municipal financial management and budgetary control systems, increasing local fiscal revenujes
from real estate taxes as well as business and vehicle licenses, improving municipal investment
planning, and developing local regulatory capabilities in connection with the privatization of
municipal services. This includes the implementation of training programs for municipal
executives, and administrative and technical personnel. Project funding wull be focused on the
pilot group of 26 municipalities which were covered by the project preparation studies (para
2.08). To be eligible for assistance, each municipality will have to formally commit itself to
mobilize the human and financial counterpart resources required to take advantage of the
assistance programs. This commitment will be discussed by the Municipal Council and agreed
to in an implementation agreement between FNDR ucting for MHD and the concerned
municipality, before the disbursement of any IDA TA funds for the respective municipality.
Annex II provides a detailed description of the programs to be financed by the Project.
2.23        As mentioned in the introduction, IDB is a major supporter of municipal
development in Bolivia. Under a first operation sponsored by this Institution (PRODURSA 1),
FNDR managed the implementation of free-of-charge municipal strengthening activities for a
limited set of large cities. Under a second operation being prepared (PRODURSA II), FNDR
will continue such activities with special focus on improving financial management, fiscal
resource mobilization, and project preparation/implementation capabilities. A special Committee
(para 2.31) will ensure that the activities sponsored by the Bank Group and IDB are
complementary and pursue consistent policies. IDB will also fund technical assistance progrmns
to strengthen the operational capacity of FNDR, the RDCs and their UCFs (para. 3.06).
2.24        The municipal strengthening component will include a separate pilot progam to
improve the environmental management capabilities of the municipality of La Paz. This
program will be specifically directed to the River Basins Department of the Municipality which
is in charge of controlling soil erosion, flooding and the quality of surface waters in the river
basins pertning to the metropolitan area. This program was appraised in the context of the
preparation of the Environmental Technical Assistance Project (Credit 2443-BO) and
subsequently attached to the preseri, operation in view of its focus on municipal development.
If successful, the program is expected to be repeated on other cities. ANNEX II (paa. 9)
provides a more detailed description of the background, objectives and content of this pardcular
component.
Investment ISnancing Component
2.25        This component supports the development of priority investment projects for the
rehabilitation, extension and development of urban infrastructure networks and public facilities.
It will also fund the preparation of pre-investment feasibility and engineering studies. In
accordance with the project objectives, the IDA credit will mainly support projects located in
small and intermediate cities. Projects located in large cities will primarily be financed from
other sources of financing, in particular IDB's PRODURSA I. To be eligible for financing,
investments projects will have to meet specific technical standards, cost recovery requirements,
and financial and economic viability criteria. Standards, requirements and criteria vary



- 22 -
according to the size and natue of the project (ANNEX M). They will be specified in an
Annex to the Credit Regulatons for the implementation of the Project (para. 2.33). IDA
financing for projects in the cities of La Paz, Cochabamba and Santa Cruz will be limited to
proects of social nature and thus eligible for matching gants (pam. 2.40); financing for power
generation and distribution projects will be limited to utilities which are committed to
privatization.
2.26        Municipalities, public utilities and service enterprises and cooperatives will be the
beneficiaries of the investment activities. FNDR will be responsible for their financing through
credit. To qualify for credit the beneficiary will have to meet specific institutional, opeational
and finacl eligibility criteria (ANNEX IV). Appropriate credit guarantees, provided by the
RDCs will protect FNDR from the risk of lending to financially weak borrowers (para 2.37).
Moreover, whenever a beneficiary cannot incur additional debt for a priority investment project
(i.e., water supply and sanitation, environmental protection), the RDC or the National Treasury
N)  will provide appropriate capital contnbutions (investment grants) for its implementation.
On demand, FNDR will lend to the RDCs the resources required to effect the above investment
grants, out of the IDA credit proceeds. The Treasury contributions will be always financed out
of these proceeds. Projects meeting specific health, environmental and social objectives will be
entitled to government matching grants (para. 2.40).
2.27        IDB, the Fondo Financiero pam  el Desarrollo de la Cuenca del Plata
(FONPI 4TA), the Corpoaci6n Andina de Fomento (CAF), and the Japanese Government will
also support FNDR's finanmcng activities. Consonant with its regional development and poverty
reduction objectives, the IDA credit will be earmarked for investment projects in intmediat
and small citiez and for projects with social content (i.e., water supply and sanitation in peri-
urban and low-income urban areas). FNDR can already count on a substantial pipeline of
investnent projects either ready for financing or at an advanced preparation stage (ANNEX V).
It is expected that the credit proceeds earmarked for the investment financing component would
be fuly committed within three years from credit effectiveness.
2.28        FNDR will carry out its financing activities with the municipalities, utilities and
service enterprises operating as a specialized financial institution in competition with the
commercia baning system. It is expected that, given the nature of their resources and their
specializion, commercial banks will focus on financing the opeating expenditures of these
entities, while FNDR will finance their medium- and long-term investment needs.
F. Project Implementation Arrangements
lIstitutional Development Component
2.29        MHD will be the central government agency responsible for the implementation
of this component. Concerning the Municipal Civil Service program, MHD will: (i) carry out
the activities related to the development of the proposed legislation, norms, incentives; (ii)
contract out to FNDR, dtough the signing of a management agreement, the responsibility of



-23 -
coordinating the implementation of improvement programs in the targeted municipalities, and
managing all the related procurement activities and expenditures, according to TOR agreed upon
with IDA; and (iii) disseminate to all municipalities the results of the program. The signing of
the management agreement for the implementation of the activities assigned to FNDR will be
a condition of credit effectiveness. To guide and monitor FNDR's activities, the Government
has also established a special Committee (Municipal Civil Service Coordinafting Committee)
comprising representatives of MHD, FNDR and MOF. The participation in the Committee of
a representative of MOF is essential to ensure coordination and consistency with the ongoing and
planned activities for the reform of the National Civil Service, which are implemented by this
Ministry.
2.30        Conceniing the Municipal Development Institute (MDI), MHD will sponsor, in
coordination with the Municipal Associations, the initial activities for its establishment. Upon
this event, MDI itself will administer, through its General Manager and Chief Accountant, the
credit proceeds related to its start-up and operating expenditures. The disbursement of these
proceeds will be contingent upon evidence, satisfactory to IDA, that MDI has been legally
established, that its key management (general director and directors of adinistration & finance,
research & analysis, and training & TA departments) has been appointed, and that financing
from its own resources has been secured. To develop operationally and become financially self-
supporting, MDI will need to develop a network of clients to assist in municipal development
related activities. Therefore, MHD, in coordination with FNDR, will transfer to it the
sponsibility for coordinating the implementation of the Civil Sernice Improvement Program.
This transfer will be contingent upon verification, satisfactory to MHD and IDA, that MDI is
appropriately managed, staffed and funded to assume the above responsibility and that an
inplementation agreement, satisfactory to IDA, is signed.
Municipal Strengthening Component
2.31        Similarly to what is described above, MHD will be the central government agency
responsible for the overall implementation of this component. It will also entrust FNDR with
the responsibility of organizing, carrying out its execution, and managing the related
procurement activities and expenditures. The signing of a management agreement between
MMD and FNDR for the implementation of this component will be a condition of credit
effectiveness. The approval by MHD of the guidelines for the implementation of the civil
service development and municipal strengthening components will be a condition for the
disbursement of the relevant credit proceeds. According to these guidelines, FNDR will help
the municipalities implement individualized packages of institutional, administrative and technical
strengthening activities, including training of management and staff, selected according to
preestablished cntera. Agreements between FNDR, acting for MM, and each municipality
will define the responsibilities of the pardes concerned and ensure municipal commitment to the
assistance received.  A  model agreement between FNDR/MHD  and the beneficiary
municipalities has been prepared to IDA satisfaction; its signing by the municipality concered
a condition of disbursement of the relevant credit proceeds. Strengthening activities related to
the enhancement of fiscal resources or addressed to revenue earning entities (i.e., public utilities
and service enterprises) will be financed by FNDR through loans (investment financing



-24 -
component below). The Govemment has established a Committee (Municipzl Strengthening
Coordinating Committee), comprising representatives of MHD, MOF and FNDR, to oversee. the
coordination between grant and loan financed programs as well as between programs sponsored
by different sources of financing (e.g., IDB, German Government). In accordance with the
arrangements defined in para 2.30 for the implementation of the Civil Service component,
FNDR will transfer the management of the municipal strengthening programs to MDI, under the
same conditions mentioned in that paragraph. It is expected that most of the consulting and
training services required by the municipalities and utilities benefitting from the programs be
provided by local consulting firms and specialized public and private agencies. Bolivia is indeed
endowed with a reasonable number of suppliers of such services (ANNEX VI). Once prompted
by appropriate demand, these can easily improve their operadonal capacity with limited external
assistance. The activities related to the strengthening of the River Basins Department of the
Municipality of La Paz will be managed by the latter, in cooperation with the Sanitary
Engineering Institute of the La Paz University. To this end the Municipality will sign an
implementation agreement with the Republic of Bolivia and the University of La Paz. The
signing of this agreement will be a disbursement condition of the credit proceeds for t}is
component.
Investment Fumaning Component
2.32        Resource Management. Investment financing will variably involve or combine:
(i) FNDR's loans, (ii) matching grants for eligible projects, (iii) investment grants for priority
projects by non-creditworthy beneficiaries, and (iv) equity financing by the municipality or
municipal utility. In addition, the RDCs will guarantee FNDR's loan to financially weak
borrowers. These financing arrangements are summarized in the table below and further
described in the paragraphs aheLd.

- 25 -
2.33        FNDR will be responsible for the on-lending activities. On-lending decisions will
be its exclusive responsibility and will be based on the economic, financial and technical
evaluation of the sub-projects presented to it by the final beneficiaries. The request of loan
guarantees for financially weak borrowers will be part of this evaluation.   FNDR will
adnister, on behalf of the State, the provision of matching and investment grants (para. 2.40).
The critena and procedures that will regulate FNDR on-lending opetions and the
administration of matching and investment grants are described in the Credit Regulations for the
implementation of the Project and are included in the subsidiary credit agreement between the
Republic of Bolivia and FNDR. The Credit Regulations have been approved by MOP, MHD
and FNDR's management; their approval by PNDR's Board of Directors is a condition of credit
effectiveness. The signing of the subsidiary credit agreement between the Republic and FNDR
will be also required by effectiveness.
2.34        Equity Financing. As a prerequisite to obtain financing, borrowers should be
able to provide equity financing for at least 20% of the total project cost, net of the grant
component but including taxes. The minimum equity requirement for the beneficiaries of
projects with RDCs' guarantees or with investment grants by either their RDC or the NT will
be limited to 5% of the project cost.
2.35        Sub-loan Administration. Given its streamlined organizational structure and
limited staff, FNDR will rely on the RDCs and their 'Unidades Crediticias y Financiers
(UCFs)' to inform municipalities and utilities about its financing activities, help them identify
and prepare eihgible projects, and administer the collection of debt repayments. To perform the
above functions, FNDR will compensate the RDCsIUCFs with a 1% spread on its loans. Past
experience has proved that the above arrangement is functional and operates satisfactorily.
2.36        In the event that the RDCs/UCFs were to disappear as a result of the ongoing
ecentralization process, it is envisaged that FNDR will carry out its promotional activities
through the establishment of regional offices and transfer to the commercial banldng system the
collton of debt repayments. This transfer is facilitated by the fact that commercial banls
handle the fiscal accounts of the municipalites and manage the liquidity of local public
enterprises.
2.37        Sub-loan Guarantees. As a general principle, PNDR will guarantee its loans by
requestng its borrowers to pledge selected fiscal resources or other income, including, in the
case of utities and service enterprises, revenues from the sale of services. For the latter
eies, the guarantees could include mortgages on real assets. As already mentioned, whenever
a public borrower is financially weak and its future ability to serve the debt depends on the
enhancement of its fiscal revenues and/or the successful implementation of a fiscal stabilization
progrm, FNDR will request its RDC to guarantee its loan. The Treasury will endorse this
guantee.
2.38        FNDR's On-lending Terms and Conditions. All FNDR's loans will carry the
same interest rate. This will be variable and adjusted every six months, on the first of January
and July, on the basis of the average rate of the 6 months dollar denominated CDs issued by



- 26 -
commercial banks, as published in the official bulletin of the Central Bank. The cost of loa
will also include a commitment fee of 1%.  They will be denominated in dollars and,
consequently, the dolar exchange risk will be transferred to the final borrower. The exchmnge
risk associated with the basket of currencies of the IDA credit will be assumed by the Treasury.
The maturities and grace periods of loans will vary according to the nature of the financed
dorks, goods and services, as specified in the table below.

2.39         The financing of pre-investment studies will be consolidated into the resulting
investment loans. However, were these studies to indicate that the envisaged investment project
is unjustified, their cost will be absorbed by the Treasury.
2.40         Matching Grants. The Government, through FNDR, will automatically provide
matching grants (pans 2.26, 2.32 and 2.33) to all investment projects benefitting low-income
population (at least 50% of households with income below the poverty line), related to sanitation
and environmental protection works, and aimed at developing cadaster systems (table 15). The
size of each individual matching grant will correspond to 20 % of the total investment cost of the
project. Sanitation and environmental projects in low-income neighborhoods will receive a
cumulative matching corresponding to 40% of their total investment cost.

2.41        Investment Gra.  These grants will support the development of prorty
investment projects by non-creditworthy muncipalities and utilities. In the Departments of IA
Paz, Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, Tarija and Chuqusac, they will be provided by the local RDCs
either out of their own resources or by borrowing from FNDR. The IDA credit could be used
for this latter purpose. In the remaining Departments, which have RDCs lacldng of substantial
financial esources, the investment grants will be provided by the NT. In many cases, it is
expected that the investnent grant be combined with a FNDR loan. The required size of the
investment grant will be assessed by FNDR, based on the debt service capacity of the borrower
and the revenue gener;ting potential of the project The provision of investment grants will be
monitored by the MOT and MHD. To this end, a representaive of each of these Minies wiR
participate to the meetiigs of FNDR's Project Committee, whenever this reviews an investment
project involving such grants.
2.42        Investment Ceilings.  To improve the regional distriLution of investment
financing and its allocation to small cities, no more than 25% of the amount of the investment
component, or approximately US$8 million, would be invested in any single region
(Department), and no more than 15%, or approximately US$5 million, in aay single
mumicipality. Moreover, no sub-loan would exceed the amount of US$ 4 million.
2.43        Sub-borrowers Eligbility Criteria. To qualify for direct lending from FNDR,
municipalities and their utilities should have a debt service ratio (current revenues minus current
expeditures/debt service including on proposed project) equal or greater than 1.4. Whenever
they have a ratio between 1.4 and 1.2, their RDC will have to guarantee their sub-loans. When
the ratio is below 1.2, their RDC or the Treasury will have to finance part or the toality of the
project investnent, with investment gants, according to need. Besides these conditions, to
qualify for a sub-loan as well as capital transfers, the municipality and the utilities concemed
will have to commit themselves to carry out specific institutional strengthening progams to
improve teir organization, operations and financial performance. This will include the
establishment of cross-conditionality between the provision of investment financing by FNDR
and the implementation of the TA and training activities contemplated under the municipal
strengthening component (paras. 2.22-2.24 and 2.31).
G. Project Costs and Tiancing
2.44        Costs. The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$58 million equivalent, of
which US$23.5 million (or 42%) correspond to direct and indirect foreign exchange
requrements (Table 15). Costs include provisions for taxes estimated at appomately US$8
million. Ihe investment financing component does not include allowances for inflation or
physical contingencies because of the nature of the proposed finan^ing mechanism (i.e., line of
credit).

2.46        Flow of Funds. The Republic of Bolivia will be the borrower of the proposed
credit of US$ 42 million equivalent. The funds for the institutional development and municipal
strengthening components will be made available to MHD, which will be responsible for their
administration either directly or through FNDR (paras 2.29 and 2.31)2. Concerning the
investment financing component, the funds related to credit activities will be on-lent by the
Republic of Bolivia to FNDR at the same terms and conditions as the IDA credit to the
Republic. Since the maturity of the IDA credit is much longer than the expected avenge
maturitv of the FNDR's loans, FNDR will recycle the r0!evant proceeds through subsequent
loans for the same purpose. Moreover, since the cost of the credit to FNDR is substantially
lower than the average cost of commercial financial resources, FNDR will employ the
differential for maintaining an adequate working capital and malkng additional'sub-loans. The
funds related to the government matching and investment grants will be managed by FNDR on
behalf of the Republic of Bolivia. FNDR wUll manage the matching grant resources free of
charge, since the relevant cost will be absorbed by its spread on the credit portion of the
financed investment. It will, however, charge the Treasury a flat fee up to 3% of the amount
for managing the resources used to finance projects by non-creditworthy beneficiaries.
H. Project Inplementation Monitoring,
Audits, Annual and Mid-Implementation Reviews, Supervision
2.47        Monitoring and Progress Reporting. Starting with the completion of the first
calendar year of project implementation, MHD/SUD, with the assistance of FNDR3, will
prepare annual progress rmports on the implementation (achievements, status, and possible issues
with remedial actions) of the institutional development and municipal strengthening components.
These reports will include an updated Plano Operativo Anual (POA) for the implementation of
the municipal strengthening program during the year. The POA for CY94 was submitted to
IDA, for review and comments, and found satisfactory. FNDR and the Municipality of La Paz
will prepare similar annual reports for the investment financing and the La Paz environmental
management components, respectively. MHD/SUD, FNDR and the La Paz Municipality will
submit their reports to IDA, for information and comments, no later than March 30.
2.48        Audits. MHD, FNDR, MDI and the La Paz Municipality will maintain separate
accounts for all the project expenditures involving the use of the IDA credit proceeds. These
accounts will be audited annually by independent external auditors acceptable to IDA. The
audits will include a review of the Special Account and SOEs of each entity. In addition,
FNDR and MDI will have their financial statements audited annually by an internationally
recognized firm. All audit reports will be submitted to IDA for review and comments no later
than June 30 of each year.
2. MDI will replace FNDR upon fulfillment of the specified requirements (pam 2.30).
3. MDI will replace FNDR upon fulfVIment of the specified requirements (para 2.30).



a 30 -
2.49        Annual and Mid-Tern Reviews. Based on the progress and audit reports
described above, YMISUD, FNDR, MDI and the La Paz Municipality will carry out with
IDA, each year by November 15, a formal joint review of project implementation. Specific
sessions of this review will include IIDB and other lenders or donors involved in municipal
development. The annual review after the completion of the second full year of project
implementation will be a mid-term review and will include a reassessment of the Project's
objectives, design and resource allocation. Agreements were reached that the Bonrower wil
take, or cause the project implementing agencies to take, adequate actions to complete project
implementation most effectively, according to the results of this review.
2.50        Supervsion. In view of its complexity and critical development objectives,
project supervision will be resource intensive and calls for over 80 staff-weeks dunng the six
years of project implementation. The basic staff required will include a municipal development
specialist, a finmcial analyst, and a project economist/engineer. Annex X provides the Key
inplfft    ad VClfaMce indicators which will be used to monitor project implementation
and FNDR financial performance.
L Procurement
2.51        The procurement activities for the implementation of the institutional development
and municipal strengthening components will mainly consist in the recruitment of national and
intenatonal experts and firms for the execution of studies, the provision of professional
services, and the execution of training programs. Those for the implementation of the
investment financing component will mainly consist in contracts for civil works and the
procurement of goods, equipment and professional services. In compliance with Bolivian law,
M'), FNDR, MDI and the La Paz Municipality will hire procurement agents tc manage the
bidding and awarding process of all contracts in excess of US$50,000. These agencies and their
procurment agents will resort to International Competitive Bidding (ICB) for civil works
contracts with an estimated value in excess of US$1.5 million, including taxes and contingencies,
and contracts for the procurement of goods and equipment contracts in excess of an estimated
value of US$150,000. The procurement of these contracts will be carried out according to the
relevant Bank Guidelines dated May 1992, and using the Bank's standard bidding documents.
2.52        Under ICB, domestic manufacturers will be granted a margin of preference of
15% or the amount of custom duties and import taxes, whichever is smaller. Local Competitive
Bidding (LCB) will be used to award all other contracts with the exception of contracts for civil
works below US$50,000 and contracts for the procurement of goods and equipment below
US$25,000, that could be awarded by shopping with at least three quotations. LCB for the
invesunent financing component will be used up to the following aggregate limits: US$ 22
million for civil works and US$ 4 million for goods and equipment. Shopping will be used up
to the following aggregate limits for each component of the Project:
- Investment Financing: US$ 3.3 million for civil works and US$ 1.7 million for goods
and equipment;
- Institutional Development: US$ 400,000 for goods and equipment;
- Municipal Strengthening: US$ 600,000 for goods and equipment;



- 31 -
Because of the nature of the Project fine of credit with many sub-projects) the limits will be
reiewed during mid-implementation review. Contracts for the use of consultants will be
awarded according to the August 1981 Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World
Bank Borrowers.
2.53          Under the IDB  financed PRODURSA  program  FNDR  has developed a
comprehensive system for the procurement of civil works, goods and professional serices.
Under this system, FNDR and ts procurement agents carry out all procurement activities on
behalf of the loan beneficiaries. This procwement process includes: (i) the establishment of
rosters of pre-qualified firms by type of works and services and by size of contracts, - firms
are pre-qualified annually through announcements in the local press. Foreign firm are allowed
to participate to qualification process, (ii) the use of standard bidding documents, -these
documents have been reviewed by the Bank found satisfactory; and (iii) the extension of
invitations to bid to the pre-qualified firms. Under the proposed IDA operation, FNDR will use
this process to award contracts falling under the local competitive bidding procedure.
2.54           All procurement activities will be carried oa in consultation with the final
beneficiaries (i.e., municipalities, public utilities and service enterprises, cooperatives).

J. Prior Bank Group Review and Approval
2.55        Sub-project Eligibility. IDA will carry out a prior review of the sub-projects
related to the construction of roads, water supply and sanitation facilities whose total cost
exceeds US$1.5 million, the sub-projects related to the construction of other facilities whose
costs exceeds US$1.0 million, and the cadastre sub-projects above US$150,000. In addition,
it will review the first two sub-projects below the above limits, that will be processed by FNDR
in the first year of project implementation. For all the free-limit sub-projects, FNDR will
maintain the relevant documentation to IDA's satisfaction at its headqwarters and make it
available to inspection by the IDA staff and external auditors.
2.56        Procurement Prior Review. IDA will review ex-ante procurement documents for
contracts in excess of US$1.5 million for civil works, US$150,000 for the procurement of goods
and equipment and the implementation of cadastre projects. However, all contrc between the
above mentioned limits and the Statement of Expenditures (SOE) limits (pam. 2.57), wil be
subject to an ex-post review of all supporting documentation before the relevant disbursement
application is submitted. In addition, IDA will exercise a prior review of the relevant steps for
the selection procedure of consulting firms for contracts exceeding US$50,000. It will also
review the first two contracts below these limits for each procurement group. For all othe
contracts, the agencies concerned will maintain the relevant procurement documents and records
to IDA's satisfaction at their headquarters and make them available to inspection by the IDA
staff and the auditors of their project accounts.
K. Disbursemrat
2.57        Disbursements of the IDA credit will be made according to the following
percentages against the following categories of expenditures:
(1) 100% of the amount of FNDR's sub-loans;
(2) 100% of the amount of the Treasury's matching and capital grants;
(3) 100% of the foreign expenditures for imported goods, and 100% of the ex-factory cost
or 70% of the expenditures in local currency for locally procured goods;
(4) 100% of the expenditures for consultant services, training activities and the operat,
costs of MDI and the Department of River Basin of the La Paz Municipality; and
(5) 100% of the refunding of the Project Preparation Facility Advance (US$1.5 million).
2.58        The disbursement schedule of the IDA credit (table 17) extends over a period of
six years after credit effectiveness, reflecting the time required to complete all pu
activities and disburse the credit proceeds, adjusted according to Bolivia standard disbursement
profiles. For FNDR, this implies that the IDA credit proceeds will be fully committed over a
perid of three years after credit effectiveness. Based on the assumption that the credit will



- 33 -
become effective in January 1994, the commitment deadline for the credit proceeds related to
FNDR's investment financing component will be December 31, 1996 and the credit closing date
December 31, 1999. Retroactive financing for an amount not exceeding SDR 2.68 million
(equivalent to US$4 million) will be authorized for expenditures incurred after May 30, 1993.

L. Special Account and Statements of Expenditures
2.59        For the purpose of facilitating the use of the credit proceeds, the Borrower will
open a Special Account in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA, under terms and conditions
acceptable to IDA, and to be managed according to standard IDA procedures. IDA will deposit
an aggregate amount equivalent to US$2 million from the credit into the Special Account.
Records of the Special Accounts proceeds and outlays will be available for review by IDA
suprvision missions aand subject to annual audit. Disbursements will be made on the basis of
cfied Statements of Expenditures for civil works whose contractual value is less than the

IIL FNDR - THE INVESTMENT FINANCE AGENCY
3.01        The "Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Regional (FNDR)" was created on March
1987 by the Law 926. The subsequent Supreme Decree 21964 of July 1988 governs its
activities. FNDR operates under the control of the Ministry of Human Development as an
adminisuravely, financially and technically independent public agency. Its main objective is to
promote balanced regional development by financing urban and regional investment projects
according to national strategies. In addition to the RDCs, the municipalities, public and private
local utilities and service enterprises, FNDR could also finance prefectures and universities.
3.02        FNDR's Board of Directors includes the Minister of Human Development, who
acts as chairman, FNDR's CEO and a representative of the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Development. The Board determines FNDR's long term strategies, operational poLicies and



- 34 -
priorities, and evaluates its performance. FNDR's CEO is appointed on recommendation of the
Minister of Human Development. He bears the responsibility of implementing the directves of
the Board of Directors and managing a staff of 41 employees and 44 consultants. This staff is
organized in four Divisions: Planning and Evaluation, Project Implementation, Finance, and
Administration.

3.03        Financially, FNDR operates as a public revolving fund totally dependant on
Government for the mobilization of its resources. Some of these resources are given to FNDR
in the form of loans for which it assumes full credit risk and debt repayment obligations. Others
correspond to government ransfers for which it acts as fiduciary manager. To carry out its
activities, the Government has agreed to endow FNDR with an initial capital of Bls.30 million
of which the Fund has received Bls. 17.2 million as of December 1992.
3.04        To date, FNDR's major operations include the implementation of the Global
National Program of Regional Development and Sanitation (PRODURSA I) financed by IDB,
the management of the financial transfers for the implementation of the Three Cities Water
Supply Project financed by IDA, and the implementation of a solid waste management program
financed by the Japanese Government. Given its short existence, FNDR has been unable to fully
cover its operating costs with the revenues of its lending activities. The National Treasury has
provided funds from various sources, including US-AID, to meet these costs. From 1993,
FNDR is expected to fully finance its operating costs with revenues from its lending operations.

3.05         Since 1992 FNDR is subject to the scrutiny of the -Superintendencia de Bancos",
an agency that undertakes a strict control of all credit institutions on the base of a number of
financial indicators. According to the ratio between capital and debt, at the end of 1992,
FNDR's estimated borrowing capacity from direct or reroceded government loans was of
US$150 and 50 million in long and short-term resources, respectively.
3.06         Through the provision of technical assistance funds, IDB has contributed to
develop FNDR's present organizational structure, strengthen its opational procedures, improve
its project appraisal capabilities, and train its adminisve and technical staff. A recent
asesment (1992) of FNDR's organization and operations by a specialized consulting firm gives
the Institution a certificate of good health while underlining that it is very young and fast-
growing and consequently needing attentive management dunng the next few years. With IDB
financing, FNDR has commissioned a team of prominent Bolivian experts to study its future role
as well as organizational, financial and opertional needs. Under its PRODURSA II operation,
IDB will provide FNDR with technical assistance to improve its organization and fiurher
strengthen its financial management and operational capabilities. IDB's technical assistance will
also include programs to improve the operational capacity of the RDCs and their UCFs. These
assistance programs have been discussed and agreed upon with MDA. ANNEX VII provides a
detailed description of FNDR's organzation, operations, and financial performance.

TV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
Benefits
4.01        General. The Project will improve municipal management and the availability of
essential urban seravices in numerous cities and towns with an aggregate population of at least
2 million or over 60% of Bolivia's urban population. Towns will include small centers that,
because of their size or location, have been only marginally touched by previous municipal and
urban development programs. Direct economic benefits will mainly materialize in the forn of
increased real estate values resulting from improvements in the urban environment (i.e., street
paving, drainage facilities, water and sewerage connections, and solid waste collection services).
The enhancement of real estate values will improve the local govemments' ability to mobilize
fiscal revenues.  The improvement/development of sanitation facilities and services,
marketplaces, and slaughterhouses will help reduce the negative impact on health conditions
resulting from the unsatisfactory waste management and food processing arrangements now
prevailing in most large and small communities. Street construction and maintenance and taffic
management activities will yield savings in vehicle operating costs.
4.02       Poverty Reduction. The Project will benefit the poor by extending municipal
strengthening activities to small urban centers in disadvantaged regions and by promoting,
through the matching grant system (para 2.40 and 2.41), the development of water supply and
sanitation facilities in unauthorized peri-urban neighborhoods inhabited by low-income population
(> 50% below poverty line).
4.03       EnvironmenW  Management. The Municipal Strengthening Component will
support the improvement/development of regulatory and environmental management capabilities
in large and medium urban centers; the Investment Financing Component the development of
projects aimed at protecting urban areas from flooding, landslides and other environmental
hazards. The matching grant system will again contribute to the achievement of this objective.
4.04        Women in Development. FNDR is carrying out, with JDB financing, a study on
the policies and actions that could foster the impact of municipal and turan development projects
on the improvement of women conditions and on their participation in the social and economic
life of local communities. The proposed Project will support the implementation of these
policies and actions through its civil service and municipal strengthening components.
4.05       Economic Rate of Return. The eligibility criteria for investment projects costing
more than US$1 million will require that these present a minimal ERR of 12%. Income
generating projects, such as water supply works, slaughterhouses, markets, bus tenninals and
parking facilities, will also require an equal ERR.
Risks and Safeguards
4.06       Improving municipal management and local services is a complex undertaking and
requires a sustained and determined effort over a long period of time. Project implementation
calls for the involvement and support of numerous central and local government agencies, most



-37-
of which are institutionally, organtionally and operationally weal. Risks include the
possibility of:
(i)    insufficient project preparation and implementation capacity at local level resulting
in the slow commitment and disbursements of the credit proceeds as well as in
low quality output;
(ii)    politcal pressures underminung the institution building, technical, financial and
economic conditionality of FNDR's lending for investment projects; and
(Lii)   turnover of central and local government officials resultng in a diminished
commitment to the Project's objectives and in the possible loss of institutional
memory and resource continuity for effective project implementation.
4.07        The Project confronts the above risks by:
Ci)    a) assigning to a strengthened FNDR the responsibility for managing most of the
project implementation activities and administering the related expenditures,
b) simultaneously, the Project helps municipalities improve their management
capabilities;
(i)     defining in a simple, transparent and unequivocal fashio the eligibility criteria
for the municipal strengthening and investment financing activities; and
(iii)    extending the scope of present Bank assistance for the reform of the Bolivian civil
service from central to local government level.
4.08        The activities that present greater implementation difficulties and risk of failure
are those related to the improvement of the municipal civil service and the establishment of the
Municipal Development Institute. Improving the municipal civil service would require
behavioral changes by both elected officials and municipal staff which are lengthy to achieve and
generally depend on the country's overall socio-economic evolution. Moreover, in large
municipalities it would require overcoming the political and cost constrmnts needed to dismiss
redundant personnel, in small municipalities the lack of financial resources to meet the payroll
of a minimum and appropriately qualified civil service. This calls for a gradual approach,
diffrentiated by city. Moreover, it calls for the establishment of a self-supporting system of
promotion and follow-up of the reform program, through the involvement of a reformed
Association of Municipalites. In spite of the strong declared interest of all the parties
concerned, the creation of MDI is constrained by the divisiveness of municipal politics in the
Country and the weakness of the existing two municipal associations. This calls for an active
Central Government support to the creation o; the Institute. Such support should be mainly
financial to bear part of the expenditures for its establishment and early opations. It should
be provided unconditionally to avoid the municipalities perceiving it as a disguised infringement
on their institutional autonomy.

V. AGREEM  AND RECOiDMMEATIONS
5.01    During negotiations, it was agreed that the further processing of the proposed IMA
credit requires the following steps:
By Credit Effectiveness
- FNDR's Board of Directors will enact the Credit Regulations for the implementation of the
proposed Project, already approved by its management, MOF and MHD (para. 2.33); and
-  MH  and FNDR wiu sign: (i) the subsidiary loan agreement for the implementation of the
investment financing component (para. 2.33), and (ii) the management agreement for the
implementation of the Civil Service Development and the Municipal Strengthening
components (paras. 2.29 and 2.31).
As a Condition of Disbuent
- of any expenditure related to the civil service and municipal strengthening components,
MMD wil approve FNDR's guidelines for the implementation of these components
(para. 2.31);
- of the expenditures related to the civil service and municipal strengthening activities for a
specific municipality, MHD/FNDR will sign a contract wnth this municipality, defining its
respoibilies and obligations for the carrying out and follow-up of these acivities
(para. 2.31);
-  of the expenditures related to the operations of MDI, this will provide evidence that it has
been legally established, that its key management and staff have been appointed, and that
financing from its own resources is secured (para. 2.30); and
- of the expenditures related to the strengthening of the environmental management
capabilities of the La Paz Municipality, the Borrower, the Municipality, and the University
of La Paz will have signed an approprite implementation agreement (pam. 2.31).
5.02    Moreover, the Government authorities concerned agreed that, to foster effecdve
decentralization and municipal development, they will submit to IDA, for review and comments,
no later than March 31, 1995, an action plan for revising the Organic Law of Municipalities,
redefining the present inter-governmental fiscal relations, and extending the electoral mandate
of mayors and muiicipal administrations, and they will carry out such a plan thereafter.
5.03        Subject to the above agreements, the Project is suitable for an IDA credit of SDR
30.1 million (US$ 42 million) at standard IDA tenns.



-39-                      ANNEX I
BOLiVIA - MUNICIPAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
THE MUNICIPAL DEVELOPNMENT INSTrrUTE
Rationale
1. Bolivia lacks a well coordinated municipal development assistance program.
Central Govemment, the RDCs, FNDR as well as vanous NMOs and
nternational donors assist the municipalities and utilities with the provision of
TA  and staff training services.  Their activities, however, are often
chancterized by inter-agency conflicts, overlapping responsibilities and
duplication of efforts. A recent feasibility study, completed by UNDP/Habitat
and financed by the former Ministry of Urban Affairs with the PPF Advance,
confirms that the creation of a Municipal Development Institute (MDI) could
greatly contribute to improving the delivery system of technical assistance and
personnel training to the municipalities. Such an Institute would have a positive
impact on Bolhvia's growth by enhancing the technical and administrative
cacity of local governments as well as sensitizing central government
authorities, the academic community and the private sector to the issues of
municipal development and creating a forum for their discussion. Similar
institutions have already been established with positive results in a number of
Latin American countries such as Costa Rica (Instituto de Fomento y Asesorla
Municipal), Ecuador (Asociaci6n de Municipalidades Ecuatorianas), Pend
(Instituto de Fomento Municipal) and Brazil (Instituto Brasilero de
Administraci6n Municipal).
Activity
2.  MDI's main fimction wiR be to help the municipalities identify their
development needs and address them with appropriate technical assistance and
staff training services provided by public, prvate and non-governmental
suppliers operating in these areas. Moreover, the Institute will operate as a
center of study, analysis and information about issues of municipal development,
promoting and coordinating the flow of information between the municipalities.
Finally, the Institute will help central government agencies define municipal and
urban development poLicies and coordinate international agencies, donors and
NOOs active in this area. To be effective and long lasdng the Institute should
gain the full support of the municipalities which should be its primary associate
members.

3. In May 1993 the fonner Ministry of Urban Affairs (MAU) held a one day
seminar to descrbe the objectives and content of the proposed Municipal
Development Project to representatives of nine provincial capitals and a few
other minor municipalities. The meeting confirmed the unconditional support
and commitment of the majority of these municipalities to creating a Municipal
Development Institute. Subsequently, another conference, organized by the
Association of fte Municipalities (Asociaci6n de Gobiernos Municipales
Aut6nomos de Bolivia - AGMAB), took place in June 1993 in Sucre to
formalize the creation of the Institute. The partipating municipalities legally
established the Institute as a non-profit, self-goveniing , and financially
autonomous entity subject to private law. Its associates, when the MDI is fuly
established, will include the members of the AGMAB and all other
municipalities and entities involved in municipal affairs willing to participate.
The latter include selected minista  departments and FNDR. A National
Council, meeting every two years, will determine MDI's long term strategies,
operational policies and priorities. It w iI include the mayors, the presidents
and three members of each municipal )uncil of the associated municipalities,
five representatives of the central government, and five of the FNDR. A Board
of Directors , that will include the President of the AGMAB, one delegate for
each departnental capital and El Alto, three delegates drawn from the provincial
capitals, one representative of the cental government and one of FNDR, will
oversee the implementation of the Council's directives during the two years
between two successive meetings of the Council. The Board of Directon will
nominate a General Manager, selected through public competition, to administer
the activities of the MDI for four years.

4.  To be effective, the Institute should be a lean institution. According to the
UNDP/Habitat study a staff of 14 people should enable the Institute to operate
efficiently through an initial centrAl unit. In a second phase, upon MDI's filler
establishment and the demonstration of its operational and financial capabilities,
it is expected that regional branches will be created in selected departmental
capitals to carry out specalized tasks and regional opertions.

5. The following table shows the operating budget for the first three years of
activity of the Institute:

6. The sJaries and benefits of the 14 permanent employees will amount to
US$ 250,000 annually while about US$350,000 annually will be used to fund
the various external consultants who will ultimately manage the delivery of the
TA and training programs identified by the Institute under the request of the
beneficiary muicipalities. The total outlay for the first three years of activity
will amount to US$ 2.5 million. IDA will provide financing for US$1.4 million
while the rest is expeed to come from the associate municipalities, central
government, international donors, and MDI's operations. The revenues that
MDI will generate through the sale of its services will be entirely used to cover
its operating costs and develop its activities; no profit will be retained.
Following the first 3 years of activity, MDI is expected to become financially
autonomous but for an annual contribution from its associates. According to the
UNDP/Habitat report, during this period the istitte will be able to help the
municipalities increase their revenues to the point where the majority of them
will be able to fully pWy for the services provided by the MDI.

BOLIVIA - MUNICIPAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
MUNICIPAL STRENGTHENING PROGRAM
Objectives
1. In accordance with government policies and acknowledged local needs, the
proposed Municipal Strengthening Development Program is designed to achieve
the following primary objectives:
(i)   improve fiscal accountability and resource mobilization at local
government level;
(ii)   enhance the managerial and technical capabilities of municipalities and
their public utilities and service enterprises to improve the supply of
primary public services in urban areas;
(iii)  provide the municipalities and their utilities with a system  of
procedures and methodologies that guarantee the efficient operation and
mnaintenance of the infrastructure and service facilities;
(iv)   enhance the impact of municipal development activities undertaken at
national level, by improving the coordination, planning and evaluation
of the delivery of TA and training activities.
Beneficiaries
2. The program was prepared on the basis of a general assessment of
municial strengthening needs carried out through the PPF project preparation
suxdies. These studies focused on 26 cities, including the nine departmental
capitals and other selected centers representing different regional circumstances,
local economic situations, and urban sizes. Moreover, to avoid conflict and
overlapping, the program was prepared as a part of a more comprehensive
municipal strengthening plan, including the activities financed by IDB through
its Second Program for Urban Development and Sanitation (PRODURSA II).
3. The manicipal strengthening plan will include: (i) individualized technical
assistance and related taining activities; and (ii) general training activities. The
first set of activities will Le focused exclusively on the 26 cities surveyed by the
PPF project preparation studies. The general training activities will be offered
to any interested municipality. The individualized TA and training activities
will be custom tailored to the needs of each beneficiary entity (municipalities
and their utilities), according to its specific managerial, administrative and
economic situation, urban development problems, and expected investment
programs. The beneficiaries of training activities will be selected among the
staff of these entities, on the basis of their learning potential and job



- 43 -                    ANNE  II
requirements, within designated functions and responsibility levels. The general
training progmms will be based on sectoral priorities detemined by the
Ministies of Human Development (MHD) as well as by FNDR and PIS. To
qualify for the program, the mcipalities and their utilities and service
enterprises will have to provide evidence to MlD/FNDR that they can mobilize
the counterpart human and financial resources required to take ful advantage of
the asstance received and to exploit its benefits in both the short and medium
term.
Descripon
-   Indvdualied Technical Assistance and Related Taiing
4.  The implementation of this program calls for the provision of:
(i) consulting services by specalized firms and individuals to assist
muicipalities and their utilities in definiing and implementing specific
insitutional stengthening actions, and (ii) taining servces to improve the
professional skills of the personnel of the beneficiaries of these actions. The
progm will cover the following areas:
A. Fhuancal Sen       ing
- Taxation: to expand municipal fiscal resources;
 Financial Adminisation: to develop municipal financial management and
budgetary control systems;
* Tax Collection: to implement and develop computeized systems of fiscal
assessment and recovery;
Management of Procurement Activities: to achieve efficient management
Of contract awarding for civil works and the purchases of equipment and
supplies;
* Office Technology: to implement computerized administradve systems.
B.  Admi tive Strengthening
* Public Services Management to develop and implement efficient
procedures for the delivery of municipal public services;
* Institutional Organization: to enhance administtive efficiency through
improved organizational structures and systems;
* Administative Procedures: to foster accountability and effectiveness,
including through the introduction of enhanced opemtional pracdies,
control systems, and auditing;
C. Human Resources Management (Civil Service). This program will be
combined with a general reform of the municipal civil service. It will help
10 selected municipalities to implement modern organizational strucures,
reiew the size of their staff, establish effective personnel management
systems, and update salary scales.



- 44-                                  ANNEX U
D. Development of Systems and Technologies.  This program will be
complementary to those addressing the topic of financial and administrative
strengthening and help the beneficiaries take advantage of the information
systems and technologies most appropriate to their specific situation (i.e.,
regional context, development stage, and resource availability).
5.   To reach them  more efficiently, the municipalities benefitting from  the TA
and training activities are grouped in three separate categories as shown in

- General Training Activities
7. This prcgram will be aimed at spreading the general principles of sound
municipal administration to the largest possible number of municipalities and
their utilities, notwithstanding possible differences in their organization and
development levels. Contary to the previous program, the beneficiaries of
these training activities will not be limited to elected municipal official and
public employees but also include community leaders, representatives of civic,
political and business associations, and personnel involved in municipal
development activities at large. These activities will be organized on a regional
basis and are expected to benefit about 83 municipalities. They wil be
consistent with and instrumental to the implementation of the decentralintion
process, undertaken by the National Government and supported by the two
existing municipal associations. They will include the execution of seminars and
courses focused on four priority areas: principles of urban management,
municipal legal framework, administration  of public services, and  urban
planning. This list will be possibly widened to other topics according to need.
8.    Tables 4 proides a preliminary cost estimate of the entire program  of
general training activities to be implemented with IDA financing; table 5 the
pmgm's financing plan.

-    EmE ironmental Management for La Paz Municipality
9. Erosion, sedimentation and flooding are characteristic problems of Bolivia's
highlands, impairing life and property in La Paz and its sunroundings. With
German assistance, the Municipality of La Paz has set up a special Department
(Direcci6n para el Manejo y Control de Cuencas - DMCC) in charge of
controlling soil erosion, flooding and the quality of surface water in the city's
river basins. This Department is well staffed and managed. It has been active
in developing a thorough knowledge of the hydro-geological situation of the La
Paz region and preparing feasibility and pre-engineering stdies for critical
environmental protection projects. To continue its operations effectively, this
department needs further intemational financial and technical support. During



- 47-                       ANNEX II
preparation/appraisal of the Environmental Technical Assistance Project (Credit
2443-BO), the IDA team discussed with the La Paz Municipality an assistance
progam to cope with the above need. Given the nature of its beneficiary (local
government), this program is being included in the institutional strengthening
component of the proposed Municipal Sector Development Project. It includes
components aimed at strengthening DMCC and the Sanitary Engineering
Insttute of the IA Paz University. This Institute will help the Municipality as
well as other interested entities carry out bio-chemical analyses of water quality
in the La Paz river basins.

Implementation
10. The Ministry of Human Development will be responsible for overseeing
the implementation of the municipal strengthening program. However, MH
will delegate the execution of the related activities and the administration of the
related expenditures to FNDR, which is also responsible for the implementation
of the TA and training program funded by IDB. An appropriate contractual
docum!nt will define FNDR's duties and its relations with MHD.
11. FNDR, in consultation with MHD, will prepare a general plan for the
implementation of the entire program (IDA/IDB) over a period of approximately
three years, and then specify this plan in annual operational plans (Planos
Operativos Anuales - POAs). POAs will be prepared and submitted to the IDA



-48-                     ANNEX I
for review and comments one month before the end of the year preceding their
Implementation. They will be agreed with the municipalides and the utilities
concerned. To ensure its most effective implementadon, MHD/FNDR will also
orgnize a monitoring and evaluation system of the program, based on selected
performance indicators.   Moreover, a tripartite committee (Municipal
Strengthening Program Coordinating Committee), comprising reentatives of
MSlD, FNDR and the municipalities will coordinate the implementation of the
program with the activities carried out in the sector by other government
agencies as well as multilater  and bilateral institutions (e.g., UNDP,
HABITAT, German Government-GTZ).
12. FNDR will carry out the implementation of the individualized TA and
taining activities by contracting out their execution to individual consultants,
consultancy firms, and NGOs. The general training activities will be conted
out in packages to speialized organizations. It is expected that the "Instituto
de Investigai6n y Desarrollo Municipal" (INIDEM) will play a major role in
the execution of these packages, given its considerable experience in the sector
and its good organizational capabilities. While FNDR and its procurement
gents will have the final responsibility for awarding all TA, training and
procurement contracts, they will carry out this activity in close consultation with
the beneficiaries of the program. Prior to the implementation of the program,
FNDR will assess the viability and quality of the potential providers of TA and
municipal training services.
13. The Association of Autonomous Municipal Governments of Bolivia
(AGMAB) is sponsoring, with the assistance of the Central Government, the full
establishment of a Municipal Development Institute to assist municipalities in
thir institutional strengtning endeavors. Upon the establishment of this
Itdtute, the Government will transfer to it, from FNDR, the mnagement of
the municipal strengthening program. This decision will be subject to IDA's
confirmation that the Institute has the capability of carrying out the above
function effectively.

The requesting beneficiary intuon must indicate to FNDR (or FNDR will directly assess) the degree of
compliance with the minimum program indicators before applying for financing. In the case of autonomous service
providers that generate their own income the analysis will refer to that enterprise. If the beneficiary institution is a
municipal agency the analysis will refer to the respective municipal admiistration as a whole.
In order to be eligible, the borrower must meet the requirements and exceed the indicators given above. If an
entity falls below the threshold of one or more indicators, it must formulate an action program satisfactory to FNDR that
includes measures and actions for achieving the necessaty indicator levels within a period of less than two years. The
first disburwsement of the loan will be contingent on the implementation of weU identified initial steps of the agreed upon
action program. Futre FNDR credits will be subject to the beneficialy having complied with the lending conditions of
previous FNDR loans.

BOLIVIA - MUNICIPAL SECTOR DEVEOPMENT PROJECT
SUPPLY OF TRAINNG SERVICES FOR MUNICIPAL PERSONNEL
1. Given its relatively small population, Bolivia is endowed with a reasonable
number of public, private, NGO and bilateral institutions providing taining for
civil servants and public utilities staff. Their activities include the organization
and delivery of courses, semins, and TA. Among these institutions only a few
are specialized in the delivery of these sevices at local level. However, they
seem to have considerable potential to expand in ffis direction. The main issue
hampering such development is the lack of a steady demand for their services
and the scope of their geographic reach is often limited by institutional as well
as logistical constraints.
* PUBLIC SECTOR INSTITUTIONS
2. The public institutions providing municipal TA and training services
include the Ministry of Human Development, the Ministry of Finance and
Economic Development, and the TFondo Nacional de Desarrollo Regionalu
(FNDR). At the decentrlized level, the municipality of La Paz is the only one
to have organized a center for the training of municipal employees (Instituto de
Capacitaci6n Municipal - ICAM)
Abe Ministry of Human Development (MH)
3.  The ')ireccidn de Agua y Saneamiento Basico - DINASBA  and the
*Direcci6n de Medio Ambiente - DINAMA* of MHD are currently involved in
the promotion of training programs for municipal and public utilities staff.
Although limited by staffing and financial problems, the implementation of their
acdvities seems to have had positive results. DINASBA has set in motion a
national taining program in water and basic sanitation. The training at
mliicipal level has been delegated to the "Asociaci6n Nacional de Empresas e
Instituciones de Servicio de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado - ANESAPA' (see
para. 10 of this Annex). DINASBA has also hired a sociologist to coordinate
the training and information activity of the Basic Sanitation Units introduced in
each Regional Development Corporation (RDC) during the reorganization of the
Basic Sanitation sector of 1992. DINAMA has organized an inter-institutional
seminar in May 1993 on how to promote better coordination and improve
existing legislaton in the area of urban environment. This department operates
in close contact with the Secrara General del Medio Ambiente - SEGMA",
the "Pondo Nacional del Medio Ambiente - FONAMA" and with the "Liga de
Defensa del Medio Ambiente - LIDEMA", with which it is plans to cooperat
for the organzation of traiming courses on urban environmental management.
Finally, since March 1993, the "Direccidn de Cadastro", in cooperation with
UNDP, has begun taining courses for municipal staff on land registration and
taxation issues .

MhnIsr of Flnance and Economic Development (MOF)
4. The 'Centro de Capacitaci6n - CENChP of MOP's Contralorha General
is entrusted with the responsibility of trining civil servants at all levels on the
Sistema Integrado de Adnministracidn Financiera y Control Gubemamental'
regulated by the SAFCO Law (1178190). CENCAP has been in activity since
1989. It trained 1331 civil servmts in 1991 and approximately 3000 during
1992. CENCAP offers a 33 weeks training cycle of eight independent courses.
The first course is an introduction to the SAFCO Law and it is held in eight
departmtal capitals. The subsequent, more advanced courses are offered in
La Paz. CENCAP is funded by the Ministry of Finances, to which it reports,
with IDA assistance.   It covers all the expenses of the participants to its
courses, with the exception of travel and lodging. To date, the large majority
of the personnel trained by CENCAP belongs to the central administration in La
Paz. Its management is supporting the idea of expanding its activities to train
a larger number of municipal civil servants.
Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Regional (FNDR)
'. FNDR (see also ANNEX VII) embarked on taining activities in 1992, in
connectton with the implementation of IDB's First Program for Urban
Development and Sanitation (PRODURSA I). The main objective of its courses
and seminars is to improve the knowledge of the adminstrative and technical
staff of the ministeial departments (n particular of the former Ministry of
Urban Affairs), the RDCs, the municipalities and their utilities on the subjects
of investment planning, implementation and evaluation. A special operational
unit ("Fralecimiento Institutional") manages the organization of the above
activities, with the support of external consultants whenever needed. FNDR
finances all the administrative costs of the events and pardally contnbutes to the
travel and lodging expenses of the participants.

The Munidpality of la Paz
6.  The "Instituto de Capacitaci6n Municipal - ICAM" was created in 1987 as
an outcome of the La Paz Municipal Development Project (MDP) of the World
Bank and the French program of bilateral cooperation. ICAM organizes, in
cooperation with the La Paz municipality, trmang courses, seminars and
conferences for municipal staff at all levels. It operates with a permanent staff
of 12. Teachers are hired on a temporary basis a- cording to need. During the
last four years, ICAM has trained about 1000 nr 'icipal employees annually.
The large majority came from La Paz where ICAM is located, although in
theory it could serve other municipalities.   Until 1990 ICAM was mainly
financed by the MDP. At present, its resources come entirely from the
municipality of La Paz and from its fees. The close political and financial
dependence on the Alcaldfa of La Paz negatively impacts on ICAM 's capacity
of autonomously determining a policy for its activities. ICAM limits its activity
to the training of municipal staff without having a global strategy inclusive of
the identification of real municipal needs and priorities and the evaluation of
utained personnel.   However, in spite of these problems it has gained
considerable experience in municipal training and has good facilities in La Paz.

7. ANESAPA is the association of the enterprises which provide water and
sewerage services in Bolivia. One of its main objectives is the strengtheiing of

in its organition a technical committee for the development of human
resources and created a specia division to coordinate the promotion of training
activities. This division has already implemented several technical training
programs and is planning to expand its activities to the area of sanitary
education. In January 1993 a seminar organized by DINASBA with the
participation of representatives from the RDCs, universities, and private and
public utilities delegated to ANESAPA the management of a national program
of training in basic sanitation. The program is expected to commence in the last
quarter of 1993.

BOLIVIA - MUNICEPAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
NATIONAL FUND FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT
A. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
1.  The National Fund for Regional Development (Fondo Nacional de
DesaUo Regional-FNDR) was created by the Law 926 of March 25, 1987 and
established according to its implementation decree D.S. 21964 of July 1, 1988.
FNDR operates under the control of the Ministy of Human Development, as
a legally, fiunncially and technically independent agency subject to public law.
Its main objective is to promote balanced regional development by financing
investnent projects and providing technical assistance to local governments and
their agencies. In addition to the Regional Development Coporations (RDCs),
the municipities, local utlities and local service enterpises, FNDR could also
finance prefectures and universities. Its main sources of revenue include loans
and transfers from the Central Government and capital from its operations. The
government agreed to endow FNDR with an initial capital of Bs. Z') million of
which the Fund had received Bs. 17.2 million as of December 1992.
Governing Bodies
2. The Board of Directors and its Executive Management (General Manager
and Deputy Manager) are FNDR's two governing entities. The Board
Jetmmines FNDR's long term strategies, operational policies and priorities, and
evaluates its perfonnance. It includes the President of the Republic, who acts
as Chainnan, the Ministers of Planning and Coordination, Finance, the
Presidential Secretary, FNDR's General Manager or their alterates. The
General Manager and the Deputy Manager are appointed by the President of the
Republic and bear the responsibility of implementing the directives of the Board
and managing FNDR's operations.
Orgation
3. FNDR is a lean institution with 41 permanent employees on pay-roll and
44 consultants. FNDR is organized in 4 operational divisions. The Planning
and Evaluation Division is in charge of the identification and appraisal of
eligible investment projects. The Project Implementation Division supervises
the implementation of the projects and the perfonnance of the beneficiaries.
The Administive Division, manages the financial resources, from the
Treasury and the Direcci6n de Financiamento Externo y Monetisacidn
(DEPM, dedicated to current expenditures. Finally, the Flnance Division
handles the resources used for investment activities.  A  special unit,



.73-                    ANNEX VU
"Fortalecimiento Institucional, is in charge of managing the delivery of
technical assistance to the municipalities and their udlities. The Iternal Audit
and Legal Services Offices assist FNDR's General Manager to carry out his
manlagement responsibilities.

4. With IDB assistance (Program for Urban Development and Sanitation -
Prodursa), FNDR has developed efficient project evaluation and investment
monitoring procedures. Potential beneficiaries requesting funds from FNDR
submit proposals detailing the technical, legal, financial and commercial aspects
of their planned projects. The Planning and Evaluation Division verifies the
eligibility of bofrowers and projects. To be accepted, project proposals should
be developed according to the technical, financial and economic standards set
in FNDR's "Gufas de presentaci6n de proyectos". When these star <"xds are not
met, FNDR helps the beneficiary prepare a proper project proposal. This



-74-                    ANNEX V'
include a comprehensive analysis of the project's socio-economic, technical,
insdtutional, financial and environmental aspects. Finally, the appraised project
is presented to the Board of Directors for approval. FNDR is currently
considering the creation of a Project Committee in charge of reviewing loan
proposals by the Planning and Evaluation Division prior to their submission to
the Board, and a Loan Committee authofized to approve, on behalf of the
Board, infrasucture loans not exceeding the amount of US$2 million and loans
for consulting services not exceeding US$300.000.

5. The investment monitoring activity takes place in three phases. Firstly, FNDR helps the
beneficiary ensure the fulfillment of all the legal, financial and technical actions that are required
before project implementation. Then, it supervises project implementation with consultants
financed by the borrower. This includes the preparation of project audits. Finally, a year after
project completion, it carries out an ex-post evaluation to assess the quality of the investment
and its impact on the economy.
6. To limit the size of its permanent staff and to operate closer to the beneficiaries of its
financing activities, FNDR recurs to the assistance of the Credit and Financial Units (UCFs) of



-75 -                    ANNEX VII
the RDCs (see Annex VM). These are responsible for inforning the municipalities and their
udlities about FNDr,'s financing activities, helping them prepare investment projects and loan
applications according to PNDR's requirements, supervising project implementadon, and
collecting loan repayments. To carry out these functions, the UCFs receive a fee of one percent
of the outstanding balance of FNDR's loans.

7.  FNDR's insditonal development has been characterized by two phases. The year 1991



- 76 -                   ANNEX VII
marks the end of the first phase. Until this date, the Fund managed the implementation of
investment programs entirely funded with grants from the NT and USAID. For the NT, it
administered the financing of 70 regional or municipal development projects, for a total
investment of Bs. 25.8 million. For USAID, it followed the implementation of 12 projects for
a total investment of US$4 million, and a solid waste program and a study on garbage collection
in seven cities for a total amount of US$200.000.
8. The second phase in FNDR's development coincides with its involvement in the
implementation of the frodusa program. Under this program, FNDR moved into investment
lending and assumed the responsibility for assessing sub-project and beneficiary eligibility for
credit financing. The investment prograr. supported by Prodursa totals US$83.8 million, of
which US$63.3 were provided by IDB and the remaining amount was mobilized locally as
counterpart funding. FNDR's lending was carried out to the RDCs which on turn on-lent to the
final beneficiaries (municipalities and their utilities). Loans to the RDCs amounted to US$35
million, the remaining investments were carried out with non-reimbursable transfers from central
government for matching grants and TA activities.
9. The proceeds of the Prodursa program are fully committed. The program fmances 40
investment projects located in departmental capitals and El Alto and benefitting municipalities
as weRl as their udlities. The implementation of all projects is expected to be completed by
June, 1995. Although all RDCs were eligible for financing, due to solvency problems, FNDR
lent to only five Corporations, notably: Santa Cruz with 12 projects and 50% of the total
investment financing, La Paz with 12 projects and 20 % of financing, Tarija with 6 projects and
14% of financing, Cochabamba with 5 projects and 20% of financing, and Chuquisaca with 2
projects and 3% of financing.

10. in addition to the Prodursa progmm, FNDR manages the implementation of the Thre
Cities Water Supply Project, financed by IDA, KFW and the beneficiares entities for a total
investment of US$43 million (IDA credit US$25 million). This project assists the water supply
companies of La Paz, Cochabamba and Santa Cruz to improve and expand their water
production and distribution systems and to enhance their operational capabilities. FNDR's role
consists in channeling the various credit proceeds to the companies, supervising their
implementation of investment and institutional strengthening activities, and recovering the debt
on behalf of the Republic of Bolivia.
11. During the next two-three years, FNDR is expected to mobilize the following additional
resources:
- IDA: credit portion of the investnent financing component of the proposed Municipal
Sector Development Project for an estimated amount of US$23 million. FNDR will also
administe asoated transfers for matching grants and non-refundable funding for an
amount of approximately US$15 million;
-   IDB: credit portion of the investment financing component of a second Prodursa program
for an estimated total amount of US$45 millon. Funding for matching grants and non-
refundable activities esfimated at US$15 million;
-   JAPANESE GOVERNMENT: proceeds resulting from the provision to municipalities of
garbage collection vehicles donated to Bolivia by Japan and donated by the Government to
FNDR. Municipalities will buy these vehicles from FNDR by borrowing from it for an
estimated total amount of US$30 million; and
-   Corporaci6n Andina de Fomento (CAF) and the Fondo para la Cuenca del Plata
(FONPLATA): medium-term borrowing for an estimated total amount of US$15
million.
12. Given its reliance on the UCFs to carry out selected project preparation and loan
administration functions, FNDR will need only a modest increment in staffing to efficiently
manage the increased amount of work that will result from its financing activities..
C. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Finncial Structure and Policy
13. PNDR's initial subscribed capital was set at Bs. 30 million, or US$ 12.5 million. This
remained a pledged contribution untl 1991 when the Nr begun providing these funds by
exemptng FNDR from serving the debt on part of the reimbursable loans under IDB's Produra



-78-                   ANNEX VI
I. As of the end of 1992 FNDR received Bs. 17.2 million (US$4.2 million) and will continue
to complement the capitization. It is expected that FNDR will receive a total of US$9.3
million by 1993/94.
14. In 1991, FNDR came under the scrutiny of the Superintendecia de Bancos and the controls
it exercises over Bolivia's financial institutions and their compliance with a number of financial
indicators. FNDR's borrowing capacity by the time it receives the US$ 9.3 million from the
NT, will be of US$186 million, equivalent to a debt-equity ratio legal ceiling of 20:1. The
proposed program and Prodursa II are well under this amount. FNDR's debt under its present
loan programs amounts to US$35 million of Prodursa I. Debt would increase to a total of about
US$120 million with the implementation of Prodursa II (approximately US$45 million) and the
proposed IDA prog-am (US$23 million), and taking into account its additional borrowing from
CAF and FONPLATA.
15. As was mentioned earlier, under Prodursa I, FNDR channels funds by rediscounting, with
the RDCs bearing the full credit risk. In case a RDC defaults in complying with its debt
service, a well structured system of guarantees allows FNDR to act through the Cental Bank
to gain access to all bank accounts of the RDC and its sub-borrower. There have been no
defaults so far, but some RDCs have been late in providing their counterpart resources that
complement the loans. The guarantee system will be extended to cover this eventuality.
16. FNDR generates income by charging a financial spread, commissions, and miscellaneous
charges and through interest earnings on banks deposits. Under Prodursa I, FNDR charges a
financial spread of two percentage pbints on the interest charged to borrowers. The RDCs
receive an additional percentage point to cover the administrative costs of their financial
intermediation. The FNDR also charges a commission fee of 1% on outstanding balances.
Finacial Analysis of FNDR
17. The consolidated financial statements shown in the following table, portray FNDR's steady
transition toward being a self-sustaining financial institution. During the period 1988-1990, the
Fund did not have any significant liabilities, and its assets were mostly pledges of contributions
from the govemment. During these initial years and while supervising investment programs,
FNDR did not have resources for its own loan portfolios and thus functioned as an
administrative agency of government. The Fund assumed its initial debt of $11 million in 1991,
placing rapidly US$8.4 million in its loan portfolio. By the end of 1992, the portfolio grew to
$28.5 million. Short term liabilities were low and well within the institution's capacity to absorb
them.

18. FNDR's accounting practices are undergoing improvements. In 1991 the Fund adopted the
accounting system that the Superintendencia de Bancos applies for all financial institutions. The
Superinendencia insisted that FNDR's capital include only those contribution from the
govenment effectively received as part of the Fund's capitalization, an account adjustment that
affectod its baMance but does not reflect a real loss of equity. However, the transfers the Fund
received for the projects and institutional strengthening of the RDC's and municipalities, were
inappropriatly recorded that year. These overstated assets by about $4 million, inflating the
insdtation's liquidity  and  undertatg  the return  it obtains on  its assets.   The Fund  took
corrective accounting measures starting from 1992. The table above highlights the adjustments
in the accounts for 1991 that make the data comparable with other years.

19. The following summary of FNDR's profit and losses since 1989, shows that tranfers from
the government and later from USAID balance of payments support funds (the DIFAD facility),
covered FNDR's operating costs throughout hiis perod. These funds began to be phased down
in 1991 as the loan portfolio generated increasng revenues. Interest and commissions on tha
portfolio and on bank deposits, provided most of FNDR's income in 1992, bringing its operang
margin to over US$2.5 million, with less than US$500,000 of external support.

Personnei expenditures have been increasing as FNDR completed its staffing in 1990/91, and
then began in 1992 to assume responsibility for paying most of its professional staff, who up to
then depended on transfers from international donors. Other operating costs also increased as
FNDR begun administering its loans and pursuing additional external resources.
20. Financial ratios can be used to measure FNDR's performance after it began to manage its
own lines of credit in 1991. Before then, the rafos are not very meaningful, as FNDR's assets
were restricted to pledges from government, and the organiizaon, that depended on wansfers
and donations, did not have substantial liabilities. The following table presents the evolutim of
the ratios, as a preliminary baseline for monitoring FNDR in the future.

The lan portfolio yielded a return of 9% over average assets in 1992, or 6.8% over end of year
asset. That compensated the drop in donated funding and maintained the Fund's liquidity while
its current liabilities also fell.
21. Administrative costs of 8% of the loan portfolio at the end of 1992, were about equal to
the financial margin and remain well above to the 2% limit imposed by FNDR's regulations.
Thi is due to several factors. The portfolio is still small, as FNDR's debt at the end of 1992
is under five times its capital. Moreover, in 1992 the Fund assumed the payment for its
personnel, and made a lump payment of US$550,000 to the OPS/UNDP for its services as a
purchasing agent for all of the Prodursa I program. A delay in disbursements during the early
part of 1993 will prolong this situation, that should however improve with the remaining
disbursements of Prodursa I. Some administrative expenses should probably not apply while
measuring whether costs are within the 2% ceiling of loan portfolio. If one were to exclude the
expenses funded by donations and those capitalized, the 1992 ratio would be 4%.
FNR's Financial Pojections
22. In the futue, FNDR is expected to consolidate its position in municipal and regional
deveopment financing. The following projection of FNDR's cash flow assumes that in addition
to IDA's line of credit of US$23.0 million, the Fund will also obtain US$45 million from the



- 82 -                                 ANNEX Vu
IDB's line of commercial lending, and additionally US$15 million coming from other sources
of financing. The terms on which fhe FNDR extends loans are assumed to remain as they have
been, that is, mostly fifteen year loans with two years grace on amortization, and interest
charges of about 11% per annum, plus 1 % for the RDC. The projections are made in constant
dollar values that do not reflect the effect of exchange rate variations.

The loan portfolio is expected to grow up to approximately US$180 milion in six years, based
on a total debt that peaks at US$148 million and a cumulative surplus of US$45 million, that are
going to be reinvested. The rapid increase in the portfolio will generate enough funds to pay
US$3.6 million that are owed to the RDCs and that should be disbursed in the short term, and
service the debt, including the two loans from IDB and IDA, whose first payments are due in
1996.
23. These resources would provide the basis for FNDR's annual operating margin to continue
to grow. The Fund is expected to reach self sufficiency this year by continuing the loan activity
under Prodursa I. Moreover, FNDR future lending activity should provide a positive $10
million operat:ng margin in the next five years. Beyond that point, the Fund would be capable
of managig all loan repayments while continuing to place over $10 million of credit per year.
The following table illustrates the profits and losses that are expected until 1998.

24. The projected financial ratos shown below, expressed in constant dollar value, reflect the
consistent improvements in financial performance that can be expected from an expansion in
FNDR's lending activities. The proportion of administrative costs to the loan portfolio drops
to the 2% ceiling by 1994 and below thereafter. Measures of profitability and liquidity are
unduly influenced by quickly changing averge values of assets and Liabilities in 1992, but
stabilize in 1993/94 and improve slowly afterwards. Profits stabilize at 6% of total assets, above
the average costs of funds. the income-debt service ratio rises in 1993 to 2.61, reflecting returns
on equity funding. The Fund plans to disburse most of the new credits by 1996, when fewer
loans are shown in the projections and thus the administrative costs of the new loans increases
thereafter. At no time do liabilities exceed 6 times net worth, supporting the credibility of
FNDR as a borrower, in term  of its repayment capacity.

BOLIVIA - MUNICIPAL SECTOR DEVELOPNMENT PROJECT
THE REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONS
1.  The 9 Regional Development Corporations (RDCs) are decentalized public entities
adminisatively, financially and technically autonomous. They were created by Supreme Decree
(No.15307) on February 9, 1978. Their main objective is to promote social and economic
development at regional level, under the supervision of the Ministry of Sustainable Development.
Organization
2, With minor differences, the 9 RDCs share the same organizational structure. A Board of
Directors determines long-term strategies, operational policies and priorities. This Board usually
includes the president of the RDC, the departmental Prefect, the mayor of the departmental
capital, the dean of the local public university, a representative of the national armed forces, one
of the Ministry of Sustinable Development, the president of the departmental association of
entrepreneurs and the president of the largest civic association. The president of the RDC, who
is nominated by the President of the Republic, and its senior management (Gerencia General)
bear the responsibility of implementing the directives of the Board. To carry out their financial
operations and administer their financial activities, each RDC relies on a Credit and Financial
Unit, which generally operates as a decentalized, semi-autonomous entity.
Credit and FThanclal Unis (UCFs)
3. Eight UCFs were created in 1984 and 1986, under the auspices of USAIID, the ninth,
Pando, was created in 1990. The UCFs were originally created for financing, on behalf of the
RDCs, productive private projects at regional level. They began to operate with a loan from
USAID of US$11 million and a grant from the government of US$ 3.5 million. The program
was expanded in 1987 with an additional credit from USAID of US$ 15 million and a local
counterpart funding of US$ 6.5 million. The range of activity of the UCFs was expanded with
the implementation of the Program for Urban Development and Sanitation (PRODURSA),
established by the Government in 1990 with I1DB assistance. Under this program, the UCFs
begun managing the disbursements and collecting the repayments of investnent loans made to
municipalities and their utilities by the RDCs with financing from the Regional Development
National Fund (FNDR). The management of the UCF bears the responsibility of implementing
the directives deWrmined by a Board of Directors, which consists of two representatives of the
private sector and three of the RDC. Two Departments, Operations and Evaluations, assist the
management in its functions.
4.  Until 1989 the opaing costs of the UCFs were covered with grants from USAID and
transfers from the RDCs.  The system became self-fi-ancing in 1990 when the average
opeaing annual budget for each UCF was of US$ 140,000, or US$ 1.1 million for the eight
UCFs. The following year, the commission (1%) for the intemediton activities under
Prodursa I, increased the operating budgets of the UCFs to about US$ 740.000. However, in



- 85 -                         ANNEX VIII
the sane year, USAID transferred its portfolio to a private bank thus producing an operaional
deficit for the UCFs. FNDR is planning to further use the UCFs for managing th.i disbursement
and collection of the future loans that it will make to municipalities and their utilities, either
directly or indirectly through the RDCs. This should help the UCFs to reach financial autonomy
in the next years.
F1nance
S.  The activity of the RDC's is subject to the fiscal control of the Ministry of Finances and
to the audit of the 'Contralorfa General'. The possible recourse to external resources for the
implementation of investment programs is approved annually by the Ministry of Sustainable
Development. The following table describes the consolidated budget of the RDC's in 1991.

6. The RDCs' main sources of funds to finance operating costs and investments include:
(j) ioyalties from the exploitation of hydrocarbons and the mining sector; (ii) transfers from the
National Treasury (NT), according to the revenue sharing mechanism of the "coparticipaci6no
introduced by the Tax Reform Law 843; (iii) revenues from the sale of goods and services; and
(iv) credits and grants for their investment programs. The RDCs can be broadly classified into
three groups: the 'Corporaciones Petrolrasw (Santa Cruz, Chuquisaca and Tarija), which enjoy
generous royalties from the exploitation of hydrocarbon in their territories; the 'Corporaciones
Mlneras (La Paz, Oruro and Potosi), which denve royalties from the mining sector; and the
cCorpowadones Dependientes" (Cochabamba, Beni and Pando), which mostly rely on transfers
from the NT. The developing capabilities of the RDCs vary greatly. The Corporation of Santa
Cruz (CORDECRUZ) is by far the richest, with an annual income (1991) in excess of US$ 47
million, that of Oruro (CORDEOR) is the poorest, with an annual income of only US$ 4.6
million.

7. Current expenditure, mostly payrolls, represents 30% of the consolidated total expenditure
for 1991 (US$143 million). In 1987 current expenditure amounted to 20% of the total. The
presence of redundant personnel in many RDCs helps explain the reive growth of operating
expenditure since 1987. The RDCs spend an average of US$ 23 per capita annually. Pando,
Tarija and Chuquisaca are the Corporations with the highest per capita expenditure; La Paz,
Cochabamba and Potosi have the lowest.

8. FNDR has recently estimated the borrowing capacity of the RDCs for the next 10 years.
This estimate taes into account a number of factors such as the analysis of the revenue and
operating expenditure, net of the debt service accumulated, for the period 1987-1992, the 1992-
1993 investing plan and a local counterpart funding (40% of the available funds) for investnents
and unforeseen expenditures. The maximum borrowing capacity of the nine RDCs amounts to
US$ 143 million for the period considered. The RDCs with the higher boromwing capacity are
La Paz, primary beneficiary of the revenue-sharing mechanism, and the "Corporaciones



- 87-                             ANNEX VM
Petroleras (Santa Cruz, Chuquisaca, and Tarija). Cochabamba has a great borrowing potential
because of the discovery of sizable oil reserves in its territory. The deterioration of the mining
sector in recent years, has a negative impact on the borrowing capacity of the "Corporaciones
Mineras' of Potosi and Ormro. The RDC of Pando, which is fully dependent on the NT
transfers, has the lowest borrowing capacity with US$ 300,000 over ten years.
