A. ProgramPurposeandProjectDevelopmentObjective
1. Programpurposeandprogramphasing:
The islandstates o f the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) face considerable development
challenges due to their small size and extreme vulnerability to external shocks and natural disasters. The
OECS countries rely primarily on three sectors for external income: (i)   tourism, which accounts for more
than half of the earnings; (ii)   mono-cropping in banana or sugar, where they are facing declining
preferential access to export markets and (iii)   offshore financial and business services, for which they
have recently come under increasing international pressureto strengthen their regulatory infrastructure as
well as to reduce "harmful"tax competition. The events o f September 11resulted ina reductionintourist
earningsthat severely impactedontheir economies, where diversificationremains limited. The countries'
location within the hurricane belt (except for Grenada) and the presence o f several active volcanoes also
increase the region's susceptibility to natural disasters of a catastrophic nature. Over the last five years
alone, five major hurricanes inflicted a total damage o f over US$1.Ibillion, orjust under 50% o fthe total
sub-regional income.

Despiterelatively strong economic performance duringthe last two decades, the OECS countries continue
to be plagued by strong income volatility and insecurity and persistent poverty. With the exception of
Antigua, which has a relatively low poverty headcount of around 12 percent, over one quarter o f the sub
region's remaining population can be classified as poor using locally defined poverty lines (St. Lucia:
25.1%; Dominica: 33%; Grenada: 32%; St. Kitts andNevis: 31%; and Saint Vincent andthe Grenadines:
37.5%). Continued growth has meant notable improvement in social indicators. Inparticular, the OECS
countries are providing universal access to primary education and access to secondary education for over
60 per cent of their population.     However, this net enrollment, which compares favorably to Latin
American countries, conceals a profound deficit in quality and equity. Student achievement i s very low
anda majority ofyouth leave the education system without the basic skills necessaryto play a productive
role in society. Less than 70 percent o f the students complete secondary education and less than 50%
succeed at the regional CXC exams (see Table I in Section B.2. for data by county). A high level o f
unemployment among youth with low skill levels has resulted in an increase in the number o f youth at
risk throughout the region. Unemployed school leavers face increasingly new challenges, not least the
temptation o f a growing sub-culture o f crime and drugs and early sexual activity with the concomitant
risks o f contractingsexually transmitted diseaseand early pregnancy.

All the OECS countries have put education at the center of their strategy to diversify their economy, to
ensure sustainable growth and to improve the cohesion o f the society by better integrating youth. In
November 2000, after a large consultation process, the OECS countries developed an Eastern Caribbean
Development Strategy with ten core priorities, among them two related directly to this project: (i)
developinghuman capital through continued investments inbetter quality health andeducation, especially
improved access to secondary and tertiary education and (ii)addressing pressing social issues,
particularly chronic unemployment and problems associatedwith youth. Fromthere, each OECS country

level, the OECS Secretariat (through the OECS Education Reform Unit - OERU) i s attempting to
started a participatory process to plan their long-term education development strategy. At a Regional

harmonize those strategies. A framework forjeform with a horizon o f 2010, "OECS Education Reform
Strategy: Pillars for Partnership and Progress," was adopted by the Ministers o f Education inJune 2001.
All the countries have expressed interest in engaging in secondary education reform programs that: (i)
expand access; (ii) the programs and curricula in light o f fast changing labor market conditions;
                     revise
(iii)improve quality by creating an environment more conducive to teaching and learning; (iv) address
the problems of youth at risk as manifested by significant school drop-outs, especially among boys, and
by school violence; and (v) develop the capacity o f both central and school level administration in the
context of a newly defined system o f autonomy and accountability.

The Bank, inthe Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) dated June 4, 2001, favors a sub-regional approach
for continued support to education with a focus on improving quality and access at the secondary level.
The CAS confirms the priorities of the "OECS Education Reform Strategy" which was presented to the
CGCED meeting o f June, 2000 and endorsed by the Ministers o f Education on October 25, 2000. The
Bank approach for this program is similar to the one adopted in other operations such as Emergency
Recovery, Disaster Management or HIV/AIDS.            In order to put the emphasis on the sub-regional
approach, conserving scarce institutional capacity and realizing efficiency gains interms o f overall costs,
the Bank groups similar operations under sub-regional umbrella mechanisms, while still shaping each
project to meet the particular needs o f each country. Implementing country projects inthis programmatic
approach encourages cost effectiveness and sub-regional integration, pooling resources from the member
countries to allow them to reach national and sub-regional priorities. The process also involved some
innovation to adapt the Bank's instrument to better suit the sub-regional goals.         In the proposed
"horizontal" APL, phased support i s provided for a long-term development program. The term horizontal
implies that the instrument will apply sequentially across countries inthe sub-region to allow countries to
join the program when they are ready.

The proposed program will support the education development of Saint Lucia, Saint Christopher (St.
Kitts) and Nevis, Dominica, Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Each country will join the
program when they meet the established criteria for participation (see Section B.4.).    St. Lucia and St.
Kitts & Nevis will be the first tojoin the program. The others are likely tojointhe program inFY03.

This program is developed with participation from the Department for InternationalDevelopment(DFID)
(see Annex 9for full description of DFIDproject implementation support to St. Lucia) and is coordinated
with the other main donors for the education sector inthe region, including the Caribbean Development
Bank, the European Union, UNICEF and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). The
activities proposed under this program are supported by current initiatives from several regional
institutions: (a) the OERU's work on curriculum harmonization; (b) the Caribbean Examination Council's
(CXC) work on evaluation and standards and (c) the UNESCO regional office's initiative on education
statistics (Caribbean Regional Educational Management Information System - CREMIS). In order to
strengthen this regional collaboration and sharing o f information, the Bank introduced an Education
Knowledge Management Network for the Caribbean ( E m ) . This network was designed for key
education policy makers and practitioners inthe Caribbean to share information and knowledge and learn
from one another in the preparation and implementation o f education projects. The EKMN should
enhance participatory project design and facilitates access to previously unavailable information.     The
OERUhascreated a staffpositionfor two yearsto give continuity to this initiative.

This program builds on the recently completed Bank-financed Basic Education Reform Projects in St.
Lucia, Grenada and Dominica, the DFID-financed Secondary Education Support Project (SESP) in
Dominica and the CDB-financed education project in St. Kitts and Nevis. Achievements at the basic
education level have laidthe foundation for reforms inthe upper primaryand secondary schools and have
increaseddemandfor better quality education.

2. Project development objective (see Annexes 1A and 1B):
The overall program objective i s to buildhumancapital inthe OECS which, inturn, will contribute to the
diversification o f their economy and more sustainable growth.    This objective will be achieved by: (i)
increasing equitable access to secondary education; (ii)improvingthe quality o f the teaching and learning
process, with more direct interventions at the school level and a focus on student-centered learning, and
(iii)strengthening management o fthe sector and governance o f schools.

B. Strategic Context
1.Sector-Related CountryAssistanceStrategy (CAS) goalsupportedbythe project (see
Annexes 1A and 1B):
Documentnumber: 22205-LAC Dateof latestCAS discussion: June 4,2001
The OECS Countw Assistance Strategy cites two crucial policy issues:                (i)economic and social
vulnerability and (ii)   limited institutional capacity. Inorder to relieve economic and social vulnerability,
the Bank, in close collaboration with other development agencies, should support an economic
diversification process to move from agriculturally-based economies to service industries and tourism,
while building institutional capacity and protecting their environment. This will require investments in
training o f human resources. The quality o f human capital is a critical factor for better integration in a
world economy dominated by knowledge-based industries. Education, especially at the secondary level,
should remain a strong priority for the Eastern Caribbean Governments in order to ensure that students
learn the basic skills necessaryto enter into the labor force. Due to the special development challenges
that these small states face, the Bank proposes a sub-regionalhegional approach to mitigate the limitations
imposed by their small size.

Caribbean Education Strategy Report No. 20452-LAC, June 2000: The proposed project is in line with
the five key recommendations made in the Caribbean Education Strategy paper, endorsed in a meeting
held on October 25, 2000 by the Ministers of Education o f the region. These strategy recommendations,
intended to realize the final objective o f reaching an internationally competitive labor force and equitable
andeffective education systems, include: (i)     narrowingthe knowledge gap; (ii) the school andthe
                                                                                   making
classroom the center o f focus o f the education system; (iii)  reducing inequities inthe school system; (iv)
strengthening regional collaboration and (v) enhancing educational financing and management.

Small States: Meeting; Challenges in the Global Economy - Report o f the Commonwealth
SecretariatlWorld Bank Joint Task Force on Small States, April 2000 (presented at the Bank`s Annual
Meetings inPrague in September2000): This report states that "improving small states' humancapital i s
the most important vehicle for a rapid transition and more equal income distribution." A better-educated
population will be more productive and use limited resources more efficiently. In strategic global
repositioning o f their economies, the OECS countries are rapidly shifting to service industries. Human
capital is a critical factor in service delivery, an increasingly important commodity inthe global market.
Improvements in the quantity and quality o f education, with emphasis on strong literacy and numeracy
skills, are essential to upgrade the work force and ensure labor productivity. Information technology can
also boost development in small states with a well-educated computer-literate work force. The Report
states that it i s important for small states to build a knowledge base and share experiences. Regional co-
operation can also help to develop capacity. Finally, improved donor coordination i s important to the
development o f small states. Alignment o f donor objectives reduces the administrative and financial
burdenon the countries.


Ministers of Education Meeting: Tortola - June 2001): This document proposes inter alia to reform
The OECS Education Reform Stratem: Pillars for Partnership and Progress 2010 (accepted in the 14th

secondary education along the following lines: (i)        to provide or maintain the provision of universal
education for all children up to the age o f 16 years, to guarantee five years o f secondary education to
students meetingthe entry criteria and to certify achievement at the end o f primary and secondary; (ii)    to
establish a common curriculum in the first three years o f secondary to reinforce general education
(English Language and Literature, Mathematics, Integrated Science, Integrated Technology, Social
Studies, Foreign Languages, Physical Education, Religious and Moral Education and Performing Arts)
and to allow some degree o f specialization in the last two years; (iii) improve the quality through
                                                                              to
modular programs, comprehensive training for school principals andteachers, lengtheningthe school year
to 190 days, encouraging the use o f creative and performing arts and information and communication

technology in teaching and (iv) to strengthen the delivery of support services such as guidance and
counseling, social welfare and libraryand learningresources.

2. Mainsector issues and Government strategy:
Sector Issues

The following issues were identified through the preliminary work done in the development o f the
countries' long-term education plans and during the preparation process through studies done in the
following areas: (i) assessment, (ii) financing, (iii)
                      social                  school                  youth-at-risk; (iv) teacher training; (v)
curriculum; (vi) science education and (vii) numeracy and literacy. The studies involved interviews with
teachers, principals, students, MOE personnel and local NGOs. In the social assessment, students were
offered the opportunity to expresstheir perceptions, concerns and expectations o f school. School-leavers,
parents and teachers were also interviewed to corroborate students' statements. Special focus was placed
on issues o f inequityo f access to quality education.

(a) Inequitable access to secondary education

Students from low-income families have a lower participation rate in quality secondary education in
OECS countries. In St. Kitts, though secondary enrollment i s universal, the secondary school that serves
the children from the low-income area of the island is overcrowded and infrastructure is poor. In
addition, many o f these children have to travel long distances to reach school. In St. Lucia, low-income
children are more likely to be enrolled at all-age primary schools' or not enrolled in the formal school
system. While only 46% o f students from the 1'' quintile are enrolled in secondary education, 79% o f
students from the 5* quintile are enrolled. The limited number o f secondary school places in St. Lucia
results in a low transition rate from primary to secondary schools (see Table I below). This i s partly due
to the high selectivity o f the Common Entrance Examination (CEE)2, which rations the limited places
available in secondary education. This also has a negative effect on the poor because they often attend
the schools with fewer resources and from which fewer students pass the exam.           There i s a traditional
concentration o f secondary schools in urban areas which limits availability to many poor rural families,
and there are no explicit compensatory and targeting mechanisms (transport subsidies, education grants,
feeding programs, etc.) which facilitate the access of disadvantaged children to secondary schools. In
addition, there is a gender issue present inboth countries (and inthe whole Caribbean region in general),
whereby males demonstrate lower academic achievement levels and have lower participation in
secondary education.

(b) Deficient quality of secondary education.

Results o f the Caribbean Examination Council (CXC) exams, given at the end o f the secondary cycle,
determine students' ability to enter tertiary education or access professional jobs in the labor market. In
most o f the OECS countries, students' achievement level on some CXC exams is very low. In St. Lucia,
only 27% passed 5 subject exams, including Math and Englishin 2000, while in St. Kitts and Nevis, the
pass rate was 26% (see Table I below). An inequitable distribution o f resources across schools results in
differences in the quality o f education offered to students, especially those from lower income families,


 The students who fail the CommonEntranceExamination,givenat Grade 6 ofprimary school, remaininthe all-
age primary schools (attendingsenior primary courses orjunior secondaryprograms). A minority ofthemhave a
further chanceto gainaplaceinsecondary school(integratingForm3) viathe CommonMiddleSchool

and unequal opportunities to attain the CXC goal. The factors more commonly mentioned during
preparation o f the program that contribute to poor student achievement include: (i)imbalanced and
irrelevant curricula; (ii)
                         low teacher qualifications and a teachinglearning mode that is uninteresting and
generally ineffective; (iii)insufficient and low quality instructionalmaterials and educational equipment;
(iv) the need for continuous evaluation o f studentperformance and better supervision mechanisms and(v)
a school environment that discourages involvement of the whole school community. All of these factors
create a school environment that i s not conducive to student learning and that inhibits active student
participation.

(b.i.) Imbalanced and irrelevant curricula
Across the OECS, the curriculum i s imbalanced and insufficient to meet society's current needs and does
not appeal to the interests o f the students. It includes obsolete subject matter and lacks a clearly defined
core curriculum to ensure development o f core skills for all students. Instead, it offers a multiplicity of
options too early in the student's school career, resulting in superficial coverage o f many subjects and
creating excessive costs for individualized teachers and space. In addition, streaming o f students takes
place in many schools, leading frequently to students being restricted in their subject choices and being
required too early to make career choices.            Such practices o f streaming contribute to student
dissatisfaction and loss of self-esteem.

Inrecognition of these problems, the OERU has led regional efforts to agree on a core curriculum. In
their policy document, "Pillars for Progress," they outline a list of subjects that has been endorsed by the
Ministers o f Education. However, discussions in a recent regional curriculum seminar (February 2002),
organized by the Bank, revealed that the policy mandates have not yet been adopted by individual
governments nor have they beenput into practice inschools. The harmonization o f the curriculum across
the OECS should be accelerated to promote economies o f scale in the production and purchase of
textbooks andto allow for a common assessment o f learningachievement.

The curriculum seminar participants also agreed that the curriculum requires a more interdisciplinary
approach, and it should give more attention to the development o f autonomy, values and moral
behaviours and local culture. In addition, all the countries expressed the need for greater inclusion o f
information technology. They are especially concerned with the lack o f a cohesive program that enables
secondary school students to acquire the skills, knowledge and attitudes for the use of information
technology.

(b.ii.) Ineffective teachingnearningmode, low teachers' qualifications and insufJicient
training
The pedagogy is teacher-centered and discourages student autonomy and creative, independent research
and learning.      The Governments assess that teachers should offer differentiated activities and
individualized learning in a more interactive way. Efforts are being made to offer teacher training more
conducive to modem pedagogy and curriculum changes.

Teacher qualifications are low. In St. Lucia, only about half o f the secondary teachers had tertiary
degrees in 1997/98 and only 58% o f the teachers had received some sort o f teacher training. In St. Kitts
andNevis, only 30% ofthe secondary teachers hadtertiary degrees in 1999/2000and30% ofthe teachers
had received some training. In addition, there i s a constant movement o f teachers, so the MOE is
continually required to hire new substitute teachers to replace trained teachers who have left the system.
Manyteachers show weaknesses inpedagogical skills and mastery of subject matter, which are cited by
education officials and school principals as one o fthe major causes of low student achievement levels. A
secondary effect of these weaknesses i s teachers' inability to create a learning environment that limits
disciplinary problems in the classroom or to handle disciplinary action in productive ways. Students
interviewed sharedfeelings o f apprehension for the use o f corporal punishment inschools, lack o f respect
from teachers anda dearth o f good role models.

(b.iii.) Insufficient and low quality instructionalmaterialsand educationalequipment to
support student-centered learning approaches
Secondary schools are characterized by the absence o f basic educational materials and equipment to
support student-centered classroom teaching and learning. Those school libraries that exist are poorly
stocked and under-used, and computers are not systematically connected to the internet.             Science
laboratories are poorly equipped and the computer laboratories, when existing, are under-used due to
insufficient access to educational software and poor maintenance o fthe hardware. The conditions make it
extremely difficult to implement student-centered approaches, such as group or team work, independent
research projects, science experiments and other hands-on learning methods. Finally, teachers and
educational support staff require more appropriate training to use existing andproposed new equipment.

(b.iv.) Needfor more continuousstudent assessment and supervision mechanisms
Inmost of the countries, the education system is largely based on a policy of automatic promotion fi-om
one grade to the next, with a selection being made at the end of the two main cycles, primary and
secondary (in St. Kitts, only at the end o f the secondary cycle).       The lack of intermediate student
assessment makes it difficult to detect educational achievement problems and resolve them when they
appear, leading to low achievement levels on the two terminal exams.            St. Lucia has introduced a
Minimum Standard Examination after the 3rd and 5th Grades that tests the knowledge and skills of all
students at a particular grade level inthe basic education cycle and introduces standards and benchmarks
as a means o f quality control. St. Kitts andNevis has designed National Certificates o f Education for the
same purpose. There is a general need at the sub-regional level to develop a new examination system to
assess student achievement inthe core subjects and some selective areas. This exam could be given after
Form I11to include studentswho may not reach the CXC level.

(b.v.) Needfor enhancementof school communityparticipation
The overall atmosphere o f the school, given the issues cited above, and insufficient communication
between major stakeholders create an environment that is not conducive to pedagogical improvements
and that does not respondto real needs, interests, expectations and culture o f the students. There i s a lack
o f activities in which students can take initiatives and voice their concerns. The involvement o f the
parents is also insufficient to motivate and support the school and the students.

(c) W e a k management of the sector and governance of schools

Three main issues inthe management o fthe sector and governance o fthe schools need to be tackled quite
urgently. First, there is a weak information system to support informed and effective decision-making.
Although the countries have Education Management Information Systems, they do not all include
systematized data collection, effective supervision and reporting mechanisms and established quality
standards. There is no supervision system in place that uses the EMIS data to monitor school and staff
performance. The recently closed projects have worked to buildthe planning capacity o f the MOEs, but
this will need to be further strengthened and decentralized to include district offices and schools.
Secondly, governance i s weak at the school level with insufficient training for principals, low levels o f
parent participation and limited autonomy and capacity o f the schools to manage small maintenance
budgets and apply site-based activities and innovations. Thirdly, there is low capacity o f the sector in
budget management and planningwith consequent difficulties in mobilizingthe necessary resources for
quality investments (including maintenance and in-service teacher training).

Government Strategies

All the countries participating inthis program have engaged recently in the preparation o f a long-range
education sector plan. In each country, the process has been highly participatory, including meetings
across the islands with key stakeholders. In their plans, firstly, all the Governments have indicated a
strong commitment to education. They have agreed to maintain significant and consistent public
investment in education, as indicated by the levels of education expenditure as a percentage o f GNP (see
Table I above). The continuity o f this commitment over the past 30 years has led, in all the countries, to
almost universal coverage in primary education. As a result, they are now focusing on the development
of quality secondary and tertiary education and greater access to these levels for students from low-
income families. The Governments all recognize that there are still quality issues to be addressed at all
levels. Governments are: (i)    designingremedial programs to improve literacy and numeracy skills for
low-achieving students in primary school; (ii)increasing training opportunities to raise teacher
qualifications; (iii)
                    reforming the secondary school curriculum to make it more relevant to the needs of
the society; (iv) equipping secondary schools with the facilities, materials and technology to promote
student-centered learning and (v) increasing the use of diagnostic assessment mechanisms. A more
detailed description of the individual plans is included inAnnex 2A for St. Kitts andNevis and 2B for St.
Lucia.

3. Sector issuesto be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The project will address the three main sector issues highlighted above:

Equitable access tosecondary education

The project aims to increase access to secondary education, paying special attention to students from low-
income families. Construction o f new schools in under-served areas, rehabilitation o f existing schools
and expansion of the number o f classrooms will provide additional secondary school places or replace
temporary and dilapidated facilities. Care has been taken to ensure appropriate selection o f school sites
for new schools, based on poverty assessment and school mapping data. Rehabilitation and expansion
will be focused onthe schools with fewer resources. St. Luciawill usethesetwo strategies intheir efforts
to achieve universal secondary education while St. Kitts and Nevis will improve opportunities for the
poorest students inthe school system. Inaddition, St. Kitts andNevis will extend to secondary education
the school feeding program. Cafeterias will be constructed or addedto the public secondary schools and
profits will be usedto subsidize meals for the poorest students ineach school.

Improved quality

A compensatory literacy and numeracy program inprimary and secondary schools will ensure that more
students acquire the basic skills to move into secondary school and successfully handle the demands o f
the secondary curriculum. Insecondary schools, the program will enhance the quality o f the educational
process by improving the school teaching and learning environment with more direct interventions at the
school level and a focus on student-centred learning. Governments will move towards a common core
curriculum more responsive to the country's development needs and the introduction of information
technology across the subjects. Relevant learning materials, books and laboratory equipment will be
provided, and learningresource centers, equipped with books, computers with internet service and audio/
video equipment, will give students and teachers research facilities and the means for more creative
teaching and learning. Teacher training courses will improve teachers' knowledge o f subject matter and
ability to use technology as well as student-centered pedagogical skills. Inaddition, efforts will be made
intraining courses to improve teachers' skills in early detection of learning problems and identification
and methods for working with students at risk. Finally, continuous student assessment and shifts to make




                                                     11

terminal examinations more diagnostic in nature will provide for more focused and relevant student
assessmentand quality assurance.

Another key to improving quality is improvement of the school environment. Students need to feel more
welcome inschools, and they need an avenue for more creative expression. School Improvement Projects
(SIPS) have been identified as an effective way o f creating partnerships throughout the school community,
fostering ownership and stimulating innovation ineducation. And extracurricular activities, selected and
managed by the students themselves, will allow students to define and explore their own interests.
Improved student support services, including trained guidance counselors, also will be available to
students.

Better sector management and school governance

Improvements in the countries' Education Management Information Systems (EMIS) will link schools
with each other and with the Ministry of Education at the central level, and will provide reporting and
supervision mechanisms as well as established quality standards to be monitored on a continuous basis.
This will enhance the work of the District Education offices and will inform the teacher training and
pedagogical support to teachers. At the school level, principals will receive leadership and management
training and the Programwill extend initialtraining on the use of school development plansto include the
involvement o f teachers, students, parentsandthe wider community in School DevelopmentPlanning.


4. Program description and performance triggers for subsequent loans:
Inthe proposed "horizontal" APL, phasedsupport is provided for a long-term development program. The
term horizontal implies that the instrument will apply sequentially across countries in the sub-region to
allow countries to join the program when they are ready. The countries will implement their projects
simultaneously.

The proposed program will support the education development o f St. Lucia, St. Kitts and Nevis,
Dominica, Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Each country will join the program when they
meet the following established criteria for participation:
     .....Adoption by their Government of a long-term Education DevelopmentPlan;
          Readinesso f a project proposal to improve quality and access to secondary education;
          Establishment o f a ProjectManagement Unitwith functions and staff satisfactory to the Bank;
          Credit worthiness indicators (net internationalreserves, debt to GDP anddebt service to exports
          o f goods andnon factor services) that remain withinreasonableranges; and
          Counterpart fundingavailability for the project.

St. Kitts and Nevis and St. Lucia will be the first to join the program. The others are likely to join the
program in FY03. The program is described in Section A.l. and the individual country projects for St.
Kitts and St. Lucia are described inAnnexes 2A and 2B, respectively.

 C. Program and Project Description Summary
 1. PROJECT     COMPONENTS(see Annexes 2A and 2B for detailed descriptions and Annexes 3A and3B
 for detailed cost breakdowns):
 The following is a general outline o fthe proposed project. Localadaptations to meet individual country's
 needs can be found in Annexes 1A and 1B. Costs for the individual sub-projects can be found in
 Annexes 3A and 3B.

     1. Increase equitable access to secondary education, paying special attention to students from low-
         income backgrounds, by (a) constructingnew schools inunder-served areas and (b) rehabilitating
         existing schools and expanding the number o f classrooms.
     2. Improve quality to enhance the school teaching and learning environment, with more direct
         interventions at the school level and a focus on student-centred learning, through: (a) curriculum
         enhancement and relatedteacher training and improved continuous assessment; (b) establishment
         o f learning resource centers and improved science laboratories and provision o f relevant learning
         materials, books and laboratory equipment; (c) establishment o f literacy and numeracy
         enhancement programs and programs to support participation o f disadvantaged students,
         including learning support for less able learners and (d) use o f school development plans and
         provisiono f school improvement projects and extracurricular activities for youth at risk.
     3. Strengthen management of the sector and governance of schools by (a) expanding the
         Education Management Information System (EMS) to link schools with each other and with the
         Ministry of Education at the central level, which should include reporting and supervision
         mechanisms as well as the establishment of quality standards to be monitored on a continuous
         basis and (b) improving supervision and support to schools through strengthening o f district
         education offices, the training o f principals, the promotion o f parent participation and the
         implementation o f decentralized maintenance budgets.

 2. Key policyand institutionalreformssupportedby the project:
 A key element to make the school more effective, to improve the learning environment and to make it
 more attractive to students, i s the empowerment o f the school community. Each of the countries, intheir
 long-term sector plan, has highlightedthe needto decentralize education, focusing onthe school level and
 enabling greater school autonomy in planning and decision-making. This will be supported by many o f
 the activities inthe proposed project: (a) each school will have a school development plan and a school-
 based improvement project, elaborated with the participation of principals, teachers, students, parents and
 community leaders; (b) students should drive the selection and implementation o f extra-curricular
 activities; (c) each school will manage a maintenance budget and (d) each school will be connected to and
 will contribute data to an EMS system. The countries support these activities within an improved legal
 framework.      In St. Lucia, the new Education Act, passed in 2000, now establishes the basis for
 governance o f the system and will strengthen the district education offices. St. Kitts and Nevis propose
 the formation ofschool Boards to monitor decentralized activities.

 All the OECS countries have also agreed on the development o f a core curriculum for Forms Ito I11of
 secondary education, building on the work done to date by the OERU. This curriculum aims to: (i)
 provide the basic skills for all students; (ii) the contents to address specific regional issues; (iii)
                                                adapt
 introduce information technology across subjects; (iv) strive to make the content more relevant and
 thereby more attractive to students and (v) focus more on core subject areas and reduce the number of
 electives to make education more cost effective at this level. The OECS EducationDevelopmentprogram
 will assist inthe provision o f instructional materials and training and re-training o f teachers to meet new
 curriculum needs. Italso will ensure that school constructionandrehabilitation, as well as equipment, are
 inline withmorestudent-centeredpedagogical approaches.

3. Benefitsandtarget population:
Main beneflts

The expected benefits from this program are considerable. First, it will increaseeducational opportunities
for youth from disadvantaged and rural areas. It also offers potential improvement in the quality of
secondary education. This improvementwill ensurethat students are able to benefit fully from secondary
education, incontrast to the current situation. Educationalachievement will be higher, leadingeventually
to higher productivity and an increase inthe earnings differential. Completion of the secondary cycle by
a greater number o f students will increase youths' opportunities to acquire better skills for thejob market
and get more qualified andbetter payingjobs.

Another important benefit which will follow from the increased enrollment i s the reduction o f out-of-
school youth with a consequent reduction in violence and societal risk. Improving school climates and
keeping students inschool has provedto be the most cost-effective way o f reducingyouth violence.

Finally, the improved governance andthe curriculum reform will lead to efficiency gains inthe education
process that will translate into a reallocation of funds from salaries to non-salary recurrent expenditures.
This will allow for greater investments inquality.

Targetpopulation

The access component o f the project will benefit especially the secondary school-age children of
disadvantaged and rural areas. Less able learners will be targeted with specially designed support
programs. The quality component o f the project will benefit all the secondary education students inboth
urban and rural areas.

4. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements:
Project coordinationand implementationarrangements:
Ineachcountry, a ProjectManagement Unit(PMU), already established withinthe respective Ministryof
Education, will be responsible for project coordination, management and implementation. A Project
Coordinator will be assigned by the ministryto coordinate project progress and will be the principal link
with the World Bank andDFID. The PMUwill include the number of staffmembers gauged necessaryto
carry out the coordination, procurement, financial management and accounting o f the project (see
Annexes 6A and 6Bfor full list of stafl. In St. Kitts andNevis, a ProjectAdvisory Committee (PAC) will
be established inthe MOE. Itwill be chairedby the Permanent Secretary andwill include representatives
o f the PMU, chairpersons o f project sub-committees and senior officials representing the Ministry o f
Finance, the Planning Unitand the Public Works Department. A similar advisory committee exists in St.
Lucia. The PAC will provide systematic advice and counseling during implementation of the project and
exercise a monitoringrole for the activities o fthe PMU.

Project implementation,monitoring and evaluation
Ineach country, the project components will be executed by the respective ministryunits, with oversight
by the PMU. Implementation o fthe project will be guided by the Project OperationalManual (OM), the
Financial Management manual and a detailed procurement plan. The final issuance of the OM is a
conditionfor eflectiveness of the Loan.

The implementingunitswill provide regularly scheduled progress reports to the PMU. The PMU, inturn,
will report project progress on a quarterly basis to the Bank, according to agreed upon performance
indicators (see Annexes I A and 1B). As mentioned above, the PAC will also monitor project activities.
As an extension of the PAC, St. Lucia has proposed the creation of a formal Council on Secondary



                                                      15

Education comprising Education Officers and Principals of secondary schools. This i s welcomed as an
additional meansto ensure full stakeholder engagement inproject implementationand monitoring.

Accounting,financial reporting and auditing requirements
The financial management o f the project (including accounting, reporting audits and disbursements) will
be coordinated by the PMU, which i s currently in the process of finalizing the overall financial
management system. To facilitate disbursements, a Special Account will be established and managed
according to Bank guidelines as prescribed in the Disbursement Handbook. The project will be audited
annually by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, and special purpose audits will be carried out
on a half-yearly basis to audit the demand-driven component o f the project. Audit reports will be
submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the end o f each fiscal year. Details o f all financial
management arrangementsmay be found inAnnex 6.

D. ProjectRationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasonsfor rejection:
Sub-regional approach vs. single-country loans: The decision to include several countries under one
programwas made for two reasons. First,the OECS countries will gain from a more integrated approach.
The limited resources available to each island are insufficient to tackle similar issues individually.
Several regional initiatives have been established already, including common CXC examinations for
secondary education graduates and an evaluation process that uses similar benchmarks; cost-effective
teacher training via distance learning and a regional curriculum reform effort. The proposed program i s
buildingonthese regional agreements. To foster regionalcollaborationinthe design and execution ofthe
program, the Bank introduced the Education Knowledge Management Network (see section AI.for a
detailed description). Secondly, the transaction costs for preparation, monitoring and evaluation of the
project are reducedunder a multi-country approach.

Focus on secondary education vs. whole-sector reform initiatives: Although some o f the activities will
cut across levels, such as institutional strengthening and student support programs, the decisionwas made
to focus mainly on secondary education. Recent Bank-financed projects (BERPs) in Dominica, St. Lucia
and Grenada andthe CDB-financedproject inSt. Kitts andNevis supported basic education reform inthe
respective countries. These projects have improved education quality and all the countries have achieved
universal primary enrollment. Thus, the proposed program will build on these achievements to make
quality secondary education available to the increasing demand. Another reason for focusing on one level
o f the education system is to simplify the design of the project. The inclusion o f several countries makes
it sufficiently challenging, and efforts are being made to concentrate on issues common to all of them.
The program will not address tertiary education needs, with the exception o f teacher training, since most
secondary graduates leave their countries to pursue higher education, and national capacity for tertiary
training i s limited, as is national investment.

3. Lessons learned and reflectedinthe project design:
   %Sector8,Themes %KM
Simple project design andflexibility: In small states, in order to reduce transaction costs, the Bank is
allowing for horizontal APLs to group countries that are working on like issues. However, the horizontal
APL loans currently under implementation for multiple countries have mixed ratings. As in all new
ventures, we must approach this with a certain degree o f caution. The OECS Disaster Management
project used a horizontal APL with additional vertical phasing inthe timingo fthe project (APL1,2 and 3
with specific countries and an APL4 for contingency funding). Unexpectedevents during the course of
implementation have required cumbersome adjustments. For this reason, this program proposes a simple
umbrella structure whereby two countries (St. Kitts & Nevis and St. Lucia) will initiate their projects
simultaneously. A similar design would be implementedfor the other countries (Dominica, Grenada and
St. Vincent) inthe future, pendingpolicy dialogue with the Governments.

Flexibility during project implementation: In St. Lucia, the sector realized significant strides towards
system reform by effecting changes in the BERP content to address pressing unanticipatedneeds. This
allowed, for example, the expansion o f local training to include Management training for MOE staff,
principals and teachers, and the support to additional district offices and strategic units within the
organization.   So while there can be broad agreement on the scope o f assistance under specified
components, there needs to be room for maneuver within and across sub-components as implementation
progresses. This is taken into consideration for this program.

Donor co-ordination with single-sourcefunding: The OECS Solid and Ship Waste Management Project
i s excessively complex with multi-countries, multi-donors and multi-source funding with a blend o f
IBRD/IDA and GEF funds and a complex project design. As a result, implementation has been difficult.
The aim o f this proposed education program is to improve donor coordination, stimulate donor
investments and reduce transaction costs but avoid the rigidity and complexity o f a co-financed loan. We
are engaged in dialogue and parallel coordination o f actions with major donors (DFID, CIDA,
OECS/OERU and EU) in the planning o f sector investments and the design o f the program. DFID and
theBankareassociatedinthe preparation andimplementationofthe program.

Community participation in design and implementation of projects: All the countries have noted the
importance o f involving stakeholders in the development o f sector plans, and adopted a highly
participatory process to establish their national long-range education plans. This responds, in some
dimensions, to the lesser degree o f participation inthe recently closed projects, and the resulting limited
success at the school level. In Dominica, ongoing efforts at reform have fallen short of effective
ownership at the school level, so they have proposed devolvement of more authority and a focus on
schools as the centers of change. They have done this by securing improved participation inthe design o f
their project under this program and will empower teachers and principals to be agents o f changethrough
the EMIS, school networking and school improvement projects. St. Lucia and St. Kitts and Nevis have
also followed a participatory approach to designing their proposed projects, and St. Lucia plans to
establish an advisory Council on Secondary Education comprising Education Officers and Principals o f
secondary schools to oversee the implementation.

School improvement projects:      The Bank has found, in countries across the region, that school
improvement projects have proved to be one o f the most effective agents o f change in schools. Chile's
school-based Education Improvement Project (PME) and extra-curricular activities (ACLES) are among
the most successful and innovative components o f the MECE projects. PMEs are submitted to the
government by individual schools and are funded on a competitive basis. The PMEs have given teachers
and principals the autonomy to decide how best to improve education quality in their schools and the
ACLES have allowed students more expression in determining the activities that are interesting and
meaningful to them, within the safe structure of the school community. Paraguay's Innovative Education
Projects (PIES) have also been widely successful in involving students, teachers, parents and community


                                                     19

leaders in the quest for improved education responsive to local needs and have increased educational
leadership among teachers and principals, improved communication with the school and with the
community and enhanced teaching practices. This program, like the project underpreparation inJamaica,
will incorporatethese same types o f innovative activities to promote school-basedmanagement, improve
the school environment and address existing problems with youth at risk.

Civil works: In St. Lucia, implementation o f the BERP has taught them that beneficiary input at the
design stage o f civil works, namely new schools, and adequately defined project needs prior to tender and
start o f construction, can help to reduce time and overall cost o f civil works. The countries have taken the
steps during the preparation phase of their projects to settle the issues relevant to proposed construction
sites before the project start date, including school mapping, property titles and ownership, encumbrances,
utilities, environmental impact and surveys.        In addition, a general framework of guidelines for
environmental assessments will be providedto all new countries coming inunder the program.

4. Indicationsof borrowercommitmentandownership:
All the countries have engaged over the last two years in the development of long-range sector plans.
Their conscious inclusion o f a wide range of stakeholders has committed them to carry forward the
reform proposals by way of concrete actions within a limited period o f time. St. Lucia, Dominica and
Grenada have all requested follow-up funding to World Bank-financed education projects (BERPs) that
recently closed in order to continue bolstering the education reform process. St. Kitts & Nevis and St.
Vincent have also made direct requestsfor Bank financing to support the education sector. St. Lucia and
St. Kitts & Nevis have submitted draft project proposals to the Bank. The project designs are rooted in
their long-term education plans. Evaluation impact studies for the BERPs have informed the proposed
program preparationprocess, providing lessons learnedto guide the program design.

All the countries participated in the Regional Meetings of the Americas Education for All in Santo
Doming0 in February 2000 to formulate a Regional Action Plan 2000-2015 which was presented at the
Conference in Dakar in April 2000. They have also participated in the Caribbean Education Strategy
issued by the World Bank. The sector needs have been brought forth by the countries themselves and
they are committed to addressing them. One clear indication i s the attendance o f representatives from
Dominica, St. Kitts & Nevis and St. Lucia at the identification workshop in Washington, D C in June,
2000. Each country financed the travel for a team, including high level Ministry of Education officials,
BERPstaff, teachertraining institute staffandsecondary school directors.

All the countries also sent representatives to a recent Bank-financed curriculum workshop to review
advances in curriculum reform for the first three years o f secondary education. They have committed to
supportingthe regional initiatives bythe OERUand will usethese to advance individual country efforts.

5. Value addedof Banksupportinthisproject:
The Bank has a standing commitment to provide financial and technical assistance to the Caribbean
region and an ongoing relationshipwith the ministries o f education. A collaborative approach has yielded
increased cooperation between the Bank and the countries, and among countries. The Bank introduced
the EducationKnowledge Management Networkas a tool for fostering continuedcollaboration. The Bank
has participated inthe Caribbean Education Task Force in its quest to establish a regional strategy and i s
knowledgeable about regional sector issues.

The Bank has carried out extensive sector work in secondary education and can provide best practice
examples of initiatives at this level. Particular to this project, the Bank's team offers expertise and
familiarity with international secondary education reforms and school-based programs for youth,
particularly in Chile, Argentina and Paraguay. The successful Chilean experience was introduced inthe
identificationworkshop.


                                                      20

The Bank has encouraged collaboration among donors (DFID, OECS/OERU, CIDA) in the project and
has assisted in mobilizing additional sources of financing. The Bank organized and financed a regional
curriculum workshop, encouraging OECS representatives to engage in consensus buildingaround lower
secondary curriculum issues.      DFID, CXC and OERU representatives also participated to ensure
collaboration among donors and regional agencies.

E. SummaryProjectAnalysis (Detailed assessments are inthe projectfile; seeAnnex 11):
1. Economic(see Annexes 4A and4B):
The main benefits o f the project will be the increase in the access to secondary education and the
improvements in the quality o f this same education cycle. Greater access to secondary education (and,
thus, higher numbers of secondary education enrollees and graduates) brought about by the construction
o f new schools will make it possible for entire cohorts of students to become more productive, get more
qualifiedjobs and, ultimately, earn more on the labor market. Similarly, quality improvementswill leadto
both decreased drop-outs and higher educational achievement which will both translate into higher
earnings through a higher number o f graduates and higher productivity gains associated with secondary
education.

The economic analysis attempts to quantifL all these benefits, findingthem significant inthe case o f St.
Lucia and St. Kitts and Nevis (analysis presented in Annexes 4A and 4B). More specifically, benefits
from increased access have required calculation of the incremental earnings associated with secondary
education and application o f the discounted stream o f these incremental earnings to the new graduates
produced by the project. Similarly, the benefits from decreased drop-outs were estimated applying this
same discounted stream o f incrementalearnings to the additional studentsthat are able to finish the cycle
following the reduction indrop-outs brought about by the quality interventions. Finally, the benefits from
increased quality (beyond the ones associatedwith decreaseddrop-outs) required to: (a) assess the impact
that quality interventions have on educational achievement proxied by exam passing rates; (b) assess the
differential in secondary earnings related to different levels o f educational achievement (proxied by the
number o f secondary cycle terminal exams passed); and (c) apply the resulting "quality premium" on
secondary education earnings to all graduates (including the new graduates produced by increased access
and/or decreaseddrop-outs). Given this, the analysis still underestimates, however, the projects' benefits,
since higher secondary enrollment will also bring a series o f social benefits (such as the increased social
cohesion produced by enrolling youth prone to be involved in risky and anti-social behaviors) which
cannot be exactly quantified. Additionally, even if the access components of the program do not
significantly increase overall enrollment but do result ina more sensible distribution o f enrollment across
schools (like in St. Kitts and Nevis), there will still be significant social benefits, again difficult to
quantify, from facilitating accessto better schoolsto disadvantaged students. Finally, onthe cost side, the
analysis attempts to estimate, as precisely as possible, the capital, recurrent and opportunity costs o f the
projects.

Table 2 shows that inthe case o f St. Lucia, the net present value (NPV) i s US$25.8 million and the rate o f
return is 28%, while in the case of St. Kitts and Nevis, these numbers are respectively US$14.7 million
and 35%. The results were checked for robustness to alternative values of the critical variables. In
conclusion, for these two countries, the project is viable ineconomic terms.

2. Financial (see Annexes 4A, 4B, 5A and 5B):
 Fiscal Impact:
The main objective o f the fiscaVfinancia1 impact analysis i s to provide a brief public expenditure review
o f the education sector for all countries and to assess whether the financial burden o f the project is
manageable. The expenditure review makes it possible to detect the priority given to education in the
countries through the analysis o f the latest education budget estimations, and to detect any efficiency
issue through an analysis of expenditure composition, pupil-teacher ratios and unit costs. On the basis o f
the macroeconomic situations o f the countries and the latest education budget estimates, future education
budgets are then projected and the impact o f the projects' capital and recurrent costs on these budgets
assessed. This exercise was carried out for St. Lucia and St. Kitts and Nevis (see Annex 5), showing
acceptable financial burdens, all the more ifwe take into account the small size of these economies and o f
the overall education budget. On average, duringthe implementation period, total project costs amount to
6.3% o f the total education budget in St. Lucia and to 6.1% in St. Kitts andNevis, falling to 1.9% in St.
Lucia and 0% in St. Kitts and Nevis inthe operational period. Finally, the efficiency analysis helped to
determine some o fthe baseline and target indicators o fthe projects andassess different projects' recurrent
costs scenarios (based, for instance, on alternative pupil-teacher ratios) which, in turn, lead to different
financial implicationsand economic returns of the projects.

3. Technical:
The project is addressing two major issues: (a) a knowledge gap between the subject matter beingtaught
and the knowledge and skills required for the countries to be competitive and to diversify; and (b) a
disconnect between the school culture and youth culture, where school i s not attractive to youth and does
not effectively address their problems. The school environment i s not conducive to change due to
traditional teaching and a rigid curriculum and examinations structure. The question i s whether the
physical investment made by the project will be sufficient to change the school. The project design will
addressthis indifferent ways:
     ..  School-based improvementprojects will stimulate school community participation.
         Extra-curricular activities will be designed and implementedby and for the youth.
         Regional curriculum reform and the evaluation o f examinations and secondary education
         certificationwill be addressedby CXC and OERU inconjunction with the program.




                                                      22

    .    Networkingwill foster communication between teachers, schools, district offices andthe ministry
         and between islands to increasecollaboration, knowledge sharing and quality o f supervision.

4. Institutional:
The PMUs have shown reasonable capacity to handle the BERPs and the CDB-financed project. The
issue i s not whether they are capable o f implementing a new project (in terms o f procurement and
disbursement) but rather whether the MOE will be able to promote qualitative change at the school level.
A core group of only four or five people in each MOE has been exposed to international experiences.
Substantial technical assistance will be needed to bridge the knowledge gap and provide training to a
wider audience.

4.1 Executingagencies:

The Ministry o f Education units responsible for components o f the Basic Education Reform Projects
(BERP) in St. Lucia, Dominica and Grenada and those responsible for the CDB-financed project in St.
Kitts&Nevis have demonstrated satisfactory implementationcapacity and commitment to the delivery of
the program. The projects have strengthened the institutional capacity of the MOE in each country and
have improvedthe sector's strategic planning and analytical skills.

4.2 Project management:

A permanent ProjectManagement Unit(PMU) hasbeenestablished already withinthe MOE institutional
framework under the BERPs and in St. Kitts under the CDB-financed project. The PMUs are fully
integrated into the MOE and have gained considerable experience duringimplementation o f the recently
closed projects. There i s atrained core staff with experience in implementing Bank-financed projects that
will assume responsibility for the proposed project. Staff now have anappreciation o fBankrequirements
and procedures on matters that require prior review and those related to disbursements of hnds. The
experience has taught them valuable lessons about staff complementation, functions and organizational
structure for effective and efficient project implementation. The professional handling o f project accounts
and the meticulously kept documents, expenditure details as well as the timely production o f reports has
been achieved under BERP.          The PMU for the St. Kitts and Nevis project was also analyzed and
determined ready for implementationo f a Bank-financedproject.

4.3 Procurement issues:

The Bank procurement specialist: (a) fully reviewed the draft procurement plans for St. Kitts and Nevis
and St. Lucia, included inAnnexes 6A and 6B; and (b) carried out a procurement capacity assessmento f
the forthcomingPMUsandMOEs(implementing agencies). The assessmentreviewedthe organizational
structure o fthe proposed Project and found itto be satisfactory inboth cases.

St. Kitts and Nevis

The main risks identified in the assessment for St. Kitts and Nevis include: (i)lack o f national
procurement rules and procedures; (ii)    inexperience o f staff with World Bank procurement planning and
procedures (although they have successfully implementeda CDB project); (iii)    limited number o f staff for
the PMU; (iv) the possibility that the MOE may not select a consulting firm with adequate qualifications
to assist the PMU in the procurement and management o f civil works contracts; and (v) possible delays
on the design o f school expansions due to lack o f information on existing schools. A plan to address
these risks is included inthe PCA report and was agreed upon by the MOE (see Annex 6Afor details and
implementation schedule). The overall project risk for procurement is AVERAGE. The project is
ELIGIBLEfor FMR-based disbursements on procurement reporting grounds inthe view that the project

includes the implementation o f a Management Information System. However, SOE-based disbursements
will be used, basedonthe inexperience o fthe PMUwithBank-financedprojects.



The main risks identified in the assessment include: (i)the selection of a consulting firm with adequate
qualifications to assist the PMU in the preparation of bidding documents, the carrying out o f bid
evaluations and the management of the works contract; (ii)limited staff exposure to Bank procurement
procedures and procurement planning; (iii)   lack of standard documents for the procurement o f works and
goods underNCB and shopping methods and for the evaluation of bids for works/goods and services; (iv)
insufficient staff for project accounting; and (v) inadequate facilities for project filing. A plan to address
these risks is included inthe PCA report and was agreed upon by the MOE (see Annex 6Bfor details and
implementation schedule).       The overall project risk for procurement is AVERAGE. The project is
ELIGIBLE for FMR-based disbursements on procurement reporting grounds in view that the project
includes the implementation o f a Management Information System. However, SOE-based disbursements
will be used, basedonthe uncertain appointment o fthe experienced project accountant.

The Bankprocurement specialist: (a) fully reviewedthe draft procurement plansfor St. Kitts andNevis
and St. Lucia, includedinAnnexes 6A and 6B; and(b) carried out a procurement capacity assessment o f
the forthcoming PMUs and MOEs (implementing agencies). The assessment reviewedthe organizational
structure o fthe proposed Project and found itto be satisfactory inbothcases.

4.4 Financialmanagement issues:
Financial arrangements for St. Kitts andNevis and St. Lucia are includedbelow and inAnnex 6A and 6B,
since they are the two countries to initiate the proposed program. Similar arrangements will be ensured
for the other countries as theyjoin the program.
St. Kitts and Nevis
The Project Management Unit (PMU) is adequately staffed and there is an appropriate segregation of
duties withinthe P M U and MOE to ensure the effective and efficient management o f all resources. The
P M U i s responsible to submit financial reports to various departments and divisions in the MOE and
MinistryofFinance and Planning(MOFP) on amonthly basis, andwill report to the Bankon a quarterly
basis through the submission o fthe financial monitoringreports.
To facilitate the disbursement o f funds, the GOSKNMOFP will establish a Special Account (SA) in a
commercial bank acceptable to the Bank, to be operated by the MOE (PMU) under terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank. The project will be audited annually, including a review o f procurement by an
independent audit fm acceptable to the Bank. Project audit arrangements also include half-yearly
special purpose audits to review the community-based component o f the project. Details o f all financial
management arrangementsmay be found inAnnex 6A.

5. Environmental (see Annex 7):                     Environmental Category: B (Partial Assessment)
5. I Summarize the steps undertaken for environmental assessment and EMP preparation (including
consultation and disclosure) and the significant issues and their treatment emerging from this analysis.

St. Kitts & Nevis and St. Lucia have identified the sites for each of the new schools, based on poverty
assessmentand school mapping data. As the construction of schools has environmental implications, the
islands are small and there are environmental issues regardingthe type of construction (hurricane proof)
and location, each borrower was asked to carry out for each school an assessment of the environmental
impact (EA). The EAs for St. Kitts and St. Lucia have been reviewed and cleared by the Bank and are
available at the Info Shop and in St. Kitts and St. Lucia. A general framework for the environmental
assessmentof land sites and construction in all other countries will be drawn up in collaboration with the
Bank's Quality Assurance Team (see Annex 7).

5.2 What are the main features o f the EMP and are they adequate?

The EA and general framework address all relevant issues. An EMP is therefore not necessary.

5.3 For Category A and B projects, timeline and status o f EA:
                    Date of receipt o f final draft: March 2002 (St. Kitts)
                                                     May 2002 (St. Lucia)

5.4 How have stakeholders been consulted at the stage of (a) environmental screening and (b) draft EA
report on the environmental impacts and proposed environment management plan? Describe mechanisms
of consultation that were usedand which groups were consulted?

In St. Kitts and Nevis, the MOE and the Ministry of Environment carried out the EA together, in
consultationwith the Government's PhysicalPlanning Unit, local architects and community leaders.

In St. Lucia, the MOE and the Ministry o f Planning carried out the environmental assessmenttogether in
consultation with local architects and community leaders.           The Population has been consulted in
particular on the issue of transportation cost. The environmental assessment has been disclosed to the
public through a website where everyone can access. A press release did inform the public that the
environmental assessment is available inthe Ministry of Education on a notice board.

5.5 What mechanisms have been established to monitor and evaluate the impact o f the pro-jecton the
environment? Do the indicators reflect the objectives and results o fthe EMP?

There are no anticipated adverse impacts from school construction, and environmental guidelines for
contractors have been established.

6. Social: (See Annex 8)
6.1 Summarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes

I n order to appraisethe project, a social assessment was carried out inDominica, St. Kitts & Nevis and St.
Lucia. The key topics for the assessmentwere based on expressedconcerns by the countries:




                                                     25

        ..  Why do students drop out beyondcompulsory education, especially boys?
            Why are there highlevels of underachievement?
        ..  How can these trends be changed?
            What i s the magnitude o f social problems among school-aged youth?
            What can be done to make the school environment more attractive?
            How can the curriculum be revised to make courses more relevant to students' interests and
            needs?

The answers to these questions came from the students themselves and have guided decisions regarding
teacher training, curriculum content and implementation, purchase of new pedagogical equipment and
materials, and development of school development projects, school-based improvement projects and
youth-at-risk activities (see Annex 8for a description of the methodology and outcomes).

6.2 ParticipatoryApproach: How are key stakeholdersparticipating inthe project?

All countries have prepared a long-term education plan, conceived through a widely
participatory approach involving stakeholders from across the education community (parents,
students, teachers, principals, teacher union and principal association representatives, Ministry
officials and others). In addition, each country has arranged meetings with secondary school
principals to review drafts o f the project proposal, and in St. Kitts & Nevis, sub-committees
comprising teachers, principals and private sector representatives have prepared the detailed
proposals for some o f the planned project initiatives. In St. Lucia, principals o f secondary
schools and Education Officers will continue to be involved in monitoring project
implementationthrough the formation o f a special advisory body.

Each secondary school will draw up a school development plan, discussed with the community,
and will implement a school-based improvement project. In addition, students will define and
manage extra-curricular activities and events.

6.3 How does the project involve consultations or collaboration with NGOs or other civil society
organizations?

As mentioned above, the consultation process included a cross-section of the entire national population,
including NGOs, the church, teacher unions, principal association representatives and others. Inaddition,
NGOs were consulted regarding ongoing programs for youth at risk, and efforts will be made to establish
stronger ties betweenNGOs and schools, ifappropriate.

6.4 What institutional arrangements have been provided to ensure the project achieves its social
development outcomes?

The project includes the organization and provision of student support services, including remedial
assistance to students with learning difficulties, strengthening of counseling services in school, school
improvement projects and extra-curricular activities for youth-at-risk.

6.5 How will the project monitor performance interms of social development outcomes?

The MOEswill provide an indicator which shows whether access has been achieved inthe transition from
primary to secondary education, based on the socio-economic origin of the students. Enrollment statistics
will also be provided by gender to ensure that access is available to girls and boys. In addition, equity
indicators have been developed individually for St. Kitts and Nevis and St. Lucia (see key performance
indicators in SectionA.3.).

7.2 Describeprovisions made bythe project to ensure compliance with applicable safeguard policies.
An environmentalassessment was carriedout inSt. Kitts, as described above, andassessments ofthe land
sites in St. Lucia were recently completed, usingthe framework designed by the Bank. This framework
will be usedby all other countries thatjoin the program.
InSt. Kitts, two farmers were usinga smallpiece ofthe landsite for the new school. They were not living
there and have no lease arrangements on the land. Nevertheless, the Ministry o f Agriculture, Fisheries,
Cooperatives, Lands and Housing has consulted them concerning their interest to continue farming and
has committed to assisting them in finding land o f comparable quality. In St. Lucia, there are no
resettlement issues for the two land sites selectedfor school construction. Dueto the sizeable investments
inschool construction for this program, a resettlement framework will be included as part ofthe above-
mentioned environmentalframework.
F. SustainabilityandRisks

1. Sustainability:
A fiscal impact analysis ofthe projects was undertaken inboth St. Luciaand St. Kitts andNevis, showing
generally acceptable financial burdens for the countries. On the basis o f realistic growth rate and
education budget projections, which take into account the current macroeconomic situation o f the
countries, it was determined that total projects' costs will stay within a 6% range o f the total education
budgets in both countries during the implementation period. Similarly, it was also determined that the
incrementalrecurrent costs o fthe project in St. Luciawon't exceed 2.4% o fthe future projected recurrent
education budget, while the incremental recurrent costs of the project in St. Kitts will represent a
negligible share (basically 0%) o f the projected recurrent education budget. Finally, it is expected that
both projects will bring more efficiency into the education sectors through increases inthe pupil-teacher
ratios and in the share of non-salary recurrent education expenditure. This will ultimately make both
education sectors more financially sustainable.

                 Annex 2A: Detailed Project Descriptionfor St. Kittsand Nevis

                               OECS EducationDevelopmentProject

The education strategy o f St. Kitts and Nevis has been formalized in its Long Term Education Plan
("Learning and Growing", 1998) covering 1998-2011. In secondary education, some o f the main
recommendations are to: (a) enhance school access in rural areas; (b) improve the teaching and learning
process, particularly in the delivery o f the science and technology curriculum; (c) enhance the learning
environment o f the school through improved guidance and counseling services, and more extra-curricular
activities, physical education and sports and (d) increase the interaction between school and the world of
work.

    ..
The general objectives of the proposed project areto:

         Increase access andequity insecondary education, particularly inpoor rural communities.
         Improve the learning environment in secondary schools through the provision of better facilities
         for teaching and learning, better trainedteachers inspecialist areas, and curricula and programs to
    .    prepare students for coping ina technological society.
         Increase the capacity o f schools to provide for the needs and interests ofyouths.
         Upgrade the planning, management and information processing capabilities in the Education
         System.

Inthe pursuit of these objectives, the project will seek to improvethe efficiency ofthe education system
through better allocation and utilization o f both physical and human resources. Every effort will be made
to improve the student-teacher ratio in secondary schools by redeployment o f teachers wherever possible.
Teacher appraisal systems and teacher-training initiatives will be closely related to project curriculum
reform initiatives, including initiatives in science and technology. Curriculum reform efforts will also be
closely linked with other curriculum developments occurring in the system, including the reforms
associated with the National Certificate o f Education (NCE) and efforts to improve teachers' classroom
assessment practices. The objectives under the project would be achieved by implementingthe following
three project components:

By Component:

Project Component 1        - US3.04 million
IncreasingEquitableAccess:

1.1 Constructionof a new secondary schoolin St. Kitts and provisionof equipment, furnitureand
     materials(US$2.49 million)

One of the objectives o f the Long Term.Education Plan for the Ministry o f Education (MOE) i s to
improve access to secondary education in rural communities. Under this component, a new secondary
school will be builtat SaddlersVillage to serve the feeder primaryschools o f Estridge, Edgar T. Morris at
Tabernacle, Saddlers and Dieppe Bay. The first three schools feed into Cayon High School, with three
other primary schools, while students from Dieppe Bay School currently transfer to Sandy Point High
School.

Issues of access and equity have emerged as they relate to the extent to which the Cayon HighSchool can
adequately serve all the children in its current catchment area. Cayon High School serves the largest
geographical area when compared to the other secondary schools in St. Kitts. Children travel to school at
mornings on school buses. However, the,distance between these villages and the Cayon and Sandy Point
HighSchools require that childrenhave to be onthe roadfrom about 7:OO a.m. to catch the school buses,



                                                      44

arriving to school before 7:30 a.m. School does not begin until 8:30 a.m., so school children are waiting
around for the start o f school, one hour later, and there i s too much opportunity for them to engage in
mischief while they wait.

The results o f a recent Poverty Assessment Report -St. Kitts andNevis show that the highest percentage
o f persons who have not attained any form o f education certification is found in the poor rural
communities. Two o f the parishes served by the Cayon High School were reported to have the highest
rate, with the village o f Saddlers beingthe largest community inone o f these parishes. These areas are in
the heart o f the sugar lands in St. Kitts and hence, the majority o f parents in this area are sugar estate
workers and are inthe low- income bracket. A large percentage o f children from the Estridge to Dieppe
Bay feeder schools often end up inthe lower streams or transfer to Form 1 at the high schools, as they
compete with students from other feeder schools for placements. The self-fulfilling prophesy then steps
in. For example, lessthan 30 % ofthe students who transferred from these feeder schools to Cayon High
School in 1996 were entered for CXC Exams at either the Basic or General Proficiency levels inthe June
2001 examinations. The majority hadto settle for the national school leaving examinations, thus affecting
their possibilities for further study or access to well payingjobs inthe labor market.

Although inadequate teacher training may account for some o f the problems experienced in dealing with
these children, many o f the problems cannot be addressed merely by teacher- training interventions. It i s
reasonable to suggest that provision o f a secondary school to service these primary schools would provide
improved community participation in their children's school activities and improved self-esteem for the
students, leadingto improved performance.

A school mapping exercise showing the number of students who entered kindergarten in each feeder
school from 1996 to 2002, and the number o f students transferring to the Cayon and Sandy Point High
Schools during the said period, shows that the roll o f the new secondary school can be estimated to be
maintained at between 350 to 400 students inForms One to Five.

Finally, provision of a new secondary school will relieve much o f the pressure at Cayon and Sandy Point
High Schools. Following the passage of Hurricane Georges in 1998, a number of temporary wooden
classrooms were built. Some construction work is currently being undertaken to address this problem.
The provision of a new secondary school would enable some classroom space to be freed up to
accommodate new initiatives such as the establishment o f learning resource centers and other space
requirements for special purpose rooms, resulting from curriculum reform efforts under this project.

Project Outcome: A new secondary school in Saddlers will be constructed for approximately 350
students. The school design will follow approved international design guidelines and space standards.
The average areaper student would be between 70 and 80 square feet. The school will be fully furnished
and equipped, with learning spaces and layout to reflect the requirements o f OECS curriculum reform
initiatives for secondary education. The tentative proposal i s as follows:

1.2. Introduction of cafeterias insecondary schools in St. Kitts (US$0.55 million)

Presently, the School Meals Programme caters to all students at the primary level (4,630 students) and
100 students at the secondary level. The current situation in secondary schools has led the GSKNto the
conclusion that there i s a need to extend the coverage of the School Meals Programme to include all
secondary schools in St. Kitts. This will not only help to improve nutrition but also assist parents who
work inthe cane fields and onthe industrialsites inproviding one meal each day for their children.

In order to facilitate the expansion of the School meals Programme, the Government is seeking to
construct six (6)cafeterias inthe six (6) highschools inSt. Kitts.

Project Outcomes:

Financing for this component will be used to construct or refurbish existing spaces as cafeterias, and to
provide basic equipment and furniture for efficient management and use. The School Cafeterias in the
highhecondary schools aim to provide students with a well-balanced meal at least once per day.
    .
Specifically, the outcomes will be the following:

        To provide meals to students whose families are in the Low Income bracket; it is estimated that
        about 180 students would receivedfree or subsidized meals;


                                                   46

     ....To increase the likelihoodthat students would stay onthe schools' compound;
         To help inthe decrease ofmalnutrition among our youth;
         To provide the means by which students would gain work experience and exposure to business
         processes, by participatinginthe runningo fthe cafeterias, and
         To provide gainful employment inthe private sector.

Implementationarrangements:

The Ministry o f Education will be ultimately responsible for operation of the cafeterias. A small
committee consisting o f a Cafeteria Coordinator, a Dietitian and two other persons would vet applicants
(school or private person) as to determine their capacity to operate the cafeteria and would supervise the
daily operation and quality. Mechanisms will be established to provide the necessary guidelines for
management and supervision of the cafeterias, either as privately-run or school-run business
enterprises.

The Government o f St. Kitts and Nevis will establish a fund to subsidize meals for the students who may
need such help. Eligibility criteria would be developed ($2,000 or less income per household) and would
include the inputs o f Guidance Counselors and the Community Affairs Department.              Recovery co
(estimated at US$76,000) would be collectedfrom the rental of the Cafeteria facilities that will cover part
o f the cost of the subsidized meals (estimated at US$108,000 total for the six schools).

      and other resource materials; training of trainers/ educators in select areas, including
      fellowshipsand developmentofa coordinatedTeacher appraisalsystem(US$0.44 million)

This component will be implemented in close collaboration with the other OECS project countries.
Activities will be centered around the development o f a curriculum for the lower secondary level, the
basis o f which was agreed at a Sub-Regional Workshop on Curriculum Reform held in St. Lucia in
February2002.

The agreed common core curriculum and electives at the lower secondary level comprised o f seven core
subjects and three common elective areas. Integration o f science and technology into the delivery o f the
curriculum will be o f paramount importance. Actions will be taken to develop,and implement the core
     ...
and elective curriculum, once the nature, form, and content is determined. Itwill be necessaryto:

         Seek endorsement o fthe key areas from all stakeholders.
         Elicit suggestions on details o f content and delivery o f the programme. The aim i s improvement

     .   o fthe quality o f education at the secondary level.
         Seek ratification at the policy level regarding linkingof curriculum reforms with other initiatives,
         such as the developments for the N.C.E. reforms.
         Have technical people work out the following details:
                  (a)      team writing o f curriculum

         A wide range of texts and other teaching - learningresources, including technological resources,
         that are available for to support curriculum implementation.

Five o f the core subject areas namely English, mathematics, Social Sciences, Integrated Science and a
Foreign language require teachers with specialist training inthe area. Fellowships will be provided for at
least one person in each of these areas to receive regional training up to post-graduate level. These
persons will serve as trainer of trainees (teachers in the above-named core areas in each secondary
school).

The other two core subject areas would be Information Technology and Personal development.
Information technology will requiretraining for one specialist (8 schools) and in service training for all
                                                                                       -
other teachers who are not computer literate (approximately 200). Personal Development will include
Physical Education, healthand family Life Education, Moral and Religious Instruction, and Guidance and
Counseling. These will involve various teachers who will require in-service training.

The common electives will be Integrated Technology, the Creative and Performance Arts, and a second
Foreign Language. Each elective will require persons trained as trainer o f trainees who will provide in-
service training for subject specialists teachers. Thirty-two (32) teachers and 8 principals will be trained
as resource persons inthe management anduse of LearningResource Centers and new Science labs.

A teacher appraisal systemwill: (i)  ensurethat an appropriate and effective system i s available for the
evaluation ofteacher and (ii)   provide a continuous assessment o fteachers.

ImplementationArrangements:

The Curriculum Development Unit inthe MOE will be in charge o f the curriculum development and the
training o f teachers. Curriculum writing teams will be established and will work on preparing guidelines
for the core subjects and electives. The project provides for purchase oftextbooks and other resources for
the delivery o f curriculum, as well as in-service teacher training workshops andfellowships.

For the teacher appraisal system a pilot scheme will be implemented in May 2002 and will target all
teachers in primary and secondary education. Annual training seminars will be organized to update all
new teachers on the appraisal system.        Software would be developed to integrate the results o f the
appraisal o f the teachers and the information about the results will be maintained. The Personnel Officer
will be incharged ofthe implementationo fthis component.

2.2. Establishment of Learning Resource Centers and Expansion and Upgrading of
        selected learningspaces, includingscience and IT labs, in seven (7) schools in St. Kitts
        and Nevis (US$1.81 million)

Learning Resource Centers

Continued enhancementinthe learning environment o f the existing seven secondary schools is a priority.
It is an age when fundamental change is taking place inthe nature of literacy and instruction; and where
new technologies are transforming the way students acquire literacy and literacy instruction. The
establishment of Learning Resource Centres in each secondary schools will provide an environment for
the synthesis o f learning experiences through the variety o f multi-media resources, equipment and
facilities that will be brought to bear on the teaching-learning situation. It i s a recognizedfact that digital
communication and multi-media technologies bringto the students, the world o f knowledge unavailable
through the traditional print or classroom libraries. The availability of free Internet access from Cable



                                                      48

Television provider (in St.Kitts & Nevis) makes such access possible. Such learning spaces will facilitate
every pattern o f instruction and seeks to cater to the differing individual intellectual capabilities, abilities,
interests, levels and needs. Thereby encouraging the adaptation of the teaching-learning processes to the
new realities inthe changing demands ofthe school curricula.

Curricular demands that require new forms o f critical thinking, reasoning, composing, navigational
knowledge, strategies, and skills as requiredfor efficient use o fthe computer, which i s now a familiar tool
inthe schools' learning environment.       The presence o f Learning Resource Centers would promote the
development o f skills and competencies that encourage the mastery o f research skills. This i s an essential
skills-need emerging with the departure from traditional approaches to teaching and learning; and that
came with the advent o f current curricular School BasedAssessment andthe Researchtype assignments.

This diversity o f multi-media resources with their accompanying equipment, organized for easy
accessibility and use; and the presence o f qualified staff, would combine to offer maximum opportunities
for learning. Their efficiency and effectiveness is assuredas the need for the existence o f trained staff to
man these spaces and offer professional and meaningful service to users has been accepted. The need for
this level of training and professionalism has been recognized as there has been a Government
commitment to training of staff. Eight (8) librarians and eight (8) information technology specialists will
be trained through a combination o f on line training andtraining sessions abroad.

Expansion and upgrading of learning spaces

The present situation reveals that most o f the learning spaces need to be redesigned or relocated to meet
the demands of a developing society and a discriminating clientele. Further, in order to be functionally
literate and numerate, computer literate and inessence to be empowered with the knowledge, attitude and
skills of the 21st century, requires that all our people be exposed to the necessary tools and become
connected.

The development andre-organization ofthis sector is most important, especially when one recognizes
that the nature o ftoday's workplace i s different from that o f the past. The workplace i s now characterized
by global competition, newtechnologies, andnewmanagementprocessesthat require workers to have
critical thinking, problem-solvingand communication skills as well as advanced levelsjob skills.
Therefore, the upgrading, expansion andre-equippingo f the various learning spaces are needed at this
timeto contribute andto support this refocusingof efforts inregardsto teaching and learning. Itwill
facilitate empowerment, by exposingour young people to the environment and tools o f the industryand
the future. This requires inessencethat the principals, teachers, students, parents andthe community
recognize the school as Quality Assurance Centers. Further, it i s thought that parity must exist at all levels
thereby affording students sustainedtechnologicaland scientific support and opportunities.

Implementation arrangements

The PMU, in coordination with the Committee who prepares this component, will be in charge o f
implementation. The Committee will work with school principals to establish the design, set-up and use
o fthe spaces.

2.3.   Elaboration of Program to Support Participation of Disadvantaged Students, and related
       teacher development inspecialeducation (US%0.29million)

The Learning Enrichment Centres (LEC) in the primary schools and the Learning Suppoflemedial
Departments (LRD) inthe secondary schools presently all aim to support students who are experiencing
learning difficulties especially inliteracy and numeracy. LEC and LRD lack adequately trained personnel
andresources.

The project will support the training of a RemedialRecovery Tutor for the new EarlyIdentificatiodEarly
Intervention policy from OERU and the Reading Recovery Programme. This will enable students to
receive more structured support at Grade 1and therefore returnmore studentsto mainstream classes.

The LRD aim to provide support inall curriculum areas but again with special emphasis on reading. To
thisendthe project will provide areading programand additional resourcesfor eachschool.

Inaddition the project will provide in-service training inLearning Support for teachers of bothLearning
Support and mainstream classes and encourage the development o f more effective Learning Support
through additional training for School Management Teams and Education Officers. The training o f
specialists in Specific Learning Disabilities and Mathematics Recovery will provide diagnostic
opportunities and support for individual students through the development o f Individual Education Plans
(IEPS).

Project outcomes:
    .   Students from the Learning Support Departments (about 10% o f total enrollment in secondary
        schools) will receive education and training designed to meet their individual needs. About 90%
    .   o f this target group will show improvement o f two levels inthe reading assessment (MICO) per
        year.
        Students with Specific Learning Disabilities (dyslexia and dyscalculia) in both the Learning
        Support Departments andmainstream classes will be diagnosed and offered tutorial support.
    ..  Teachers (about 48) with additional skills and resources will offer early intervention to students
        experiencing readingdifficulties inprimaryschools.
        Increased security will ensurethat this investment inresources can be maintained.
        More equitable access will provide more varied learning experiences for Learning Support
        classes.

Implementationarrangements:

The Coordinator for Learning Support (a position already created in the MOE) will be in charge o f this
programme. Most o f the training will be in-service training provided within country. Three teachers will
attend university overseas to follow studies in: (i) Reading Recovery; (ii)Specific Learning Disabilities;
and (iii)MathematicsRecovery.

2.4.   Organization and provision of school-based improvement projects and extra-curricular
activities (US$0.34 million)

This component seeks to provide opportunities for each school to design school improvement projects to
address special problems that the school has been experiencing, particularly problems that relate to
students' learning. Under this component, funds will be provided annually to each school in St. Kitts and
Nevis that presents projects that have the potential for findingreal problems that are being experienced by
schools. Projects should be linked to the overall school development plan. In addition, because o f their
emphasis on the involvement o f the community in the project, school improvement projects have the
potential to promote better communication by reinforcing and increasing the level o f partnership among
the various stakeholders inthe education system.

In addition, under this component, funding will be provided to support extra-curricular activities
    ..
promoted bythe youth in,eachschool. Extracurricular activities will be designed to:

         improvethe quality o f education offeredto young people
         make the schoolthe centre for change
         fund developmental programmes geared specifically to addressing the needs of the youth sub-
         culture; those needs to be determined bythe young people themselves.

Project Outcomes:

School improvement projects and extra-curricular activities are intended to introduce a measure o f
decentralization in school administration. The objective is to strengthen the capacity o f schools to cope
with autonomy and innovationand so promote a change inthe organizationalculture ofschools.

ImplementationArrangements:

AnOperatingManual details the selection criteria andallthe implementationarrangements.

Each year each school will present one proposal for a School Improvement project (SIP) and Extra
Curricular Activities (ECA). The School Improvement Projects will be prepared by the teachers in each
school and selected by the School Management Team. The Extra Curricular Activities will be prepared
by the students and selected by the School Management Team. Projects will be selected based on the
quality of the proposals submitted andtheir capacity to motivate at risk students to remain inschool. It is
hoped that in implementing this plan, leadership potential would be developed and positive values and
mutual self-esteem among young people would be enhanced.

About US$300,000 will be available for schools (approximately $7,500 per school per year) over the five
years o f the project o f which 60% will go to School Improvement Projects and 40% for Extra Curricular
Activities.

The MOE i s responsible for the final approval o f SIPs and ECAs. The Chief Education Officer will be
responsible for supervising on an on-going basis the implementationo fthe SIPs and ECAs.

ImprovedGovernanceandManagementinthe EducationSystem

3.1. Expansion of the EducationmanagementInformationSystem (EMIS), including networkingof
     schools and E M I Straining(US$0.30 million)

The decision on the expansion of the EMIS arose out o f concern generatedthrough a study done in 1997.
Among many others, the following problems were evident:

     1.     The mechanism for providing and analyzing data on various aspects o f the Ministry's
            operations was inadequate. The ability o f the Ministry to quantify its overall investment in
            educationwas questionable. Arising out ofthiswas the question as to whether resourceswere
            equitably distributedacross schools and across levels o f education.

     2.     The extent to which teacher qualification affected or contributed to learning outcomes was
            undetermined. At the same time, performance o f students on CXC Secondary School
            Examinations and on Primary School Tests o f Standards fluctuated widely across schools.

     3.     The overall capacity for management in schools needed drastic improvement and support
            through the provision o fthe necessary infrastructure.

The Ministryrecognizes that the lack o f relevant and accurate and timely information can impede the
formulation and implementation o f appropriate and relevant policies. The Ministry also wishes to place
renewed focus and emphasis on school management.It i s with this inmindthat the Ministry has proposed
to expand the EMIS.

The expansion o f the EMISinvolves the following:
     .  The establishment o f a network linkingschools inSt. Kitts andNevis, colleges andthe MOE.
        Acquisition and installation o f one computer per school as a node on the network.
        Acquisition and installation o f software for the EMIS.
        Provision o ftraining for school officials andEMIS staff at varyinglevels o f expertise.

Project Outcomes:
     ...A Ministry-wide networkwith a server at the Ministryandaworkstation inevery school.
        EMISstaffand school officials will be appropriately trained at varying levels ofexpertise.
        Relevant, complete and current data on various aspects o f education will be provided to a variety
        o f stakeholders on a timely basis, including statistical data, budgetary and financial data,
     .  information on curriculum guidelines, textbooks, as well as other resources.
        The Ministrywill devise policies with an improvedlevel o frelevance and pro-activity.
        Communication and collaboration among education officials and among schools will be vastly
        improved.
        Schoolmanagementpolicies will be data-driven and more goal-oriented.
        The EMISwill evolve into a knowledge network supportingbothschool and Ministryofficials.

As a result of the expanded EMIS there will be: (a)        improved systematization of school planning,
including participatory school performance assessment and greater inclusion o f community participation;
and (b) improved governance through effective budget planning and management, strengthened
accountability and an increaseinefficiency o fthe education system.

The Ministry o f Education has had recent experience in managing a major capital project funded by the
Caribbean Development Bank. This i s the first World Bank-funded project to be managed by the
Ministry of Education.     The Project Management Unit (PMU) will be based in St. Kitts and all
procurement o f project goods and services will take place in this PMU. The P M U staff comprises a
Project Manager, a Procurement Officer, an Accountant, an Accounts clerk and an Administrative clerk.
The Project Manager is responsible for the management and supervision o f the operations o f the P M U
and coordination with the Nevis Coordinator and Nevis MOF representative. The Permanent Secretary

                               OECS EducationDevelopmentProject

The education strategy of St. Lucia has been formalized in its five-year "Education Sector Development
Plan (ESDP)-2000 to 2005 and Beyond," adopted in the year 2000. This plan was designed through a
very participatory approach involving the whole civil society and sought to define strategies to achieve
national, regional and international targets in education. The main objectives o f the plan for secondary
education are to (a) increase access to secondary education, reaching universal coverage by 2005; (b)
improve the quality of secondary schools through a general improvement in the facilities and the
provision of relevant support teachinglearning materials and equipment and (c) refocus on student-
centered learning and provision of classroom instructional methods, supported by appropriate space,
equipment and materials, to be directed towards meetingthat objective.

The OECS Education Development Project (OEDP) may be viewed as a sequel to the Basic Education
Reform Project (BERP), which was financed by the World Bank, the Caribbean Development Bank and
the Government o f St. Lucia. It will be implemented in tandem with the Basic Education Project 2
(BEP2) funded by the Caribbean Development Bank and the Government o f St. Lucia. The BERP has
laid the foundation for reform o f basic education provisions at the primary and secondary school levels.
The achievements of that project and the anticipated outcomes o f BEP2 will pave the way for strategic
focus on achieving the national goal of providingUniversal Secondary Education(USE).

The OEDP i s aimed at laying the basis for the attainment o f USE. The Ministryhas sought to ensure the
widest participation of stakeholders inthe conceptualization and design o f the project. The objectives to
be pursued under the OEDP are rooted in the Education Sector Development Plan for St. Lucia. The
overall objectives of the project are to improve access and equity, and to ensure greater quality and
management support for secondary education.

The specific objectives of the OEDP areto:
     0   Provide equitable access to secondary education by constructingnew schools andby expanding
         andrehabilitating select schools inunder-served areas;
     0   Improve qualityat the secondary school level by focusing on: (a) curriculum reform, teacher
         training and improved student evaluation, including continuous assessment; (b) enhancing
         learning spaces, and (c) implementing programs to support participationo f disadvantaged
         children, including social and welfare support; and
     0   Strengthen the managemento fthe sector through: (a) the establishment o f an EMIS, (b)
         capacity buildingat the district level to provide better support to the schools, (c) achievement o f
         greater equity inresource distribution among schools.

These objectives would be achieved by implementing the following project components:

IncreasingEquitableAccess

1.1. Constructionofnewschools (US$9.50 million)

This sub-component of the project seeks to provide an additional 1,400 new secondary school places.
The main activity i s the construction of two secondary schools inareas of greatest need. Decision on the
location and eventual size o f school have been based on objective criteria, which include the results o f a
School Location Planning Study, conducted by the Ministry o f Education, HRD, Youth and Sports in
2002. The recommendations were basedonthe needto reduce the current inequity in access to secondary
education, to increase the efficiency of use o f available resources and to reduce the travel costs incurred
bytraveling longdistancesto attend school.

The report on School Location Planning (see Attachment I of St. Lucia's project design in the Project
Files) identified four districts in which the need for additional secondary school places is most critical,
namely: Anse L a Raye, Gros Islet, Micoud and Dennery. These areas are grossly under-served makingit
difficult and expensive for students there to access secondary schooling. The required school places in
Dennery and Micoud will be addressed through the expansion, upgrading and rehabilitation o f existing
schools in these districts. However new secondary schools each with a capacity for 700 students are
proposed to addressthe demands inGros Islet andAnse L aRaye.

ImplementationArrangements

A feasibility study and environmental impact assessment on each site has been conducted to determine
their suitability and to delineate the cost and characteristics o f the schools. The preliminary designs will
be informed by the approved Design Guidelines for Education Facilities and the secondary education
curriculum reform developments. The Design Guidelines is expected to be completed prior to project
effectiveness and will serve as a manual o f building standards for the constructionhehabilitation o f
education facilities.

For each new school, the Projectwill finance:
     0   Feasibility and Environmental Impact Studies,
     0   Technical assistancefor architect and engineering planning and designs, and
     0   Civil works.

Tables Iand I1provide a detailed cost by accommodation schedule for the proposed Anse la Raye and
Gros Islet secondary schools respectively. Attachment VI11 o f the St. Lucia project design inthe Project
Files provides further details on the schedule o f accommodation, furniture and equipment requirements
for these new schools.

1.2. Expansion,upgradingand rehabilitationofexistingfacilities (US$4.27 million)

Part o f the effort towards achieving universal secondary education will involve the expansion o f selected
existing facilities to optimize capacity. The project will also upgrade Grand Riviere Senior Primary
School to a full-fledged secondary school thus eliminating the last vestige o f the senior primary school
arrangement.

Sections o f the existing school plants (including staff and student toilets) indilapidated conditions will be
rehabilitated and all temporary structures will be replaced (consists mainly of timber buildingson school
compounds used as classrooms). To facilitate secondary education reform, it is expected that certain
critical facilities such as science laboratories, and Learning Resource Centres will be provided in schools
where they are absent.

ImplementationArrangements

Schools are selected for extension and rehabilitation onthe basis of agreedeligibility criteria, which
include the following:
     0    ProjectedNet Enrolment Ratio byDistrict;
     0    Numberand conditionof existing school facilities,
     0    Availability o f land for extensions, and
     0    Poverty index.

The Clendon Mason Secondary School will undergo significant rehabilitation. Provision will also be
made for 105 additional places. The Grand Riviere Senior Primary School will be upgraded to full
secondary school status via significant enhancements inits programme offerings andfacilities. The school
will also be expanded to provide a total o f 700 secondary school places. Thus, through expansion and
upgrading the project will realize the creation o f 805 places at the secondary level and will complement
the constructionof new secondary schools to help realize a total o f 2,205 new school places.

Improvingthe Qualityof Teachingand Learning

2.1. Developmentof new curriculafor lowersecondary,teacher training,instructionalsupervision
     and assessment(US$0.36 million)

CurriculumReform

Curriculum development is a vital part of the set of activities designed to improvethe quality o f education
andto render the education systemresponsive to the social andeconomic needsofthe country. With rapid
socio-economic change, existingcurricula have to be revisedperiodically to bringthem into line with the
demands o fthe economy and new educational priorities.

At the upper secondary level (Forms N and V), children generally follow a standardized regional
curriculum developed by the Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC). No standardized curriculum has
been developed for the lower secondary level (Forms I- 111). Schools have by and large developed their
own curriculum for the lower secondary level. Consequently, there are significant variations among
schools in the curriculum offerings at the lower secondary level, which presently has devolved into a
fragmented curriculum structure comprising up to fourteen subjects.

The Ministry's vision for a revitalized secondary curriculum involves not only upgrading and
harmonizingthe knowledge content of the curriculum but also incorporating elements that were formerly
considered "extra-curricula" and focusing also on the development o f the appropriate attitudes, ethics and
work disposition of students in relation to the particular discipline. For example, the business subjects
should include mandatoryparticipation inthe Junior Achievers Program, work attachments, an element o f
community service, etc.

ImplementationArrangements

The Ministry is seeking to develop a standardized core curriculum for the lower secondary level. St. Lucia
recently hosted a regional workshop on the development and harmonization o f core curricula for the
lower secondary. The workshop was organized by the World Bank and involved OECS countries and the
OECS Education Reform Unit (OERU). At the same time, the Ministry i s spearheading discussions with
CXC on the possible extension of the CXC programto cover the lower secondary level.

The Deputy Chief Education Officer for Instruction will spearhead the development o f the new
curriculum in Saint Lucia in collaboration with regional efforts. Teams comprising competent teachers,
and leading educationists (including the Caribbean Examinations Council) will be formed and charged
withthe responsibility for developingthe new curriculum. Provision ofinstructional guides and textbooks
and teachertraininglorientation to new curricula will be part o f this initiative.

          and principals, selection o ftextbooks, and provision ofcourseware.
      0   Localtraining ininstructionalsupervision for Curriculum Officers andHeads o fDepartments.

In support of the new curriculum, the Ministry will institute appropriate mechanisms to monitor its
implementation. Greater effort in instructional supervision will be requiredfrom Curriculum Officers and
Heads o f Departments in secondary schools. The national examinations will be reformed to provide a
more comprehensive profile o fthe student's overall progress anddevelopment.

Teacher Training

Staff projections point to the need for an additional 90 secondary school teachers by 2006 to meet the
increase access to be provided under the OEDP. This number was arrived at on the basis o f the current
1:20 teacher-student ratio. However, actual new recruits should comprise 60 percent o f this number (54)
with the remaining 40 percent comprising teachers redeployed from primary schools. The Ministry
therefore, will upgrade the content competencies o f primaryschool teachers who will be displaced by the
constricting primary enrolment especially at the senior grades to allow for their redeployment to
secondary schools.

ImplementationArrangements

The Division o f Teacher Education o f the Sir Arthur Lewis Community College has been mandated to
coordinate all teacher education andtraining. The Ministrywill collaborate with the College inthe design
o f training programmes and the selection o f participants. The existing OECS/EDF/UWI/TLIU3
secondary teacher-training programme will be expanded to deliver some of the teacher training necessary
to support the secondary education reform initiative.

Secondary school teacher training will include inter alia (a) deepening the content base o f teachers (b)
professional development to include training in understanding how children learn, (c) integrated and
child-centered teaching, (d) work planning, (e) use of new technologies including Information
Communications Technology (ICT) in teaching and learning, and (f) identification and methods of
dealing with "at risk" students.

The OEDP will support:
         Technical assistance to design new teacher training programmes to be delivered by the Division
         o f Teacher Education. Priority funding will be provided to training programmes which support
         the objectives of the OEDP viz. implementation o f new curriculum, fostering student-centered
         learning, upgradingthe content base o fprimary schoolteachers, etc.

It is anticipated that a variety of training methods would be employed. Such methods would include full
time programmes, part-time programmes, in-service training and distance learning modes. The final



  Programme was developedby the University ofthe West Indies, underthe Lome' Conventionandimplementedby
the Division of Teacher Education of the Sir Arthur Lewis Community College. It was first implemented in St.
Lucia in 1997- 1999. The programme is deliveredthrough a combinationof face to face and distance methods and
focuses on strengtheningthe content andor the teachingmethods of secondary schoolteachers.

design will also be informed bythe recommendations of the study on teacher education conducted as part
o fthe project preparationactivities.

ContinuousAssessment

This sub-component seeks to address issues of student evaluation including continuous student
assessment, learning benchmarks and performance standards. The overall goal is to provide more focused
and relevant student assessment and international competitiveness. Currently, national assessments are
summative in nature, although most of them are meant to be diagnostic. Such assessments include the
Minimum Standards Tests (MST) taken at Grades I1 and IV and Form 111; the Common Entrance
Examinationtaken inGrade VI and the Special Examination at Grade VIII.

There i s need to reorient principals, teachers and education officers to the value o f the respective
examinations and to make greater use o f the results to help improve student learning. There is also the
needto makethe present national assessment system less centralized and less examinationoriented.

ImplementationArrangements

The Ministryis seekingto develop a new system of continuous student assessment that is underpinnedby
internationally acceptable learning benchmarks and performance standards. The role o f the Common
Entrance Examination as the main mechanism for the selection and assignment o f students to secondary
schools will be reviewed. The EvaluationsUnit o f the Ministryo f Education, HRD, Youth and Sports has
proposed a few assessment options for facilitating the transition o f students from the primary to the
secondary level. The proposed options retain some measure o f traditional testing while incorporating
elements o f continuous school-based assessment. Attachment VI o f St. Lucia's project design in the
Project Files provides further details.

At the secondary level, the content and format of the Form I11MST will be revised to reflect the new
standardized secondary curriculum for Forms I,I1and I11to be financed under this project. It is proposed
that every secondary school leaver will be provided (instead of the traditional "school-leaving
certificate") with a portfolio that contains a thorough transcript o f hidher academic and co-curricula
performance, a profile of the student's attitudes, behavior, community engagement - in other words, a
comprehensive statement o fthe student takinginto account hisher holistic development.

Further, the Ministry intends to pursue the establishment o f a secondary school completion certificate to
be awarded after completion o f a select number o f courses at the secondary level. Technical assistanceto
fully explore this mode of certification andto devise a work planfor its implementation will be funded by
the project. The Ministrywill source the funds necessaryfor the implementation o fthis school completion
certificate.

      (US$1.80 million)

Learning ResourceCentres

The Ministryo f Education i s committed to providing physical and intellectual access for all students to an
extensive range o f print and electronic resources. Learning Resource Centres will be established as a
strategy to enhance and enrich the school's curriculum, to stimulate interest and independence inliteracy,
and to encourage and develop metacognitive skills for independent and lifelong learning. It i s hoped that
the centerswillhave a combinationofessential library resourcesandinformationtechnology capabilities.

ImplementationArrangements

The OEDP will support the construction and equipping o f Learning Resource Centres in 8 Secondary
schools. The project will also help to upgrade school libraries to Learning Resource Centres in other
secondary schools. In the final analysis, every secondary school will have a Learning Resource Center,
which will hnction as an integral component of the school's learning support system. Attachment I1o f
St. Lucia's project design inthe Project Files provides a conceptual description of the LearningResource
Center along with a list of recommended inputs. The final decisions on refurbishment and equipment
needs o f schools with respect to Learning Resource Centres will be based on a Needs Assessment to be
conducted by the MOE.

Thus, under this sub-component the project will finance:
     0   Construction and equipping o f 8 LearningResource Centres, and
     0   Furniture, equipment andmaterials for upgradingschool librariesto LearningResource Centres.
     0   Training for all LearningResource Centre Managers

ScienceLaboratories

This sub-component seeks to develop in secondary school graduates a greater interest in science beyond
the classroom, including industryand research, through improved methodology and greater participation
o f the learner. Of the 19 existing secondary schools only the four new secondary schools constructed
under the BERP have fully equipped science laboratories. The Science Laboratories will be designed
accordingly to reflect: (i)  the needs o f the new curriculum; (ii) proposals and recommendations o f the
                                                                 the
Lower Science Educationconsultancy.

Concomitant with the provision o f improved science laboratories and equipment i s the need to provide
training for laboratorytechnicians in secondary schools. Training in areas such as inventory management
and preventative maintenance o f laboratory equipment and infrastructure will assist in containing costs
and ensuring the prolongeduse o fthe laboratoryresource.

ImplementationArrangements

The OEDP will support the refurbishingandequipping o f science labs inexisting secondary schools. The
final decisions on refurbishment and equipment needso f schools with respect to science labs will be made
after the MOE has conducted a Needs Analysis o f each school. Additionally, The OEDP will support the
training o f all lab technicians insecondary schools.

The OEDP, therefore, will finance:
     0   Furniture,equipmentandsupplies for science laboratories in 15 existingsecondary schools; and
     0   Training for all lab technicians insecondary schools.

Orpanizationand Provision of SuuuortServicestoSecondarv SchoolStudents

At all levels inthe education systemthere is an acknowledgement that studentsvary inthe extent o ftheir
learning, personal, social and other developmental needs. The Ministry is also astutely aware o f the
limitations on student achievement posed by these needs if they are unsatisfied. Thus, the Ministry i s
committedto the provision of adequate student support services to ensure equity o f access particularly for
poor and at risk youth inthe education system.

ImplementationArrangements

The Ministry will be re-assessing its existing compensatory and welfare programs with a view to
integrating these programmes and effecting closer collaboration with human service agencies to ensure
delivery o f maximum impact to disadvantaged and at risk students. The OEDP will assist the Ministryto
revamp its student support programme at the secondary level and to ensure better targeting of assistance
to needy students. The role o f guidance counselors and school social workers will be reviewed by the
Ministryto ensureharmonywith any new reforms incorporated inthe student support programme.

The following areas of support will be reviewed:


Educational:
-                                                         Social:
    Diagnosis o f learning impediments and                    Guidance

         monitor disadvantaged students;
    0    Localtraining o f personnel (68 staff) inschool social work, guidance, counseling and special

                                                      63

(See Attachment IV o f St. Lucia's project design in the Project Files for additional information on the
current student support programme and the proposed Book Rental Scheme.)

Designinpand testing of Literacv andNumeracv imurovement vrogrammes at theurimarv and
secondarv levels

Measures o fpupilachievement at the primarylevel are available on a national scale at Grades 2,4 and via
the Common Entrance Examination taken in Grade 6. At the secondary level student achievements are
gauged by performances on the MinimumStandards Examination (MST) taken in Form I11and on their
performance in the CXC "0" Level Examinations. An analysis o f the results o f those examinations
reveals that student achievements in English Language and Mathematics fall well below national
expectations. (See Attachment I11 o f St. Lucia's project design in the Project Files for highlights o f
students' performanceinEnglishLanguage and Mathematics inthe MST.)

Thus, it would seem that initiatives to address causes of poor student performance in Literacy and
Numeracy in St. Lucia would need to be both ubiquitous and wide-ranging. Such initiatives should be
informed by (a) a re-evaluation o f the current assessment and examination processes, (b) an increased
emphasis on Literacy and Numeracy teaching and learning and (c) a comprehensive plan that addresses
Literacy and Numeracy efforts inthe short, medium and longterms.

ImplementationArrangements

Inan effort to maximize impact, the Ministryis pullingtogether several disparate projects andinitiatives
into a single coordinated framework that will result in reduced cost to the central government. The
projects that will be pulledtogether under a coordinated framework to include:

          (i)LanguageAcquisitionandReadingIntervention:Languageprototypeworkbeingdoneby
              Dr. Hazel Simmons-McDonald with funding from the European Union inpilot schools in
              Babonneau.
          (ii)PresidentBush'sLiteracyInitiative-undertheSummitoftheAmericasinitiativewith
              fundingfrom USAIDandtargeted atthe provision ofReading Specialists at the Sir Arthur

         (iii)ReadingMonthExtravaganzaandMathematicsMonth.(Annualactivitiesorganizedbythe
              Ministryto focus onReading andMathematics inschools).

The OEDP will support the design o f a programme to raise student achievement levels in English
Language and Mathematics at both the primary and secondary levels. The final design o f the programme
will be basedonthe collective input of expert services, research and consultations with students, parents,
teachers andcurriculum officers.

The OEDP will finance:
    0   TechnicalAssistance to review the nature and magnitude o f problems inliteracy and numeracy;
    0   Design o f a programme by a select group of expert teachers and educators to addressthe causes
        o f low Literacy andNumeracy.
    0   Conducting a pilot test o fthe new programme inselectedprimary and secondary schools. This
        would involve workshops for teachers andprincipals inthe pilot schools and provision of

Beyond the pilot phase the Ministrywill seek to expand the programme with other sources o f fundingto
all primary and secondary schools inthe country. This would involve workshops and other local training
for teachers and principals. As far as possible, these training sessions will involve all teachers in the
system, at all levels of education. The workshops will be complemented by the following efforts:

                Teacher training that focuses on constructivist strategiesfor teaching and learning in
                Literacy andNumeracy, andwill enable participants to become more critical and diagnostic
                teachers.

2.4. Organizationand supportfor schooldevelopment planning.andschool-basedimprovement
      projects(US$0.46 million)

Under this sub-component of the OEDP, the Ministry is seeking to (a) foster more effective stakeholder
participation in school development planning, and (b) engender greater student involvement in school
improvement through student-managedprojects.

School DeveloumentPlanning

Under the IOB Management Training Programme4, secondary school principalshice principals and a
senior teacher from each school were exposed to various tools and techniques for undertaking school-
based SchoolDevelopment Planning. All schools are now requiredto develop School DevelopmentPlans
(SDP). Such plans generally have a three-year outlook with objectives, resource requirements and
activities delineated for eachyear.

ImplementationArrangements

The Ministry is seeking to extend the training in School Development Planning provided by the IOB to
key education stakeholders, including teachers, students, parents and school board members. As a
prerequisite, the Ministrywill seek first to assessthe impact o f the IOB management training at secondary
schools to identify deficiencies as well as implementation issues.

The OEDP will finance:
    0    Expert services and convening of a 6 - 8 week training seminar for a selected group o f teachers,
         students, parents and school board members involved inSchoolDevelopment Planning.

SchoolImurovement Proiects

School-based School Improvement Projects (SIPS) have been identified as an effective way o f improving
the quality o fteaching and learningcreating partnerships, fostering ownership, stimulating innovation and
efficiency in resource utilization in education. Currently, many schools embark on a variety o f school
projects. Such projects are largely self-financed or funded from grants and contributions from various
organizations. The practicum projects that were developed and implemented as part o f the IOB
management training for principals and senior teachers are but a few examples o f the kinds o f projects
that have emergedthrough the pursuitof school-based SchoolImprovement Projects.

The Ministryunder the OEDP will seek to buildon this culture of school-basedprojects to encourage
schools to focus on projects with the followingfoci:

     0   Improvingthe teaching and learningprocess
     0   Increasing student participation inco-curricular activities

ImplementationArrangements

An Operations Manual has been developed and details the selection criteria and all the implementation
arrangements for the coordination of support underthe OEDP for School Improvement Projects.

Eachyear each school will present one School Improvement Project (SIP) including activities to improve
the teaching and learning process and Co-Curricular Activities. The School Improvement activities will
be proposed by the school's management body in each school and selected by the School Management
Committee. The Co-Curricular Activities will be proposed by the studentsand selected also bythe School
Management Committee. Projects will be selected based on the quality o f the proposals submitted and
their capacity to motivate students.

The co-curricular activities are designed to stimulate general interest and motivation in students. Key
areas o f focus included (a) sports, (b) entrepreneurship (Linkedto the Junior Achievement Programme -
establishing mini-businesses), and (c) school clubs and groups. Participation o f students deemed
"vulnerable and at risk" should be encouraged and the co-curricular activities will be managed by the
student body with supervision by an appropriate school staff.

Under this sub-component the OEDP will finance:

     0   Implementation o f SIPs through a School Improvement Projects Support Fund. For the period
         2002 -2007 the Project will make available atotal o fEC$200,000.00 eachyear to be disbursed
         among the existing secondary schools as support to SIPs.

3.1. Improvementof the EducationInformationManagementSystem (EMIS) and provisionof
     traininginits operation (US$0.26 million)

The acceptance o f school-based management has engendered a need for more school-based planningand
decision-making. Information is key inboth planningand decision-making functions. The current trend i s
the use of computer-based Education Management Information Systems (EMIS) for the storage,
processingand sharing o f data for timely decision-making.

Moreover, a recent business process re-engineering consultancy (funded by CIDA) o f the Ministry of
Education has identified ways in which red-tape can be eliminated and cost savings achieved from the
more effective use of such technology at the school, district andMinistry levels.



                                                    66

ImplementationArrangements

The Ministrywill undertake a comprehensive review o f the implications o f expanded connectivity to the
Ministry, schools and District Offices. Experimentation with the EMIS under the OECS Education
Reform has demonstrated the advantages to be derived from the use o f this technology and the cost
savings to be realized.

An important element of this information management capability will be the spread of the EMIS to all
schools, the installation o f the SECAS (Schools Accounting program) that will bring accountability to
school funds but allow continued autonomy in their use by the schools. It will also involve the
installation o f a document management system that will facilitate the electronic exchange o f all types o f
documents and files between Ministry and District Offices and the establishment o f a teachers' database
that will form the basis o f an integrated humanresource management system.

OEDP will support management training inEMIS for school, district andcentral level management with a
focus on usingthe system for planning and for decision-making purposes

The project will cover the cost of:
    0    Evaluation and selection ofEMIS software
    0    Hardware and software for the establishment ofthe EMIS anddocument management system in
         all secondary schools, district offices and central office.
    0    Professional services to undertake system maintenance, upgrade and for trouble shootingnot
         covered under the client-support agreement.
    0    Training to all users ofthe EMIS.

3.2. Strengthening the District Offices to deliver management and instructional support and
     performance assessment to schools, and to achieve greater equity in resource distribution
    among secondary schools (US%0.61million)

Under the BERPthe Ministrywas able to establish and re-organize District Offices. There are now eight
(8) District Offices serving the districts. In this project, the Ministry will be further strengthening this
infrastructure since the results`of the business process re-engineering exercise (referred to earlier) has
identified many areas in which the role o f the District Offices need to be enhanced to provide faster and
more direct service to the schools consistent with the Ministry's objective o f becoming a "service center".

The District Education Officers are critical to the success of the OEDP due to their close attachment to
both the schools and the central office. The Ministry expects them to assist with the coordination o f the
activities to be pursued under the OEDP and ensure the forging o f strong and direct links among
implementation of the new curriculum, instructional supervision, assessment o f school performance and
school development plans. Attachment VI1 o f St. Lucia's project design in the Project Files provides a
diagrammatic representation o f the type o f linkages envisaged.

ImplementationArrangements

The Ministry intends that District OMices be adequately staffed and equipped to enable them to provide
managerial support to district schools and to provide essential Ministry services at the district level. The
Ministry fUrther expects the Education Officers to assist with the consolidation, management and
institutionalizingo fnew interventions introducedunder the OEDP.

The OEDP will support:

    0   Major rehabilitation ofthe Micoud and Soufriere District offices.

The Ministrywill seek to effect reforms inthe allocation and distribution o f resources to achieve greater
equity among schools. Among the reforms contemplated i s the application o f a formula funding for
schools during the budget exercise as proposed by the consultant on School Financing and Resource
Allocation. The implication o f the proposed formulae will be explored further with a view to modifying
them ifnecessary. Additionally, the Ministrywill institutemeasuresduringits annual staffingexercise to
ensure greater equity in the distribution o f its qualified and graduate staff among its schools while
working towards a minimumratio of graduate to non-graduate staff o f 1:l at all secondary schools. It
will also review the policy o f school funding-raising, particularly the fees charges to pupils to ensure that
they are fair and equitable andto ensure proper accountability intheir use

                Annex 4A: Cost BenefitAnalysis Summary for St. Kitts and Nevis

                                  OECS Education DevelopmentProject

Summary ofBenefits and Costs:

The project design o f St. Kitts and Nevis is quite similar to that of St. Lucia. Therefore, the methodology
used for the economic analysis i s similar as well. The benefits of these interventionshave been estimated
following the methodology described in Annex 4B with the following main simplifying (but plausible)
assumptions: (a) the St. Lucia average (and by age) yearly wage associatedwith primary and secondary
education also applies to St. Kitts andNevis'; and (b) the education production function calculated inthe
St. Lucia case i s valid also for St. Kitts, meaning that we have the same relation between educational
inputsand CXC passing rates6.

Since the "access" component o f the project in St. Kitts and Nevis does not lead to increased enrollment
(the transition rate between primary and secondary is already 100% in the country and the gross
enrollment rate is around 100%) but only to equity improvements through the construction o f a new
school in an under-served area, the difference in methodology consists inthe fact that we have explicitly
quantified the impact of the quality-enhancing measures on drop-outs. This impact i s expected to be
particularly significant given the strong focus on quality enhancement.

All the children from the primary schools of the under-served area are compelled to go to distant
secondary schools, already overcrowded, which cannot provide them with the necessary assistance, and
the children often end up being early school leavers. It i s expected that the construction o f the new
school will solve this problem. The benefits o f this equity improvement are not being quantified here.
The main focus o f the project in St. Kitts and Nevis is in quality improvements that are being pursued
through the provision o f better facilities for learning, better trainedteachers andcurricular reforms.




  We were forcedto makethis simplifying assumptionsince no LabourForcedataare collectedinSt. Kittsand
Nevis. Inany case, roughestimations made with the helpof local experts confirmedthat bothcountries have avery
similar structure ofwages, inbothrelativeandabsolute values, across educationlevels.

   This assumptionwas againmadenecessaryby the absence of detaileddataon educational inputsand socio-
  economic status per school inSt. KittsandNevis.Inany case, it is plausiblethat, inview ofthe similar levelsof
  qualityperformanceoftheir education sectors and levelandquality of educationalinputs(around50% ofthe
  schoolinfrastructure ina state ofdeprivationaccordingto roughestimates and30% oftrainedteachers), the
 relationbetweenCXC results and its maindeterminants be very similar to St. Lucia.

Benefits from higher qualitv

Reduced drop-outs

It is expected that, through its quality-enhancing measures, the project will gradually lead to decreased
drop-outs from 2003/2004, which will inturn be reflected into a higher number o f graduates. Table 4.1
shows an estimation of the total benefits associatedwith these new graduates under the assumptions that:
(a) secondary school-age population is stationary from 2000/01; (b) drop-outs in all grades decrease
gradually from 2003/04 to reach target levels in2006/07 o f 1% drop-outs inForms 1and 2 and 2% drop-
outs in Form 3'; and (c) access to Form 5 increases by 10%. Multiplying the discounted stream of
graduates by the discounted incremental earnings and summing this up, we obtain a total economic
benefit o fUS$17.6 million*.

Extra-earnings >om secondary education

Table 4.2 below shows an estimation of the total benefits associated with these increased secondary
earnings under the following simplifying assumptions: (a) the refurbishing and upgrading o f learning
spaces and the training sub-component o f the project lead, in a somewhat conservative assumption for
St.Kitts, to an increase of 20% points inthe proportionof graduate trained teachers and a decrease o f 30%
points in the proportion of infrastructure in state of deprivationg; and (b) the increase in the average
mathEnglish CXC passing rate is then related to increases in the passing rates o f one or more CXC
exams and to higher earnings (seefootnote 6 and the information presented in Table 4.3). Given this, the
2% increase in income associated with completed secondary education found in St. Kitts and Nevis
translates into a premium of US$1,300, which i s then multiplied by the total discounted number of
secondary graduates (including the new graduates produced by the decreased drop-outs) to obtain total
benefits o f US$6.7 million.

The impact o f the quality measureson secondary education earnings kicks inonly from 2005/2006 and no
attempt was made to quantify the impact o f the other quality interventions on educational achievement
and earnings.

Proiect costs and relating; costs to benefits

InTable 4.4, we report the total investment, recurrent and opportunity costs of the project and inTable
4.5, compare the total discounted benefits with the total discounted costs to obtain a Net Present Value
andEconomic Rate of Returnfor the project. The NPV is equal to US$14.7 million and the IRRto 35%.
Therefore, the project i s viable ineconomic terms.




 'The  drop-out values havebeendeterminedthroughsimple linear intrapolation.
 'Adiscountrate    of 10%is usedthroughout the analysis.
   This wouldbe the case ifwe assumethat all schoolshadthe same proportionaldecreaseof40% indeprived
 learninginfiastructure (the non-targetednature ofthe interventions, which cover all schools inSt. KittsandNevis,
 suggests this is arealistic assumption).

Sensitivitv Analvsis

Ifthe incrementinearnings dueto secondaryeducationisonly 50% ofthe oneassumedinthebasecase,
the NPV will fall to US$6 million. The point where the NPV reaches0 (or the IRR 10%) would be with
incrementalearnings reaching20% o fthe ones assumedinthe base case.

Ifthe "quality premium" insecondaryeducationis only 50% ofthe oneassumedinthe basecase, the
NPV will fall to US$l1million.

                                  OECS Education Development Project

InSt. Lucia, the mainbenefits ofthe projectlie inthe increasednumber ofsecondary graduates(produced
either through increased access or decreased drop-outs) and in substantial quality gains, which are both
reflected into higher future earning streams. The analysis attempts to quantify these benefits as well as
estimating the total costs of the project (including capital, recurrent and opportunity costs), to produce
measures of net total gain in the two countries. For St. Lucia, the analysis i s based on the lower bound
project (US$16.0 million).

Summary of Benefits and Costs:

Benefits from expanded coverage

Inthis section we carry out a standard external efficiency analysis. A standard assumption made inthe
evaluation o f investments in education i s that the increase in educational attainment will lead to gains in
the beneficiaries' productivity over their entire lifetime which will inturn lead to earnings gains over the
entire lifetime. Typically, we compute the present value ofthe increaseinearnings, assessed at the time o f
graduation, for each cohort of project beneficiaries. In Table 4.6, we present the average gross yearly
wages" for individuals with complete primary and complete secondary to obtain the increment in annual
earnings at each age produced by the different educational attainment level. We then discount the stream
o f incremental earnings to the time o f graduation using a 10% discount rate". Age-earnings profiles for
each level of educational attainment are shown inFigure 1.

The relevant benefit stream i s then obtained multiplying this figure by the number o f new secondary
graduates that the project is expected to produce each year over the next 20 years. Component 1 o f the
project is expected to create an additional 2,205 places in secondary education over the 2002-2007 time
period through the construction of two new secondary schools (both with a capacity o f 700 students), the
expansion o f existing schools (providing approx. 385 new places) and the upgrading o f a senior primary
school (providing a further420 places insecondary). Underthe followingassumptions: (a) the first school
i s completed in 2004-2005; (b) the second one in 2005-2006; (c) both schools are filled gradually class
after class'*, except from some transfer from Grade 9 o f Senior Primary School directly to Form 3 which
accelerates the speed o f school filling (both schools are filled in three years); (d) school expansion is
implementedgradually from 2004-2005 onwards and the new places are gradually filled class after class;
and (e) the senior primary school is upgraded to secondary school in2004105, we obtain a distribution in
time of new secondary graduates similar to the one shown in Table 4.7. Multiplyingthe discounted

schoolingbutthat was made impossibleby the quality ofthe datasubmitted. The St. LuciaLabour ForceSurvey
only providesdata on"mean income" interpretableaccordingto anon linear income scale (1:'Under 200' EC$; 2:
'201 399'EC$; 3: '400 799'EC$; 4: '800 1199'EC$; 5: '1200 1999'EC$; 6: '2000 3999'EC$; 7: '4000 -

use the obtainedmeanincome per age expressedaccordingto the above mentionedscale andthe standard deviation
of this meanincomeper age to estimatemeanincomesper age indollars(the nonlinearity betweenthe two scales

economic benefit o f the higher access produced by the project (US$30.3 million).

Benefitsfrom higherqualitv

The project is also planningto undertake several quality-enhancement interventions, such as rehabilitating
existing secondary schools, implementing literacy and numeracy programs, providing equipment and
materials for new and existing schools, introducing school improvement projects, developing new
curricula and providing teacher training. All these interventions have been proved to have a positive
significant impact on educational achievement in various countries according to education production
function ana lyse^'^. In the context of St. Lucia, it was possible to test the impact o f infrastructure
rehabilitation (together with the provision o f some equipment) and teacher training on secondary school
educational achievement through an education production function analysis. Table 4.8 below reports the
results of an education production function relating the averagepassing rate inthe EnglishandMath CXC
exam by secondary school to measures of teaching staff characteristics, state of the infrastructure (and
equipment) and personnel expenditure per student, after controlling for the socio-economic status o f
schools. Unfortunately, the unavailability of information on CXC scores at the student level left us with
no other option than to estimate an aggregate function at the school level, over an admittedly small
sample size. In any case, simple OLS results show that both the state o f the infrastructure and the
proportion of trained teachers are significant inexplaining CXC passing rates. An increase o f 1%point in
the proportion o f trained graduate teachers leads to an increase of about 0.70% points in passing rates,
while a decrease o f 1%point inthe proportiono f infrastructure and equipment inpoor conditions leads to
an increaseo f about 0.40% points inpassing rates14.

Ifwe assumethat the project will leadto an increaseof20% points inthe proportion ofgraduatetrained
teachers (through the training sub-component) and a decrease o f 30% points in the proportion o f
infrastructure and equipment in state o f deprivation through the rehabilitation and provision o f
eq~ipment'~, get an overall increase inCXC passingrates o f about 25% points. This increase will then
                we
translate into a higher proportion of students passing one or more CXC exams which we can relate to
higher earnings usingthe evidence presented in Table 4.10 and some specific assumptionI6. From Table
4.1 1,we see that quality-enhancing measures bringto an increase of about 2% inthe discounted average


  l3 forinstance,FullerandClarke(1994), HarbisonandHanushek(1992), Wolf, SchiefelbeinandValenzuela
     See,
 (1994) for extensive reviews o f studies assessing education production fhctions.

  l4Asmentionedabove, theseresultsshouldbeinterpreted withcautionduetothe smallsample sizeandthe
 aggregated nature o fthe data. The small sample size ledus to check the assumption that the residuals are normally
 distributedthrough ajoint skewnesskurtosis test for normality. The test ,runover model (2) that we are using,
 yielded a Chi2-statistic o f 3.02 insignificant at all conventional levels o f significance (Pr(Chi2)=0.22), leadingus
 to accept the normality assumption with all its implications. However, caution should be maintained due, as well,
 to possible endogeneity issues which would require the use o finstrumental variable techniques and/or panel data to
 improve the reliability o f the estimates.

l5This would bethe case if we assumethat the schools rehabilitated(approx. 50% o fall secondary schools) are the
ones with the current worst infrastructure andequipment andthat the rehabilitation effort leads the schools to a state
o f filly satisfactory infrastructure and equipment (proportion o f deprived infrastructure equal to zero).

 providethe same likelihood o f successacross categories; and (c) the proportional earning increase obtained on the

annual income associated with completed secondary education, or, in other words, a 2% premium on the
total discounted income associated with secondary education (equivalent to approximately US$1,300).
Multiplyingthis figure by the total discounted number of secondary graduates, we get the total benefits
associated with these quality-enhancing measures(US$22.2 million).

Proiect costs and relating:costs to benefits

InTable 4.12, we report the total investment, recurrent and opportunity costs ofthe project and inTable
4.13, compare the total discounted benefits with the total discounted costs to obtain a Net Present Value
and Economic Rate of Return for the project. The NPV is equal to US$25.8 million and the IRRto 28%.
Therefore, the project i s viable ineconomic terms.

MainAssumptions:

MainAssumptionsunderlyingthe calculation of the benefitsfrom expandedcoverage

The graduation age (and age o f entry to the labour market for the secondary school students) is taken to
be 17. This assumes that students progress throughthe schooling system ontime, entering Grade 1at age
6 and leaving Form 4 at 16. The absence of repetition in secondary combined with low repetition in
primary makes this assumption reasonably plausibleinthe case o f St. Lucia.

The drop-out rate i s taken to be about 1%annually from Form 1to Form 3, increasing to 3% from Form 3
to Form 4 and 6% from Form 4 to Form 5. This reflects the situation in St. Lucia, where there is a
noticeable increase inthe drop-out rate inthe last two years o f secondary education.

The working life o f the secondary graduates starts at 17 and goes up to 60. It i s assumed that all
secondary graduates will manage to be employed. It i s plausible that in the context of the projected
medium term growth rate of 3 to 4% and the relatively small amount o f incrementalsecondary graduates,
the labour market can absorb them all.

We also assume that the size of the expansion (385 new secondary graduates per year from 2010/2011
compared with an estimated 2,691 students graduating from secondary school each year from the same
2010/2011, or the existing secondary school population o f approx. 12,700 students) i s sufficiently small
so that we can safely assume the absence o fwage compression effects due to the incrementalgraduates.

MainAssumptions underlyingthe calculation of the benefitsfrom higher quality

The impact o f the quality-enhancing measures on secondary education earnings kicks in from 2005/06
onwards, when these measures have all been implemented and the secondary students have been able to
take advantage of them.

No attempt was made to estimate the impact o f the quality-enhancing measures on drop-out rates. It is
very likely that drop-out rates will decrease after the intervention, increasing the benefits o fthe project.

N o attempt was made to estimate the potential impact on educational achievement and earnings o f the
other quality interventions. Among these interventions, the provision o f teaching materials and the
implementation o fthe school improvementprojects are likely to have a significant impact on educational
a~hievement'~and, thus, on earnings.

    As showninseveralstudies, includingFullerandClarke (1994),HarbisonandHanushek(1992), Wolf,
 ShiefelbeinandValenzuela(1994) andDiGropello(2001).

Main Assumptionsunderlyingthe calculationof the costs

The normal entry age into the labour market is taken to be 16. The forgone income is obtained
multiplyingthe discounted new Form 5 enrollees by the yearly wage that they would have earned ifthey
were working instead ofbeing inschool.

Recurrent costs were obtained under the assumption o f a constant pupil-teacher ratio o f 19 (conservative
assumption). This implies that, overall, 54 new teachers will need to be hired (and the hiringwill start in
2004/05).

Sensitivityanalysis/ Switchingvalues of critical items:

A sensitivity (and, when applicable, a switching value analysis) was undertaken in relation to the
following crucial parameters:
        -the "pace o fproduction" o fnew secondary graduates
        -the incrementinearnings due to secondary education
        -the unemploymentrate
        -the "quality premium" insecondary education

 These are the mainresults":

     If the "pace of production" of new graduates is slower (because: (a) school 1 is terminated in
     2004/05 and school 2 is not terminated until2006/07 and (b) schools are filled in5 years instead o f 3
     due to the absence o ftransfer from Grade 9), the NPVwill fallto US$20 million.

     Ifthe increment inearnings dueto secondaryeducation isonly 50% ofthe one assumedinthe base
     case, the NPV will fall to US$9 million. The point where the NPV reaches 0 (or the IRR 10%)
     would be with incrementalearnings reachinglessthan25% ofthe ones assumedinthe base case.

     Ifthe unemployment ratewas 20% for allthe projectbeneficiaries (higher thanthe projected 15%),
     the NPV will fall to US$16 million. The point where the NPV reaches 0 (or the IRR 10%) would be
     with anunemployment rate of more than 50%.

     Ifthe "quality premium" insecondaryeducationis only 50% ofthe oneassumedinthe base
     case, the NPV will fall to US$14 million.

 It can be inferred from the above information that St. Kitts and Nevis is generally giving increasing
 priority to education, as indicated by an increasing share o f the national budget allocated to education
 expenditures (from about 12% in 1995 to about 15% in 2001) and an increase in the education
 expenditure-GNP ratio (from 4.6% in 1995 to more than 6% in 1999). However, the estimated
 consolidated 2001 budget (about EC$56 million for St. Kitts and EC$17 million for Nevis, with clearly
 over-estimated capital expenditure) appears to reverse the trend o f high real growth rates o f education
 expenditure and the 2002 budget (about EC$56 million for St. Kitts and EC$13 million for Nevis) even
 marks a decrease in nominal terms of the budget. The 2002 budget reduction is narrowly linked to the
 crisis which followed the September 11 events and, therefore, should not be seen as an indication o f a
 future trend. However, the previously already deteriorating fiscal situation o f the country (with a central
 government deficit which was projected to be around 11% o f GDP in 2000 and an increasing debt-GDP
 ratio) would have made it difficult to sustainthe past highreal growthrates of the education budget inthe
 mediudlongrun.

 While the education expenditure analysis shows that the proportion o f recurrent expenditure allocated to
 non-salary expenditures i s satisfactory in the overall education sector (around 13% on average in the
 1995-2001 time period), there i s a serious imbalance in the allocation o f resources within the secondary
 sub-sector: only 5% in the 2000 budget and 2% in the 2001 budget o f recurrent expenditures are spent
 on non-salary expenditures such as maintenance and teaching materials. It i s true that this figure i s
 underestimating the total amount of resources directed to maintenance becausethe maintenance budget o f
 the Ministry of Public Works is not considered here, but nonetheless, this proportion will need to be
 substantially increasedto improvethe quality o f secondary education delivery.

      The same analysis also shows that, inthe secondary sub-sector, unit costs are quite highin comparison to
      St. Lucia. Unit costs increased by more than 25% in real terms between 1997 and 2001. Both the level o f
      the costs and the increasing trend can be largely associated with the low and decreasing pupil-teacher
      ratio.

      b. Projections
      Assuming: (a) that the GNP real growth rate is around 3% over the 2001-2005 time period, following
      September 11 events and, above all, the fiscal adjustment that the country will have to implement to
      tackle the deteriorating fiscal situation, and 4% over the 2006-2010 time period; and (b) that education
                                                                                                         7
      remains a clear priority for the country (as recently reiterated by the Ministry o f Finance) in spite o f the
      fiscal adjustment, we can project an annual real growth rate o f the budget over the 2001-2020 time period
      o f about 3% (reflecting a moderate real growth trend). Under this scenario, total project costs will amount
      to 6.1% o f the total education budget inthe implementationperiod and 0% inthe operational one. On the
      recurrent side, the incremental recurrent costs produced by the project will represent about 0% of the
      projected recurrent budget, if we assume that this grows at a similar rate o f 3% in both the
      implementation and operational period. This should not represent an excessive financial burden on the
      MEDbudget.

From the above information, it appears that St. Lucia is givinghighpriority to education, as indicated by
a share o f the recurrent national budget allocated to education expenditures of around 2526% and an
education expenditure-GDP ratio around 6.5%. The 2001/02 estimated education budget i s increasing in
real terms (even assuming that the capital budget i s over-estimated), pursuing a trend o f the last few
years, and existing evidence suggests that the education sector will continue to be a constant priority o f
the country, maintainingpositive real growth rates.

The education expenditure analysis shows a satisfactory share o f capital and non-salary recurrent
expenditure out of, respectively, total and recurrent expenditure inthe overall education sector, as well as
a generally satisfactory (around 12%) share of non-salary recurrent expenditure in the secondary sub-
sector, which point to the production of quality education. These shares should be maintained or even, in
the secondary education case, increased slightly.

The same analysis also shows that, in the secondary sub-sector, unit costs have been decreasing over the
1994-2001 time period (by around 6% in real terms), following a gradual and continuous increase inthe
pupil-teacher ratio (even ifthe 2001 figures show a slight reversal inthis trend). A further slight increase
inthe pupil-teacher ratio would make it possible to decrease even more unit costs, increasingfurther the
share o fnon-salary recurrent expenditure.

b. Projections
Assuming that the GDP real growth rate is around 3% over the 2001-2010 time period" and that
education remains a strong priority for the country, we can assume that the education budget will grow at
a similar 3% rate maintaining the education expenditure-GDP ratio around the current 6.6%. Under this
scenario, total project costs will amount to an average o f        6.3% of the education budget in the
implementation period and to 1.9% o f the same budget during the operational period. This should not
represent an excessive financial burden on the MED budget. On the recurrent side, the incremental
recurrent costs produced by the project will represent only about of 1.3% the projected recurrent budget
(assuming this grows at a rate o f 3% as well) inthe implementation period and 2.3% in the operational
one.

Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits", published in January 1995 (revised January/August
1996, September 1997 and January 1999); and "Guidelines:Selectionand Employment of Consultantsby
World Bank Borrowers" published in January 1997 (revised in September 1999 and January 1999), and
the provisions stipulated inthe LoanAgreement.

1) Procurement methods: The methods to be used for the procurement described below, and the
estimated amounts for each method, are summarized in Table A. The threshold contract values for the
use o f each methodare fixed inTable B.

ProcurementofWorks

Works procuredunder this project would include constructiono f a new secondary school in St. Kitts, and
construction or rehabilitation o f works in secondary schools in St. Kitts and Nevis, totaling US$2.6
million equivalent. Major contracts for these works will be procuredfollowing International Competitive

estimated to cost less than US$500,000 per contract, up to an aggregateamount of U S l . 5 million will be
procured following National Competitive Bidding procedures (NCB) using standard bidding documents
agreed in advance with the Bank. Small works, estimated to cost less than US$150,000 equivalent per
contract, up to an aggregate amount o f US$400,000, may be procured on the basis of at least three
quotations received in response to a written invitation, which will include a detailed description o f the
works, basic specifications, the required completion date, a basic form of agreement acceptable to the
Bank, andrelevant drawings, where applicable.

ProcurementofGoods

Goods procured under this project would include furniture for schools and the PMU, equipment and
materials for labs, cafeterias, Learning Resource Centers and the PMU totaling US$2.5 million
equivalent. To the extent possible, contracts for these goods will be grouped into bidding packages o f
more than $150,000 equivalent and procured following International Competitive Bidding (ICB)

project management system. These services are estimated to cost US$0.74 million equivalent and would
be procuredusingBank StandardRequest for Proposals.




                                                   95

Firms
All contracts for firms would be procured using QCBS except for simple contracts estimated to cost
US$50,000 equivalent or less that would be procured using LCS or CQ up to an aggregate amount o f
US$200,000 each equivalent.

Individuals
Specialized advisory services would be provided by individual consultants selected by comparison of
qualifications   o f three candidates and hired in accordance with the provisions o f paragraphs 5.1 through
5.3 of the Consultant Guidelines, upto an aggregate amount o fUS$200,000.

Training: Training activities will include: cost o f tuition, material and traveling for overseas Post
graduate; cost o f venue, food, materials and traveling to provide and/or attend local training seminars on
new curricula, student evaluation, and Project Management. Training services are estimated to cost
US$0.3 1million equivalent and would be procuredfollowing shopping procedures whenever applicable.

School Improvement Proiects (SIP): The Loan would partially finance the cost o f goods and services
for the implementation o f demand driven sub-projects to be proposed by schools. Sub-projects are
estimated to cost US$0.34 million equivalent. Goods for the subprojects will be procured under shopping
procedures.

Recurrent Costs: Recurrent costs, such as costs o f salaries o f the PMU staff, physical facilities, and
operationand maintenance costs for the PMU, will be entirely financed by the Government.

2) Prior review thresholds: The proposed thresholds for prior review are based on the procurement
capacity assessment o f the project management unit and are summarized in Table B. Inaddition to this
prior review o f individual procurement actions, the procurement plan will be reviewed and approved by
the Bank annually.

With respect to each training program, the objective of the specific training program and the estimated
cost o f it shall be furnished to the World Bank for prior review and approval.

B) Assessment ofthe agency's capacitv to implement procurement

An assessment of the capacity of the MOE to implement procurement actions for the project has been
carried out andwas approved by the Regional Procurement Advisor on March 23, 2002. The assessment
reviewed the organizational structure o f the proposed Project and found it satisfactory.         A Project
Management Unit (PMU) reporting directly to the Permanent Secretary will carry out procurement
activities. This Unit will be composed by: a Project Manager, a Procurement Officer, a Coordinator for
works and other project activities in Nevis, an Accountant, an Accountant's Assistant and an
Administrative Assistant. The P M U will manage project procurement and funds, and coordinate project
activities among the other Divisions involved in the Project. Terms o f reference for consultant services
will be prepared by the Educational Services Division in close coordination with the Planning
Development Division. A Consulting firm will support the P M U in the design and supervision o f civil
works.

The main risks identified inthe assessment include: (i)  lack o f national procurementrules and procedures;
(ii)lack of staffwith experience inWorld Bankprocurement planningandprocedures (but have
successfully implemented a CDB-funded project); (iii)limited number o f staff for PMU; (iv) the
possibility that the MOE may not select a consulting firm with adequate qualifications to assist the PMU
in the procurement and management of civil works contracts; and (v) possible delays on the design of
school expansions due to lack o f information on existing schools. The following plan to address these
risks is included inthe PCA report andwas agreed by the MOE: By negotiations: (i)       Annex 4 o f the Loan



                                                      96

Agreement to include a statement establishing that the procurement under the Project will be made in
accordance with the Bank guidelines and following the procedures included in the Project Financial
Management and Operations Manual. By loan effectiveness: (i)       Submission to the Bank o f a satisfactory
Request of Proposals for the selection o f an engineering consulting fmto assist them inthe procurement
o f works and management of the civil works contracts; (ii)   submission to the Bank o f terms of reference
for the consulting services to be executed in the first year of the Project; (iii)
                                                                                 establishment o f technical
committees to assist the Project Manager inthe coordination o f project activities; (iv) submission to the
Bank of a satisfactory Financial Management and Operations Manual that includes standard documents
for the procurement o f works and goods under NCB and shopping methods, and Bank standard forms for
bid evaluation. During project implementation: (i)      training for the P M U staff in Bank procurement
procedures, particularly on procurement planning and procurement o f goods; (ii)appointment by the
P M U o f a consultant to assist in the design o f a modern filing system; (iii)
                                                                               after the first six months of
project implementation, revision o fthe PMU's staffing by the Bank andthe PMU.

The overall project risk for procurement i s AVERAGE. SOE-baseddisbursementswill be used, based on
the inexperience o fthe PMUwith Bank-financedprojects.

C) ProcurementPlan

At appraisal, the Borrower developed a preliminary procurement plan for project implementation that
provides the basis for the aggregate amounts for the procurement methods (per Table A). This plan was
approved by the RPA and is in the project files. At the beginning o f each calendar year, the Borrower
will update the Procurement Planwith a detailed procurement schedulefor the coming year

D) Frequency ofProcurement Suuervision

Inadditionto the prior review supervision to becarriedout from Bank offices, the capacity assessment of
the P M U has recommended one full supervision mission every twelve months to visit the field to carry
out post review o f procurement actions. Based on the overall risk assessment (AVERAGE) the post-
review field analysis shouldcover a sample o f not less than 1in 10contracts signed.

FINANCIALMANAGEMENTARRANGEMENTSfor ST. KITTS andNEVIS

Implementingentity

The Ministry o f Education (MOE) has overseen the successful implementation o f the Basic
Education Reform Project, partially financed by CDB. The MOE will be responsible for project
implementation, utilizing the structure o f the PMU established under the CDB's Basic Education
Reform Project. The PMU's experience obtained through the ongoing project has favored the
learning and execution o f financial management and audit practices that are somewhat congruent
with World Bank's respective requirements.

The PMU is responsible for the management and administration of the project, including overall
coordination and implementation of the project, coordination o f the contributions o f entities
participating inthis project, communicationwith the World Bank, procurement o f all civil works,
goods and services under the project, preparation o f progress reports, maintenance o f all project
financial accounts and preparation and processing o f applications for withdrawals o f proceeds
from the Loan.

The P M U is headedby a Project Manager, and staffed with a Senior Accountant (Treasury) and a
Procurement Specialist. The project's Senior Accountant i s presentlyresponsible for processing
payments through the government's treasury system, direct payments, and letters o f credit andhe
will be considered to be an integral part of the project management team.           The PMU has
identified a qualified accountant in the Ministry o f Finance (Budget Department) who will
assumethe day-to-day responsibilities o fthe Project Accountant.

Other areas o f the Government o f St. Kitts and Nevis (GSKN) that are key to the financial
processes are the Ministry of Finance (MOF), in terms o f treasury, control of assets, and the
project's accounting and financial information, and the BudgetingDepartment (under the MOF).
These agencies have also beenrecently examined under the Bank's CFAA exercise.

Oversight tasks are currently performed by the Auditor General's (AG) office. Based on the
preliminary findings o f the CFAA and current capacity o f the office o f the Director o f Audit, it
was evident that this office would not be able to fulfill the audit aspect o f the Bank's fiduciary
requirements and therefore it has been requested that independent private auditors be appointed
prior to effectiveness.

There will be an implementing unit on the island of Nevis, staffed with a Project Coordinator.
For financial management purposes, the procurement o f goods and services, including payment
and tracking of sources and use o f Nevis funds, will be done centrally from the St. Kitts
implementation unit. The Nevis Coordinator will be responsible for project management
activities inNevis, as well as coordinating with Procurement in St. Kitts to initiate procurement
activities and monthly reporting on project status. In addition to beingthe central location for all
procurement and accounting activities, St. Kitts will be responsible for sharing overall project
financial statements with Nevis byproviding monthly reports generatedbythe accountingsystem
and the quarterly FMRs produced for the World Bank. Counterpart funds from Nevis will be
made available into the project account in St. Kitts

Flow of funds

Procedures for flow o f funds from the loan and the required counterpart contribution will be
implemented with due regard to safeguarding project's resources (including IBRD requirements
for use o fthe special account), and ensuringtimely execution o f payments.

                                                102

Counterpart funding has not been a problem for the CDB project. The PMU submits its funding
request via the MOE, andthe approved fundinglevels are published inthe annual estimates. The
MOF (the Budget Division) also publishes a monthly update o f expenditures reported and
formally updates the budget allocations twice per year (MarcWApril and AugusVSeptember).
Surplusbalances are permitted to be carried forward on a monthly basis, andthe ministry is able
to submit a request for advance on future allocations inthe event that the project i s able to exceed
the implementation plan. The MOF will issue an annual warrant for approved funds and will
release the funds on a monthly basis (based on projections), and the budget i s normally finalized
by December 15 and is passed by December 31 for the subsequent fiscal year (January-
December).


DisbursementArrangements

The proposed loan would be disbursed over an implementation period o f about five years.
Disbursements would be made in accordance with guidelines set out in the World Bank's
DisbursementsHandbook (Le., traditional disbursement procedures).

Special Account.     The PMU will establish a Special Account in USD, in a commercial bank
acceptable to the Bank. The Special Account is only to be used for eligible expenditures under
the loan agreement. Under no circumstances may funds inthe Special Account be used to cover
the share of expenditures corresponding to the counterpart funds. Transfers from the Special
Account to other project bank accounts will only be permittedto meet eligible expenditures for a
limitedperiod of no more than 30 days.

The Bank emphasized the importance o f establishing the Special Account in a commercial bank,
rather than the National Bank or the Central Bank - due to the negative experience o f other Bank-
financed projects with the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), where the processing o f
payments and other complex disbursement arrangements(e.g., Letters o f Credits, U S Dollar bank
statements) are difficult to execute. The Bank was informed that the MOE usually operated its
project accounts ina commercial bank, and it i s expected that this arrangement will be utilized for
the proposed project as well.

For replenishment of the Special Account, the PMUwill prepare monthly (in any case not more
thanquarterly) requestsfor reimbursementofexpenditures made.

Statements of Expenditures (SOEsX Loan withdrawal applications will be supported by SOEs
for expenditures relating to contracts that are not subject to the Bank's prior review.
Reimbursement of other expenditures would require submittal to the Bank o f full supporting
documentation.

Documents in support of SOEs must be maintained by the PMU at least until one year after the
Bank has received the audit report for the fiscal year in which the loan withdrawal was made.
Such documents must be available to review by external auditors andBank staff.         '




Other procedures. Uponrequest from the Borrower and subject to the Bank's approval, payments
may be made: (i)directly to a third party (supplier or consultant) for goods, works and services;
(ii) aprocurementagent; or(iii)acommercialbankforexpendituresagainstaWorldBank
    to                              to

                                               103

Staffing

The PMU has identified a qualified Accountant within the Ministry o f Finance (Budget
Department) who will assume the day-to-day responsibilities o f the Project Accountant (part-time
position) and report to the Project Manager. The PMU has also proposed the addition o f an
Account Clerk who will mainly be responsible for preparing payment vouchers with supporting
documentation, responding to vendor inquiries and assisting the Project Accountant.           The
candidate for this position has not yet been finalized, but the person identified by the PMU has
experience working as an Accounts Clerk for the CBD-financedBasic EducationReform Project.

The Senior Accountant (Treasury Operations) will provide senior-level support and facilitate and
process requests for government funding. The Senior Accountant has benefited from a regional
training workshop on Bank procedures and requirements. The Senior Accountant is a career civil
servant and has aided the current project in processing all governmental payment requests and i s
familiar with MOFprocessesandprocedures. The Senior Accountant will also needto be trained
inthe computerizedaccounting system, as he will be act as a supervisor andwill needto obtain
the familiarity and comfort of use with the system for monitoring and supervision purposes.

Accountingand internalcontrol

Administrative procedures are currently in place to ensure that financial transactions are made
with consideration to safeguarding project assets and ensuring proper entry in the
accounting/monitoring systems. The project accounting system has the capacity to record assets,
liabilities and financial transactions of the project, and produce financial statements useful to
project management and to meetingIBRD'sfiduciary requirements.

Seaegation o f duties. The PMU's organizational structure and established procedures in the
Financial Managementloperational manual support an adequate segregation of procurement,
budgeting, payment and recording activities. The authorization to execute a transaction is the
main responsibility o f the Project Manager.       The recording o f the transaction is the main
responsibility o f the Project Accountant.      And, the custody o f the assets involved in the
transaction i s mainlythe responsibility o fthe Procurement Officer.

Accounting. The PMU's policies, procedures and system allow the recording o f transactions
under the cash basis in local currency, with classification o f expenditures by disbursement
category, project component and financing source; this is compatible with the Bank's
recommendedpractices for project accounting. The MOE's own accounting system does not have
that flexibility, which is the reason why the PMUwill keep separatetracking o f project accounts.

There has been no indicationof computerized system-related errors and this was evidenced bythe
fact that accounts are maintained by the P M U in the accounting system and exported to
spreadsheets and reconciledon a monthly basis.

Adequate documentation o f financial transactions and subsidiary records such as project financial
statements, bank reconciliation and payroll sheets, are kept up-to-date by the PMU. The PMU,
under the CDB project, i s requiredto submit monthly trial balances and account reconciliationto
the CDB Project Manager. Furthermore, the accounts and records had beenmaintainedaccording
to IBRDstandards.




                                                104

Budnetan, control. The PMU prepares annual operating plans and budgets. It does not utilize the
GSKN's FOUR GEN financial software, which is only utilized by the MOF. The PMU's
budgetary execution reports are produced each month and quarter, and formal project progress
reports are prepared semi-annually by the PMU. Other non-periodic financiavprogress documents
are produced as needed. The Bank reviewed all o f this documentation and found that it met the
minimumrequirement for financial management under OPBP 10.02, however it has not yet met
the standard for FMR-based disbursements.

For the proposed project, the projectionso f expenditures (per PAD and cost tables) will be broken
down quarterly by the PMU interms o f project component, disbursement category and financing
source. This exercise should be the basis for: (i)
                                                 the preparation ofthe annual MOE's and PMU's
budget proposal for the project; and (ii)the subsequent monitoring via quarterly financial
statements.

Payments. The payment system used by the P M U with the GSKNMOF Treasury Unit
encompasses appropriate internal control procedures, as it allows for an adequate segregation of
functions, review, recording and delivery o f documents, and monitoring of bank account
transactions.

The payment, by check or transfer, will be processedby the P M Uagainst the recordedvouchers.
Each disbursement from the ProjectAccount will require any o fthe followingtwo signatories:

          The Permanent Secretary, Ministryo fForeignAffairs andEducation
          The ProjectManager
          The Accountant General ofthe Assistant Accountant General

Written procedures. In the financial management area, a manual o f payment procedures and a
description of the accounting system have been prepared. For the new project, such documents
will be updated and complemented with other areas, such as budget preparation, distribution and
review o f financial statements, follow-up to audit recommendations, management o f subprojects,
etc. Financialmanagementprocedures will be partofthe project's OperationalManual.


Internal Audit

The P M Uwill be subject to review by the Auditor General's (AG) office. However, based on the
preliminary findings of the CFAA, the current capacity of the office of the Director of Audit
would not enable that office to fulfill the audit aspect o f the Bank's fiduciary requirements.
Although no internal auditor will be assigned to the project, the office of the Director o f Audit
may decided to perform some visits to the project, as they are usinggovernment funds.


ExternalAudit

Annual project financial statements will be audited inaccordance with International Standardson
Auditing, by an independent firm and in accordance with terms of reference (TORS) both
acceptable to the Bank. Auditors will provide audit opinions on project financial statements,
Special Account and Statement o f Expenditures (SOEs), a report on internal controls and a report
on compliance with the terms ofthe loan agreement and applicable laws andregulations.

The PMU has provided the mission with a short list of potential audit firms and will appoint the
auditors prior to loan effectiveness, with an annual contract to be renewed duringthe first quarter
o f each subsequent year.

                                                105

The PMUwill prepare, ifneeded, a planto address any issues and recommendations contained in
the audit reports. The action plan and follow-up activities will be communicated promptly to the
Bank.

The table below summarizes audit requirements:

Audit compliance. This is the first World Bank-fundedproject to be managedby the Ministryof
Education. Therefore, no audit compliance issues relevant to the proposed project have been
identified.

Financialreports and monitoring

Financial statementsand reports will be prepared informats satisfying boththe Government's and
IBRD'smonitoringand fiduciary purposes.

The quarterly financial statements for the new project will include cumulative and quarter
information on: (i)sources and uses of funds; (ii)  expenditures classified by project component
and disbursement category compared to the respective projected figures; (iii)    expenditures by
source of funds; and (iv) reconciliation o f the Special Account. The annual financial statements
will include, additionally, the scheduleo f SOEspresentedduringthe year.

For output/outcome follow-up, the new project will support the development of a Monitoring and
Evaluation System, which will serve as basis for the output monitoring section o f project
management reporting.

The PMU will incorporate all activities (project, financial, and procurement) executed inNevis,
inthe consolidatedreportingto the Bank.

Recurrent Costs: Recurrent costs, such as costs o f salaries of the P M U staff, physical facilities,
and operation and maintenance costs for the PMU, will be entirely financed by the Government.

2) Prior review thresholds:        The proposed thresholds for prior review are based on the
procurement capacity assessment o f the project management unit and are summarized inTable B.
In addition to this prior review of individual procurement actions, the procurement planwill be
reviewed and approved by the Bank annually.          The prior review threshold for consultants
contracts for both individuals and firms has been fixed at US$40,000, as this is the level above
which consultants contracts must be submitted to the Central Tender's Board o f the Ministry o f
Finance.

With respect to each training program, the objective o f the specific training program and the
estimated cost of it shall be furnishedto the World Bank for prior review and approval.

B) Assessment of the agency's cauacitv to imDlement Drocurement

An assessment of the capacity o f the PMU to implement procurement actions for the project has
been carried out and was approved by the Regional Procurement Advisor on March 23, 2002.
The assessment reviewed the organizational structure of the proposed Project and found it
satisfactory. A Project Management Unit (PMU) within the Planning and Development Division
will carry out procurement activities. This Unit will be composed of: a Project Manager, a
Procurement Officer, a Procurement Assistant, an Accountant, an Accountant Assistant and an
Administrative Assistant. The PMU will manage project procurement and funds, and coordinate
project activities among the other Divisions involved in the Project and will be assisted by a
Consulting firm in the procurement o f civil works. Terms o f reference for consultant services


                                                111

will be prepared by the Educational Services Division in close coordination with the Planning
Development Division.

The main risks identified in the assessment include: (i)    the selection of a consulting firm with
adequate qualifications to assist the PMU inthe preparation o f bidding documents, the carrying
out o f bid evaluations and the management o f the works contract; (ii)       limited staff exposure to
Bank procurement procedures and procurement planning; (iii)      lack of standard documents for the
procuremento f works and goods under NCB and shopping methods and for the evaluation o f bids
for works/goods and services; (iv) insufficient staff for project accounting; and (v) inadequate
facilities for project filing. The following planto address these risks i s included inthe PCA report
and was agreed by the Ministerof Education: By loan effectiveness: (i) PMUwill submit to
                                                                               the
the Bank a satisfactory request for a proposal document for the selection o f the consulting firm to
assist them in preparing bidding documents, evaluating the bids and managing the works
contracts; (ii)the MOEwill submit to the Bankthe Project FinancialManagement and Operations
Manual that includes standard documents for the procurement of works and goods under NCB
and shopping methods, Bank standard forms for bid evaluation; (iii) PMU will appoint an
                                                                             the
Accountant Assistant; and (iv) the PMUwill provide substantive space for project filing. During
project implementation: (i)the PMU staff will be trained on Bank procurement procedures,
particularly on procurement planning and procurement o f goods; and (ii)        the PMU will appoint a
consultant to assist inthe design o f a modern filing system.

The overall project risk for procurement i s AVERAGE. The project is ELIGIBLEfor FMR-based
disbursements on procurement reporting grounds in view that the project includes the
implementation of a Management Information System. However, SOE-based disbursements will
be used, basedonthe uncertain appointment o fthe experienced project accountant.

C) Procurement Plan

At appraisal, the Borrower developed a procurement plan for project implementation which
provided the basis for the aggregate amounts for the procurement methods (per Table A). This
planwas approved by the RPA and i s inthe project files. At the beginningo f each calendar year,
the Borrower will update the Procurement Plan with a detailed procurement schedule for the
comingyear.

D) FrequencyofProcurementSuDervision

In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the capacity
assessment o f the P M U has recommended one full supervision mission every twelve months to
visit the field to carry out post review o f procurement actions.          Based on the overall risk
assessment (AVERAGE), the post-review field analysis should cover a sample o f not less than 1
in 10contracts signed.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTSfor ST. LUCIA

Implementingentity

The Ministry o f Education, Human Resource Development, Youth and Sports (MOE) has overseen the
successful implementation o f the Basic Education Reform Project, partially financed by World Bank
Loan No. 3837-SLU and Credit No. 2676-SLU.            The MOE will again be responsible for project
implementation, utilizingthe structure o fthe PMU established under the Basic Education ReformProject.
The PMU's experience obtained through the ongoing project has favored the learning and execution of
financial management and audit practices that are generally congruent with World Bank's respective
requirements.

The P M U is headed by a Project Manager, and staffed with a Financial ManagedAccountant and a
Procurement Specialist andvarious technical specialists (the PMU compromises the core o f the Corporate
Planning Unit within the MOECL).         The project's Finance/Accounting Manager is responsible for
budgeting and disbursements, accounting, and reporting, and i s considered to be an integral part o f the
project management team.     Additional support within the MOE will be provided from a supervisor for
foreign-funded projects, who has pledged her support to assist the PMU with internal funding allocation
and budget processes, andwith internal(to the MOE) reportingand monitoring.

Other areas o f the Government of St. Lucia (GOSL) that are key to the financial processes are: Ministry
o f Finance (MOF), in terms o f treasury, control o f assets, and the project's accounting and financial
information, and the Accountant General and BudgetingDepartment (under the MOF). Auditing tasks
are currently performed by the Office o f the Director o f Audit (who operates under Audit Act No. 26 of
1988), and the findings o f the recent Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) found this
department able to fully carry out its duties - even though the department lacks a full complement o f
human resources, there has been a recent training to provide the audit staff with computerized skills to
audit modern financial [computerized] accounting systems.

Flow of funds

Procedures for flow o f funds from the loan and the required counterpart contribution will be implemented
with due regard to safeguarding project's resources (including IBRD requirements for use o f special
account), and ensuring timely execution o f payments.

Counterpart funding has not been a problem for the Basic Education Reform Project. In order to obtain
counterpart funds, the P M U submits its fundingrequest via the MOE, andthe approved funding levels are
publishedinthe annual estimates. Once the approved amount has been published, the PMUwill request
and receive counterpart funds every quarter by submitting a quarterly forecast to MOF. The MOF (the
planningsection) also publishes a quarterly update of expenditures reported an a quarterly funds forecast
as well.


Disbursement arrangements

The proposed loanwould be disbursedover an implementation period of about five years. Disbursements
would be made inaccordancewith guidelines set out inthe World Bank's Disbursement Handbook.

Special Account. The P M Uwill establish a Special Account inUSD, ina commercialbank acceptable to
the Bank. The Special Account i s only to be used for eligible expenditures under the loan agreement.
Under no circumstances may funds in the Special Account be used to cover the share of expenditures
corresponding to the counterpart funds. Transfers from the Special Account to other project bank


                                                 117

accounts will only be permitted to meet eligible expenditures for a limited period o f no more than 30
days.

The Bank emphasized the importance of establishing the Special Account in a commercial bank, rather
than the National Bank or the Central Bank - due to the negative experience o f other Bank-financed
projects with the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), where the processing o f payments and other
complex disbursement arrangements (e.g., Letters o f Credits, U S Dollar bank statements) are difficult to
execute. The Bank was informed that the MOE usually operated its project accounts in a commercial
bank, and it expected this arrangementsto be utilized for the proposed project as well.

The P M U has expressedan interest for loan funds to be disbursed to the Special Account, on the basis of
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) sent to the Bank on a quarterly basis. The financial management
system and procedures to be used for the new project follows the model established under BERP. The
mission feels comfortable that if the same financial management system and procedures are used (this
includes the involvement of the same Project Accountant), the PMUwould be eligible to use FMR-based
disbursement procedures. However, uncertainty around the appointment o f the experienced project
accountant could lead the Bankto encourage SOE-based disbursements.

For replenishment o f the Special Account, the PMU will prepare monthly (in any case not more than
quarterly) requestsfor reimbursement o f expenditures made or FinancialMonitoringReports (FMRs).

Use o f statementso f expenditures (SOEsYFinancial Monitoring Reports (FMRs).
Loanwithdrawal applications may be supported by SOEs or FMRs for expenditures relating to the
project.

Documents insupport o f SOEsRMRsmust be maintainedby the P M Uat least untilone year after the
Bankhasreceivedthe audit reportfor the fiscal year inwhich the loanwithdrawal was made. Such
documents mustbe available to review by external auditors and Bank staff.

Other procedures. Upon request from the Borrower and subject to the Bank's approval, payments may be
made: (i)directly to a third party (supplier or consultant) for goods, works and services; (ii)to a
procurement agent; or (iii)to a commercial bank for expenditures against a World Bank Special
Commitment covering a commercial bank's letter o f credit.

Staffing

The PMU has identified a qualified Accountant who will assume the day-to-day responsibilities o f the
Project Accountant andreport to the Project Manager. The proposed Project Accountant has a University
degree in Business Administration and has obtained certification from the Chartered Association o f
Certified Accountant (ACCA) in 1993. Since 1995, he has been the Project Accountant for the Basic
Education Reform Project. Through his experience with BERP, he has acquired sufficient knowledge o f
Bank's financial management and disbursement procedures and requirements.             He has also gained
extensive knowledgerelatingto the accounting systemused.

One weakness has been identified as it relates to the staffing o f the PMU. Even though all staff posts
have been filled, the condition o f employment o f the Project Accountant presents a risk for the financial
management of the project. The Accountant is seconded, which implies that at any time, without prior
notification or arrangements, he could be reassigned or returned to his former position. The Bank,
therefore, would recommend that the Accountant be officially appointed to this position or offered a
contract prior to effectiveness to ensure continuity inthe financial management o fthe Project.

The PMU has proposed the addition of an Account Clerk who will mainly be responsible for preparing
payment vouchers/check requisition requests with supporting documentation, responding to vendor
inquiries and assisting the Project Accountant. The candidate for this position has been identified within
the Ministry o f Education and has experience preparingpurchase orders ,working with spreadsheets and
answering inquiries.

Accounting and internal control

Administrative procedures are currently in place to ensure that financial transactions are made with
consideration to safeguarding project assets and ensuring proper entry in the accounting/monitoring
systems. The project accounting system has the capacity to record assets, liabilities and financial
transactions o f the project, and produce financial statements useful to project management and meeting
IBRD'sfiduciary requirements. However, it shouldbe considered that the PMUexplorethe possibility to
expand the functionality o f the accounting system (currently the PMU utilizes QuickBooks Pro) to
incorporate a database system that can be linked to the financial accounting software in order to
accurately track contracts and procurement activities and their respective implications on the financial
cash flow o fthe project.

Seaerration o f duties. The PMU's organizational structure and established procedures in the Financial
ManagemenVOperational manual support an adequate segregation of procurement, budgeting, payment
and recording activities. The authorization to execute a transaction i s the main responsibility o f the
Project Manager. The recording of the transaction i s the main responsibility o f the Project Accountant.
And, the custody of the assets involved inthe transaction is mainly the responsibility o f the Procurement
Officer.

Accounting. The PMU's policies, procedures and system allow the recording o f transactions under the
cash basis in local currency, with classification o f expenditures by disbursement category, project
component and financing source; this is compatible with World Bank's recommended practices for
project accounting. The MOE's own accounting system does not have that flexibility, which is the reason
why the PMUwill keep separate trackingo fproject accounts.

There has been no indication of computerized system-related errors and this was evidenced by the fact
that accounts are maintained by the P M U in the accounting system and exported to spreadsheets and
reconciled on a monthly basis.

Adequate documentation o f financial transactions and subsidiary records such as project financial
statements, bank reconciliation and payroll sheets, are kept up-to-date by the PMLT.           The PMU's
organizational structure and established procedures support an adequate segregation of procurement,
authorization, recording andcustody activities.

Budgetaw control. The P M Uprepares annual operating plans and budgets. It does not utilize the GOSL's
Smartstream financial software, which has been determined to be somewhat unreliable. The PMLT's
budgetary execution reports are produced each month and quarter (utilizing the FORM GEN-1 budget
forms), formal project progress reports are prepared semi-annually by the PMU, and project financial
statements in formats acceptable to IBRD are submitted annually to the Bank. Other non-periodic
financiavprogress documents are produced as needed.

For the proposed project, the projections o f expenditures (per PAD and cost tables) will be broken down
quarterly by the PMU in terms o f project component, disbursement category and financing source. This
exercise should be the basis for: (i) preparation o f the annual MOE's and PMU's budget proposal for
                                     the
the project; and(ii) subsequentmonitoringvia quarterlyfinancial statements.

                                                 119

Payments. The payment system used by the PMU with the GOSTLMOF Treasury Unit encompasses
appropriate internal control procedures, as it allows for an adequate segregation o f functions, review,
recording and delivery o f documents, and monitoring of bank account transactions.

Written procedures. Even though a manual o f payment procedures and a description o f the accounting
system had been prepared, an updatedmanualmust be preparedto reflect the new organizationwith inthe
MOECL and its functions with the PMU. For the new project, such documents should be updated and
complemented with other areas, such as budget preparation, distribution and review o f financial
statements, follow-up to audit recommendations, managementof subprojects, etc.


Audit

The P M Uwill be subject to review by the Director ofAudit.

Annual project financial statements will be audited in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing, by the Director of Audit and in accordancewith terms of reference (TORS)both acceptable to
IBRD. Audit reports from the Director o fAudit have been delivered ontime andhave been ofconsistent
quality. Furthermore, the Director o f Audit is a member of the International Organization o f Supreme
Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) and the Caribbean Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions
(CAR0SAI).

Therefore, the appraisal team has suggested that the PMU continue using the Office o f the Director o f
Audit, provide an updatedTerms ofReference and submita Letter ofUnderstandingto the Bank from the
Director of Audit indicating that the Office will provide auditing servicesto the project.

The PMU will prepare, if needed, a plan to address any issues and recommendations contained in the
audit reports. The action plan and follow-up activities will be communicated promptly to the Bank.

 Audit compliance. As of the date of appraisal, the final audit for BERP had not been submitted to the
 World Bank (due July 2001). The main reason given for the delay was the unavailability of the Project
 Accountant, as he had been reassigned to another department within MOE after the project ended in
 December 2000. The required documentation has now been sent by the PMUto the Office of the General
 Auditor, and the Director o f Audit has committed to finishingthe audit within the next six weeks. The
 Bank has received a note from the Director confirming that the audit will be submitted by 17May 2002.


 Financialreports and monitoring

 Financial statements and reports will be prepared informats satisfying boththe Government and IBRD's
 monitoring andfiduciary purposes.

  The PMU's Accountant will be responsible for producing monthly reports (reconciliation and the
  project's sources and uses o f funds, a matrix classifying receipts and expenditures by financing source,
  subcomponent and disbursement category) to share with the Project Manager andProcurement Officer.

  Each quarter, the PMU will prepare Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) to be submitted to the Bank.
  The FMRs will include a narrative outlining the major project achievements for the quarter, the project's
  sources and uses o f funds, a detailed analysis o f expenditures by sub-component, a physical progress
  report, a procurement report and a procurement table. FMRs should be submitted to the Bank no later
 than 45 days after the end o fthe reportingperiod. Quarterly reports will also be submittedto the Ministry
  of Finance (budget section) andto the PAC.

  The annual financial statementswill includethe project's sources anduses o ffunds, a detailed analysis of
  expenditure by sub-component, the schedule of SOEs or FMRs presented during the year and a
  reconciliation o f the Special Account. These reports will be made available to the auditors after the end
  o fthe fiscal year.

Obiectivesand Methodologv

A social assessment (SA) was conducted duringthe preparation phase ofthe program. Giventhe limited
resources allocated to the SA, the choice was made to focus on consultingwith the users o f the secondary
schools: students, parents, teachers and school leavers. The fieldwork for the SA was conducted inMarch
2001 inDominica, St. KittsandNevis and St. Lucia.

A total of 27 discussion groups were conducted for the assessment involving approximately 235
participantsin the four islands. Consultations took the shape of discussion groups ineachcountry inat
least two schools, with boys and girls separately (4* and 5* formers); and with teachers and parents in
one school. On all four islands, users intwo schools were consulted and one of these schools was a rural
school. In addition, secondary education issues were also discussedwith Four groups o f recent graduates
and secondary school graduates enrolled ina secretarial program; andthree groups o f students enrolled in
skills training or alternative programs.

These results were integrated with secondary sources which provided quantitative data at the regional
level as well as a number of youth and education studies. The final report integrates feedback and
additional information provided by counterparts during a presentation of preliminary findings conducted
inearly May2001.
Results

The objective o f the SA was to offer students a voice inthe design o f secondary education reform and to
identify areas o f future investigation. The project managerswere interested in issues o f inequity o f access
to quality education. The study's main focus was on students' perceptions, concerns and expectations of
the school. Expectations and attitudes are key to determining behavior within the system. School-
leavers, parents and teachers were included to offer contrasting perspectives and context within which to
understand student statements.

The results o fthe consultations highlight some critical issues about secondary reforminthe four islands:

   i. TheopportunitycostofeducationforstudentsinSaintLuciaandDominicawhichseemstobe
         underestimated by teachers and other officials.
  ii. Lowqualityofteachers-theirlackofmotivation,teaching skills, andpsycho-social skillsto
         handle social issues affectingtheir students-- especially among young teachers.
 iii. Violence inthe schools, described as the lack of safety but also widespread knife fights
         exacerbatedby the perceived disinterest or fear of teachers and administrators to intervene.

Equityof access and opportunity costs for schooling

Inequity of access to quality education in Dominica and Saint Lucia because of a reliance on exclusion
from the system to allocate scarce resources - i.e. places in secondary schools. While the system i s
predicated on determining access based on merit, other determining factors are at play including gender
andSES.

Obstacles to access secondary school are for students, individual capacity, money and parental support.
Students pointed to the high cost o f lessons necessary to compete for placement in the best schools in
Saint Lucia and Dominica. Once in secondary school the costs only increase - transportation, uniforms



                                                   126

and textbooks. Large costs such as textbooks are most problematic. Yet recurrent costs are also
problematic given low and irregular incomes - often leadingto absenteeismanddrop out.

The system in all four islands i s overburdened. Schools management of resources also result in inequities
for the students, mostly those in the lower streams. Irrational management worsens resource allocation.
While schooling is requireduntil fifteen or sixteen years of age depending on the island, little is done to
enforce attendance or to ensurethat drop outs from one school access schooling in alternative institutions.
Thus, a number o f (often troubled and/or lower income) children fall out ofthe systemthat mandates but
does not track or support their access to continued education.

Access to quality educationi s also inequitable since a significant proportion of children will get a second-
tier education (inless popular schools, unable to chose their curriculum because o f limited subject choices
withinschools, attendinglower streams, limitedto non-secondary education, andunableto obtain General
CXC passes) increasing their chances of educational failure. Segregated in these lower tiers o f the
education system -inJunior Primary, Senior secondary or lower streams      -- aminority o f students findthe
means to reinsert themselves into the mainstream system through repetition o f classes. The correlation
between low income and lower quality schooling - poor schools, lower streams - is most troubling as it
points to risk antecedentswhich needto be addressedthrough the school to ensure equity o f access.

1.     QUALITY TEACHING

Boy's underperformance i s a significant characteristic o f the system, however girls' underperformance is
no less important for their and their children's future. Underperformance also puts into question the
effectiveness o f the system - including the pre-primary and primary school systems which i s unable to
teach basic literacy and numeracy to a large proportion o f its students and passes on these issues to
secondary schools. Children who attend pre-school are more likely to perform well in primary school and
create for themselves a history o f educational successes.

Students also underlined the impact of low qualifications and low morale of certain teachers, especially
young inexperienced teachers who are unable to effectively and inclusively impart material as well as
create a positive atmosphere of learning in the classroom. In discussions with students, the role o f
teachers emerged as central in the discussions regarding dropout, performance and addressing youth
issues. This finding echoes other regional studies that place students' attitudes toward teachers as the
main determinant o f student outcome. Teachers' attitudes toward students and how they are perceived by
students arethe only determinants o f student outcome that are controllable at the school level.

Increased parental involvement and curriculum reform are crucial in buildingan effective school for all
studentsregardless of achievement level and subject interests.

2.       VIOLENCE INSCHOOLS

Another critical issuethat arose from these discussions i s the students' concern about school violence and
safety. Youth described a school where those at risk - acting out, low performers - have few allies and
connections to the authority figures. This isolation alongwith the highlevel o f concern for social issues in
school among both students and teachers points to a gap in meeting student and teacher needs. Current
efforts are offering counseling did not translate into a perceived benefit for students. Further regional
distinctions are outlined inAnnex 3 of the SocialAssessment (see Project Files).

Recommendationsmade duringinterviews

Recommendations by the discussion group participants are in large part coherent with the reform project
undertaken by the governments in terms o f its focus on improving school infrastructure and updating
resources; upgrading teaching resources; revising the curricula to include learner centered teaching,
extracurricular activities and to reflect the current employment opportunities; improving equity of access
to quality o f education for all including boys and low performers; address issues o f at-risk youths; and
strengthening the capacity o f school management. However, though the goals are coherent, based on
these discussions, teachers, students and parents say that the reforms must in some cases go further
toward qualitative improvements than what the program has currently envisioned. Inparticular, students
are concerned about teaching quality and student safety within the schools. Another focus o f interest i s
youth at risk who mostly receive very incomplete services withinthe school ifany.


    0   Students believethat the government reform should:

            (1) improve the physical plant o f the school, including structures and access to equipment
            (science labs, libraries, study halls, teaching materials, computers, vocational training tools
            and equipment);
            (2) improve teachers' teaching skills to make classes less boring, more lively, hands on and
            interactive andhelpteachers be more effective with slow learners;
            (3) improve security inschools (violence, gangs, fencing);
            (4) revise the regulations regarding punishment: ending corporal punishment and verbal

                               Annex 9: DFID Support for St. Lucia

                             OECS EducationDevelopmentProject

Introduction

The countries o f the Windward Islands, through their respective Education Sector Development Plans,
have identified the goal of universal secondary education as one o f the key priorities to be pursued within
the short to medium term. The attainment o f a minimumo f secondary education by the majority o f the
population is viewed as a means o f increasing the competitiveness and productivity o f the workforce
thereby reducing their vulnerability to poverty. Inpursuito f that broad goal and inan attempt to address
identified concerns in their education systems, St. Lucia and Dominica, together with St. Kitts, have
sought the financial support o f the World Bank and DFID for undertaking the OECS Education
Development Project (OEDP).

 The project seeks to address problems of: a) inequitable and low rates o f access to secondary education
where the poorer groups are excluded from participation; b) poor quality o f education at the secondary
school level as evidenced by low success rates in terminal examinations, low student enthusiasm for
pedagogic methodology and content and an absence or poor quality o f learning supplies, equipment and
space; and c) ineffective management and governance o f schools that depends on inefficient information
flows, an acutely centralized decision-making system and weak budget management and monitoring
system. Despite recent efforts by Government to deal with these under previous and ongoing projects,
considerable inputs and reforms are needed in the education sub-sector to establish a base for human
capacity development inthe countries.

As part o f its commitment to promoting better educational opportunities for poor people, DFID has
offered its support for the OEDP and, in particular, to address the problems o f low achievement, poor
quality and high inequity that evidently plague the education systems o f the individual countries o f the
sub-region. DFIDcommitment to these objectives i s exemplified inits funding o f technical support to all
four o f the Windward islands intheir efforts to develop comprehensive sector plans. The organization is
now prepared to work with the governments in the implementation o f some o f the priority objectives
identified inthose plans. DFIDsupport for St. Luciawithinthe OEDP is described below.

ACTIVITIES TO BEFINANCEDINST. LUCIA

DFID will contribute grant-fundingequivalent to US$O.S million in support of some of project activities
described inthe project description for St. Lucia. These funds will be used to finance activities under the
technical assistance category o f the project that addresses namely improvement o f quality teaching and
learning. Specifically, these funds will be used for:

         a. Technical assistance                  300,000
         b. In-countrytraining activities         300,000
         c.  Studytours                           100,000
         d. Knowledgepromotion                     50,000

The amount in brackets i s the upper funding limit (in U S dollars) that would be expended on each
subcategory. DFID will support a flexible approach in the implementation of the components it will
support andwill allow some movement o f funds across those categories.




                                                  130

Technical assistanceand training

Project inputs in the form o f local and foreign expert services will be provided to support several
activities duringimplementation, as described below. DFID fundingwill be utilizedto procure a total o f
approximately 300 days of short-term consultancy inputs (see summary in Attachment I). Additionally,
funds will be utilized to provide local training in support of the project objectives. Inmany cases these
training activities will be closely related to the consultant services being provided (see summary in
Attachment 2). These training activities include several programmes for teachers and principals which are
aimed primarilyat improving classroom pedagogy and at enhancing school development planning. While
most o f the training activities will be inthe form o f local workshopsheminars spread throughout the eight
school districts, some longer-term overseas training inthe areas o f school social work i s envisaged. This
i s expected to boost local capacity inthe areas of school social work and guidance and counseling inorder
to provide better support for disaffected youth. Some study tours and attachments are also planned.

Literacy and numeracy improvement:
Student performances on national and regional examinations show evidence o f low and unacceptable
achievement inthe areas of literacy and numeracy. Many students, evidently those from poorer families,
complete the primarycycle unable to read and write while some o f those who move on to secondary are
unable to participate adequately at that level. DFID fundingwill help to build on previous work done on
literacy and numeracy issues with a focus on identifying the nature and magnitude o f the problems in
those areas. The technical analysis and sample assessments should guide subsequent project work in
formulating new literacy and numeracy programmes. Expert services will also assist in establishing a
coordinated framework for several ongoing projects and initiatives that attempt to address literacy and
numeracy enhancement.

A project preparation study on Literacy and Numeracy pointedto the needfor a series ofteacher training
activities to address deficiencies observed in classroom practices across schools in St. Lucia. DFID
funding will support school-based professional development o f teachers with emphasis on use o f varied
teaching strategies and inthe implementation of new literacy and numeracy programmes. Those training
workshops will encourage sharing o f exemplary practices.

Itis expectedthat new programmes will be developed under the OEDP among a wide range of strategies
to improve student achievement in literacy and numeracy. These programmes will be introduced on a
pilot basis in select schools and later will be rolled out to all schools in the system. DFID funds will
support training workshops for teachers and principals of pilot schools towards the implementation of
those new programmes.

Student support services:
Based on the social assessment study and preparation studies on Youth-at-Risk, there i s strong evidence
that existing student support services are grossly inadequate to meet the current needs o f disadvantaged
students.   Many of these programmes appear as stand-alone initiatives and there is little coordination of
these services within education or across government institutions. DFID funding will support MOE
efforts in a formal assessment o f its existing compensatory and welfare programmes inan effort to better
target those disadvantaged and at-risk students and to improve articulation between these programmes.
The roles and functions o f guidance counsellors and school social workers will also be reviewed and
weak capacity in those areas will be strengthened through training. DFID funds will support local
training for teachers in school social work, guidance, counselling and special education. The funds will
also be used for overseas training in counselling and school social work at the post-graduate level for
selectteachers, particularly those who have a first degree inpsychology.

SchoolDevelopment Planning:
Under the recently completed BERP, school principals and senior teachers o f primary and secondary
schools received training in school development planning. While the preparation o f school development
plans have become a feature o f school level planning, there i s a perception that there is insufficient
meaningful participation inthe process byteachers, students and parents. With the increasing importance
now being placed on school development planning and in the use o f school improvement projects, the
OEDP will seek to foster more effective participation o f all key interest groups in the planningprocess.
This will be done by formally introducing the concept and process to teachers, students and parents
through a series o f training seminars. DFID funding will facilitate the hiring o f expertise in school
development planningto work with a local core o f principals and education officers who are, themselves,
best practitioners in school development planning to develop a training programme and to run those
seminars across several school districts.

Design of new curricula:
Under the OEDP, the MOE will undertake curriculum reform to include a design o f new core curricula
for the lower secondary level and, in so doing, build on work that has already been done at the sub-
regional level. Inthe process it will seek to integrate identified co-curricula activities so as to give them
more relevance to student learningexperiencesat that level. DFIDfundingwill support national efforts at
formulating the curriculum outlines and procuring expert services to undertake the final design o f the
curriculum. The process will involve a series of consultations to determine the content and design o f the
core curriculum that was defined at a recent World Bank-sponsored sub-regional workshop in St. Lucia.
DFID funding will support the necessary consultations aimed at detailing the core curriculum and in
support o f work groups to finalise the design work. Fundingwill also be provided for the localtraining o f
curriculum officers, heads o f department o f secondary schools and education officers as a strategy to
strengthen the base support in instructional supervision and general provision o f professional guidance to
teachers.

Student assessment:
The CEE is expected to continue to be a feature o fthe assessment system for some time in St. Lucia even
with the move to provide universal secondary education (USE). There have been numerous calls for its
review both as a selection mechanism and as a diagnostic tool. More recently the DFID-sponsored OEDP
preparation study on Literacy and Numeracy pointed to the need to review the assessment and
examination systems currently inexistence. These tests seem to be at the core o f factors impedingstudent
learning.   Thus, within the broader context of a continuous assessment system, all existing local
examinations, including the CEE, will be reviewed under the OEDP. DFID will support this initiative by
funding technical assistance and consultations related to the reform of examinations. The outcome of
these activities would be a proposal for an alternative to the current examinations. Funds will also
support a preliminary study on the development o f a national school completion certificate.              This
certificate will complement CXC certification. DFID funds will support training o f select teachers and
measurement officers in school-based assessment, performance assessment and in organisingfor remedial
work. Training will be inthe form o f local seminars andwork attachments at examinations centres.

Teacher Training:
The OEDP preparation study on teacher training pointed to the need for a redefinition o f existing teacher
training programmes to make them more relevant to the educational needs o fthe school system. Boththe
content and the practice need to be reviewed, particularly in the areas o f curriculum implementation,
student-centred learning and the use o f new technologies in the teaching and learning process. DFID
fundingwill support technicalassistanceto design new teacher training programmes incollaboration with
the Sir Arthur Lewis Community College (SALCC) who would be expected to deliver most of these
programmes. The services will include facilitation o f consultations on the new programmes and advising
on the best modalities for delivery.    These new programmes will complement the existing secondary
teacher training programme offered by SALCC to address deficiencies in curriculum delivery, lack o f

variety in teaching strategies and inadequacy of content knowledge. DFID will support teacher-training
workshops inthe delivery of those new programmes.

                                    ProjectManagementSupport

DFID has provided technical assistance support through the Windward Island Education Programme
Manager during the preparation and design of the project and i s committed to continuing this support
duringproject implementation and monitoring. The Education Programme Manager will be part of the
core team on supervisionmissions and will advise on implementationissuesas appropriate.

Additionally, DFID would support the contracting o f a management consultant to organise the TA
component o f the project described above. The firm will handle the anticipated workload associated with
the management and administration o f the TA, training (including study tours) and knowledge support
inputs outlined above. The firm may also provide similar services to other countries of the Windward
Island who are participating in the OEDP. Inthe performance o f its duties, the firm will work in close
collaboration with the Project Management Unit and other implementation units o f the Ministry of
Education. In the process, it i s expected to relieve personnel there o f the pressures associated with the
effective andefficient deployment o fthose aspectso fthe project.

The broad duties o f the firm will include: a) recruiting, managing and supervising consultant inputs; b)
sourcing appropriate training programmes and assisting inthe placement o f qualified candidates to pursue
these programmes; c) organising study tours; and d) managing funds provided by DFIDin support o f the
OEDP.

The procurement o f the management firm will be done by DFID in collaboration with the Government in
accordance with DFID, EU and World Bank guidelines for procurement.            A contract will be awarded
followingjoint DFID/Government and World Bank(ifappropriate) evaluation o ftenders.

Most o f the activities to be undertaken by expert services and the related training to be provided are
expected to front-loaded in the implementation plan. This is because several other activities to be
undertaken under the project depend on the successful and early completion o f those that have been
identified for DFID support. It i s therefore anticipated that DFID funding be fully disbursed within the
first two years ofthe project.
