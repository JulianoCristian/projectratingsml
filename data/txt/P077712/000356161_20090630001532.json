outcomes of the project were\n            moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the link between project's\n            activities and the outcome indicators for the quality and\n            management components was not clearly addressed in the\n            project document. As a result, these indicators could not\n            adequately measure the achievements or progress made under\n            these components. To maintain the focus on project\n            development objectives during the implementation and to\n            clearly address how different activities and components fit\n            together, creating a well-defined results framework is\n            critical. Project teams need to make sure that the framework\n            articulates the link between outputs and outcomes, by\n            setting intermediate indicators which adequately measure the\n            interim changes toward achieving the objectives. If the\n            focus of the activities changed over the course of the\n            project, the indicators should be reviewed and modified\n            accordingly. The project aimed at enhancing quality while\n            expanding access to secondary education. As commonly seen in\n            many education projects, an expansion of access has led to a\n            large influx of new students with a wide range of abilities,\n            posing a considerable challenge on schools to meet these\n            students' needs. A rapid expansion of access can\n            undermine the quality of teaching and learning. With this in\n            mind, realistic targets should be set for quality\n            improvement, particularly for learning outcomes, when a\n            project seeks dual enhancement of access and quality."}, "docdt": "2009-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
