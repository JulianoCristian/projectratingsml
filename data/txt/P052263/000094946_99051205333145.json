"The Pilot Social Fund Project supports\n            the development of human resources and poverty alleviation\n            objective of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), and\n            targets disadvantaged populations, fostering access to funds\n            for community-determined projects. The project includes four\n            components. 1) The first component will finance small\n            socio-economic infrastructure, through the rehabilitation\n            and extension of elementary schools and health centers, to\n            include installation of water points and/or construction of\n            latrines, etc. Repair of bridges, and community public\n            centers, such as markets, will also be considered under this\n            component. 2) The second component focuses on capacity\n            building, financing human capital investments for community\n            benefits, thus increasing functional literacy and providing\n            training for village health workers. It will also provide\n            beneficiaries with organizational , managerial and strategic\n            skills. 3) The third component will support financial\n            intermediation. Although the definition of this component\n            will become effective as the project progresses,\n            institutional building will promote income-generating\n            activities. 4) The fourth component will promote\n            institutional mechanisms for a system of decentralized\n            social funds, where project management and institutional\n            building will have control over operational expenditures\n            concerning implementation, supervision and coordination."}, "docdt": "1999-04-14T00:00:00Z"}
