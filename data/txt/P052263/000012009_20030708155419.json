though\n            institutional development impacts are modest. Lessons for\n            project preparation indicate that components which cannot be\n            prepared fully, should not be included in a project, or at\n            the very least, should be considered highly risky, with\n            mitigation measures put into place; that broader political\n            support is paramount in a country with such high political\n            tensions, and where political fortunes are made, and lost\n            quite fast. Hence, depending on a particular champion the\n            project becomes much riskier; that participatory approaches\n            involving all stakeholders from the beginning helps enhance\n            ownership, providing a chance of well-implemented\n            micro-projects; that it is important for learning and\n            innovation loans to ensure measurable indicators early on,\n            including a monitoring and evaluation system, and that staff\n            are trained in data collection procedures. Lessons for\n            project implementation stipulate that the Bank should not\n            precede government's efforts in the area of\n            decentralization because as in this case, the government did\n            not fully exercise its oversight responsibility, rather led\n            to tensions between the implementing agencies, and the\n            government central institutions. And other lessons suggest\n            that the inclusion of maintenance plans in micro-project\n            proposals as a requirement, contributes to sustainability of\n            the structures; that capacity building should be considered\n            part of individual micro-projects, to strengthen beneficiary\n            communities in project planning, and management."}, "docdt": "2003-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
