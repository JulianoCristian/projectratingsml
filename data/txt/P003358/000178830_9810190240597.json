The\n            Kinmundaung subproject lies in Magwe Division in the dry\n            zone of central Burma. The subprojects will provide\n            year-round irrigation for about 5,000 acres, irrigation for\n            a dry-season crop in the area, and a full drinking water\n            supply for Mudon Town which has a population of about\n            40,000. At full development, cropping intensities will\n            almost double for both subprojects; incremental paddy\n            production will total about 8,100 tons p.a. With the\n            introduction of cotton and orchard crops, the project will\n            assist the government of Burma's efforts toward crop\n            diversification while increasing the value of non-paddy cash\n            crops by about K8.8 M per year. The project will introduce\n            furrow irrigation to the Kinmundaung area for the first\n            time. In addition, both subprojects will introduce new crops\n            such as Long-Staple Cotton (LSC) and a 850 ac irrigated\n            orchard scheme."}, "docdt": "1982-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
