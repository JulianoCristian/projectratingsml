MEMORANDUM AND RECO)IRUDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTEENATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLES DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA
FORt A SECOND ADDIS AABA URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.     The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Credit to the
Peoples Democratic Republic of Ethiopia for SDR 27.1 million (US$35.0 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed Credit would be on
standard ImD terms with 40 years maturity and would help finance a second
Addis Ababa urban development project.
2.     Background.  The nation's capital, Addis Ababa, with a current
population of about 1.8 million, accounts for about 292 of the nation's urban
population, 63Z of manufacturing workers and 231 of gross domestic product.
Despite its importance, the capital city suffers from a severe shortage of
housing, deteriorating physical infrastructure, unhealthy environmental
conditions and inadequate resources to meet the needs of its steadily growing
population, which has been increasing at 4.5? per annum recently. The number
of women-headed households has also been increasing such that the proportion
of females in the urban population was 56Z in 1984. Income levels of the
city's population are extremely low, and poverty is widespread. According to
a income survey in 1984, the median household income was only Birr 150 (US$72)
per month; it is doubtful that income levels have risen appreciably since that
time. In 1987.* it was estimated that about 652 of households in Addis Ababa
could be defined as living at or below the subsistence level, an unus4ally
high proportion for a major city.
3.     Partly in an attempt to improve the management and financial capacity
of local authorities, the Government of Ethiopia (GOE) is in the process of
implementing a comprehensive plan for reorganizing government administration.
Under the new arrangement, the jurisdictional boundary of the municipality of
Addis Ababa has been greatly enlarged to encompass the existing city together
with several surrounding areas, including the rapidly growing industrial town
of Akaki. The total population of the Addis Ababa Administrative Region
including these surrounding rural areasi reaches over 2.1 million.  This makes
it one of the largest cities in eastern Africa between Cairo and Johannesburg.
4.     In order to strengthen the financial performaice of Addis Ababa so that
it will be able to undertake the proposed project, the new (since December
1988) regional administration has implemented a number of positive actions
over the last-year which have reversed its prior declining revenue
performance. It has vigorously pursued the registration and taxation of
unregistered building plots, unlicensed traders, cost recovery on municipal
services and collection of arrears. In addition, it has also strengthened. its
finance and ac,ounting departments and hired more qualified staff to manage
its revenue and finance functions. These measures have already resulted in a
substantial improvement in its overall financial situation such that Addis
Ababa will be able to afford both the project and increase its expenditures on
other capital investments to improve the level of services provided in the
tegional area.

-2-              Q
S.    -Rationale for-IDA Involvement. In the absence sf -agreement on a
macroeconomic adjustment program,at this time, IDA will continue to provide a
modes* core program of lending to address Ithiopia's deep poverty,   nifest
food knsecurit$, environmental fragility and low level of human reso rce'
development. Through this Project, IDA is helping to allevi#e urban poverty
and environmental/health constraints and promote opportunities for poor women
'"n the na=14's capital and largest urban area.  IDA' involvement is regarded
as importait in supporting the development of appropriate urban policies and
investment programs under the present condition of severe resource constraitts
and in supporting the development of urban institutions invoj)ed in the
delivery of basic services. The Project would build on a successful first
Urban Develo p   t Project (Credit W366-ET) which financed a demonstration of
lower-cost, replicable approaches to housing, an upgrading program of
environmental conditions  tnd infrastructurt in the ctty's largest slum area,
and studies,which addresse4 issues a~sSociated with m&intesauce and management
of municipal services. Tlre Project comes at a time when the Government is
unaertaking p6licy reforms in the housing sector. Theie-reforms are expected
to lead to increases in private construction of housing and theteby help to
ease the severe housing shortage in the city.
6.     Pr!oect Obictives.  The proposed Project is essentially a poverty
alleviation project. It would provide continued support for the nation's
capital through '*upport of the programs and operations of key urban agencies
and a cr4dit institution, including the Addis Ababa Administrative Region
(AAAR), the Addis Ababa Water and Sewerage 'Athority tAWSA) and the Housing
and Savings Bank (HSB).  Specifically, tbheroposed Pro3ect is aimed at (a)
improving basic infrastructure and environmental conditions in project areas;
(b) supporting-a core housing development program primarily for lower-income
families; tc) -promoting opportunities for poor women living in\the Rebeles
(slums) to enhance their incomes; (d) providing assistance to irbas  service
delivery agencies to carry out their activities more efficiently; md Ce)
promotiig the adoption of sound cost recovery policies and practices.
7.     Project. Description.  The proposed Project includess  (a) development
of about 2,000 serviced plots with 1,900 core housing units for the'lower-
income groups with supporting infrastructure and community facilities at two
locations in Addts Ababa and about 350 serviced plots and core housing units
for the lower-income groups with supporting infrastructure in Akaki; (b)
infrastructure improvements and loans for improvement/upgrading of houses in
seven ceitrall^-located Xebeles in Addis Ababa in the first pbas-, similar
investments fo* Kebeles in Addis Ababa to be identified in a sec&d phase, &*d
a loan fund to finance revenue-generating projects partly for poor women and
other development projects in Kebeles citywide in Addis Ababa; Cc) st eet
maintena,ce, including municipal vehicles, equipment, spare parts, plant and
civil works in Addis,Ababa; (d) solid waste management improvements, including,
minicipal,vehicles, spare parts, collection containers, landfill plant,
equipment and civil worcs in Addis Ababa; (e) improvemets tok roads and
drain, provision of-essential municipal Vehicles and etuipment, and a ptwer
line extensLion to service the new hQuoing arest in-Akaki; and (f) major-
expansion voZks of the water supply system in Akaki.  The proposed Project
also $ncJudes programs of institutional support, including consultancy
servic)as, studies, technical assistance, traininb, vehicXes and equipmen to
\.  .*.



-3-
strengthen mmangement and jiintenice systems, and assist';ce for project
management and  Implmentation  as ippropriate. for project agencies.  The
Project, to be carded out ovlr 6 years, has a total cost estlmate4 at US$46.7
Million .quva letit, with a foreign exchange component of US$19.6 'million
(42?). A bteikdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shonn in Schedule B. A timetable df key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Ithiopia are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively.' The.locations of project investments are
shown on Maps ZIRD fo. 2230I1 22302 and 2t30O. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 8632-ET dated May 30, 2:99O,'is also attached.
8.     Actions Aareed.' During negotiations a4reements were reached with
Government regarding: \a) staffing and organizational requirements of project
agencies and composition of a Project Advisory Committee; (b) submission by
AAAR of the first four applications for *ebele development loans to tA for
review and approval prior to granting lons, and subsequent loans tObe
A             provided in accordance with appraisal criteria agreed with IDA; (c) HSB
contDnuing to  mplemept an astion program to reduce arrears on its non-
nationalized portfolio, and that arrears will not exceed 3? of the related'
outstanding mortgage balances; (d) HSB continuing to undertake an annual  -
review of the quality of its mortgage portfolio and set aside regular annual
provisions for bad debts; {e) AWSA carrying,out a water and sewerage tariff
study within one yeaF of credit effectiveness, submitting the study to IDA for
its 'review and discutsing the recomme4dations with IDA prior to
implementation; (f) AWSA adjustment of-water and sewerage tariffs and other
related charges so that starting in PY92193 AWSA will maintain total revenues
from water supply and sewerage services at,sufficient levels to meet all
operation and maintenance expenses, and the higher of depreciation or debt
service, in each fiscal year; (g) terms of on-lending to ensure adequate
spreads on operations for project agencies and positive interest rates.to
beneficiaries; (h) recovery b  AAAR of on-site infrastructure costs associated
with the housing schemes from beneficiaries through pl6t development and other
charges; and.(i) Government st#mittiag proof.that it has started to implement
its policy for selling government-owned houses in the project upgrading areas
'\   and in upgrading areas already improved under the First Urban Development
Project and promioted improvement of houses as a coqdition of disbursTment on
the Kebele upgrading component.                     i
9.     Benefits.  The proposed Project would reinforce the progress achieved
under the First Urban Development Project in alleviating urban poverty au 
improving environmental and living conditions in Addis Ababa. This would be
accomplished in part by strengthening the management and financial capacity of
institutions which play important roles in urban development and
administration, and more specifically through upgrading and expanding physical
infrastructure and housing Vrimarily for the lower-income groups.  Poor women.
living in the Kebele areas would also be assisted in raising their incoies
*          through the provision of loan funds to finance revenue-generating schemes.
Directly quantifiable benefits were estimated for (a} the housing components
on the basis of imputed rental values 'of the dwellinjs to be constructed-
(b) the Xebele upgrading program oF the basis of increases in imputed rent-al
values of the properties benefittinig from the infristructure improvements;

o                              /          a    S  /
V.. 
(c) the water supply expansion scheme on the basis of tucreased revenues; and
(d) the street maintenance prdgram.on the baios of savings in vehicle
pperating costs.  Together these components account for about 732 of the total
pjroject costs and produce a weighted ;verage eoonomic rate of return mfl6.5Z.
Further unquantifiable benefits would accrue from the road improvements in
Akaki whici would aid circulation around the market  nd by connecting the new
housing development with the existing network and the drainage improvements
which would alleviate ocqssional flooding, prevent erosion and protect roads.
'aken together with the v!ter_ supply and sanitation improvements, the drainage
works would be expected to make a sigpificant contribution to reducing the
high-incidence of water-related and eye aid skin diseases prevalent in the
Addis Ababa region. 'The solid waste management improvements would benefit
t4ore people through an expanded system and provide a more regular and\reliable
service which would lead to improving enviroamental conditions.
10'.    Risks.  Since Government has demonstrated its ability to carry out a
similar IDA-supported project in a satisfactory manner, the risks assoc4ateda
with executing this follow-on project are expected to be small.  The main
risks are that (a) v*ter tariff incrqases may not bec.implemented by AWSA as
required for politi6al or other reasoWs, (b) Governmit may not execute its
plan in a timely manner to sell government-owned houses in project areas in
order to better ensure that houses will be, upgraded and thus a comprehensive
upgrading program would be supported, and (c) the hkakk.kater supply component
may cost more than.the current estimated cost. To minimize these risks, the
requirements for tariff increases would be.closely monitored, disbursement of
project funds for upgrading of Kebele areas would be linked to Government
initiating the sale of its houses in project areas, and Government would bear V
any additional costs if the actual cost'qf the water supply component exceeds
the estimate.
11..    Ricommendation'.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Atrticles of Agreement of the Association and reca#mend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit'.            '
