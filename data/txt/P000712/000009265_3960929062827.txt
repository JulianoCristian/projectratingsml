Credit and Project Summasry
Borrower:      The Government of Ethippia (GOB).
Implementing   Addis Ababa Administrative Region (AAAR)
Agencies and   Housing and Savings Bank (HSB)
Beneficiaries: Addis Ababa Water and Sewerage Authority (AWSA).
Credit Amount: SDR 27.1 million (US$35 million equivalent).
Credit Terms:  Standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years.
On-Lending   ' As- loans to: (a) AAAR at 4.5Z interest rate; (b) HSB
Terms:         at 1.52 interest rate; and (c) AWSA at 4? interest rate,
all to be repaid over 26 years including sii years of
grace.
Proiect        The Project would provide continued support for Addis Ababa
Description:   and Akaki by improving basic infrastructure ant d
en-vironmental conditions in project treas, supporting a
core housing development program primarily for lower-income
families, promoting opportunities for poorer women to
enhance their incomes, providing assistance to urban
service delivery agencies to\carry out their activities
more efficiently, and promoting the adoption of sound cost
recovery policies and practices. The Project would include
support for: (a) sites and services and care housing
development in two locations in Addis Ababa and one
location in Akaki; (b) upgrading of infrastructure. and
housing in Kebele (slum) areas in Addis Ababa and a loan
fund to finance revenue-generating projects\,partly for poor
women and other development projects in'Kebeles citywide,
(c) street maintenance in Addis Ababa; (d) improvements in
--solid waste-management in Addis Ababa; (e) improvements to
municipal infrastructure in Akaci; (f) expansion of water
supply in Akaki; and (g) institutional support programs to
strengthen management and maintenance systems, and
assistance for project management and implementation, as
appropriate, for project agencies.
ProJect Riskss: Project risks include uncertainty regarding water tariff
increases, sale of government-owned housei-being
implemented in project areas, and the cost estimate of the
Akaki water supply component.  To minimize these risks, the
requirements for water tariff increases would be closely
monitored, disbursement for the Kebele upgrading program
would be linked to progress with Government selling off its           a
nationalized stock, and the Government would bear the-
additional costs if the cost of the water supply coaponeni
exceeds the estimate.            k    , -

SECOND ADDIS ADAM URBAN DJLOPNNT         ECT
I. SECTOR BAC1GROUND
A. Country Context
1.01     Ethiopia is one of the poorest countries in the world.  Its per
capita income was only $120 in 1987. About 901 of the total population of 47
million is rural, the majority of which derives its livelihood from settled
peasant farming in the highlands. Since the Revolution in 1974, the average
rate of real GDP growth has been only 22 per annum, and per capita income has
fallen by over 0.7Z per annum.   After vigorous growth in the late 1970s, the
economy has stagnated in the 1980s. Macroeconomic performance has been
dominated by droughts (in 1983/84, 1.984185 and 1987188), the effects of civil
war, and a distorted pricing and marketing system which inhibited production.
The effects of several years of virtual economic stagnation have been falling
standards of living, decreasing real Incomes and rising open unemployment.
The available evidence also points to sharply falling per capita fodd
availability. While nutritional and other health indicators to confirm the
impression of steadily growing impoverishment are sparse, Ethiopian mortality
rates compare unfavorably with those of other low income African countries.
Education levels are lov, with secondary schooling the privilege of a small
minority of children.
1.02     The Bank's overall obJective is to assist Ethiopia in shifting its
economy trom the present cycle of stagnation to a path of long-term
sustainable growth.  This will requira substantial policy and administrative
changes freeing up the ec,qnmy. adjusting the exchanje rate. domestic prices,
trade policies and producer 'iwcentives, and creating a radically improved
environment for the private sector. The preferred meais for carrying out this
strategy is to assist the Governmiet of Ethiopia (GOE) to pursue these
comp;ehensive adjustment policies ai4 to support the reform process with
adjustment lending. In the absence of agreement on a macroeconomic adjustment
program at this time, the Bank will continue to provide a modest core program
of lending to address Ethiopia's deep poverty, manifest food insecurity,
environmental fragility and low level of human reso%irce development. This
will be pursued through lending for boman resource =nd institutional
development, environmental protection, the strengttaening of essential roads,
and urban'infrastructure.  The proposed Project would meet a combination of
the objectivess to alleviate urban paverty and environmentallhealth
constraints, promote opportunities for women, and improve some essential
infrastructure, while supporting the development of appropriate urban
policies.

B. Urbansfation in the Addis Abab& Adid~istrative'kesion
1.03 ,Ze nation's capital, Addis Ababa, suffers from a severe shortage of
,housing, deterioratiqFg physical infrastructure, unhealthy envxronmental
conditions and inadequ*te resources to meet the needs of its.. 'teadily growing
population.  Based on a-census count of 1.4 million in 1984 and u2 estimated
annual growth rate of 4.52, the population of Addis Ababa is currently
calculated to be in the region of 1.8 million.  The growing number of women-
headed households has raised.the proportion of females in the urban population
to ,56% as of 1984.  According to available iAformation, AdO*s Ababa also
accounts for about 292 of the nation's-urban population, 6it.of manufacturing
"workers, and 23Z of gross domestic product. The growing population is placing
an Increasingly severe burden on the city's already overstrained,
infrastructure 4nd public facilities.  Given the limited fiscal resources of.
<\the city administrati,on  maintenance, upgrading and expansion of Its
'infrastructure and facilities have,failed to keep pace with the increaseln
populatio. and economic activity.                          ,           l
'1.04     Income levels of the city's population are low, and'poveity ii
widespread.  According to a household income survey conducted in 1984 for the,
Addis Ababa Master Plan,.average household incomes were estimated to be Birr
280 (U~$135) per month and the median income was only Birr 150 (US$72?) per
month.\.In real terms, it is doubtful that income levels hate risen,
8ppreciably since that tAime,. In 1987, it'was estimated that the poierty
income level r¶quired to purchase aibasket of essential t-fod and non-food
items by a typical houseboldwias Birr 238-(US$115) per month. ?1  on this
ba8iii #t has been-calculated that f5Z of households' in Addis.Ababa could be
define4_s living at or below the vkbsiTstence level, an iunususlly high
proportion for a major city.                                           capac'.y
..OS    Partly in an attempt to improve,the management an' financial capacity
of local authorities, the Government of Ethiopia is in the process'of
implementing a comprehensive plan for reorganizing governmeni administration.
Under the new arrangement, the jurisdictional bouhdary.of the municipality'
(central administration) of Addis Ababa has been greatly enlarged to. encompass^
the existing city together vith. sveral surrounding areas,,including the.'
rapidly groving-industrial 'towh of Akaki with an estimated,population of
68,000. The total population of Addis Ababa Administrative Region (AAAR)
including these surrounding rural areas now reaches over'2.1 illion.  This
makes it one of the largest cities in eastern Africa\ between Cairo a*d
Johannesburg.                            '
7,,. 1/  'sVing 1982 prices and. a food  8ket based on 95X of the daily N"lori ;
reiuirements established by.the Ethiopian Nutrition Institute, the     '
subsistence income required by an average family of 5.5 persons was estimaked
to be Birr 124 per month,, including Birr 70 for food and Birr 54 for
non-food items.  This was converted to 1987 prices using the Retail Price
. ndex for the ftems in th  original consumption basket.               -

C. JInfrastructure Deficiencies and Priority Needs V
1.06     About 1 millidn of Addis Ababa's 1.8 million people live in areas
which have serious deficiencies,in infrastructure and which love little or no
access to municipal services. The neighborhood area,s or Rebeles where the
'majority of these people live are characterized by Wdgh population densities
(400-700 persons/ha), limited accest to and circulation within the areas with
* the few roads generally unpaved; insufficient and undesigned drainage systems;
few individual water connections or public water fountains; and in many areas,
non,-existenk refuse collection and disposal arrangemients.  The most critical
deficiency, 4owever, is the-lack of toilet facilities with only about 602
having access\ to a private or shared latrine and,the remainder using open
spaces and watercourses.  Environmental conditions are extremely poor and
health risks are high in thJse areas.
1.07   - Water and electricity supplies are more stable in Addis Ababa than in
many African cities, although service levels are modest.  The kity also has a
generally adequate primary and secondary road network given the fairly low
traffic 4#tensitieq, although the result of years of inadequate maintenance is
now seen and felt throughout'the lity.  Of the city's 270 km ofUprimrry and
seconaary roads (l.e. arterial, sub-'arterial. collector _ad local -service -2
roads), in the,order of 801 are showing some form of distress, much of it
severe.
1.08  - Of the approximately 290 tons of refuse generated i*-Addis Ababa
every day, only about 502 is collectedvvith the remainder generally disposed
of on open spaces, ,in drainage channels or in watercourses, exacerbating the
esty,s dtainage deAiciencies. --tfuse that is collected by the city's aging
fleet of vehicles (56 no. with an avera'  aga-of over 12 years)=is-dumped at
the city's one tip site some 10 km to the south-west of the city which is*
operated as an uncontrolled, unsanitary dump. *Refuse is not covered, the site
is not fenced or drained, dead animals are buried in the refuse a_d many
scavengers)operate at the site vhich is now nearing the end-of its useful
life.
1.09w    Priority intervlntions required in Addis Ab#ba to address the post
critical infrastructure needs aret (a)\a comprehensive rangi of basic Zeeds
infrastru'ture and services in the Rebetes, in concert with a program tpl
maintain the housing stock; (b) a program to halt the deterioration of the
city's toad network with a focus on drainage improvement and maintenance
tAgether with basic road maintenance; and (c) a pr ram to improve and expand
solid waste collection in the city and to improve disposal arrangements.'

D. HRousingt Conditions and Constraints
1.11       Between 1984 and 1988 approximately 8,900 building permits were
issued in the city and assuming that all of theqe have resulted in
construction of new houses, annualAhousitip outpu't averaged 2,225 legal units.
eh~n houses built by the government-owned Rental Hlousing Administration (ERHA)
a" added, the total annual housing output is estimated to have averaged about
3,300 dwellings. Snethe number of urban households increased by about
9,850 per year'during this period, this has created a serious hokusing
shortage, estimated at about 30,000 units in 1988 and represe'nting about ll?
of-t4e 1988 housing stock of about 268,500 units. Roughly one-~bird of
hous 1.g unit6 are owner-occupied and the re'ma'Ining two-thirds are'.t%,nted from   N
Kebeles and the RHA,.\ both of which took over ownership of `extra (reznted)
-  houses' from private "hosehold  after the -j97-4-Rwvoiuion--on ~the basis76  rent
levels.21 Rents on nationalized pri¶pertiei were r-educed by 15-502 and have
remained fix ed at-the 'same levels ever since, due to the Imposition of strict,
rent control laws.  Vailure of Kebeles t o carry out constant maintenance of
the predominantly Ochika'l houses (muad and straw on a timber framework with
corrugted iron roofing) due primarily to Mie low rent re'venues available for        N
maintenance.is~ a major-cause.of the desperatk  state'-of housing prevailing in
the city today~.v it is estimated that about 44,000 housing units are-inicapable 
of repair and require-demolition and over 70,000 req-uire majp~r maintenance.      N
In the areas such as Akaki surrounding Addis 'Ababa, the housing situation is
siml.ar-, although on a smaller scale. Between 1984 and 1988, housingi
constructioni 'I4,#aki failed tb keep pace with the growth of househbolds such

\housing, wilch accounts for'about half of Adis Ababa's housing and houses the
tifban poor, often consist of lands subject to flooding withfout'proper access,
drainage. sanitation and with inadequate distribution of water supply.
1.13     The w&jor constraint to Increasing the supply and maintenance of
housing has been the shortage of materials production, particularly wood,
cement and glass. Disruptions in the production of local materials by the
state enterprises ore caused in part by improper maintenance of facilities
which lead to significant delays. Administrative bottlenecks and insufficient
measn of transportation accentuate the problem. Dependency op foreign'imports
of certain components (e.g. iron sheets, reinforcement steel, metal frames)
and the limited'availibility of foreign exchange add to the delays.
1.14     Another,factor affecting the supply of housing in the Addis Ababa
area has been the limited availability of serviced land. Very little vacant
land with access to services and infrastructure 1i available close in the
center of Adds Ababa, and  a a 'result, plots for housing dsvelopment are now
primarily'all6icated in areas around-'t9e periphery of the city. 'Thsee lands,
however, are ge4erally lacking in infrastructure and services, and'house,
dwellers in these-areas may be require \to wait some time before services are
supplied.                                                           "'-\

1.16     Since lending to Ethiopia for--urban development activities coamenced
in the early 1980s,,IDA's assistance has been geared to helping the GOt
improve the delivery of serviced land and housing while at the same time
easing the burden on public'finances. Anqther focus of the strategy' has been
to review current policies and practices on maintenance of urban housing and
infrastructure with a view to ultimately reducing rent subsidies and impr,oving
the efficienc'y of public resource utilization.  Institutional development of
existing urban agencies has' been a key element of this strategy.  The-P irst

involvement throsgh a UNDP/World Bank water program aimed at supporting the
d4velopment of  ivestment plans and strategies for the sector, including
investment priorities for urban and rural, watet and sanitation systems.
Currentiy, ongoing techiical assistance under this program is reviewing,among
other things, the organization and management requirements needed to support
the development of the tWater Supply and Sewerage Authority (WSSA), the key
institution in providing water supplies in urban areas outside of Addis Ababa.
\1.19    The proposed Project would build upon the successful experience of
the\previous projects through further support of the 4evelopment of
appropriate urban policies and investment programs utdder the present condition
of severe resource constraints.  In\addition, the Project would provide
continued support for the development of urban institutions $mvolved ip the
delivery of basic services. The Project would expand the past instituiional
devllopment of Addis Ababa municipality, now an Administrative Region, in the
areas of finance, operations and maintenance and as4slt it in 'carrying out its
development programs. In addition, the Addis Ababa Water and sewerage
Authority (AWSA) would be supported to strengthen its organization and
management as well as training of staff.  The high rate of growth in_fhe
capital\city and surrounding areas codapled with the poor health and
environmental conditions necessitate the deve;opment of housing, expansion of
'water supply, and maintenance and improvement*of Kebele ezeas as well as
street networks and sanitation facilities, which would a qo be included under
the 4oject.
Financial Sector Strategr    .
1.20     The Ethiopian financi,l system is very underdeveloped and contains
the typical features of a socialist financial system. It. is characterized by
a lack of competition, public ownership and a lack of managerial, Xutonomy
among formal institutions, a high and =,economic level of institutional
s9ecialization, widespread subsidization and inapprqpriate pricing, and poor
loan recovery. IDA has recently opened a dialQgue with the Government on
financial sector issues.  A seties of issues papers are to be prepared and
discussed with the Government, and will cover the following areas\  savings
mobilization; regulato4i  framework; housing finance; and measures to broa#en
the availability of financial instruments. These papers are expected to be
completed in 1990.  IDA's current'strategy is to agree with the Government on
a series qf actions intended to mo;e the system towards greater flexibility in
Institutional decision makinig, introducing elements of competitionr correcting
pricing distortions, and ensuring the sustainability of public finfincial
institutions.  Agreement will also be.reached with the Government during 1990
on areas for further analysis, including thie initiation of collabor tive work
on a finan ial sector review.

A. Proiect Origin and Formiulation
2.01    -The preparation of a ftllow-on project and financing of necessary
engineering studies were provided for under the' First Urban Development
Project.  The follow-on project was originally concoived as having a two-
pronged approacht one, to provide continued suppor for the development and
Improvement o* living conditions in Addis Ababa ant secondly, to initiate a
program of development for Important market centers serving areas of
agricultural production outside of the capital. In order to sharpen the
objectives and to facilitate implementation for each approach, the Bank and
GOAi 6utually agreed in July 1989 to split the follow-on project into two
smaller projects a one, the Market Toms Development Project (appraised
June/July 1989) and two, this proposed Second Addis Ababa Urban Development
Project.
2.02     In consultation with the Bank, the GO5  assigned the Ministry of
Urban Development and Rousing (MUDE) and its National Urban Planning
Institute (NUPI) the responsibility for overall,preparation of the proposed
\Project.  As a result of two Baik project identification missions in June
and October 1987, an outline for the two Projects was developed and the
terms of reference fQr the necessary feasibility and engineering studies
*ere prepared. Preappraisal of the proposed Project took place in July
1989 and was based on the feasibility studies and-prel-imnary engineering
designs completed at that time. Appraisal took place in February 1990.
2.03     With the reorganization of government administratson rurrently
underway, Akaki town is in the process of being incorporatid iito the Addis
Ababa Administrative Region. This necessitated a shift in responsibility
for water supply services for Akaki town frou the Water Supply and Sewerage
Authority (WSSA) to the Addis Ababa Water and Sewerage Authority (AWSA),
and the Bank was officially advised of this change *n responsibility in
September 1989. While AWSA was int"oduced as aka imp$ementing' agency of the
Akaki water supply component late ini the project preparation process,
appraisal of its institutional performance was completed during appraisal.
2.04     The assessment of the existing water supply and sanitary
conditions in Akaki was carried-out as part of the preparation of the
Market Towns Development Project. As a result of this study, carried out
by VSSA's cons\iltants in 1988, it has been recognized that the existing
water supply system is'inadequate, and a major rehabilitation and expansion
is Pequired to meet the water needs of the pqpulatSon of the town, which
would be further enhanced by the proposed sites and ser*ices component.
The preparation of the 'required feasibility study and engineering designs,
followed by implementation of the water supply system e*tesion, has now
been included under the proposed Project. At the request, of GOE, IDA
agreed to provide a PPP advance of the amount of US$293,000"to finanje the
feasibility\study and engineering designs. The evaluation report of the
consultants' proposals was reviewed b 'the appraisal mission and the Bank's
no objection to award the consultancy contract to Tahal Consulting
Engineers was communicated to AWSA on February 13, 1990. It is expected



that the consultancy work would comence end-April 1990 and would be
c;p1etei ivthin six months. 
.\B. Proiect Obiectives
2.05     The Project $s designed to provide continued support for the
nation's cap$tal and would have the following objectivess
(a)  improving basic infrastructure and environmental conditions
in project areas;

management ind implementation.
Sites and Services Componente-
2.07     The sites and services component in Addis Ababa would improve upon
the efftirts to provide affordable housing to lower-income families
supported by IDA under the First Urban Development Project, which has been
succe)ssfully implomented.  A detailed description of t-e component is
included in Annex 1.  A total of 2,000 serviced plots Would be provided on
two sites, as a first phase of development. On these serviced plots, 1,900
residential core housing units. would be developed, leaving 100 serviced
plots of which 50 would be for industrial purposes and another 50 for
commercial purposes. Both sites are to the west of the city, the first in
the north-west corner adjacent to existing factories and&close to Ambo Road
on wvich about 500 plots would be developed and the second further to the
south and close to Jimma Road and existing residential development on which
about 1,500 plots would be developed. The topography and soil conditions
at both sites are generally well suited for low-cost housing development.
Both sites include some existing development which has been incorporated
into the respective site plans.  Main infrastructure services either are
already supplied to the sites or are clos1 by, and hrice off-site
infrastructure costs will be modest.
2.08     For efficiency in servicing and land usage, the sites have been
designed using 'cluster modules' and in this way the saleable areas of each
site have exceeded 60X (an improvement over the first project experience)
with densities of 40 plots/hectare. Infrattructure to be provided will
include access, drains, water reticulation 'servicing communal water
fountains, electricity supply and streetlighting. Minimal design standards
have been Adopted, although systems have been designed to perm#t
incremental improvement in the future. Infrastructure would be constructed
by AAAR through contractors.
2.09     A common plot size of 136 m2  (8m x 17m) is to be adopted to
accommodate three basic housing typologies consisting of core units, core
plus one room, and core plus three roomp.  In keeping with Ethiopian norms,
the cooking area and pit latrind are separatee from the main living area
and bedrooms. Houses have been designed as single story, duplex units and
the utility blocks at the rear are such that four separate latrines share
the use of a single pit. Maximum built-up area woul4 be about 61 m2 (core
plus thre#).  Industrial and commercial plots are aldo to have similar plot
depths as residential units for layout efficiency purposes, and plot widths
\                     \  .                               \~~~~~~~~~~~'7



would vary (in multiples of 8  ) to enable such plots to be better able to
responM to demand.  In additiol, layouts have allocated space for various
community facilities (e.g. schools and markets) to service residents, and
funds have been included in the program for such facilities.
2.10     Housing typologies proposed are such that self-help cooperative
groups can build with the mipimum of skilled labor requirements. The mix
of plots proposed is such that 70Z would be core (Type A) or core plus one
(Type B) units affordable to lower income households (Birr l 4-216 per
month).  The remaining 302 of units would be core plus three'(Type D),
which would 6e targeted to medium income households (Birr 300 and above per
month) to achieve a balanced social mix within the residential development.
The low-income tar4et group may thus be defined as households at about the.
50-70th percentiles of the urban income distribution, wh*ch repres4nts an
improvement compared to the first project, which reached only about the
60th percentile and above.
2.11     The sites and services component in Akaki would develop the first
phase'of the selected site with 350 residential plots. Core housing would
be provided on the site and to a similar layout concept as for the Addis
Ababa sites. However, plot sizes would be 160 sq. m. (20m x 8m) reflecting
the'more "rural" nature of the town compared with Addis Ababa.  Housing
designs would also be similar to those for Addis Ababa although costs are
marginally higher, primarily due to the more difficult soil conditions.
The site is well located and off-site infrastructure requirements are
modest. The housing mix would differ slightly from Addis Ababa)in that
core plus two (Type C) units would be constructed in lieu of core plus
three (Type D) units to ensure affordability, given the higher development
costs in Akaki.
2.12     Funds for the development of housing on the sites would be
channelled through'the Housing and Savings Bank (HSB), which would process
loans in cash and materials to the self-help groups ftr on-plot housing
development. The required locally unavailable building materials would be
purchased in bulk supply for the Project by the AAAR Project Implementation
Office (PTO) on behalf of HSB. During negotiations agreement was obtained
that AAARPIO manage the bulk purchase of building materials for the house
construction program on behalf Of USB and enter into an ag:eement with HSB
by DeceWber 1990 on the bulk purchasing arrangements.  Funds for the
construction of comercial and industrial facilities are expected to be
provided by individual entrepreneurs, as was the case under the First Urban
Development Project. Selection criteria to ensure affordability by
beneficiaries was discussed during appraisal for the Addis Ababa and Akaki
hkousing sqhemes and are shown in Annex 1. During negotiations agreement
was obtained regarding the beneficiary selection criteria for the
allocation of serviced plots and housing loans.
Kebele Upgrading Cov onent
2.13     Based on the experience of the First Urbani Development Project,
the program would initially support infrastructure improvements in seven
Kebeles covering some 88 hectares or about 7,000 households (approximately
43,000 people). Detailed designs and costing have been prepared fvr the
*irst phase of the program.\ In addition to this piogram, further Kebeles



-12-
would be identified and.detailed prop,sals prepared during the course of
the program. following the concepts developed for the initial phase. An
allocation of Birr 2.5 million for these additional Kebeles has bewa
included in the component. A detailed description of the component is
included in Annex 2.
2.14     Approximately 4.3 km of vehicular access and circulation, 8.3 km
of footpaths, 14.5 km of unlined drainage, 11 public water fountains to
supplement existing coverage, 66 communal latrine blocks, 28 hardstandings
for 8 m3 solid waste containers and 350 streetlights would be provided in
the initial phase of the program.
2.15     Proposals have been developed following planning, design and cost
standards which are intended to provide a balanced, least cost, basic needs
infrastructure program to spread benefits to as many people as possible, as
quickly as possible. The application of such standards has resulted in an
infrastructure upgrading program estimated to cost only about B'rr 40,000
per hectare or Birr 80 (US$40) per capita.
2.16     Works have been planned and designed to ensure that demolition of
properties and relocation is kept to a minlmum, and thus only 19 dwellings
are likely to be affected. Compensation and alternative better
accommodation will be provided within the same Kebele areas for families
requiring to be moved, for which a resettlement plan was discussed during
negotiations. As far as possible, various infrastructure upgrading works
will be carried out in an integrated manner for efficiency, to keep
disruption in the areas to a mini=um during the course of implementation
and to create an  immediate impact in the areas.
2.17     In addition to the upgrading of infrastructure, a concomitant
program addressed to improving the condition of the housing stock in the
selected Kebeles would be supported under the Project, but will be
contin&ent upon Government through MUDH initiating sale 'procedures of the
predominantly Kebele-owned houses, a decision which has already been taken
by the Central Committee for the Workers Party (during the Ni#th Plenum).
Sale of houses it expected to provide the incentive for individual
households to improvetmaintain their houses, which was not achieved under
the First Urban,Development Project. A line of credit of Birr 2.25 million
to be administeied by HSB for home improvement loans for project
beneficiaries has been included in the Project. During negotiations
agreement was obtained that, as a condition of disbursement on the Kebele
upgrading component, the Government submit proof that it has started to
sell government-owned houses in areas already improved under the First
Urban Development Project (Tekle Haimanot) as well as project upgrading
areas and promote the improvement of houses in project areas. Sale of
about 100 houses in project areas would be considered as a clear Indication
9f Government's commitment to this objective.



-is-
Kebele Development Fund
2.18     Complementary tb the upgrading program to be implemented, a loan
fund called the Kebele Development Fund (KDF) would be included, to be
administered by AAMR for Rebeles to construct optlonal community facilities
and undertake other revenue-generating projects, as done under the First
Urban Development Project.  The KDF vill be available for any Kebele
community in Addis Ababa which requires a development projec%, provided it
is able to raise 101 of the project cost and is able to demonstrate the
project's technical, financial and economic (or social) viability to the
AAAR. Appraisal of the individual schemes would be carried out by AAAR
following appraisal criteria previously established and recently reviewed
and approved by IDA. Typical projects are likely to include market
improvements, community centers, prima=y schools, public showers,
improvements'of infrastruOture, and grinding and flour mills. During
negotiations agreement was obtained to have AMAR submit the applications of
;the first four sub-loans for Kebele projects to IDA for review and approval
'.prior to granting sub-loans. Subsequent sub-loans vould be provided by
AAAR in accordance with the appraisal criteria already agreed with IDA.
2.19     Part of the funds provided for the KDF would be utilized on a
pilot basis to assist poorer women living in the Kebele areas to undertake
revenue-genera\ting projects. The eligibility criteria for sub-loans to
poor women would be determined after detailed feasibility study is carrie4
out by AAAR during pioJect start-up, and the criteria would be submitted to
IDA for approval prior to granting sub-loans. It is expected that the loan
funds would be used for such activities as preparing foodstuffs for
restaurants, pottery work, sewing training, and purchase of equipment.
University students would be engaged by AAAR to initiate discussions with
the women's associations at the Kebele level so that by the time of project
start-up, a number of proposals would have been prepated in close
cooperation with the prospective women candidates.  Due to the experimental
nature of the component, not more than 152 of the funds would toe allocated
for this\purpose. As for xebele projects, IDA would review the first four
applications for sub-loans to poor women.
Street M1aintenance Component
2.20     The First Urban Development Project supported modest investments
in Addis Ababa for street maintenance and funded a comprehensive, citywide
-study of street and drain maintenance.  This study was recently reviewed as
part of the preparation.work for the Project and a major investment program
together with vehicle and equipment needs for relevant AAAR departments and
agencies has been proposed. Twelve priority activities were identified,
and a 5-year investment program was proposed at an estimated cost of Birr
125 million. A further Birr 19 million was proposed for vehicles and
equipment.
2.21     Although important, the scale of investment proposld is beyond
AAAR's capacity.to both afford and implement. Further prioritization of
-the proposed\program was thus made by AAAR. The initial needs of the city
qre to repair and recommission existing vehicles and plant whbich have
fallen Into disrepair because of lack of spare parts owing to foreign
exchange constraints and to expand and reequip the relevant divisions and



- 14 -
-agencies in AAAR impacting on the maintenan". of roads and drains.  The
Project would thus provide vehicles, equipment and plant (over 100 items)
for the Road and Building Department, and'its toad Construction, Road
Maintenance, and Drainage and Flood Control Divisions, as well as the
Equipment Services Department and the Quarry Production Agency also under
AAAR. In concert with street maintenance programs, important traffic
management improvements and road safety measures would also be carried out.
In addition, support to AAAR's annual street and drain maintenance program
would be effected as well as technical assistance to establish a
sustainable pavement management system for the city. A detailed
description of the component is included in Annex 3.
Solid Waste Management Comonent
2.22     Investments in solid waste management were also supported under
the First Urban Development Project but were kept modest while awaiting the
outcome of an ongoing study at that time. This study and subsequent
detailed studies of specific elements of a solid waste management system
(e.g., waste generation rates and disposal options) formed the basis for
the recent review of solid waste management in Addis Ababa. This review
concluded that the simplest and most cost effective collection s,stem of
the three different systems being operated in the city is the comunal
containev system, whereby city residents are responsible for conveying
refuse from their respective households to the communal (8 m3 preferred)
containers. These containers are collected by lift trucks when full and
replaced with an empty container. Refuse collected is taken to the city's
one landfill site.
2.23     Major system deficiencies identified included a lack of spare
parts for the existing collection fleet as well as landfill plant and an
inadequate number of lift vehicles and containers to provide a basic
collection service (twice per week) to all parts of the city. Thus the
Project woulO support a solid waste management program aimed at improving
and expanding the collection service and improving landfill operational
practices, including the properly engineered development of new landfill
sites. To this en4, 28 new lift vehicles and 140 8 m3 containers would be
provided together with spare parts to extend the lives of existing vehicles
and containers. In addition, landfill plant (i.j. compactor and bulldozer)
would be provided together with civil works, in drder to assist.in
improving landfill operations and hence environmental and health conditions
on and near the site, as well as equipment, to better ensure the efficient
operation of new landfill sites of which a major site has already been
identified adjacent to the existing landfill. Technical assistance would
also be provided to assist the AAAR's Environmental Health and Social
Services Department in improving efficiency and practices in both its
collection and disposal operations as well as to review costs and
accounting of the service and the possible future role of private
contractors in refuse collection. A detailed description of the component
is included in Annex 4.
Municipal Infrastructure Component

infrastructure and environmental conditions and providing assistance to

urban service delivery agencies, a number of improvements would be provided
in Akaki. These would inc-lude road and drainage lmprov¢ments in the area
of the market and access thereto, solid waste management improvements, and
A the provision of specialized vehicles to Amprove tanitatica and road and
drain maintenance.   More spe"ifically, the component for. Akaki would
\include approximately 550 linear meters of new and upgrafed roads, 1,600
linear meters of lined and unlined drains, extension of the existing 15 Y
power line by about 1,500 linear meters to the proposed sites and senvices
housing scheme, 45 solid waste cocutainers (130 liters), a vacuum tanker,
grader and front-end loader. A detailed description of the component is
included in Annex S. 
Water $upDly Component  V
2.,25    The existing water supply system in'Akaki is not adequate to meet
the present and future needs of the town,  The Akaki water supply scheme
was constructed in 1945 based on a spring with a capacity.-of about 360
X       m3lhour. Some additional.ater is nowkprovded from the Addis Ababa water
supply system through 8 3'\diameter pipp. The distribution network -is very
old and covers only a iimited part of the towW,- with small diameter pipes
(1 112' to 2 1128).  The population of Akhki was 55,250 in 1984 (last
census). The projected population is 100,600 in the ye,ar 2000 and 148,8.0
in the year 2010, with an average water demand of 7,400 ,3lday and 14,600
m3lday, respectively (including public avid industrial wat"r de"nd).2) As
the capacity of the present system\is only about 25Z of the.effective
4emand, a major extension is requiied to provide adequate'water supply-for
the further development of the town.\
2.26    ;The Akaki River passes through the town, but it is highly polluted
with industrial waste and organic matter and cannot be considered as a
source for a water supply system. In Akaki, at present, there are about 30
production wells, serving mainly the industries, with an average yield of
about 12 m3/hour.  Additional groundwater investigation and study is
required to obtain adequate information on the possibility of using
groundwater sources for the augpentation of the present source works. The
other possible source of water is thi Addis Ababa water supply system. Its
capacity (about 180,000 m3tday, with the ongoing extension) will be
adequate for the capital city only up to about 1995. Akaki's demand-.would
account for about 4Z of the demand in Addis Ababa.in the year 2000.
2.27~  As described above, further study is neede4 to-ind6the most   -
reliable and cost-effective solution for the extension of the Akaki water
supply system.  Bowever, -for the purposes of a tentative cost estimate, it
is asstued that Akaki would be linked to the Addis Ababa ystem and would
consist of: (a) a gravity transmission main (about 7 km. long, 300 mm.
diameter), with a bulk meter, (b) storage reservoir located between Kaliti
and.,Akaki, (c) distribution network covering about 2,600 hectargs, and (d)
aux4Jiary buildings (stores and offices).  This is a conservati'e estimate;
if reliable groundwater source(s) would he-found in the vicinity of Akaki,
the, cost of the water supply extension is expected to be less.

2.31     The recently appraised Market Towns Development Project provides
significant assistance for institutional-support of the Housing and Savings
Bank (HSE) and, therefore, no further support in this area is being
provid d for USB under the troject.
D. Cost Estimates
2.32     The total project cost is estimated at Birr 96.6 million (US$46.7
million equivalent) of which about 8irr 40.6 million (US$19.6 million
equivalent) or about 422 is the foreign exchan& component. Taxes and
duties on imported goods are estimated at about Birr 11.3 million (US$5.4
million equivalent) and are included in the cost estimates. The taxes and
duties represent about 122 of the total project cost. Base costs are
expressed in end-June 1990 prices. Summary project post estimate are shown
in Ta1qle 2.1 and detailed cost estimates are given in Annex 7.,
2.33     Project costs for the sites and services, Kebele upgrading, solid
waste management. street maintenance and municipal infrastructure
components were estimated by consultants on\the basis of preliminary.
engineering designs and recent similar'contract prices and for equipment
and vehicles on the basis of recent quotations. Detailed engineering
designs for thiese components will be available during negotiations, at
which time the cost estimatesavill be reviewed. Costs for housing in Addis
Ababa and Aka4i assume self-help construction and represent estimated
mortgage requirements. Land acquisition costs are not required but
compensation costs for crops and structures have been estimated. Cost
eitimatea for AAAR and AMSA technical assistance, training and management
staff support are based on recent actual costs for similar activities.
Notional sums have been included for house upgrading loans in Kebeles, the
Kebele Development Fund, and the second phase of Kebele upgrading. Project
costs for the water supply components are based on the assumption, that
Akaki would be supplied from the existing Addis Ababa system requ4ring the
physical components as mentioned previously, utilizing recent similar
contract prices.
2.34     Physical contingencies are estimated at 10? of base costs
(excluding technical assistance, training and Kebele development loans).
Price continigencies for local currency costs are,\based on expected
increases in construction costs of-AZ-per annum during the project
Implementiation period. The corresponding rates for foreign costs are 4.9?
per annum for 1990-95 and 3.7Z per annum thereafter. In total, physical
contingencies are estimated at about 97 of base cost and price
contingencies are estimated at 172 of base cost plus physical -
contingencies.

would-be passed on to USB as a loan to support thd financing of the
construction of residential houtes on the sites and services developmentsS
and house improvement loans in Kebeles for which thb  costs would 'be
recovered through mortgage payments. The loan to HSSa would be made at an
interest rate of 1.52 to be repaid over 26 years including six years of
grace on repayment of principal.  The proposed terms are the same as the-
terms undei the prior IDA Credit and the HMarket Towns Development Project
and would provide for an adequate spread Of about 3t on these operations.
During negoti~tions agreement was obtained that Government enter into
subsidiary loin agreements with AAAR, AWSA and USB as a condition of
effectiveness of the IDA Credit.

Terms of Loans to Beneficiaries
2.40    Residential Nortases.  Loans to cooperatives and Individuals for
constructi9n of residential houses at the sites and services schemes )uld
be advanced in tranches uiith a 1OX advance, a 152 installment after
foundation work is completed and the remainder provided according to
construction progress. The loans would be made at HSB's prevailing terms
for owner-occupied residential properties. The loans would carry variable
interest rates with initial interest rates of 4.S5 for cooperatives and 71
for individuals to be repaid over 20-25 years, according to the age of the
recipient.  A one-year grace period on mortgage.payments would be provided,
roughly corresponding to the expected house construction period. Interest
would be paid during the construction period. The mortgage amount would
also include administration and appraisal fees, and mortgage redemption and
fire insurance .harges. Loans to cooperatives and individuals for home
improvement in Kebele upgrading areas would be provided on the sawe terms,
although the requirement for mortgage redemption insurance would be waived.
2.41    Rebele Development Loans. Loans to Kebiles and poor women for
revenue-generating and other development projects would be provided by AAAR
at HSB's prevailing interest rate for cooperative residential lending,
currently 4.3r. The loans to Kebeles would be provided with two
maturities, reflecting the service ikature of the projects. For income
generating projects such as public showers and grinding mills, the loans
would be required to be repaid in six years. For other developeent
projects, the loans would be required to be repaid in twenty years.
Beneficiary Kebeles would be required to raise at least 102 of the project
cost to ensure their  oma*itment. The loans to poor women would be expected
to be repaid in up to six years.
Tnjlation and Interest Rates                         -
2.42    Inflation's rates 31 in Ethiopia were about 3X in'1985186, -4.51
in 1986187 and 22 in 1987188 "nd are estimated to be about 41 each year
over the medium term. Interest rates on NSB mortgage loans are-
administered by the National Bank of Ethiopia and have generally kept ahead
of inflation in recent years. Interest rates on loans to subborrowers
would be set at prevailing interest rates and are therefore expected to be
positive in real terms for the residential building and improvement loans
t the sites and services and Kebeile upgrading schemes supported by the
Project. Interest rates on loans to Kebeles\ for 4evelopment projects would
be set at the BSB interest rate for cooperatives and are therefore also
expected to be positive in real terms.
F.  Implementation Arrangements  \
2.4    'The lead agency for the project would be the Addis Ababa
Administrative Region (AAAR) which would monitor the overall project's
progress, coo  inatw with other implementing agencies -and be the focal
-' SI  As aesured by changes in the GDP deflator.

point for communicating with the Bank through its Project Implementation
Office (PlO). The AAAR would also have primary responsibility for
implementing the street maintenance, solid waste management, Xebele
upgrading, municipal infrastructure and sites and services infrastructure
components as well as the Kebele Development Fund. The Kebele upgrading
and sites and services schemes would be implemented in close coopcration
wt;th the water and electri-ity authorities.  To carry out the upgrading and
sites and services projects, the AAAR would be strengthening its PIO,
established for the purposes of carrying out the Fitst Urban Development
Project. Street maintenance and solid waste management components would be
carried out by existing city departments. The overall staffing and
organizational arrangemetts for AAAR components were reviewed and agreed
during appraisalq
2.44    The Housing and Savings Bank (HSB) would extend housing
co4astruction and improvement loans to cooperatives and Individuals who will
build or upgrade their own homes through self-help and would manage
collections for the schemes through its existing department structure and
branch offices. HSB has demonstrated its ability to administer a similar
level of lending in Addis Ababa under the First Urban Development Project.
For its responsibilities for project monitoring and reporting, BSB will
establish a project implementation unit (PIU) reporting to the Deputy
General Manager. These staffing and organizational arrangements were
reviewed and agreed during appraisal.
2.45    The Addis Ababa Water and Sewerage Authority (AWSA) would be
responsible for implementation of the Akaki water supply component. AWSA
has successfully carried out several large investment projects in the
recent past, and is considered to have the general capability to implement
the proposed Project.   The supervision of construction would be carried
out by consultants". AWSA has established a Project Office which is
adequately staffed. During negotiations agreement was obtained regarding
AAAR, HSB and AWSA staffing and organizational requirements which would be
maintained over the project period.
2.46    A high-level Project Advisory Committee would be formed to resolve
issues during iplementation and would be comprised of senior officials of
each of the implementing agencies and chaired by the Minister of MUDH. The
composition of the Project Advisory Committee was agreed during appraisal.
During negotiations agreement was obtained regarding the composition of tte
Project Advisory Committee which would be established by December 31, 199t
and maintained over the project period.
2.47    Project implementation would be expected to begin in early 1991
and would be carried out over a six-year period. The project
implementation schedule was developed during appraisal and is included as
Annex 8.

2.49     Procurement of the civil works contracts and-supply contracts 4/
for the electrical and mechaFical equipment for the Akaki' water supply
component would be on the bab$s of international competitive bidding (ICB).
The bid documents would be prepared by the en;ineerint consultants of the
Implementing agency (AWSA). After review by AWSA, the bid documents would
be transmitted to IDA for review.  Prqcurement of the civil works contracts
for the k-ousing infrastructure components Sl would also be on the basis of
ICB. The bid documents will be prepared by AAARPIO and transmitted to IDA
for review.
2.50     Procurement of civil works contracts for street maintenance, solid
waste management and municipal infrastructure components 6/ would be made
on the basis of local competitive bidding (LCB) as their individual values
would be small (average value estimated at VS$0.2 million equivalent) and
the works would be spread over six years and different locations. LCB
procedures in Ethiopia have been reviewed and are acceptable to the Bank.
LCB procedures will include advertisement in local newspapers, public bid
opening, specific criteria for evaluation, and award to the lowest
evaluated bidders. Foreign bidders who wish to participate iwill not be
precluded from participation. The eligibility of public sector enterprises
will be in accordance with Bank procedures. All contracts with a value
above US$100,000 equivalent would be subject to review by IDA.
2.51     In order to ensure the timely availability and least cost of the
building materials (e.g., glass, reinforcement bars, roofing sheets, etc)
that are not produced locally or are in short supply for the housing
development and Kebele house upgrading components, these materials 7/ will
be procured in bulk contracts through ICB.  Similarly, Eaterials for the
street maintenance component 8I that are not produced locally (e.g.
bitumen) will be procured in bulk contracts through ICB.  The bid documents
would be prepared by AAARPIO and transmitted to IDA tor review.  The
building materials would be received, stored and distributed by AAAPIO on
behalf of BSB. Contracts for building materials and materials for street
maintenance estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$20,000 each up
to an aggregate amount of US$200,000 may be procured on the basis of
international shopping from at least three suppliers from two countries.
41 Total values established at US$4.9 million and US$0.4 million
respectively.                                           \

2.52     Vehicles sad miscellaneous equipment 91 fot AAAR and AWSA would be
combined into supply contracts and- would be procured through ICB. The bid
documents vould be prepared by the respective agencies and transmitted to
IDA for review.
2.53     Feasibility studies aid engineering designs, preparation of bid
documents, and construct on supervision of the Akaki water supply component
vill be carried out by consultants to be employed by the implementing
~gency (AVSA), whose qualifications, experience and terms and conditions
shall be satisfaetory to IDA. Consultants and specialists will be employed
by the implementing agescies for additional studies, advisory services and
training purposes.  Such consultants shall be selected in accordance with
the .Guidelnes for the Use of Consultants by world Bank Borrowers and by
tbe World Bank as Executing Agency* publi*had by the World EBank i*a August
2.54     Force Account is presently used by AAAR's load and Building
Department to carry out about, 809 6f Its street maintenane program 
(estimated at U6$6.7 million equivalent), but this percentage would reduce
over the project period with the increasing use of private contractors for
maintenance works. The Project would futd about 252 of the city's annual
maintenance program, in addition to vehicles and equipment for various
divisions of the Road and Building Department.  Bank funding would be
utilized for those parts of the annual maintenance program carried out by
contractors as well as for important materials for the program (e.g.,
bitumen) as described in paras. 2.51 and 2.52 above.
2.55     The General Procurement Notice will be published in the
Development Business Forum, at least 60 diayi prior to the issue of the bid
documents. 
R.  Disbursement
2.56     The proceeds of the IDA Credit would be disbursed against:
(i) 1002 of foreign and 552 of local expen1itur's on civil works
and surply contracts for the water supply component;
(ii)  1002 of foreign expenditures bn material supply contracts for
the housing development and street maintenance components;
(iii) 1OO2 of foreign and 702 of local expenditures on civil works
contracts for housing, street maintenance, solid waste
management and municipal infrastructure components;
(iv)  10O2 of foreign expenditures for vehicles and miscellaneous
E       X   \     equipment;.u
91 Total value of vedlicles and equipment (including spare parts) estimated
at US$0.2 million'=and US$13.2 million, respectively.

(vii)  10S of expenditures for AAAR's Project Implementation Office
salaries; and
\(viii) 75? of expenditures for housing construction and upgrading
loans.-
2.57     The disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 9.  It is expected
that 4i$s,burvements would be completed-by June 30, 1997, about one year
4fter the ccopletion of civil wo*i. - isbursements'would be made against
stand*rd, W  docusentation.  Disbursemats. under categoies (ii), (tvii)
and (v    '*u t id be mada, on the basS. of statemgnts of expenditure .(0E)
for contracts and purchase orders Withb atotal. :Vsue of 'less than
US$50,000.  In order to ensure the timely provisiun 6f funds available to,
finance the capital costs of the project, it is proposed that the
Government establish separate Special Accounts for AAAR, USB and AWSA in
the amounts of US$2.0 million, US$1.0 million, and US$0.6 million,
respectively.  Funds in the Special Accounts would be available to finance
only eligible expenditures under the Prkject.  During negotiations
agreement was obtained regarding the arrangements for establishing and
operating the Special Accounts.
I.  Accounts and Audits
2.58     Project accounts would be prepared by each implementing agency,
including AAAR, HSB and'AWSA, for their respective parts of the Project.
The proje~t-accounts would identify all sources and uses of funds in
carrying out the Project, including a detailed actounting of the use of the
proceeds of the IDA Credit. The project accounts would be audited by an
independent auditor acceptable to IDA and the audit report submitted,to IDA
within nine months of the end of the fiscal year. The project accounts'
audit reports woZd also contai# a separate opinion on the statement of
expenditure (SOB) procedure wheti utilized.
2.59     In order to monitor the fin#n ial performance of AAAR, HSB and
AWSA, all revenue-generating implemeat i agencies, their financial
statemen s (Income and Expenditure Statements for AAAR, I4come Statments
and Ealanice Sheets for'HSB and AWSA) along with the project accounts would
be audited by an auditor acceptable to IDA and the audit reports would be
sumitted to IDA within nine months of the end of fiscal year.  The audit
reports would contain a separate opinion on compliance by Implementing
agencies wtih all finncial covenants under the IDA Credit and operation of
the AAAR, HSB and AWSA Special Accoutts.  It is expected that Audit
Services Corporation (ASC) would carry out the audits, and this arrangement
is considered acceptable.

Of AAAR's and AWSA's financial statements, however, is not currently up-to-
date due to delays by both agencies in finalizing their accounts.  Both
agencies have placed a high priority on finalizing their accounts and
submittins,them for audit.  This is expected to permit proper audits of
AAAR's and AWMA's accounts to be carried out two years after project start-
up. Therefore, during negotiations agreement was obtained from AAAR and
AWSA that the first two years audit reports would be received by the Bank
within twelve months of the end of each fiscal year and within nine months
thereafter. lS8's audit report would be expected to be received within
nine months of the end of"each fiscal year.
J.  Environmental Impact
2.61     The Project would lead tp significant iMaprovemento and tangible
benefitof to the envi ronment  n tbt Addis Ababa Administrative Region.
Critical sinitation defickencls which have created eatremely poor
envirtomental and health conditlons in the Kebeles would be addressed by
the pro,ision of additional latrines in order that greater numbers of
people have access to a proper facility, thereby reducing the use of open
spaces and watercourses. Drainage would be also be improved and extended,
thus reducing the risk of flooding and its attendant detrimental
environmental and health effects.
2.62     The solid waste management component in Addis Ababa would both
improve and expand the refuse collection service by providing more
containers and lift vehicles, benefiting more people and providing a more
regular and reliable service. Garbage dumps that currently accumulate
around full bins should be reduced and th re will be less need to resort to
drains and watercourses for the dumping ol refuse.   Environmental
conditions should improve considerably as a result of the expanded
containerization and collection facilities. In addition, the unsanitary
landfill site will be cldsed, properly covered with earth and left in a
sanitary condition. The new landfill site'(s) will be developed following
normally accepted sanitary landfill operational practices, again having a
significant environmenta-l impact on the neighborhoods in the vicinity of
the landfill site(s).
2.63     The street maintenance program .ill also have an environmental
spin-off by improving the condition of roads and drains, reducing the
number of potholes and unreinstated utility trenches which often result in
stagnant pools of dirty water during the rainy seasons and which are both
displeasing to the eye as well as hazardous to motorist and pedestrian
alike.
2.64     Nineteen restdential structures will be affected Ay the Kebele
tipgrading component in Addis Ababa. Given that about 7,000 households
would benefit from improvements in the first phase of the program, the
small number of displaced households is testimony to the sensitive
appl.cation of design standards in these dense areas (approx. 400-700
pers.nsIha). A detailed resettlement plan, based on a socio-economic
survey, has been prepared for the relocation of the affected families and
can be summarized as follows:                                    -



-28-
(a) three families (presently tenants), wish to build their pwn
houses using their own savings and mortgage loans. Plots ---
haave been identified, and AAAR will assist them in the land
transfer process. If any of these families are not eligible
for a mortgage loan and their own funds are not adequate,
AAAR will provide them with newly constructed rental houses;
(b) six families (presently oa..er occupants) will be provided
with newly constructed housing units by AAAR free of charge;
and
(c) ten families (presently Kebele house tenants) will be
provided with newly constructed rental houses.
The resettlement plan ensures that each affected family will have better
accommodation and it better locations than at present. Those families who
will mave to new rental housing are willing to pay higher ronts which will
be proportional to their incomes. All new houses will be completed before
the old structures are demolished. AAAR will also provide assistance to
the families to move to their new homes.
2.65     In Akaki, the municipal infrastructure improvements to be
supported by the Project would also have a positive environmental impact.
Since Akaki does not have proper facilities for the regular and sanitary
emptying of pit latrines, cesspools and septic tanks, a vacuum tanker would
be provided thereby reducing the incidence of overflowing of facilities,
the resulting pollution of the environment and the attendant health
hazards. The water supply scheme will extend the coverage of piped water
supply to the lower-income groups who now rely on u#healthy water sources.
The towns's open channel drains, where these exist, act as sullage carriers
as well as stonm-ater drains. With an increase in the supply of water to
the town, sullage flows wiZl increase and thus the proposed improvements to
key town center drains and outfalls will be particularly important in
enhancing environmental conditions.  In addition, the improvements will not
involve any resettlement of families during implementation of the Project,,
and compensation for crops and damages caused by construction activities
will be paid in accordance with the laws of Ethiopia.
2.66    The new housing developments in Addis Ababa and Akaki will also not
result in any resettlement or adve se environmental impacts.

III. IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
A. Addls Ababa AdministrAtive Region
Background and Organization
3.01       The implementing agency for the sites and services, Kebele
upgrading, street maintenance, solid waste management and municipal
infrastructure components of the Project and the Kebele Development Fund
would be the Addis Ababa Administrative Region (AAAR). Addis Ababa
municipality (predecessor of AAAR) with support from the Ministry of Urban
Development and Housing (MNDE) has satisfactorily i         emented its
components under the prior IDA-supported First Urban Development Project.
3.02       The municipality of Addis Ababa, with an estimated 1968
population of about 1.8 million, was created ir 1942, and ii 1954 the city
was granted its charter, giving the city an element of autonvuy not eajoyed
by any, other city in Ethiopia. As a chartered urban center, it.can, with
the approval of the Council of Ministers, set tax rates and charges,
instead of being required to submit proposals for tax increases to MME for
approval as is the case for other municipalities. In the September 1988
government reorganization, 'the Addis Ababa region has been expanded to
include surrounding districts including Akaki, and the city of Addis Ababa
and neighboring towns have been placed under a regional administration
reporting to the Council of Ministers. While the details-are still being
worked out, the Addis Ababa Administrative Regioh will comprise the former
Addis Ababa municipality and other town administrations absorbed into the
regional boundary.
3.03       A municipality is defined as a group of associations of1urban
dwellers with an aggregate population in excess of 2,000. The stritcture of
a municipality currently comprises the following hierarchy of urban
dwellers' associations:
,Kebeles are the smallest associations and* are composed of all the
adult members of a community who elect a policy committee which has
three subordinate committees (revolutionary defense, inspection and
i - executive)-d a judicial tribunal, the Kebeles report through Awraja
(district) offices to the municipality.
Central Associations which constitute municipalities and which are
made up of representatives of Kebeles. These bodies have a judicial
tribunal, inspection and revolutionary defense committees and an
executive committee which is responsible for administration, land,
technical and community services.
3.04       Lthough Kebeles may raise funds and take initiatives to improve
their local conditions, it is the municipalities which are the sXecutive
--urban authorities. The powers and duties of a typical municipality include
the followings (a) preparation of-urban land rent, urban house tax and
service charges and submission to MUDE for approval (submission to Council
of Ministers in the case of Addis Ababa); (b) preparation, submission to
HUDH and, when approved, imlementation of the urban center's master plan;
*                                                         ~~~~~~~~~~-



-0
(c) operation and maintenance of strets, squares, market places,
cemeteries, transport services, social service programs, theaters and
cinemas, fire fighting, ambulance and sanitary services; (d) collection of
rents on lands and houses within the urban center rented for up to Birr 100
per month; (e) collection of charges, rents, taxes and fees due to
municipalities under various laws in force; and (f) operation of revenue-
generating activities including abattoirs, quarries and pharmacies through
autonomous agencies.
3.05       The municipality of Addis Ababa is headed by a Chief
.Administrator who acts as Chairman of the City's Executive Committee
comprised of the three senior managers (Secretary, First and Second Deputy
Administrators) in addition to the Chief Administrator. The Secretary to
the Chief Administrator is responsible for the staff functions (of legal
services, public relations, management services, and personnel and training
services) and is the conduit for reportlng by the Kebeles and Awraja
(disttict) Offices.  The First Deputy Secretary is responsible primarily
for technical matters and oversees four departments (including City,
Planning and Development, Road and Auilding, Planning and Programiig
Services and $quipment Services). X addition, three city enterprises
(Bakery, Quarry Production Agency, and Abattoir) and the Fire,Brigade
report to the Firet Deputy Administrator. The-Second Deputy Administrator
is responsible primarily for financial matters and health services and
6versees three departmeFts (Revenue Administration, Accounts and General
Services, and Health and Social Service Departments). The remainmg
enterprises (Pharmacy, City Hall Theatre and Culture Center; and
Cafeteria/Bar) report to the Second Deputy Administrator. The city has
about 3,800 permanent employees and hires temporary staff as needed for its
maintenance activities. The organization of the municipality is currently
under review as to how it can be merged with the regional administration
organization established recently. Until the details are worked out, the
municipality will assume its additionai responsibilitAes for the
surroundings areas absorbed into its regional boundary\through existing
city departments. AAAR's organization is shown in Chart 1.
Municipal Finances
3.06       General.  The key sources of revenue for municipalities as
established and prescribed by proclamation are trade license fees, urban
land rent and urban building tax (property taxes) and various service and
license fees. In addition, municipalities can derive additional income.
from commercial rents and from taxes on economic activities unique to the
towns; these sources of income are not prescribed by the Central
Government. Most of the basic taxes and service and license fees 4ave not
been legally increased since the early 1970's. As a result, many towns
have sought other sources of revenue or have imposed increases for which
they have not received legal sanction.
3.07       Addis Ababa must submit its forthcoming annual budget of
revenues and expenditure to the Council Qf Ministers, and other
municipalities to VUDB, for approval prior to commencement of the financial
year.  Municipalities are required to be financially self-sufficient with
expenditures contained within revenues, since they receive no regular*
suibventions from Gove7nment, except for shares of customs taxes and minor



_31-
assistance in kind. *=icipaliiies can also utilize accumulated cash
reserves and occasionally have been permitted to borrow from MUDH on
interest-free terms for capital development schemes. The loan funds
available from MUDH, however, have been inadequate to finance any
significant amount of capital investment.
3.08       The rece;nt financial positions of Addis Ababa and Akaki
municipalities are summarized in Annex 10. Revenues and expenditures for
each of the last three financial years, together with accWuulated reserves
as of June 1989, are displayed for each municipality along with projections
of financial performance through 1996197.
3.09       Addis Ababa.  Addis Ababa has been one of the poorer
municipalities in terms of annual revenue raised per capita, which was only
Birr 15.58 (US$7.53) in 1987188.   A significant factor is that the city
has not increased its trade licence fee schedule since 1952, and.has not
increased building and lbid taxes since 1979.  A submission to the Council
of Ministers for tax increases was made in 1984, but has still tot been
enacted.
3.10       Of the total annual expenditure in 1088189, about 722 was
absorbed by recurrent expenses, of which the largest single item was
salariea, rep'resenting 652 of all recurrent costs. Other significant itemas
of expense were vehicle operating and maintenance costs, other,maintenance,
and office furniture and equipment.-'Capital expenditure represented the
balance of 28Z of annual outlay. Expenditures on roads and bridges was the,
major category, followed by property development and construction, vehicle
purchase and various other works.  Over the period since 1981, income to
Addis Ababa municipality has stagnated l  real terms, recurrent expenditure
has shown a similar trend and capital expenditure has shown modest growth.
The gradual increase in capital expenditure has caused an annual deficit
which has been incurred in every year since 1981182 until .988189. This
deficit has been financed by drawing upon accumulated reserves which were
reduced to a level of Birr 9.5 million as of end-1987188.
3.11       As a result of historically,low per capita municipal revenue
generation, together with commitments to major expenditure (primarily self-
financed)'in shopping centers and other property development through
1989190, the city of Addis Ababa was expected to be in a cash deficit of up
to Birr 10.8 million as of end-1989/90. The new (since December 1988)
regional administtation has taken a number of ppsitive steps which have
totally reversed the declining trend in revenue performance such that by
end-FY89190, the City is expected to have accumulated reserves amounting to
about Birr 10 million. It has auctioned the leaseholds on shops in the new
Piazza commercial develbpment and the Insurance Buildini and is expected to
receive'about Birr 6.9 iuillion from this source in 1989190. The city vould
receive a large boost in propertylin4ome from rental of these more
explnsive buildings. It is also vtigorously pursuing the registration and
taxation of unregistered building plots, unlicensed traders, cost recovery
on municipal services (particularly sanitation charges)-and collection of
arrears. It has also strengthened its finance and accounting departments
and hire4 more qualified sjtaff to pmanage its revenFe and finance functions."
These measures have alread* resultid in a 402 incr'ase in revenues received
duking the first half of FY89190 and should be sufficient to enhance annual



re*eAues by approximately Birr 20 million durin  the yjar, with an expected
substantial improvement in its overall financLal situation.
3.12       M       aki.   Akaki is one of the -inancially stronger municipalities
in terms of annual revenue raisednper capita. which vas Birr 31.32
(Uf$25.13) in'1987188. Akakk town has enjoyed the benefit of financially
r taware leadership, has sought to Impose tax increases where possible within
the last five years and, in particular, has identified its unique economic
activity (diverse manufacturing industries) as a source of tax reyenue. As
for Addis Ababa, a submission to the Council of Ministers by MUDH on behalf
of Akski and all other municipalities for property tax increases and
introduction of a head tax was -made in 1985, but has not as yet been
enacted.  Despite its inability to legally increase taxes in recent years,
revenues have increased faster than \expenditures such that accumulated
reserves homve been increasing over the past three years to about Dirr 1.3.
miUllJon as of end-1987/88.  This level of reserves is nearly 14Z of the
size of.Addle Ababa's reserves at the same time, and is notable in that
.~-m   hAkaki's population baa4 is only about 1 of A4dis Ababa's.
S. 13      The potential for revenue lncreases for Akaki of up to about 35Z
in liqenses and taxes at present-tax levels has been estimated by
consultants during the preparation of this Project to be possible through
tie implementation of improved collection policies, record-keeping and
taxpayer identification.  A financial management consultancy unit to be
established within MUDH is being supported under the Market Towns
Development Project.  This unit is expec,ted to assist, kaki and other
municipalities in improving their revenuo performance ind accounting
procedures.
Project Impact oI Municipal uIILets
P.14       Proposed capital expenditures for street maintenance and solid
waste management improvements, housing infrastructure, Kebele upgrading and
the Kebele Development Fund in Addis Ababa municipality as'well as
Anstitutioft, support to be undertaken as part of the Project would amount
to about Birk 62.5 million.   Proposed capital expenditures for
improvements to housing and municipal infrastructure and equipment and
vehicles in Akaki mur4cipality would amount to about birr 2.3 million.  The
affordability of the proposed infrastructure components for both Addis        t
Ababa and Akaki is analy"    in Annex 10.' The' analysis is based on the
assumptions that: (a) increased yields in various taxes and charges of
about 352 can be adhieved for Akaki in phased piogress over the three years
ending in 1992/93, which would require improvements in collection and
administrative efficiency with assistance to be provided by a centrally-
based unit to be established at MUDR; (b) increased yields in various
taxes, charges, rents and enterprise activities of about 802 can be
achi#ved for Addis Ababa during 1P89190 with modest gro th th4reafter as a
resuit of improvements in collection and administrative efficiency already
being imp}le nted; and (c) on-lending of IDA funds ,is at'an interest \ate
of A.5; per annum, with about a 252 contribution frbm each P nicipality
towards the t';tak capital cost of tblir respective,parts of the Project.



- 33 -
3.15       The financial forecasts demonstrate that both Addis Ababa and
Akaki would be able to comfortably afford the proposed project recurrent
expenditures and debt service as well as capital contributions based on
existing sources of revenues and-Improved collection procedures without tax
increases. Addis Ababa would also be able to undertake a significant and
growing additional capital expenditure program, growing from about Birr 20
mill4on to Birr 40 million by the end of the project period. Since the
prop'sed investments in Akaki are easily affordable and Akski is currently
in the process of being incorporated into AAAR, Akaki's strong financial
position would have a positive impact on the overall financial situation of
Addis Ababa.
Financial Management
3.16       Addis Ababa municipality's financial and management information
systems were reviewed by consultants in 1984 and recommendations provided
to improve the city's accounting, budgeting and financial management
information systems and to introduce computerization of the accounting
system. Significant progress has been madt with introduction of these
recomuendations. Additional assistance is needed to improve the city's
cost accounting system in order to permit cost centers to be established in
the accounts which classify expenditures and revenue, where appropriate, by
municApal activity to facilitate the setting of charges to better ensure
cost recovery. In addition, assistance is needed to support the further
computerization of the accounting system, particularly in the areas of
revenue accounting, stores, and equipment and vehicle operations. Under
the new regional administration, a cost accounting section has already been
established. Addis Ababa will be able to draw upon the Financial Advisor
proposed for MUDH's Financial Management Consultancy Unit (supported under
the Market Towns Development Project) for additional guidance and advice in
this area. A provision of US$240,000 is included under the Project, to
support a program of cost accounting and data processing development,
training and procurement of computers and related equipment.
S.  Housing and Savinas Bank
Backgroumd and Organization
3.17       The Housing and Sairings Bank (HSB) was established in 1975 as
the only bank with a mandate for mortgage lending. It is a Government-
owned saviigs and loan association under the supervision of the National
Bank of Ethiopia. HSB's loans are provided primarily to housing
cooperatives, private individuals and state enterprises for construction
and purchase of 'single family dwillings and commercial buildings. While it
is permitted to finance real eatate for private businesses, it has apppoved
few loans to this sector within the last three years.  The bank is
empowered to raise funds by accepting savings and time dep'osits and by
borrowing.  HSB would be expected to administtr the housin4  loans under the
proposed Project and has demonstrated satisfactory administrative capacity
in implementing similar housing loansiprogram under the prior IDA-supported
First Urban Developmett Project. It currently operates from a ,large head
office in Addis Ababa and has ten btanch offices located in Addis eAtema,
k~ 



- 34 -
Asmara, Awassa, Debre Zeit, Oondar, Jima, Nazareth, Dire Dawas, Bsakr Dar
and Dessie, reflecting geographical patterns of current housing ¢emand.  It
also plans to extend its branch network further throughout the country with
the proposed est4blishment of branches in Goba, Assela and Aseb in the
1990-92 time frame.
3.10       In practice, the majority of fSB's lending in terms of value of
loans has been to state-owned enterprises for non-residential buildings.
These typically large loans are the most cost-effective for HSB to
administer and reflect the priority given to state enterprises in obtaining
access to the limited supplies of building materials at controlled prices.
However, in accordance with its mandate and with Government policy, there
has been a major increase in lending to housing cooperatives during recent
years. Over the last three years, fSB has approved about 2,500 loans
totalling approximately Birr 30 million to self-help housing cooperatives
under the ID4-supported First Urban Development Project. HSB management
has indicated that one of its key objectives over the near term is to place
more emphasis on residential lending and lending to housing cooperatives
and the lower-income groups. Whereas previously a financial limit was
placed on the size of a residential loan, this no longer applies as current
regulations prohibit construction of new houses above 70nm. A schedule of
loans approved over the last five years by class of borrower and total
value is shown in Annes 11.
3.19       The organization is headed by a General Manager and his deputy
and has recently been reorganized into seven departments which manage
accounting, credit, control, administration functions, engineering
services, legal ssrvices, and research and planning, as shown in Chart 2.
The reorganization completed in June 1988 was designed to separate head
office policy and supervisory functions from the day-to-day banking
operations, most of which are transacted at the head office branch. The
number of fSB's staff-has grown from 315 in 1983184 to 474 in June 1989,
keeping pace with the expansion in business and the extension of its
services through the opening of branch offices.  During this period, the
value of HSB's advances to bOrrowers per employee increased by 28t while
the number of loan approvals processed increased by about 300S,
demonstrating a greater efficiency in its operations. However, while the
senior management is well-qualified and experienced, fSB is currently
facing a shortage of qualified staff at middle management level in all
departments. Furthermore, its management information requirements and
overall information systems strategy need to be reviewed in light of its
anticipated growth and changing technology. During negotiations of the
proposed Market Towns Development Project, agreement was obtainei that HSB
carry out an internal review by June 1991 of its overall information
requirements, including requirements for software, hardware and manpower
development and implement recommendations after discussion with IDA.  It is
expected that HSB would seek guidance from the National Bank of Ethiopia on
t,he information and computer requirements. An allowance for software,
hardware and training requirements have been provided for-under the Market
Towns Development Project.
3.20       Administration of the proposed house construction and
improvementloans included under the Project will accentuate fSBH's- own
perceived need for additional training for middle management to support



-35-
present grovth and to provide succession to senior management. Areas in
which academic and on-the-job training are particularly required over the
next five years includet (8) on-the-job training in the engineering aspects
of slum upgrading, and design and construction of low-cost housing; and (b)
post-graduate academic courses in architectureIcivil engineering,
international economics and banking, buqiness pdministration, computer
science, legal, and training methods and skills.  Support is included under
the Market Tovns Development Project for a suitable training program. In
addition, the spread of the housing projects over distant locations will
not only require a strengthening of HSB's engineering, supervision and
appraisal capabilities but will also require that the additional personnel
be supported by additional vehicles and equipment, also included under the
Market Towns Development Project.
Financial Policies,and Performance
3.21      Past Performance.  HSB has performed well in an environment of
strict government regulation over its activities. Its operating
performance for the 5-year period is summarized below in Table 3.2 and
detailed in Annex 11.  Mortgage assets have grown steadily from Birr 219
million to Birr 368 million or by 682 over the period and operating
surpluses increased from about 14Z to 562 of operating revenues during the
period. This improvement reflects the fact that while operating,revenues
increased by about 342 due to the growth in the volume of lending,
operating expenses decreased by 312 due to the overall lowering of interest
rates in 1986187 and HSB's greater efficiency in loan administration. As a
result, accumulated deficits improved from -Birr 3.7 million to -Birr 0.5
millioin over the period. In 1987188 HSB had an average cost of borrowed
funds of about 2Z, an average return from mortgages of 62, and an average
spread on operations of about 42. Despite these significant achievements,
HSB's overall finrncial position is weak primarily as a result of the 1975
nationalization of urban land and properties which had a severe adverse
impact on its loan portfolio and as a result of other Government policies.
In order to address HSB's weakness, agreement was obtained during
negotiations of the Market Towns Development Project that HSB complete a
housing finance study by March 1993. The study would be expected to
identify measures necessary to gradually move HSBE towards more competitive,
market-oriented banking practices in the future and address the policy
issues described belows

favoredIcooperatives relative to government-owned e\terprises which
benefitted when compared with individuals and private organizations anc (b)
favored housing construction relative to all other-sectors. The interest
rates applicabletfor housing development by cooperatives became 4.52 and by
iiidividuals became 72 and for purchase of houses by individuals became 82.
The interest rate applicable to state enterprises for non-residential
construction became 8?.
3.23        Interest rates on savings deposits earn 62 pEr annum on
accounts with balances no more than Birr 100,000 and 2B an accounts with
higher balmnces. Interest' rates on time deposits vary from 7.5whper annum
for privatt   individuals investing for five years to 12 for financial and
government insgitrution which are only allowed to place funds in ont year
time deposits.'_-ost of the time deposits, which represent 842 of HSB's
total debt and equity finanhing, are invested in by the insuratce sector
aind Governmt pension funds which earn only 12. Since irvflation is
currently estimated at about 41, interestprates paid by HSB oi the bulk of
deposits are negative in real terms. Although interest rates paid on these
ctimerdepositsio rennattractive, by law the insurance  -cm i          pension
\      .2           ntretrsesomseig deposits,er are uptqome annudo
.funds are required to place specificlevels of deposits with HSe and these
deposito are nord aly rosled over a4tomatically, since other investment
opportunities are not available.  This directed and subsidized funding
provides a disincentive to Se  to'mobilize its "own repsource  and adversely
affects the developmeuit of pension and insurance furids as i major source of
funds over the longer term. The housing finance study included uider the
Market Towns Development Project will. therefore, examine interest rate and
directed credit policies and recombend appropriate pricing irianiples and
sources of funds required to suppoirt alhousing finnce system which is
expected tr be expanded ' 'the futiore aas the bottlenecks to h using
production are removed a*id housing policies are revised.
3.24        Mismatch of BprrOEion and keinsraturities.  HSB mortgages
for resident*al purposes have  oaturities up to 30 years, and are typically
for 20-25 yeaDe since the loPnrec tst be fully repaidby age 55. -For state
-enterprise borrowing for non-residential purposes, loans may have
maturciesoi£up to 20 years, but 10-15 years is typical.eI Lastly,. loaiis to
private buinesses are for a maximum periodof 10 years.  However, these
loans are primarily financed by'savings and one-year time deposrits, which
together account' for 91 of total debt and equity financing. Although
these deposits have grown steadily, Ho  yheavy reliance on such deposits
to finance its growing medium- to long-term flortgage portfolio may present
a high level of term intermediation risk in t-he event of a sudden call on
denpoits.  bSr'si mortgages are variablpu-rate i     lostruments, bt if tbe  low-
cost ime deposits are to be withdrawn by Goverment, a major Impact on the
demand for and type of loan offered by USB could result. Thus the survival
of gSe  is'a function of the Goverment continuing to decree that 'its
thpension plan and igiirance corporation continue to invest in time deposits
And automatically roll then over. To mit gate against this ask, HSB's



:                            - ~~~~~~~~~37 -
corporate object*ves call for an increase in longer-term sources of finance
and increases in its equity capital. ?he prior IDA Credit which was
largely passed on as an equity contribution and the proposed  IDA Credits
for the Market Towns Development Project and this Project which are
expected to be passed on as long-term loans would contribute significantly
to improving the financial structure of HSB.
3.25        It should also be noted that state capital of Birr 6 million
has the nature of debt rater than either common or preferred equity due to
the fact that a 'capital charge' of 5S of origina. paid-in capital is paid
annually regardless of profitability or of the existence of accumulated
deficits.  In the past this contributed to reducing HSB's equity base to
Birr 2.3 million as of end-June 1984, but this trend has been reversed to
Birr 5.5 million as of end-June 1987 as lending volumes have increased.
About Birr 8.3 million passed on to HSB from the proceeds of the first IDA
Credit wva converted to an equity contribution during 1987188 as per the
original agreement, and this has helped to restore HSBE' real equity to a
positive position. USB is also expected to receive an additional injection
of Birr 4 million of permanent capital from Government over the next three
years. Debt to equity ratios thus have been reduced to more reasonable
levels, with a total debt to equity ratio of 30sl (as compared to about
1OO:l previously) and a long-term debt to equity ratio of 1.7:1, based on
balances as of end-1987188.
3.26        Collection Performance.  HSB's collection performance has been
adversely affected by the 1975 nationalization of urban land and properties
mentioned previously. Currently about Birr 20.5 million of loans (or 51 of
outstanding balance of loans as of end-June 1989) secured against
nationalized properties are,non-performin*. Government has compensated HSB
for its loans secured ag4inst nationalized properties an amount of Birr 8.4
million in accobrdance with a previous decision. In ordtr to adequately
cover the remaining loan balances at risk, HSB plans to increase the
provision for bad debts by Birr 3.5 million per year over the ntxt three
years. 'When added to the current provision for bad debts of Birr 13.2
million as of June 30, 1989, USB would then have an adequate cushion of
Birr 23.7,million against possible losses on these loans.
3.27        Regarding its mortgage loan portfolio not affected by
nationalization, about Birr 9.8 million of loans (or 22 of outstanding
balance of loans as of end-June 1989) are in arrears over three months,
although this decreased from about Birr 16 million (about 62 of outstanding
balance) some 24 months earlier.  USB has recently initiated an action
program to reduce arrears, and this has resulted in significant improvement
over the period June-September 1989. during which time balances in arrears
were further reduced to Birr 8.4 million.  buring negotiations, agreement
was obtained from HSB that it would continue to implement an action program
acceptable to IDA to reduce the level of arrears on this non-nationalized
portfolio and that arrears will not exceed 31 of the related outstanding
mortgage balances.
3.28        While HSB has been increasing its provision for bad debts more
regularly on an annual basis over the recent past, the current provision is
cotsidered inadequate when compared with the total loan balances at risk.
Adequate provisioning for ali non-performing loans would leave HSB in a



: 38-
position of net capital deficiency, in which tota. liabilities exceed the
net realizable value of its assets.  During negotiations agreement was
obtained that HSB continue to undertake an annual review of the quality of
its mortgage portfolio and set aside regular annual provisions for bad
debts.
3.29        A further Birr 9.2 million (or 2Z of outstanding loans) are
under various stages of litigation, although judgments have been reached in
HSB's favor or loans are currently being rescheduled for about 80S of this
amount. Cumbersome legal procedures have made foreclosure and resale time-
consuming on loans under advanced legal procedures. HSB, along with other
banks, has been working with Government to reinstate auctioning procedures
which permit quicker recovery of losses on loans taken to foreclosure, and
this has recently been accomplished.
3.30        The current system for calculating taxes, however, does not
allow HSB to treat bad debt provisions as a charge against income before
tax. In addition, interest is accrued on loans which are in arrears,
thereby boosting pre-tax income on which there is an initial provision for
taxation at a rate of 502. Provision for any related bad debt is then made
out of after tax income. A further payment equal to 402 of remaining
profits, termed *residual surplus,' is then paid to Government, even when
HSB is in an accumulated deficit position.  Thus there is a transfer of
HSB's capital to Government when it is in a deficit position. These
accounting and taxation policies would also be reviewed as part of the
housing finance study mentioned earlier.
3.31        Future Performance.  Resource requirements £or housing finance
loans necessary to support the level of housing development and improvement
proposed for the Project would amount to about Birr 25.6 million of which
about 75Z would be provided from the proceeds of the IDA Credit.; The
remaining 25Z is expected to be provided from HSB's internally 8enerated
funds, primarily savings and time deposits which have been growing steadily
in the past and are expected to continue to grow over the project period.
In order to manage this volume bif lending, HSB has reviewed its staffing
requirements and other arrangements for administering loans in Akaki and
Addis Ababa which were discussed during appraisal. BSE proposes to
establish a Project Implementation Unit based in Addis Ababa and reporting
to its Deputy General Manager to coordinate appraisal and lending
activities for the Project.    ,                                  g
3.32        Projections of HSB's financial performance over the period
1989190-1998/99, including income statements, sources and applications of
funds statements and balance sheets,. are shown in Annex 11. The
projections have been prepared assuming that (a) there is an increase in
the proportion of lending to cooperatives versus state enterprises, (b)
interest rates earned on advances wotld average approximately 62 per annum
over the period, (c) savings and time deposits would grow in accordance
with past performance, (d) the provision for bad debts would be
substantially increased, and (e) the proceeds of the IDA Credit would be
passed on at 1.5 interest rate to be repaid over 26 years, with six years
grace on repayment of principal. On this basis, USB would be expected to
maintain a healthy spread of at least 32 on borrowing and lending -
operations.  HSB's overall profitability in the early projectlyears is



39 -
expected to be reduced 1y the need to increase provisions for doubtful
debts and by the fact that making such provisions cannot be olfset against
income for tax purposes. The projections show that HSB*s cash' holdings
will,be reduced from about 15-20Z of total deposits, which is typically
considered an adequate level, to about 8-9? but this is not considered
serious since deposits are unlikely to be withdrawn suddenly.  HSB's total
debt to equity ratio is forecast to improve from approximately 36sl to 15X1
by the end of the forecast period, but is still considered to be somewhat
high.  The additional equity contributions of Birr-4 million recently
agreed to by Government would help MSI to further improve its financial
structure and cash balances.
C. Addis Ababa Water and Sewerage Authority
Background and Organization
3.33        The Addis Ababa Water and Sewerage Authority (AWSA) was
established in 1964. Under the Board of Directors (responsible for policy
formulation), the General Manager is the Chief Executive of the
organization. The authority is divided into four major departments:
Technical Services, Operations, Finance and Administration. In addition,
it has units for Legal Services, Plan and Budget Programming, Organization
and Management, Computer Services, Public Relations, and internal Audit.
There are six branch offices in the presently served area to support field
operations.  The organizational struciture is shown in Chart 3. The total
number of staff is about 1,400, which is in proportion to the technical
responsibilities of AWSA. The Authority, in general, is well managed, but
to support improvement of its performance in the future as its operations
are expanded, the Project has provided for an organization and management
study. The areas to be reviewed under the study were assessed during the
appraisal mission and are outlined in the terms of reference in Annex 6.
3.34        AWSA was until recently responsible for water supply, sewerage
and sanitation (excluding solid waste management) for the city of Addis
Ababa only. Recently its responsibility has been expanded to cover the
entire AddJs Ababa administrative region.  Since Akaki is part of this
expanded area, it has been decided to transfer the Akaki water supply,
operations from WSSA to AWSA (see para 2.03). The Authority plans tolopen
a new branch office in Akaki when operations are taken over. Presently
there are about 36 WSS" employees in Akaki, and they will be absorbed by
AWSA.
i.35        AWSA has successfully carried out several investment projects
since its establishment to keep pace with the rapidly growing demand,
including a Bank-supported project durhrg the 1970s. The latest extension
(Water Supply Project II, Phase A, implemented in 1982 through 1985)
increased the capacity of source works, transmission mains and storage
capacity from 72,000 m3/day to 180,000 m3/day. The total cost of the
project was over US$55 million equivalent, financed by EEC and GOE. Phase
S (presently under construction) will expand the distrib.tion network to'
cater for the present and future water demands up to 1992-94.



-40-
3.36        The present water production is about 110,000 m3lday.  The
number of water connections (including public taps) is about 117,000, of
which about 900 are major custamers. About two thirds of the estimated 30X
unaccounted-for-water is attributed to physical losses in the system.
Efforts are under way to reduce the losses with gradual rehabilitation of
the system.
3.37        Although Addis Ababa has a small sewerage system serving only a
limited part of the city's center, only about 500 customers are connected,
primarily because of the high sewerage connection fees (between Birr 1,500
to 3,000; there is no subsequent fee for usage). Only about 10 of the
sewage treatment capacity is being used, and because of the low sewage
flows, the sewers must be flushed from time to time to avoid clogging.
Most customers have septic tanks or pit latrines, and AWSA is responsible
to provide them with tank emptying services.
Tariffs
3.38        AWSA's tariffs were last regulated and gazetted in 1973.  The
basic water tariff of Birr 0.50lm3, however, has not been changed since
1948. As mentioned above, there are no sewerage usage fees. The fees for
disposal of sewage from pit latrines and septic tanks vary from Birr 25 to
30. The present tariff in Akaki charged by WSSA is Birr 0.50/m3 (the same
as in Addis Ababa) plus Birr 0.50 per month for water meter rent.
Billing and Collection
3.39        Water meters are read every two months and billing is also for
two months. About 20? of the water meters are' not functioning, and those
customers are currently billed at a flat rate based on their previous
consumption levels. To address this problem, the Project would provide
assistance for the extension of the meter repairlcalibration workshop.  The
billing is computerized with bills prepared at the head office, since there
\are no computers at the branch offices.  However, AWSA plans to
decentralize billing in the near future.  The proposed Project provides for
the purchase of additional computers so tht financial management systems
can be improved and bills can be prepared in the branch offices, and this
is expected to further improve billing performance. Collection performance
was reviewed during appraisal and found to be satisfactory at 69 days of
receivables, reflecting the two-month billing period.
Past Financial Performance
3.40        AWSA's financial performance over the last three years is
summarized in Tale 3.3 below and detailed in Annex 12. AWSA's present
financial situation has to be viewed in light of the fact that its basic
water tariff has not been adjusted for a very long time. Analysis of its
income statements shows that although its annual revenues have grown from
Birr 11.4 million to Birr 16 million in thl last three years, it had a net
loss of Birr 5.3 million in FY 1988189. However, this loss includes a
depreciation charge of Birr 4.6 million and debt service (interest and
principal) payments of about Birr 5.8 million. It is only because AWSA has
not been servicing its debts (for both Ministry of Finance and foreign
loans) and the Government has been servicing its foreign loans, that AWSA's



- 41 -
cash flow situation has remained reasonable.  Unless tariffs are adjusted
appropriately, this unacceptable situation will continue and deteriorate
further.  AWSA has prepared several tariff studies, over the years, the
last of which was prepared in-house, and requested the Goverament for
tariff adjustments. These requests have, however, not been acted upon.

Net Income (Loss)                             (8,167)   (6,216)   (5,317)
3.41  -  AWSA has the largest and perhaps the most sophisticated water
supply sy1tem in the country, and a significant proportion of its consumers
are commercial and industrial enterprises. The average incomes of its
residential customers are also esti*nated to be higher,than in other urban
areas of the country. Yet AWSA has a uniform water taxiff (Birr 0.50/m3)
for all categories of customers regardless of consumption levels, and this
average unit charge is significantly lower than smaller urban areas in the
rest of the country where WSSA\ is supplying water. AWSA also charges a
substantial fee (Birr 200-300) from consumers wishing to connect to the
water supply system. Although AWSA makes a substantial profit from
connection fees, it is believed that the high level of these fees acts as a
deterrent to requests for connections, particularly among the poorer
consumers.
3.42      This overall situation of the low water tariff, the absence of
sewerage charges, the structure of water and sewerage tariffs, and the high
water and sewerage connection fees is clearly untenable and i tariff study
is required to study various alternatives to address these problems. The
terms of reference for a tariff study is in Annex 6 and funds have been
provided under the Project tO carry out this study. Agreement was obtained
at negotiations that a water and sewerage tariff study will be carried out
by AWSA within one year of credit effectiveness thit the study will be
submitted to IDA for its review and the recommendations of the study will
be discussed with IDA prior to their implementation.
Future Financial Performance
3.43      AWSA's financi1  forecasts for FY1989190 - 1999/2000 and the
assumptions on which the, are based are in Annex 12.  By the end of the
forecast period, the volume of water sold is expected to almost double from
present levers and ASWA will reach the limits of its existing water



- 42 -
production capacity. AWSA's present average per capita consumption level
is very low for an urban service area of its kind. Substantial investments
are required to build additional production capacity for the years beyond
2000, and studies are being carried out presently to plan for these
systems. It is estimated that these new systems might cost in excess of
US$200 million. AWSA's financial planning should, therefore, have two
objectivest the first would be to restore AWSA's financial viability in
the short-term; and the second would be to position AWSA in a way which
would allow It to raise the large amounts necessary to undertake its future
expansion plans.
3.44      To restore AWSA's financial viability in the short-term, a
number of options have been evaluated. The first, and perhaps the easiest,
would be to convert a portion of its debts (those owed to the Ministry of
Finance and the principal and interest payments of'foreign loans already
made by the Government on AWSA's behalf) to equity.  Interest and principal
repayments on the remaining foreign loans could also be re-scheduled.
Under this option, an average tariff increase of about 502 would be
required; the resulting average tariff would be about Birr 0.751m3.
Another option would be to insist on AWSA paying all of its outstanding
debts but over a longer period. Using this option, average water tariffs
would have to be increased by about 601 immediately (Birr 0.80m3) and then
increased to Birr l.001m3 from FY1996/97 and beyond. Under both the
options, and subject to the tariff adjustments being made, it is estimated
that AWSA would be in a position to finance about 10X of its substantial
future capital requiremehts from internal sources. The Government would be
expected to make a decision in this regard in conjunction with the
implementation of the recommendations of the tariff study. Agreement was
obtained during negotiations that AWSA'S water and sewerage tariffs and
other related charges will be so adjusted that starting in FY1992/93 AWSA
will maintain total revenues from water supply and seweragelsanitation
services at sufficient levels to meet all its operation and maintenance
expenses, and the higher of depreciation o- debt service, in each fiscal
year.

IV. FINANCL ANALYSIS
A                                 A.  Cost Recovers
Sites and Services
4.01       The actual costs of on-site'lroads, drains and water and
electrical services would be recovered directly by AAAR from the
residential, commercial and small industrial beneficiaries of the two sites
and services schemes in Addis Ababa as well as from the residential
beneficiaries of the scheme in Akaki through plot development charges. The
development charges would be recovered from beneficiaries, once their
houses have been compldtedg over 25 years at the prevailing HSB Interest
rate to cooperatives (currently 4.5). Since all urban land is owned by
the Government, the AAAR would also collect a land lease charge from the-
residents.. During negotiations agreement was obtained that AAAR recover
on-site infrastructure costs from beneficiaries of the sites and services
schemes through plot development charges and levy land lease charges for
use of the land.
4.02       Mortgage loans would be extended to the residential
beneficiaries at HSB3s prevailing terms for development of houses which
would be constructed through self-help. Loans would be advt-iced in
tranches with a 102 advance, a 15? payment when fouidations are completed
and further advances against work completed.  It is expected that a portion
of the loans would be advanced in the form of building materials. The
loans would be recovered at interest rates of 4.5? fram cooperatives and 7?
from individuals over periods of up to 25 years, depending on the age of
the beneficiary, with a one year grace period on repayment of principal.
Interest would be requir*d to be paid during the construction period. In
accordance with USB's normal practices, no down payments would be required
for beneficiaries who participate in cooperative building arrangements.
'However, since the loanuamount is fixed and cannot be in:reased during the
construction period if construction costs increase; beneficiaries typically
must make significant contributions. Other beneficiar;,es would be required
to make down payments of 5 or 10?, depending on income levels.
4.03       Loan recipients would be required to pay HSB's charges for
mortgage redemption insurance (typically about 82 of the loan amount) and
administration and appraisal services (2? of the loan amount) which would
be added to the loan amount and repaid over 25 years.  In addition, a
monthly payment (amounting to about Birr 3-4 per month) would be charged to
the mortgagees for fire insurance and recovered along with the monthly
mortgage payments.
4.04       As a result of the experience under the First Urban Development
Project, fuuds have not been provided for commereial and industrial
beneficiaries on the Addis Ababa scheme, since these beneficiaries
typically prefer\to utilize their own funds for construction of structures.
However, should these beneficiaries need-to borrow for this purpose, they
can apply for loans from the Commercial tank of Ethiopia, Agricultural and
Industrial Development Bank or HSB under other lending programs.



- 44 -
4.05       The-capital costs of commity facilities on the Addis Ababa
developments such as markets would be recovered by AMAR through market fees
and schools from the Ministry of Education, in line with normal practice.
In addition, the recurrent costs of the on- and off-site roads and drains,
street lighting and refuse collection would be recovered',by MAR through
property taxes and refuse collection fees. The recurrent costs of the
water and electricity services would be recovered by AWSA and EELPA,
respectivaly, through tariffs in line with levels elsewhere in the city.
Kebele Uporading/Municipal Infrastructure/Vehicles/Street Maintenance
4.06       The investment costs associated with the upgrading of Kebeles,
street maintenance, municipal infrastructure, and maintenance and other
vehicles, vhich together account for about 30Z of the total project cost,
would be recovered indirectly through property taxes and general municipal
revenues. These components are unsuitable candidates for direct cost
recovery because beneficiaries and the value of individual benefits are, in
general, impossible to identify; the imposition and collection of benefit
charges would not be a cost-effective way of raising revenues, or because
services are traditionally and appropriately provided by the municipality
and funded from general revenues.
Solid Waste Management
4.07       Investment costs associated with revenue-generating facilities
such as the solid waste containers and lift vehicles in Addis Ababa would
be recovered through refuse collection fees and general revenues. The
accounting system of MAR currently does not identify the costs associated
with the provision of the various services. Through the Project, the
accounting system would be improved so that all costi associated with the
provision of individual services will be separately accounted for. This is
expected to demonstrate to the AAAR the level of cost recovery currently
employed and to provide the basis for setting the various fees and user
charges more in lint with actual csts incurred.
Kebele Development Fund
4.08       Loans provided by AMAR to Kebeles and poor women for *evenue-
generating and development projects vould be recovered through loan
repayments. Xebeles would be required to contribute 1OZ of the capital
cost of the schemes to demonstrate their commitment. Loans would be repaid
at the prevailing HSB interest bate for housing cooperatives (currently
4.52) as under the First Urban Development Project, over either 6 years in
the case of revenue-generating projects (e.g., public showers, grinding
mills) or over 20 years for other projects. Kebeles would in turn charge
residents in their areas for the facilitielO provided. Beneficiary Xebeles
will have to demoustrate their financial capacity to repayAthe loans.
lHouse Improvement Loans in Kebeles
4.09       Loans provided by HSB to home owners in Kebeles for
upgradinglmaintenance of houses would be recovered through loan repayments.
The loans would be provided on the samelterms as for house construction



v                --   t  _ 45_  
loans Ko the sites and ser lces schemes, although the requirement for
mortgage redemption insurance would be waived.
Water SupDly Component
4.10       The capital cost of the water supply scheme in Akaki would be
recovered through water tariffs, as discussed previously in para. 3.46.
B.  Affordability                    V
Sites.snd Services;
4.11       Addis Ababa schemes.  Estimates of building costs (base) range
from about Birr 180, per m! for a core plus 3 room unit including cooking
area an4 latrine to'about Birr 235 per m2 for a core only plus cooking area
and latrine giving total unit costs of building of approximately Birr
11,100 for the Type D down to Birr 5,350 for a Type A.  On-site
infrastructure costs have been estimated at approximately Birr 1,320 per
plot.
4.12       Based on the above cost estimates, housing Types A and B would
be affordable by families with munthly incomes of between Birr 165 and Birr
220 or approximately the 50th to 70th percentile of the estimated 1988
Addis Ababa income distribution.  Types D would be affordable by families
with incomes above Birr 300 per month.  The detailed calculations are shown
in AnneX 1.
4.13       Akaki scheme.  Types A and B plus the Type C with no finishes
voUld cost between Birr 5,700 ind Birr 1b,275 approximately (base costs).
On-site infrastructure,costs have been estimated at approximately Birr
2,130 per plot.
4.14       Based on the above costs estimates, housing Types A, B'. and
would be affordable by families with monthly incomes of'between Birr 190\
and Birr 301 or approximately the 50th to 70th percent*les of the urban
inceue distribution. Annex 1 shows house costs and repayment requirements
for Akaki and also shows the proposed mix and numbers of plots of each type
proposed.
*ter supply Component
4.15       In accordance with the latest stitistical data, it .1s assumed
that-there arl 5.6 persons in the lowest income households, with two wage
larners:  ozne person fully -mployed, with a minimum wage of Birr 80 per
month and one person emp' .o '&d part-time with a minimum wage of Bi!r 25 per
month, or with the same it?ime from the informa3  sector.  The average per
capita water consumption in the low-income households is assumed to be 18 '
liters per day.' The total monthly water consumption of the household would
therefore be 3.02 mS. At the present tariff-in Akaki (Birr 0.501m3) and
assuming a house connection, a low income household would pay Birr 1.51,
which is about 1.5X of the total household income.'  At the projected 1994
tariff level (Birr 0.75/m3)kand assuming an increase in income levels, the



4~~~~~~~
- 46 -
proportion ,f income requ#ted would-increase to about 2.2S for the typical
low-income household.
4.16       As 52 or less of monthly income of low income families is
generally con,si4ered affordable, the \required increased tariffs would not
place an undue burden on the urban poor. A large portion of the low-income
'poulation, however, buys water either at the public water selling points
where tariffs are about 40Z less, or from other families.  In the latter
case, water may cost 302 to 502 more.  In order to improve thi basic needs
provision and to keep the cost of water within the affordability of the low
income groups, consideration would be given to the introduction of a
progressive tariff structure. The project provides for a tariff st4dy to
be undertaken during the first year of project imtlementation, which would
recomen4 a progressive tariff structure for Addis Ababa.

V. Project Justification and Risks
A. Economic Justification
5.01       The Project would reinforce the progress achieved under the
First Urban Development Project in alleviating urban poverty and improving
environmental and living conditions in Addis Ababa. This would be
accomplished in part by strengthening the management and financial capacity
of institutions which play important roles in urban development-and
ad4ninistration, and more specifically through the provision of housing,
urban infrastruicture and street maintenance. Poor women living in the
Kebele areas would also be assisted in raising their incomes through the
provision of loan funds to finance revenue-generating schemes.
Improvements in solid waste disposal, drainage, sanitation facilities and
the supply of potible water would lower health risks and the widespread
incidence of water-related diseases, and reduce the corresponding loss of
family income. Road improvements would likewise reduce traffic congestion
and the costs of vehicle maintenance and transportation. The housing
components would upgrade and increase the supply of accommodation,
partiFularly for low-income families, and thereby help to alleviate the
curretat severe shortages. In terms of institutional devilopment,.the Addis
Abgba Administrative Region would be assisted in strengthening its
financial management and data processing systems. Furthermore, the Addis
Ababa Water and Sewerage Authority would benefit from assistance designed
to improve the management of its operations and tariff policies as well as
training of staff; The methodologies for calculatipg the economic rates of
return for the various components are described in detail following.
Sites and Services            -
5.02       The estimated rental values of dwellings to be constructed under
the Proje4t were used as the measure of the economic benefit of the
subprojects. Tn-the absence of reliable indicators for market rents Or
prices from house sales, imputed rental values ire based on prices paid for
hotel rooms, which are the only quasi-market indicators available.  All on-
site infrastructure, .ho0se materials and estimated labor costs and
recurrent Iosts were corisidered in tho analysis and adjusted to exclude
taxes and estimated inflation costs.  Also included in the cost stream was
an estimate of the opportunity cost of land, which was estimated to be Birr
36 per m2 in Addis Ababa and Birr 2 per m2 in Akaki. These estimates were
derived from pre-nationaltzatioh prices:in similar locations inflated by
the retail price index. Foreign exchange costs and the costs of unskilled
labor, when applied, 'were shadow priced utilizs'-g Bank guidelines to
reflect mor1.appropriate economic costs t0/.  Lapd is entered as a beiefit
at the end of the life of the Project and assumed to appreciate in value\at
hal\f the 5 projected annual rate of growth of the city'l population.
Costs as well as benefits were considered over a 30-year period. On this
10I Shadow prices for foreign exchange at Birr i.5  1 US$ and for unskiiled
labor = 2/3 of actual wage.

basis, the- economic rates of return (ERRs) for the two sites' in Addis Ababa
were both estimated at 19S, and for the Akak. site at 17Z,
Rebele Upgrading
5.03       The estimated increase in rental values of the properties
benefiting from the infz*structure improvements was used as the measure of
economic benefit in the Kebele upgrading project.  Currently, all rental
properties are subject to rent control and therefore no proxy exists for
estimating the rental values after mprovements. benefits were thus based
on the assumption that after upgrading, present rents (approximated by
hotel room tases) would appreciate by 20?. This is considered to be +
conservative estimate of economic benefit, since actual rents bear no
relation to potential market rents, because of the 50? reduction in rent
levels on similar properties at the time of nationalization with no
increases ever since. All con&truction costs of Phase 1 were considered in
the analysis and were adjusted to exclude taxes and inflation and to
,reflect shadow prices of foreign exchange and unskilled labor. On this
basis, the ERR for the Kebele upgrading project in Phase 1 is 14?. The ERR
for the Kebele upgrading project in Phase 2 is expected to be similar.
Upgrading would also improve environmental conditions, which would reduce
the incidence of water-borne diseases among the resident population and
hence the loss of days from school and work and associated earnings.  If
these benefits could be,quantified, the EiRs would be significantly higher.
Vater Supply Component
5.04       The estimated incremental revenues were used as a measure of the
economic benefit of the Akaki scheme. Incremental revenues include
revenues from water sales as well as for connection fees and meter rents
were calculated on the basis of the proposed increased average tariff of
BirriO.75/m3.  As industries would be major users of water it Akaki with a
higher than average consumption, this assumption is considered to be
conservative with the introduction of a progressive tariff mtructure. All
costs of civil works, equipment~,design and construction supervision an'
recurrent costs we;e included in the analysis and adjusted to exclude
taxes, duties and inflation as well as for shadow prices of foreign
exchange and unskilled labor.  Costs as well as1benefits were considered
over a 35-year period.  The ERR was calculated4at about 10X for Akaki., The  -
ERR is acceptable for water *iupply projects. Significant other benefits,
including health benefits resulting from the use of safe water and improved
sanitecion, are also expected but are not possiblq to quantify.
Street Maintenance
5.05       Economic benefits for the street maintena ce program are based
on estimates of the savings in vehicle operating costs that would accrue
over a 135year period, compared with the situation in which th re is no
maintenance and a steady further deterioration in the pavement surface. '
The estimates i-n savings are based on data provided by AARPIO onxtraffic
flows for different vehicle types along the streets\to be -included in the
program, and figures on vehicle maintenante costs provtded by the Public
Transport Corporaition. The costs of equip6ent, civil works and additional
recurrent maintenance were InALuded in the analysis and adjusted to exclude
?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



- 49 -
taxes, duties and inflation as well as for shadow prices of foreign
exchange and unskilled labor. It is assumed that the street maintenance
program would result in average annual savings of 12.51 in operation costs
over the 15-year period, which is considered to be a conservative 'estimate.
On this basis, the ERR for the street maintenance program is 18?.
Additional benefits would accrue from the savings in travel time for
vehicle occupants using these roads. However, if time is valued at the
current average wage of Birr 2/day, these additional benefits would have a
negligible Impact on the EU.
Municipal Infrastructure/Solid Waste Management
5.06       Further unquantifiable benefits would accrue from the municipal
infrastructure including other road and drainage improvements as well as
the solid waste management improvements, which amount to about 142 of the
total investments proposed. The roads to be improved in Akaki are short
stretches of less than 1,000 meters, designed to aid circulation around the
market and by connecting the new housing development with the existing
network. The drainage components are designed to alleviate occasional
flooding, to prevent erosion and to protect roads. Taken together with the
water supply and sanitation improvements, the drainage works can be
expected to make a significant contribution to reducing the high incidence
of water-related and eye and skin diseases prevalent in the Addis Ababa
regiou. The solid waste management improvements would benefit more people
thrc%gh an expanded system and provide a more regular and reliable service
whit i would lead to improving environmental conditions.
Overall Proiect
5.07       The weighted average ERR for the project, for components for
which benefits could be quantified and which amount to about 73? of the
total project cost, is 16.5Z. The detailed calculations of the ERRs are
shown in Annex 13.
3.' Prodect Imact on Urban Poverty Population
5.08       About 652 of families in Addis Ababa and Akaki have incomes less
than the urban poverty threshold of Birr 238 per month. The needs of these
poverty populations are addressed in part by all project components. The
project would benefit the urban poor by improvi4g the supply of low-cost
housing and by redressing deficiencies in infrastructure and thus improving
environmental conditions. The sites and services components in Addis Ababa
would provide a total of about 1,900 housing units, of which about 201 are
intended for the very low-income households (less than Birr 165 per month)
and 50S for the low-income households (Birr 165-220 per month), all of
which would fall below the absolute urban poverty threshold. Similarly, in
Akaki about 701 of the housing units would be provided for families in the
urban poverty group. The Kebele upgrading component in Addis Ababa would
affeci some 43,000 people, of which about 702 are estimated to have incomes
in the poverty group.  The major water supply extension project in Akaki
would alleviate service deficiencies which are most severe among the urban
poor. The benefits of the road and solid waste management improvements and
the Kebele development projects would be roughly proportionately



distributed among the city's,population, thereby benefitting a large nuwber
of impoverished families.  A share of the Kebele Development Fund would
also be targetted to very poor women living in the Kebeles.
5.9        'The Project would also benefit the urban poor by rtducing
disease, which they are most exposed to and least able to combat. Although
it is not possible to assess,accurately the Impact of the project on the
health of the urban poor, tht components for drainage, sanltation and
especially water can be expected to significantly improve environmental and
health conditions.  Statistics compiled by hospitals and health centers in
Addis Ababa,show a higb incidence of water-related diseases among the local
population. Research has shown that project interventions of the kind
envisaged can reduce the incidence of these diseases significantly.
C. Proiect Risks
5.10       Since Government has demonstrated its ability to carry out a
similar IDA-supported project in a satisfactory manner, the risks
associated with executing this follow-on project are expected to be small.
The main risk is that water tariff 4ncreases may not be implemented by AWSA
as required for political or other reasons. Although few tariff increases
have been introduced since the Revolution, there is a higher probability of
tariff increases for vater systems undergoing capital works than for
others.  Monitoring AWSA's performance in this area would be a major focus
of IDA 'supervision.\ Another risk centers around Government executing its
plan in i timely manner to sell governmert-owned houses in project areas in
order to better ensure that houses will be upgraded and thus a
comprehensive upgrading program is supported uuder this Project. To reduce
the risk of a less than comprehensive program of upgrading, disbursement of
project funds for upgrading of Kebele treas would be linked tt Government
initiating the sale of its houses in project areas. A remaidnng risk is
that the Akaki water supply component may cost more than the current
estimate, which is based on an engineer's estimate of linking the Akaki
system to the Addis Ababa system. The cost estimate is considered to be
conservative, since, if ground water sources are found during the
feasibility study, then fhe cost is likely to be even lower than the
current estimate. In the event that the final cost is higher, the
Government would bear the additional cost.

ETHIOPIA
SECOND ADDIS ABABA URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Sites and Services ComDonent
A. Background and Program Formulation
1.        During the past 30 years, the population in Addis Ababa
increased from about 685,000 to 1.80 million. The growth in population has
been accompanied by a steady increase in the average household size from
3.5 persons in 1961 to 5.3 persons in 1984.  An iAadequate supply of new
housing has, apart from demographic factors, significantly contributed to
this increase.
2.        The present housing stock in Addis Ababa is estimated at
approximately 270,000 units. The housing backlog is estimated at about
30,000 uits and the required annual increase is estimated at about 15,000
units. Even allowing for the fact that multi-occupancy of units will be
significant (current average occupancy rates for one and two room dwellings
range from 5.3 to 6.0), it is apparent that the housing situation in Addis
Ababa is critical. The fact that such a large part of the existing stock
is in poor condition (about 44,000 units being incapable of repair and over
70,000 requiring major maintenance) exacerbates the housing
shortagelovercrowding situation.
3.        The First Urban Development Project supported a major sites and
services housing program in Addis Ababa, at Refas Silk, where over 2,700
residential sites (plus commercial and industrial sites) were provided.
The program was considered successful, although it was only of limited
scale in comparison with need and demand.  Additional policy initiatives
are considered necessary to increase the delivery of p1ots to all income
ranges as well as to improve the existing stock. As at least a partial
response to the need for increased plot delivery, a further sites and
sekvices housing program is proposed under the Project. This will build
upon the success and the lessons learned from the Nefas Silk scheme.
4.        Over 70S of Addis Ababa households have incomes of less than
Birr 300 per month (US$145 per month) and the demand for housing in this
group is estimated at between 50,000 and 58,000 units. Assuming a maxi*um
monthly loan repayment of 252 of income, then approximately 50S of the
population demanding housing (incomts above Birr 150 per month) could in
theory afford a minimum structure of about 20 m2.
5.        A review of the Nefas Silk scheme by the feasibility study
consultants (NUPIISir William Halcrow ant Partners (SWH)) concluded that
the threshold to participation in the sckeme (cost of a core unit) could
have been lowered if the core had been more economically designed and



NNX 1
Page 2 of S
constructed andlor made smaller.  It also coualuded that houq-ing units for
th, wmddle/high income groups were also too ,epensive with the result  that
beAzeficiaries reptesented the top St to 0l of Addis Ababa households. The
major causes of the 'high"..costs were thp layout and design standards
adopted which could have been more functional and efficient.
6.        The program proposed will address the above issues by delivering
serviced plots affordable by a greater percentage of lower income families.
This will in large part be achieved,by the applicatigQ of more functional
engineering and building design standards. More efficient layout designs
will- also improve land use giving a greater percentage of saleable area at
each of the two proposed sites.
B. Program Objectives
7.        The objectives of the housing program in Addis Ababa and Akaki
are:,
(a) to provide a range of self-help cooperative opportunities to
as_ist In reducing the housing shortages;
(b) to target thls provision primarily towards the lQt i*icme
population of the city; and
(c) to provi4e a cost effective initial invespment which has-the
capability of subsequent upgrading both by the occupants of the
houses and by the Addis Ababa Administration Region (fot
infrastructure).
C. Detailed Description of Program
S.        A total of 2,000 serviced plots will be provilded on,two sites in
Addis Ababa. Site 1 close to the Ambo Road will include about 500
residential plots.  Site 2 about 2 km from the main Jimi   Rc*e  will inc'lude
1,400 residential plots, 50 comuercial plots and 50 industrtial plots. Both
sites are to the west of the city, the first in the north-wedt corner
adjace0t to existing factdrles, and the second further to the south close
to existing residential development.  the topography an4 s(l Xonditions at
both sites are generally well suited for low cost housing devlopment.  The
sites ea6h embrace some existing development which has been 4ncorporated
into the respective site plans. Main infrastructure servicest either are
already supplied to the sites or are close by, and hence off-site
infrastructural costs will not be excessive.
9.        The Akaki site is located adjacent to the Akaki bypass. The
first phase of site devqlopment of a larger site will be supported under
the Project consisting of 350 residential plots. Off-site infrastrufture
requirements are modest and consist of an electricity power line extension,
tapping of the adjacent water ain to feed the site, a short op*o channel
drain to connect to the existing system and.  a short leotfb 4   m        road

and appropriate intersection improvemmnt'between'the site access and thea
Akaki bypass road.
l,o.      ,\Pr efficiency in servicing and land usage, the sites have been
designed using cluster modules and in this way the saleable areas of each
site have oxceeded 60S with densitie# of 40 plots/Ihectare.  Infrastructure
to be provided will include access, drains, water reticulation servicing
communal water fountains in Addis Ababa, electricity supply and
streetlighting. Minlmal design standards ha"R been adopted, although
systems have been designed to permit incremental improvement in the future.
xI.       Secondary roads will generally have a 14 a right of way (ROW)
with 5 m carriage4ay with an all-weather surface, and local roads will have
1 10 m ROW with only a 4 m unsurfaced carriageway. Pedestrian accessways
will have either a 7 m ROW or a 4 m ROW with no surfacing. All access and
circulation variants include Orainage ditches (generally unlined) and
utility r'eserves. Although rights of way widths could have been reduced
further, from environmental and future upgrading considerations, the
advantages of the ROW widths decided upon outweigh ihe.marginal additional
cost savings that could have been made by further width reductions.
12.       Designs for the water reticulation networks have been approved X
by AWSA, which will also take over the systems on completion. Although in
Addis Ababs systems have been designed to permit future individual house
connections, the initial proposals willl.be for the networks to serve public
fountains sited sueh that consumers will not have to carry water more than
100 meters. In Akaki individual water connections to each plot will be
provided at the outset.
13.       Bach unit will be provided wikh an individual connection to the
electric power supply system to be installed at each site.. Design of the
overhead networks will belapproved by BELPA, which will take over the
systems on completion. tisign of the systems will be based on each house
having a maximum supply of 0.5 Ew through an indjtlrdual meter. Basic
streetlighting will also be provided at each site.
14.       In Addis Ababa a cano6 plot size of 136 m2 (Om x 17m) is to be
adopted to accommodate four basic housing typologies.  In keeping with
Ethiopian norms, the cXoking area and pit latrine ate.-separated from the
main living area and bedrooms. Houses have been designed as-,single story,
duplex units ad the utility blocks at the rear are such that four selarate
latrines sha*e the use of single pit.  The maximum built up area per plot
would be about 61 m: (core +3).. Simlar designs will be applied in Akak4
although plot sizes will be larger at 160 m2 (20m x 8m) reflecting the more
rural nature of the town.
15.       Industrial.and commercial plots to be provided at Site 2 in
Addis Ababa are also to hake similar plot depths as residential units for
layout efficiency purposes but plot widths would wary (in multip2 es of 8 m)
to enable sufh plots to be better able to respond to demand. Layouts have
allocated spice for various community facilities (e.g., schools and

markets) to service resideits and funds have been inclu eU'in tie program
for suqh facilities.
16.-      Housing typologies proposed are such that self-help co-operEtive
groups can build with the minimum of skilled labor requirements.  The'mix
of plots proposed is such that 70X would be core (Type A) or core plus one
toom (Type B) units aimed at the lowe't end of the income curve (Birr 132 -
Birr 232 per month). the remaining 302 of units, core,+2 rooms (Type C) in
Akaki, and core +3 rooms (Type D). in Addis Ababa would be targeted at the
upper medium income (Birr 233 plus) to achieve a balanced social mix within
the residential development.  The project'target group may thus be defined
as the 47-67th percentile for 'low income' plots, which represents an
improvement compared to Nefas Silk which reached only the 60th percentile
and above.
)D. Program Costs and Financing
17.       The total cost of the component in Addis Ababa is estimated at.
Birr 26.4 million (US$12.8 million equivalent) of which (he foreign
exchang,e component isaestimated at Birr 7.0 million (US$ 3.4 million). In
Akaki the total cost is estimated at BLrr 4.5 million (US$ 2.2 million),o-e-
which the foreign exchange component is estimated at Birr 1.2 mlllioi 
(US$0.6 z4llion equivalent).
,18.      Houses would be constructed by self-help cooperative gro#ps and
funds for the construction of houses would be channelled though the Housing
and Savings Bank (HSB) which would process loans to the groups for the on-
plot development.
19.       Infrastructure would be constructed by contractors engaged by
th'e AAARPIO (roads and drains) and utility companies (AWSA 4nd EELPA) for
water supply and electricity supply, respectively.  Full on-site
infrastructure costs would be recovezed from the beneficiaries through plot
development charges, but off site infrastructure costs will be borne by the
AAAR from general revenues as these elements would serve a greater area
than that of the first phases of development of the sites above. To ensAre
that no delay occurs to site development, funding of the capital costs of
the t ilities (water and electricity) will also be chinnelled through AX.
20.'    Estimates of buflding costs (base) range from about Birr 180 per
m2 for a core +3 room unit includinj cooking area latrine and washroom in
Addis Ababa to about Birr 250 per m forja core only plus cooking area a,nd
latrine in Akaki, giving total net unit costs of building at approximately
3Birr 11,100 for the Type D down to Birr 5,350 for a Type A. 'On-site
infrastructure costs have been estimate4-atan equivalent of apprxlimately
EBrr 1,320 per plot in Addis Ababa and BErr 2,130 per plot in Akaki.  The
full o-site,infrostructure costs would be covered from the respective site
beneficiarie..  Eitimated costs and affordatility analyses for Site I tt
Addis Ababa (more expensive than Site 1) and for Akaki are set out in'-
Appendices to this Amnex.

21.       Overall management of the Implementation of the component\
including co4struction supervision viii be ths responsibility of the AAAR.
The AAAR (through its PIO) will be responsible for provisionXof off-site
and on-site infrastructure, the co-ordination of the utility agencies (AWSA
and MELPA) and the provision of community facilities at Site 2.
Construction of schools will be carried out by AAAR witi costs reimbursed
by the Ministry of Education.  The HSB will process house construction
loans;to individuals through cooperative groups.
22.       A potential major constraint to the efficient and timely
implementation of the component, particularly the construction of the
houses or the 'on plot' consolidation, to the lack of an adequate supply of
the building|materials,_particularly items that require to be imported
(e.g., roofing sheets, steel reinforcing bars, door and window furniture).
lFor this reason, it is proposed that key materials for the sites and
services componsnt¢for Addis Ababa and Akaki will be procured centrally
(through AAARPIO) as an initial ixplementation task. This will be done by
way of a major supply contract procured following ICB procedures.
23.       For on-site infrastructure at each of the sites, it is envisaged
that-there will be a major lnfrastructure contract for each with AWSA and
SL PA effectively acting as sub-contractors to AAAR for water supply and
electricity supply, respectively, and AAAR through contractors constructing
the roads and drainage.l The contracts will be phased as appropriate. In
view of the estimated stiall size of the contracts, the nature and difficult
location of the works, foreign contractors would not likely be interested
and thus local competitive bidding procedures would Ve adopted. AAARPIO
would, however, be required to obtain at least three bids for each civil
works contract to ensure effective competition.
23.       The I   N0 would be responsible for tendering of the works,
award of contracts, construction supervision, payments to contractors, aqd
continual liaison with the utility agencies (AWBA and mELPA), with the
Rebele Associations and the communities. The AAAR'8 Road and guilding
Department would be responsible for subsequent maintenance of roads and
major drains.  During the course of implementation, detailed arrangements
for the subsequent operation and maintenance of the coamUnal facilities and
tertiary infrastructure would be developed and agreed upon between AAAR and
the Kebele Associations. For public fountains, the AWSA will supply and
charge users for water consumed, and KELPA will supply and take over the
maintenance of streetlighting, charging t*e AAAR In accordance with the
normal practice for streetlighting in the city.

ETHIOPIA
SECOND ADDIS AABA URBAN DEVELMOPENT PROJECT
Kebele Upgradins Comoonent
A.  Background and Program Formulation
1.        It is estimated that in the order of one million of Addis
Ababa's 1.80 million people.have incomes below the absolute urban poverty
threshold and live in areas which have serious deficiencies in
infrastructure and municipal services. These neighborhood areas or Kebeles
are characterized by high population densities (400-700tpersonslha);
limited access and circulation, generally unpaved; itadequate and poorly
maintained drainage; few communal water fountains or yard connections for
the numbers requiring service; and few or non-existent refuse
containerization facilities and collection arr w ements. Probably the most
critical deficiency, however, is the lack of toilet facilities with few
households having their own private facilities.  In the.order of only about
602 use a private or public shared latrine and the remainder use open
spac,es and watercourses.
2.        The first major effort to provide a range of infrastructure and
municipal services improvements was supported under the Bank's First Urban
Development Project (Credit 1366-ET) in the poorly served and very
congested Tekle Baimanot area of the city (some 100 ha, 80200 households i.__
- This program, although not comprehensive and which experienced some
coordination problems, was considered at least partially successful.  The
proposed program will continue (and learn from) this earlier initiative.
3.        The infrastructure and services to be, provided under the Project,
are aimed at- i;roving the efficient functioning of the Rebeles selected,
the health, quality of life and resulting productivity of the inhabitants
and the general environment. To achieve this, access, circulation,
drainage, public water fountains, refuse containerization, latrines,
streetlighting and some community facilities, including public showers,
would be provided to functionai and affordable standards in an integrated
manner.
4.        The Kebeles, in the Aba Koran area of thl city, were selected by
the AAARPIO (a prefeasibility study was carried out by NUPI) from a longer
list of'needy Kebeles that have been identified by AAAR. Criteria used in
seliction included income levels as well as the existing conditions of both
infrastructure and housing.  The selected Kebeles (7) cover 88 hectare8 and
house 43,000 people approximately. Detailed feasibility studies for
upgrading together with preliminary engineering have been carried out for
the whole 88 hectares by the design consultants with participation of the
community associations.  Detailed engineering designs have been prepared
' I                                          .'

for the first year's construction program covering about 15 hectares and
benefitting 10,500 people.
5.        In addition to the infrastructure upgrading component proposed
in the selected Kebeleo (Phase 1), the Project would include funds for
further areas to be identified and engineered during implementation' of the
Project (Phase 2) and vould also provide support for improvements in
Kebelea generally throughout the city through the Kebele Development Fund
(KDF) established under the first project. This fund will be available to
support in'frastructure and other deve,lopment projects in the Kebeles as
proposed by Xebele CdmAunities to thed AAAR, which would be tequired through
its PIO to review and approve project proposals. Projectslwould need to
respond to priority needs and ¶o demonstrate technical and financial
viability. Similar arrangements as established under the first project
would apply with the Kebele Coamunities being required to provide a minimum
of 102 of the specific project cost to demonstrate their commitment.
Through the additional,Phase 2 and the JDr arrangements, the modestly sized
program initially proposed by'>tie consultants will be further expanded to
other Kebeles which demonstrate a need for improvement and development as
well as a willingness to contribute to the projects.
6.        In addition to the infrastructure upgrading component and the
KDF which would provide limited and complementary improvements in the
Kebeles, a concomitant effort to improve the condition of the housing stock.
(generally in very poor conditiolp) in the Kebeles would be sLpported
through the Project through a loan fund for house upgrading an,d
B.  Program Objectives
7.        The objectives of the upgrading program are:
(a) to improve the efficient functioning and environmental
conditions in the Kebeles;together with the health and quality,
of life of the residents through the provisionuof basic
facilities;
(b)  to provide a balanced program of improvements in project are4s
to functional physical standards and target cOst per hectare
and/or cost/capita to ensure the greatest number of people
benefit and that no area receives a disproportionate share of
the limited funds to the detriment of an equally needy area;
(c) to demonstrate that significant improvements and-hence impact
can be made and yet be affordable,. thus ensuring that the
program can be'Veplicsted elsewhere in the city;
(d) to carry out improvements in an inteirated and thus. efficient
manner and to minimize the disruption of Kebele communitie's'
(.luz.b:s/21fW

(e) to encourage the residents to participate in further development
of their conau ities, particularly in the operation and
maintenance of facilities, by their involvement in the
identification, planning and implementation of the program.
8.        It is recognized that the program proposed is modest in scale
and ideally should be greatly expanded tp respond to tiie-rmagnitude of the
problem of deficiencies in the Kebeles. tHowever, the capacity of the AAAR
to implement and coordinate a complex program has been an important factor
in determining the size of the program. A further objective of the
program, therefore, is for the AAAR and other concerned agencies to gain
further experience in the implementation of a multi-component, integrated
program of infrastructure and municipal services improvements. This
experience should enable the identification, preparation and implementation
of similar programs on a larger scale. in the foreseeable future to
accelerate upgrading of Rebeles citywi¶e.
C.  Detailed Description of Program
9.        Initially seven Kebeles (7130, 7131, 7/32, 7/33, 8123, 8124,
8125) In the Aba Koran area of the city covering some 88 hectares and
housing some 43,000 people (about 7,000 households) would be upgraded j
(Phase 1).  The following would be provided:
-    Primary Road  -               475 l.m.)
-    Secondary Road -             1845 l.m.)  i.e. 49.4 mlha
-    Local Accwss Road -          2015 l.m.)
-    Footpaths -                  8320 l.m.)  i.e. 94 m/ha
-    Drainage -                 13,994 l.m.   i.e. 159 mlha
-    Communal Pit Latrines -        66 no.
-    Public Water Fountains -       11 no.
-    Public Washing/Shower
Facilities -                  4 no.
-    Solid Waste Container
-Hardstandings -              28 no.    i.e. 1 (2 bins) per 3 ha
Streetlighting -              350 units  i.e. 4 per ha'
-    Small bridges -                10 no.
10.       Vital 'off-site' infrastructure to effectively link the Kebele
infrastructure to citywide sysFems would also be provided to ensure 'on-
site' provisions are able to operate to optimum levels. This is limited
during Phase 1 to one 'length of major road improvement, which would be
upgraded under the street maintenance component of the Project.
11.       The proposals, while adopting functional, least-cost standards
developed from affordability considerations, have taken cognizanci of
longer term development plans for the city, generally-accord with' such
plans and would be capable of incremental improvement over time.

Page 4 of 5
12.     ' Tolensure balanced and least cost provision, proposals have been
developed following target rplanning, design and cost standards..  These are
- set out in detail in'Appendix 1.  Actual provision ind standards achieved
following detailed survey and design of Phase 1 are detailed in jara 9
above.
13.       Apart from the fundamental concept of planning and designing
facilit4es that are affordable by those who would benefit directly from the
improvements, a further prime consideration was8to plan the works such
that the minimum of disruption, demolition and subsequent relocation is         -
netessary. Consequently, despite the dense and haphazard layouts, only 19
structures vill require removal and families relocated. A site within the
benefiting Kebeles has'been identified where those families will be
resettled and basic structures to no lesser standard than those to be
demolished will be erected as compensation for the-affected families.  A
resettlement plan has been formulated and was agreed during negotiations.
No families will be displaced until the resettlement sc  e, physical
layout and infrastructure have been completed.
-D.  Program Costs and Financing
14.       The total base cost of the upgrading program including
contingencies and taxes anc' duties for the 7 Kebeles (88 ha) in Phase 1 is
estimated at Birr 3.63 million (US$1.75 million).  Of this Initial program,
the first year or stage 1 program will cost approximately Birr 1.1 million
(.US$0-.53 million).l  A't6tal-sum of lrr-277-'I4 millionw (US* .-04'rmjliowy-l- --
been included for Phase 2 of the program yet to be identifteo in detail.
The foreign exchange component is estimated at 286 of the total component
cost.  The Phase 1 Improvements will copt approximstely Blrr 40,000 per ha
CUS$20,000 per ha).or about Sirrt80 per capita (US$40 per capita). Details
of quantities of the different components with costs and ttandards to be
achieved are shown in Appendix l1.
15.       Cost recovery for the program will be achieved both by direct
(user charges) -nd indirect (property taxes and other city revetues) means.
The costs of the roads and drainage components as well as the hardstandings
for the 8 m3'solid waste containers will be recovered through property
taxes. The cost of the containers themselves which arg-part- of the city's..
solid waste management program wil,l be recovered through sanitation fees.
The costs'of public water.fountainis as well as streetlighting will be
recouped\through utility user charges levied by AWSA and EELPA,
respectively. The costs of communal-latrines would be recovered fr m city
general revenues.

16.       The AAAR's Project Implementation Office (AAARPIO) established
under Urban I Sill .be Tretponsible for implementation .of the program which
would be supported by local consultants, as necessary, to assist in
completion of the Phase 1 design and the design of future areas as well as
constralction sup rvision.
18.       The works have been packaged on an 'area' basJ,s rather than a
component basis to demonstrate the advantagels of an integrated approach to
development. This approach is expected to risult in the minimum of'
disruption over the shortest possible time;  to reduce the risk of one
contractor or agency damagitlg another's work; to create a greater impact;
and to simplify the scheduling and coordination of the works.
Comprehen4ive contracts which would include as a minimum all
'infrastrructure network' works [i.e. roads, drainage, water supply (AWSA to
execute) and streetlighting (EZLPA to execute)] would be awarded, and only
one contractor would be respo;ble for coordination of work in any one
area at one time. In packaging the works, the design consultants have
taken cognizan:e of specific physical features in the area, off-site
linkage requirements, access-needs. etc. 
19.       It is envisaged that four infrastructure contracts would be
awarded in Phase 1 covering the 88 ha. Contract sizes would be in the
order of Birr 1 million (US$.48 million). In Phase 2, two further
contracts would likely be awarded, each valued at approximately tirr 1.2
million (US$0.58 million).  In vew  of. the estimated size of thea.cwntractsat
the nature and difficult location of the works, foreign contractors are not
likely to be interested and thus local competitive bidding procedures would
be adopted which have been reviewed by the Bank and found acceptable.
20.       The-PZ0Mwould be responsible for detailed design of the
'remainder of Phase 1 ap well as Phase 2, tendering of the works, award of
conti-acts, construction supervision, payments to contractors, and continual
liaison with the utility agencies (AWSA and EELPA), the Rebele Associations
and the communities. The AAAR's Road and Building Department would be
responsible for subsequent mai4tenance of roads and major drain*. During
the course of implementation, detailed arrangements for the subsequent
operation and maintenance of the coammunal facilities and tertiary
infrastructure would be deve~loped and agreed upon between AAAR and the
Kebele Associations. For public fountains, the AWSA will supply and charge
usotrs for water consumed and KELPA will supply and take over the
maintenance of streetlighting, charging the AAAR in accordance with the
normal practice-for streetlighting in the city.

SECOND ADDIS ABABA URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Street Maintenance Component
A. Background and Project Formulation
1.        Addls Ababa has approxiamtely 270 km of paved streets in
addition to the Kebele roads, the Vast majority of which are unsurfaced.
Roads (excluding Kebele roads) are classified into four categories,
including arterial, sub-arterial, collector and locallresidential strqets.
These are paved with either asphaltic concrete or surface dre., ed (bitumen
penetration and stone chippings).
2.        The Road and Building Department of the Addis Ababa
Administrative Region (AAAR) is responsible for construction an4
maintenance of roads and drainage within the city.  The Departient has six  t
divisions  ll of which the Road Maintenance Diviiion and the Drainage and
Flood Control Division have the" major maintenance responsibilities., All of
9AAR's vehicles and plant including that of the Roal and Building
Department is maintained through the AAAR's Equipment Services Department.
Road stone is provided by the AAAR's Quarry Production Agency.        -
3.        Road maintenance is presently carried out predominantLy by the
AAR's direct labor force -t10OZ asphalt pave - t, 702 surface dressing and
1002 drain maintenance).  Contractors carry out approximately 302 of
surface dressing, plus all sidewalk maintenance and all new road
construction, which 'represents an average 30% of theXDepartment's annual
road and drainage budget.  Presently 10 crews perform resurfacing and
patching activities.  The city has 5 zones in each of which 2 crews
operate, a 'patching' crew and a 'penetration crew' having generally 15 and
I8 persons in each, respectively.
4.        In recent years shortages of asphalt, cement and bitumen, a
deteriorating vehicle and plant fleet, staff shortages, problems with
production at the quarry and the lack of an effective pavement management
system have resulted in anadequate maintenance of the city's roads and
drains.  Consequently, the city's road network has seriously deteriorated.
S.        The Bank's First Urban Development Project recognized road
maintenance deficiencies and included funds for a study to assess road
maintenance problems and needs. This study was, carried out between January
1987 and March-1988 by Stanley International Limited which presented its
1/   The divisions are Road Maintenance Division; Drainage and Flood
Control Division; Road Construction Division; Design and Contract
Administration Division;  "tding Construction and Maintenance
Division; Traffic Systems Di#ision; there are also sections that deal
I~ "       with Eqipment Dispatch and Office Engineering Service*.

final report in December 1988. This report was further developed in the
Feasibility Study of Street Maintenance In AddisjAbaba ca !ried, out by NUPI
and its subconseltants, Sir Willisam Halcrow and Partners (SH), also
financed under the First Project. These reports and AAARPIO's subsequent
review have formed the basis for formulatioi'of the street maintenance
program.
6.        Together with the AAARPIO, the NUPI/SWH team identified 12
priority maintenance activi- ies. A five-year program was proposed which,
with vehicles, plant and equipment for'the relevant city agencies and
technical assistance to establish and to assist in implementation of a
pavement management program, was estimated to cost approximately Birr 145
million (US$70 million). This estimate included all labor and equipment
owning and running posts of the city's maintenance divisions. The high
cost of the proposals identified by the studies highlighted the severely
distressed state of the city's street and drainage netwotk.
7.        Expenditures by the city's Road and Building Department on road
maintenance in recent years, excluding cost of permanent employees and the
owning and operating costs of the Council's own equipment, was Sirr 8.88
million in 1985186 and Birr 8.54 million in 198187. In 1987J88 this
figure fell to Birr 4.39 million against an original budget of Birr 7.35
million. The 19891.90 budget for all maintenance (excl9ding new road
construction) i! Birr 7.0 million of which about 40? has been utilized by
the end of January 1990. The feasibility study carried out by NUPIISWH
suggested a maintenance program, to be carried out predominantly through
the city's own direct labor force, in excess of'Birr 10 million per annum
for road and drainage maintenance and reconstruction. This was based on
the, assumption that the key departments and divisions would need to,be
properly equipped (vehicles, plant and equipment with an estimated base
cost of B$rr 18.5 million was proposed) and fully staffed in accordance
with the proposals (approved by Council) of the "Operation and Management
mprovement Study-City of Addis Ababa carried out by Project
Administration Service in 1984.  The achievement of such a program also
assumed that fuel, asphalt and bitumqn (imported items) would be available.
The difficulty in obtaining these items at present is a major reason the
present year's maintenance program is lagging.
8.        The conclusion of the experience of recent years is that an
annual level of road maintenance expenditure of Birr 7 million
approximately is being optimistic from both afford4ble and implementable
(machincc and materials) viewpoints. The present five-year (1989-94)
rolling program .for maintenance prepared by the Road and Building
Department budgets for an expenditure on works of about Birr 28 million for
5 years. The Project would focus on supporting those elements of the
maintenance program which cause AAAR the greatest difficulties, that is.
those requiring foreign ex hange, namely vehicles, plant1, equipment and
spare parts together with aiphaltic and bituminous mate;Wals. In addition
it would also support, in parallel and coordinated with the street
maIitenance program, traffic management and safety=itmprovement measures-
including signalization of key intersections.-

B. Program Obiective
9.        The progrpm would provide oupport to AAAR's departments and
divisi6on impacting on road and draii maintenance to help to ensure that
significant past investments made in road and drainage Infrastructure are
adequately protected by retarding the rate of deterioratlon. This vill
avoid expensive reconstruction in the future and will avoid unnecessarily
high vehicle operating costs. In carrying out road maintenance activities;
the program would also cairy out traffic    agement impro4ement measures
pVrticularly atlinteraections to improve traffic flows and safety.
10.       More specifically the program would seek tot -
(a)  impro4e and expend the present fleets of vehicles, plant and
equipment of th divisions of the Road and Buildtna Department
directly responsible for msaintenance;
(b)  improve the vehicle, plant and equipment maintenance capability
of the Equipment Services Department responsible for keeping
AMR's fleets operationalt
(c) improve and expand the vehicle, plant and equipment inventory of
the Quarry Production Agetcy responsible for providing )materials
for street and drain maintenance;
(d) provide support (equipment and training) to the Traffic Systems
Division of the Road and Building Department in order to enable
intersection improvezpents, other traffic management improvements
and road user safety measures to be carried out in conjunetion
vith road rehabilitation and maintenance proirams; and
Ce) provide operational assistance to establish a sustainable
pavement menagemant system$ to lmprove the general management
and operations of all of the reltvant departments and agencies
directly affecting street and drain maintenance and triffic
I managemem and safety; and to carry outlon-the-job and more
formal training.
C. Detailed Description of Program
11.       The program would address the highest priority needs for
Improving maintesnace of the city's road and drainage network and
addressing the more criti4al traffic management and road user safety needs.
Details of the program are shown in the attached Appendices 1 and 2.
D. Program Costs and FPiancanA
12.       Too total cost of the street and drain maintenance program
component is estimated at Dirr 21.98 upillion (US$10.62 million equivalent)
of which the foreign exchange component is'estilmated at 522 of the tdtal
¢copan"le coots.  Thea s figures eFclude technicaai ass*stmncea.nd training
for mkintenance operations and maha8ement which is estimated at Birr 0.50
million (US$0.24 mlllioniequivalent)..

13.       the program has five m&$rn thrusts: ti) to provide Immediate
funding for spare parts to rehabilitate existing maintenance vehicles,
plant and equipment t3irr 1.10 million)- (US$O.53 million 6quivalent); Cd)
to provide funding to enable a minimum level of new vehicles, plant and
equipment for maintenance to be procured (Birr 11.31 million) (US$5.46
million equivalent)s (iii) to support the AAA' s anual planned maintenance
program such as to ensure funding is available for mplementing at least a
minimum level program (Birr 9.57 million) (US$4.62 million equivalent) or
BArr 1.60 million per annum (US$0.77 mlllion equivalent'per annum) for six
years; (iv) to pro4ide support for traffic management and road safety
improvement measures to be carried out in conjunction vith road maintenance
programs; (v) to improve the traffic management design capability, develop
a pavement panagement system and generally improve the op rations and
management of departments and divisions and training of staff involved in
street ind drain maintenance iby supportiig Technical Assistance to the
deparpments and divisions (Birr 0.5 million) (US$0.241million equivalent).
3. Implementation
14.       The AAAR's Road and Building Department.would be the key
implementing agency through its Road Construction; Road Maintenance;
Drainage and Flood Control; and Traffic Sistems Divisions. \The Equipment
Services Division (for vehAcle and plant maintenance) and the Quarry
Production Agency (for production of road materials$ would also implemlnt
relevant partslof the pr4sgram.  The AAAPIO would be responsible for
ovezhll coordination and monitoring of the program.
15.      Although at preset only about 152 of road and drainage
maintenance overall is carried out by private contractors (50?
approximately of the road budget overall as all new construction is carFied
out by contractors), the AAAR is presently analyaing the efficiency of its
direct labor operations. Consideration is being given to merging the
present Road Maintenance Division together with dhe Quarry Production
Agency and Equipment Services Division to form a commercial enterprise on
the model.of\Direct Labor Organizations (DLO's) which operate in many U.K.
local authorities.  guch DLO's have to compete for maintensacelconstruction
liurk contrkcts with private contractors. The TecanicaltAssistance to be
supported under the Project 4,ould, as one of its objectives, assist the
AAMR in the feasibility and subsequent establishment of such an a
organization within AA1 .  AAAR is planning tolestablish a DLO enterprise
by maid-1991.
16.       Notwithstanding the above, the AAAR is planning to expand the
use of contractors for carrying out road msaintenance activities. trom
1990-91 all utility trench reinstatements will be carried out by private
contractors under an annual schedule of rates contract.   The contract will
be tendered locally prior to July 1991 and run for one year (the AAAR
fiscal yeazl). Such type of contract will permit a more imwdiate response
in the carrying out of maintenance and minor civil works compared to
current practices.

17.       in addition to the above, the us5 of contractors for carrying
out 'penetration' or  surfac. dressing' maintenance activiti., will be
increased over the course of the Project, from,the preeent 301
approximately of the san$al program to 801 by year five,of the Project.
The following matrix shows the main road and drainage activities of the
Road and Buildi4g Department, and how such actiiities are currently carried
out and compares this wLth targets for the end of the Project which are to
be achieved incrementally. The Project itself would support that part of
the maintenance program to be carried out by private contratptors (subject
to annual budget limits estimated at about 251 of annual program costs), in
addition to plant, vehicles, equitment and key imported materials for the
Department itself.

by the Road and Building Deparnment with assistAce from AAMPIO. Tender
documents =iil be submitted tolthe Bank for review prior to negotiations,
and beforel the beginning of each year the annual maintenance program
proposed and agreed.by AMAR would be submitted to the Bank for review.
This would indic#te the works to be contracted and also ihe imported
materials content of the annual program. Technical Aseistarce would be
engaged internationally to primarilylassist the Road Maintenance Division
int-he establishment and impiementation 0t a pavement- mangement system as
well as to advise on the establishment of a caou:rcial1ygoxiented DLt. to
assist the Traffic System Division in detaillng traffic management and
safety measures and their coordination with annual maintenance programs;

#nd to prepore and carry out training programs for Roadd Maintenance
Division staff as well as staff of other relevant divisions of the Road and
Duildins Department. Outline job descripiion(s) for the Tethnical
Assistance have been drafted (included in Annex 6). and detailed Terms of
Reference will be finalized prior to loan negotiations. Approximately 12
man-months have been estimated at an 'all-in' cost of US$13,000 per month
(Dr. 31,050 per month) together with vehicles and equipient support.
19.       Vehicles, plant, equipment and spare parts amounting to about
Birr 12.4 million (US$6.0 million equivalent) would be procured through ICB
procedures. Road maintenance work carried out by contractors would be
procured through local competitive biddinB procedures (approximately Birr
9.6 million)(US$4.6 million equivalent) over six years. LCB procedures
'have been reviewed and found to be acceptable.

Solid Waste Management Component
A. Backtround and Program Pormulation
1.        It has been estimated that the approfimately 1.80 million
cit$zens of Addis Ababa, together-with commerce and industry, generate in
the order of 290 tonnes of refuse per day. Average household waste
generation rates are about 0.15 ki"person/day or 0.4 liters/personlday with
an average density of 370 kg/m3. the Environmental Health and Social
Services Department of the Addis Ababa Administrative Region (AAAR or City
Council) is responsible for collection and disposal of refuse through its
Collection and Landfill Sections, respectively. Recent estimates have
indicated that about 5OS of the total waste generated is collected by the
Department's service. No private collection arrangements operate.
2.        Essenti*lly, three different systems of refuse collection are
operated. The minoit widespread system is the qoamun*l container system
vhereby 8 V3 containers (240 no. in total) are placed in varidus
neighborhoods of the city for people to deposit their garbage.  The
containers are collected periodically by t4e Department by lift truck (5
lift vehiclest only one currently, in operation).   There is also a limited
'door to door' collection system and also e 'block' system whereby
collection vehicles operate regular toutes, stopping frequently and
alerting households to bring their garbage to the vehicle by blowing a
-horn.  Some 28 side loaders ehd 2 compaction trucks currently operate these
syst6ms.
3 .    ~All systems have deficiencies which primarily are caused by
insufficient numbers of appropriate, reliable vehicles and equipment.  The
Departmant managesi however, to keep about 50Z of its operational fleet  2
vehicles of various types) in service at any one time despite the fact that
their average age is over 12 years. Difficulties in acquiring spare parts
and a lack of skilled labor,.are major problems ficing tbh> Aquipment
Services Department which it responsible for maintaiaing alVCity Council
vehicles.
4.        At present, refuse is disposed of at the city's one tip site
some 10 km from the city centrqeto the soith-west.  The site is not
operated as a sauitar,/ landfill.' A gravel road serves the site; refuse is
not covered;,compactitin and-sl-reading plant s4ffer frequent breakdowns; the
site is inadiquately fenced and drained; dead animaIs are buried in the
landfill; and many scavengers including chil¢rn operate at the site.  The
site wtic4 has been-in operation since 1968 hit a limlted futur; life'
(aspare capacity).            _    -    -              v   ,                  ,   _-,

5.        A nubeg of studies have been c4rred out re4atinj tp solid
waste In Addis Abba over the post 8 years, the latest being the
Feasibility Study carried out by NUPI and Its sub-consultants, Sir William
valcrow and Partners (SW8), financed under the Bank-supported First U*ban
Development Project (Cr. 1366-4T).  This study reviewed earlier studieNs
which looked at various collection and disposal options as well as,the
current situation and proposed measures for solving amiediate sb rtcomings
in the system as well as identifying longer term requiremonts. 'It also
proposed a prioritized investment program, and this has formed the basis
for the solid waste management (SP) program, although further
prioritization was felt to be necessary. Apart from cist\'and
affordabilitiy considerations, the effectiveness of the oad. loader
vehicles which currently .cperate the block system, the b4ock system itself,
the effectiv.ness of the,compaction vehicles given the generally high
density'of refuse and the bigh cost qf operation and maintenance of thee,
havp all been 'questioned Sn past studies.' Ipthe immediate tenm,
thetefore. only the com_alna  container system whci hMs proven to be the ,
simplest and most effective of collection systems operated to-date would-be
expanded. Technical assistance-to be provided to assist in the

1Q, .   To-daXte the actual costs of lroviding solid waste coll*ction and
disposal services to the city have never been accurately dete ined.. At
'present, the service is funded from general city revenues and a sanitation
fee on commercial users (atded to the trade license fee),. Psst studies
have recommended the Introduction of a sanitation fee for all\,users.  The
lNorconsult Study" of 1982 suggested a fee linked to service received, with
industrial ad commercial waste generators paying proportionally more than\
housetiolds fo'r which rates would be fixed according to ability to pay.
Such a system is in proceis of being developed. _
11.       As patt of the technical assistance supporting the pro!gram,
costs of the service will be analyxd4 and detailed proposals for a proper
sanitation fee ot similar measure to'recoup costs for the service provided
from users would be developed and implemented. AAAR has already commeu4ed
this exercise initially c4icentratiog on industrial, commercial and
institutional establiebments. A solid waste account would be established
In order that' expendituris on and revenues frcmk the service can be
separately accounted for.  Duriug the course of program implementation,
measures targeted to cover a greater part of the cost of the pervice
-ogether with a seFsrate SWM account would 'be Introduced by tap AAAR.
12.       Civil-workk costs (Birr 0.98 million lncluding' contingencies and
taxes and duties) have been estimated frem detailed engineering proposals
prepared by National Engineers PLC in 1987 and subsequently modified. The
'details are shown in Appendix 2.  Technical-Assistance for the waste
manage^ent section of the Environmeital Health and' Social Service.
A D3partment has been identified (outlinerjob description in1'Annex 6) and a
\ total of Approximately 12 man-mwnths of assistance has been estbAsted at an
3all in cost" of US$15,100 per month (Birr 31,250 per month) together with

13.       The Vhvironmental Health and Social Services Department would be
responsible'for implementation of the program supported by the AAARPIO.
The AAAI0 and the Department-have al\eady produced draft bid dt uments   ;
for the procurement of worki, vehicles,'and equipment, the latter items
which would be procured through iCi procedures. Prelimairy spare parts
lists are being prepared by Equipment Seriices and will be finalized by
loan negotiations.  Technical Assistance would be engaged internatlonally
to carry out a Itailed review of collection arrangements and make\\

14.   l t Is .nviabged that two main ve4cLei and equipment contracts.
OVA  for collection wehicles-and the other for landfill plant.and equipment,
would be procured th ough ICB. Thesa would total approximately Birr 11.2
million (US$5.42 m11lon). Civil an  builditng works for which detailed
engineering has been prep&red would involve two or three contracts-of a
relatively minor nature. Some Birr 0.98 million (US$Q.48 million) wprth of
work at both existing and proposed iew landfill sites at different times
would be carried out. Because of the small size and nature of such works,
foreign contrectors are likely to be interested and the works would thus be
procured through local competitive bidding\procedures.  Spare parts worth
Birr 1.0 million (US$0.48 million) would be,procured as a matter of urgency
through local suppliers on apprwval by the Bank ofl.J4ts and quotations.
Containers are currently being modified and fabricated loca4ly, and AAR
would procure containers to be provided under' the Project locally, provided
that the qzantity, quality and cost are shown to be comparable with
estimates froiminternational vehicle and equipment manufacturers/suppliers.

would bi ident4fied and\ detailed propisals prepared during the course of
thei program, following the cQAcepts dEveloped for the Initial phase. An
allocation of 31rr 2.5 million for these additial Zebe4e hes beeti
included in the component. A detailed description of thd component is
Included in Anex 2.
2.14     Approximtely 4.3 km of vehlcular access and circulation, 8.3 km
of footpaths, 14.5 km of unlined drainage. 11 public water fountains to
supplemAnt existing coverage, 66 communsl latrine blocks, 28 hardstandings
for 8 m3 solid waste cootainers and 350 streetlights would be provided in
the initial phase of the program.
2.15     Proposals have been developed following planning, design and cost
standards whith are intended to provide a balanced, least cost, basic needs
infrastructure prcogram to spread benefits to as many people as possible, as
quickly as possible. The application 'of such standards has resulted in an
infrastructure upgrading program estimated to cost only about Birr 40,000
per hectare or Birr 80 (US$40) per capita.
2.16     Works have been planned and designed to ensure that demolition of
properties and relocation is kept to a minimum, and thus only 19 dwellings
are likely to be affected. Compensation and alternative better
accouaodation will be provided within the same Kebele areas for families
requiring to be moved, for which a resettlemeqt plan was discussed during
negotiations. As far as possible, various infrastructure upgrading works
vill be carried out in an integrated mmaner for efficiency, to keep
disruption in the areas to a minimum during the course of implementation
and to create an immediate impact in the areas.
2.17     In addition to the upgrading of infrastructure, a 'oncomitant
program addressed to improving the condition of the housing stock in the
selected R6beles would be supported under the Projeet, tut will be
contingent upon Bovernment through MMDU initiating sale procedures of the
predomLiantly Kebele-owned houses, a decision which has already been taken
by the 'Cntral Committee for the Workers Party (during the Vi4th Plenum).
Sale of houses is expected to provide the incentive for individual
households to improvelmaintain their houses, \which was not achieved under
the First Urban Development Project. A line of credit of Birr 2.25 million
to be administez   d by USB for home improvement loans for project
beneficiaries has been included in the Project. During negotiations
agreement was obtained that, as a condition of disbursement on the Rebele
upgrading component, the Government submit proof that it has started to
sell government-owned houses in areas already improved undWr the First
Urban Development Project (Tekl; Haimanot) aw well as project upgrading
areas and promote the improvement of houses 'in project areas. Sale of
about 100 houses in project areas would be considered as a clear 'indication
9f Goverment's commitment to this objective.

SECOND ADDIS A BABA  MUMB A          PROJECT.
Addis Ababa Water 4ad SeweraLe Authority Mena clal Analysis
I. Assumutions Used i-  Financial Proiections
General
Although the IDA Project is 'limited to the toaw of Akaki,
financial projections have been prepared for overall AWSA operations, since
the financial convennts will apply to overall AWSA operations. The
following assumptions have been made.
Incom Statements
Water sales are assumed to grow about 5? a year, based on past
experience and AWSA's future plans. Unaccounted-for-water is also assumed
to decline from the present level of 34t to about 251 by FY 1996/97, based
on the loss reduction measures that ARM is planning to undertake in the
next few years.  Vater tariffs are assumed to be adjusted starting in PY
1991/92 such that th9 water revenues, when combined with meter ;ents,
coanection charges and other revenues, would be sufficient to cdrer all
operating expensee and debt service or depreciation, whichever is higher.
A41 operating expenses have been adjusted to grow in proportion
to increase in water sales.  The number of staff is not expected to grow
sigiificantly. Fixed assets were depreciated at a rate of about 2.6S per
on a straight-line basis, based on past experience.
Cash Flow4Statements
It has been assumed that Government would provide AVR  with 152
of the total cost of the project in each year of projert Implementation as
)an oquity contribution. The remaining 852 of project cost would be covered
by the MA Credit. The proceeds of the Credit will be on-lent to ARS for
a period of 26 years, inOluding a 6-year grace period on repayment of
principal when only interest on the outstanding balance of the Credit would
be paid, followed by repayment of principal and interest oan the outstanding
balance over a 20-year perlod at an interest rate of 4U* This on-lending
interest rate is consistent with what AVSA is expected to pay on average on
its other outstanding external loans.
Starting in TY 1994;15 ARI will need to undertake substantial
investments to increase its water avallability to supply tbe growing demad
in the Addis Ababa region. these investsent requirements are
conservatively estimated to be around Birr 200 million, and it is assumed
that Government would provide about 5t of the total amoun' required for
this expension as an quity contrLbution, that about 10? will be provided
i Donors as grant, that about 75$ of the total amount required will be
borrowed, atd AMIA will finance the remaini8g 10 from internal sources.

Bd anc' Sheets
AWSA's existing coklection/billing ratio is about 80S, which is
satisfa4tory. With' the introduction of Improved billing facilities under
this Project, it is expected to improve to about 842. The level of',
inventories presently maintained are high mainly to avoid problems and
delays aslociated with procurement. However, this is Assumed to decline to
about 2X of gross fixed assets over the projected perio4.
Due to the low level of tartfs, AWSA has not been able to
service any" externa loans received in the past and the Government has,been
servicing them., Nor has AWSA been repaying the loans received from the
Ministry of Finance. Con'sistent with one of the conditions of the IDA
Credit, the projections assume that in FY l991/2 a portion of these loans
will be converted to equity. Th se consist of all past Ministry of Finance
loans (Birr 18,985,000), the rep yments of principal on foreign loans made
by'-the Government (Birr 28,300,000), and the intefest accrued on the
Ministry of Finance loans and the interest payments made by Government on
the foreign loans (Birr 16,400,000). The total amount of loans coverted t4
equity would be Brr 63,685,600.
- .  "   Customer deposits are assumed to grow consistent with the number
of connections.  Accounts payable have been assumed at 4bout 55X of total
expenditures. Based on past experience, advances to staff and contractors.
are projected to be slightly higher than accounts payable in the initial
years and then gradually decline to about an equal level.
Imterest during construction is assumed to te expended as it is
incurred.  Based on the projected tariff increase, A    is expected to
contribute signif1cantly to its future investment requirements.
