Some lessons learned includes: general\n            lessons. The contentious nature of land sector reforms. In\n            any country, bringing about reforms to the land sector is\n            always contentious and highly political. As such, policy and\n            institutional reforms are extraordinarily challenging and\n            invariably take a long time to achieve. Lack of high level\n            oversight and coordination. High level engagement and\n            oversight is required throughout the period of project\n            implementation to ensure the policy and institutional reform\n            agendas are progressed, and to also re-calibrate the project\n            implementation schedule and priorities as is deemed\n            necessary due to delays and unexpected challenges\n            encountered. Special lessons for land administration in\n            Indonesia. Alignment of Project implementation plan with the\n            Government's budget cycle. Project Baseline and Project\n            Development Objective (PDO) Indicators. The results\n            framework and the Monitoring and Evaluation (M and E) system\n            go hand in hand and should be designed with implementation\n            in mind. Land policy reform. Need for full-time project\n            staff. The borrower's ICR report makes a strong case\n            for full-time project staff to be assigned both at the\n            central and provincial levels. The effectiveness of having a\n            long list of legal covenants to mitigate project\n            implementation risks."}, "docdt": "2011-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
