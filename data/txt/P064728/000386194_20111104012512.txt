1. Project Context, Development Objeetives aDd Desiga

1.1 CODtext at Appraisal

Country aDd Seetor' BackgrouDd. At appraisal, the Indonesian land sector          was perceived as
one of the most inefficient sectors in the Indonesian economy:

    •   The legal framework was fragmented and allowed wide'discretion in interpreting the law.
    •   National Land Agency (BPN) offices did not provide an acceptable quality of service.
    •   The pace of land titling as slow and was falling behind the increase in new land parcels.
    •   Uncertain tenure and high transaction risks hindered land markets and investment.
    •   Local governments lacked capacity to execute their land management responsibilities.

Legal Framework. Land management and titling in Indonesia was governed by the Basic
Agrarian Law of 1960, the Basic Forestry Law of 1967, unwritten customary (adat) law, and a
series of laws, regulations, and policies that were passed after 1967 but which were often
inconsistent or in conflict with one another and with previous laws. The result was a complex
array of incidental laws, ministerial and other decrees, and ad-hoc regulations that allowed wide
discretion in interpreting the law and allocating of land rights, and provided little basis for fair
resolution of tenure disputes.

Administra.tion. BPN had responsibility for titling, registration, surveying and mapping, but
responsibility for nine other key activities had been transferred to local governments, including
dispute resolution, land use planning, and compensation for appropriated land. However, local
governments did not have the training, personnel, offices, and other assets needed to carry out
these functions effectively. The quality of serVices provided by both BPN and local governments
was very poor, despite a previous Bank-financed project, i.e. the Land Administration Project
(LAP), P003984, aimed at improving the performance ofBPN.

Titling. Only about 34 percent of all land parcels were titled, and· the number of new parcels
(mainly from subdivision of existing parcels) was increasing more quickly than they could be
registered and titled. Titling rates were low and the titling process was slow because of complex
and overlapping patterns of land tenure, weak institutional capacity of BPN, absence of
documentation, long-term disputes, and unclear procedures for adjudication.

Land markets. Buyers and sellers faced high transaction risks because of uncertain titles,
regulations, procedures, and adjudication. Efficient and fair land markets had not developed and
the number of registered transactions involving titled land was low. Although mortgages on titled
land increased slightly under LAP, 'in general land still could not be used as collateral to mobilize
financial resources. Unclear titles, unreliable and inaccessible records, and a refusal to recognize
informal but valid ownership were also leading to social conflict, particularly as Indonesia's
economy and government evolved rapidly after the end of the Suharto era in 1998.

RatioDale for Bank Involvement. The Bank already had global expertise in land administration
and management, including in four East Asian countries other than Indonesia (Laos, Philippines,
Thailand, and Cambodia). It also had direct sectoral experience in Indonesia through the LAP


                                                 1
project, which closed in December 2001. During implementation of LAP, the Bank deepened its
understanding of the country's land sector and institutions as well as its working relationship
with the Indonesian government and with BPN in particular. The lessons and experience both
from LAP and other countries would allow the Bank to provide sound technical, institutional,
and policy advice and to bring greater coherence to overall donor efforts in the sector.

By improving land management services and institutional capacity, increasing registration and .
titling, and strengthening tenure security and land markets, the project would support the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goals of improving the investment climate and making
service delivery responsive to the needs of the poor. More specifically, it would improve both the
security and val~e of the poor; s assets and help create more investment and economic
opportunities for the poor. It would also support the government's decentralization agenda, under
which many land management functions had already been transferred to local governments.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Performance Indicators

The objectives are to: (i) improve land tenure security and enhance the efficiency, transparency
and improve service delivery of land titling and registration; and (ii) enhance local government
capacity to undertake land management functions with great efficiency and transparency.

The PAD (section 2.1) listed five key performance indicators (KPIs):

    a.   Key land policies developed and regulations drafted.
    b.   Compliance with the minimum service standards.
    c.   Number of titles issued.
    d.   Improvement in land tenure security and speed in resolving land disputes.
    e.   Increase in land ~arket activities and increase in registration of subsequent transactions.

However, the Project Design Summary in Annex 1 of the PAD (and in the Development Credit
Agreement) comprised ten KPIs that overlapped with but did not directly correspond to the five
listed above. See Section 1.7 and Annex 2 for detailed discussion of the treatment of indicators
during supervision and in the ICR.         .

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

PDO. The PD~ was not revised.

Indicators. The KPIs were not formally revised. However, because of discrepancies between the
different lists of indicators, as well as issues of relevance and utility, the ICR includes the entire
set ofKPIs in Annex 2, but presents a subset of those indicators in the Data Sheet·that combines
the key elements most relevant to the PD~. Also, it is important to note that there were no
changes made to any of the indicators themselves. It is noted the PD~ indicators lacked values.
In almost all cases the indicator took the form of a non~quantified increase or decrease,. rather
than a percentage or number to increase/decrease by. See Section 1.7 and Annex 2 for details.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The project's primary target beneficiaries were the 2.5 million households expected to receive
land titles. Having fonnal titles would increase their tenure security and the value of their land
assets, improve access to credit, and create conditions that could foster increased investment,
productivity, and economic opportunities. Many of the expected beneficiaries were to have been
the poor and vulnerable who, because of time and resource constraints, had not previously
obtained land titles through the existing system.

The second key set of beneficiaries, were BPN, Bappenas, MoHA and the local governments
which were expected to establish a clearer regulatory and legal framework, stronger institutional
capacity to carry out their land-related mandates in titling, land administration and management,
governance and policy formulation.

It was also envisaged that the project would provide indirect benefits to the broader population
which would also enjoy improved land management and titling services after the project closed
as well as the ongoing benefits of more active and efficient land markets' and related economic
benefits and opportunities.

1.S Original Components

The project had five main components:

1.     Development ofthe Land Policy and Regulatory Framework
This component would support the development of a land policy and regulatory framework for
land management through: (i) the development of government capacity to coordinate formulation
of land policies through consultative processes; (ii) the development of a national land policy; (iii)
the formulation and studies of specific key policies in the areas of land management and
administration and the development and drafting of the regulatory framework to implement them.

2.     Institutional Development, Capacity Buiiding, and Training
The objectives of this component were to support BPN's transformation into a transparent,
responsive and more service-oriented institution and to develop the capacity of local academic
institutions to provide land administration education and training. As described under
Component 5, many land management functions were transferred from national to local authority
under Presidential Decree No. 34 of 2003 (Keppres 34/2003). The residual functions (including
land registration, titling, surveying and mapping) are delivered by BPN through provincial,
district and local land offices.

This component includes subcomponents covering: (i) development and implementation oflong-
term strategic planning for BPN; (ii) re-engineering of land offices to deliver transparent and
efficient land administration services to the community at the local level, (iii) support to the legal
department of BPN to develop policy and prepare laws and' regulations, (iv) education and
training to strengthen land administration expertise, and (v) overall project management.

 awareness and participation; (ii) systematic land titling; (iii) streamlining of Land Office registration
 processes (such as the process of sporadic registration); and (iv) increased capacity of the private
 surveying sector. The component proposed a program of systematic registration that initially focused
 on five provinces in Java with modest expansi~ to 4-5 selected urban centers outside Java.

 4.       Development ofa Land Iriformation System
 The objective of this component was to develop a framework for a Land Information System
 (LIS}-along the lines called for in Keppres 34/2003-to facilitate improved access to land
 information for government agencies and civil society, promote transparency and facilitate
 public participation in land management, and improve land administration services. The need for
 this LIS was based on the premise that land information is critical for effective decision~making
 on social, economic and environmental issues at all levels of government. The component would
 support these goals through: (i) development of a national land information strategy; (ii)
 establishment of LIS infrastructure; and (iii) a LIS pilot study covering one district.

 5.    " Capacity Building Support for Local Government
 This component, administered by the Ministry of Home Affairs, would strengthen the capacity,
 efficiency, and transparency of loCal governments in carrying out their land management functions, "
 and in particularly the nine activities transferred from national to local authority under Keppres
 3412003. These activities were: (a) location permit issuance; (b) taking of land in the public
 interest; (c) cultivated land dispute settlement; (d) compensation detennination for land taken for
 development; (e) land distribution and compensation for land held in excess of standards;" (f)
 detennination and resolution of ulayat land problems; (g) resolution of unutilized land problems;
 (h) land opening permit provision; and (i) land use planning in local government jurisdictions.

  The component's main activities included: (a)" an in-depth assessment of the local governments'
. capacity to undertake their new functions; (b) a pilot training and capacity building program for
  five local governments; (c) development of a national strategy for strengthening local·
  government land administration, and (d) technical assistance for implementation.

 1~6   Revised Components

There were no revisions to the project components.

1.7 Other Signifieant Changes

As mentioned in Sections 1.2 and 1.3, there were discrepancies between the 5 key indicators listed in
the beginning of the PAD and the 10 key PDQ indicators (and 24 component output indicators) listed
in the Project Design Summary in Annex 1 of the PAD. Neither set of indicators fully covered the
main parts of the PDQ. Therefore, during supervision and completion reporting the task team used a
subset of indicators for project reporting that combined the most relevant elements of both versions
of the iildicators, as determined by the Bank and borrower ·project teams. The complete set of
indicators (see Annex 2) was also tracked and was reported regularly in the mission aide-memoire.


                                                    4
This primary subset of indicators included three of the five KPIs- from the main PAD document
(section 2.1) and two additional indicators that combined key elements of the indicators in the
results annex:

          Main PAD (Section A.2)
    a) Key land policies developed and regulations drafted.
    b) Compliance with the minimum service standards.
    c) Number of titles issUed and distributed (i.e. collected by beneficiaries).

          PAD Annex 1
    d) Infonnation system for decentralized and improved land administration and management
       created and functioning well.
    e) Local government strengthened to efficiently undertake land management functions.

The two indicators drawn from the annex dealt with elements of the PD~ that were not
adequately addressed in the five KPls from the main PAD, specifically the service delivery
aspects of the land registration system and the capacity. of local governments. .

Many of the indicators that were not included in this primary subset were related to outcomes that
could not be reliably measured during the implementation period or clearly attributed to the project
(such as decrease in informal payments, or increase in land market activity and land values). In
addition, most -would be measured. only in two socio-economic studies for baseline and impact
assessment. Ultimately the baseline was not carried out until the time of the mid-term review, and
neither the baseline nor the impact study yielded robust data on many of the indicators.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The project's main strengths at entry were: (a) it addressed very relevant problems in the sector
with very relevant activities and investments, and (b) it included a detailed anti-corruption
strategy addressing key governance issues throughout the project.

The main weaknesses were (a) underestimating risks, particularly related to inter-institutional
coordination, high-level program oversight, and the capacity and commitment of BPN to bring
about major policy changes, (b) shortcomings or inconsistencies in the indicator framework,
which required clarification during implementation, and (c) inadequately incorporating the
lessons from previous operations, such as avoiding excessive complexity.

There was· not a QAG quality of entry (QAE) assessment, but the Bank's seventh Quality of
Supervision Assessment (QAS7)1 in 2006 called the project ''well-designed'' and the 2008 Quality



1 QAS7   the B~'s supervision of the project. It did not assess project design.



                                                          5
Assessment of the Lending Portfolio (QALP-l)2 which reviewed a broader range of project
elements, concluded that design was Moderately Satisfactory and identified several design
shortcomings, including overestimation of implementing agency capacity, commitment, and high-
level project coordination, and late scheduling of critical monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities.

Soundness ofbackground analysis

The background analysis and project rationale were strong. The Bank· had a very' good
understanding of land policy, administration, and titling issues in Indonesia both through its
experience and evaluation of the earlier project (LAP), assessments and studies commissioned
during preparation ofLMPDP, and review of third-party studies and analysis.

The project identified the importance of increasing title registration and improving the legal
ftamework, capacity, and transparency of national and local governments in the sector as a way to
strengthen tenure security, improve services, and foster efficient and effective land markets. These
outcomes are expected to contribute to higher-level impacts of increasing well-being and economic
opportunities for the poor. The main obstacles to achieving these outcomes and objectives were
identified as being an outdated and fragmented legal and regulatory framework, poor institutional
arrangements and capacity for providing effective land administration and management services, and
weak local government capacity to carry out their newly acquired responsibilities. Preparation alSo
included careful analysis of fraud and corruption problems and specific measures to address them.

The lessons learned from earlier operations and experience were sound, such as addressing land
titling in the context of a broader policy approach, focusing on systematic registration in entire
areas, and incorporating traditional land rights customs (adatluluyat) into the regulatory
frame~ork. Specific lessons from LAP included making sure that activities led to actual policies
and regulations rather than just studies, the importance of transforming BPN into an efficient and
accountable partner and implementing agency,and establishing sound and transparent dispute
resolution mechanisms to ensure public confidence in the system.

Assessment ofproject design

The objectives and their translation into components and activities were well-designed. The first
main objective, on land tenure security and improved titling and registration services, was linked to
components 1-4, which focused on (a) policy and regulatory reform, (b) capacity building for BPN,
(c) accelerated land titling, and (d) developing land information systems. The second main
objective, on local government capacity, was mainly linked to Component 5 activities for building
the capacity of local governments through capacity assessment, direct training of local government
staff in the project area, strategic planning for ongoing capacity building, and project management
support to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA), which was the main implementing agency for
these activities.



2 QALP-I assessed five project elements: (a) Quality of Design; (b) Quality ofImplementation; (c) Quality of Bank
Supervision; and (d) Likelihood of Achieving the Development Objectives.       .




                                                        6
However, the design tried to mitigate some of the concerns about agencies carrying through on
commitments and completing intermediate outputs by making many of these . outputs dated
covenants, which reduced flexibility and may have diminished rather than increased the likelihood
of keeping the project on track. In addition, with three' implementing agencies carrying out
different activities, a high-level steering committee was included in the project design to ensure
proper coordination and leadership. The failure to establish this committee or provide the needed
leadership could be interpreted' as a combination of shortcomings in design, risk assessment, and
performance by either the government or implem~nting agency. Despite the validity or the lessons
learned from previous experiences and attempts to take them into account in the project design, the
project still fell into some of the same pitfalls as previous projects (such as studies not leading to
policy reform, or insufficient capacity and coordination). Unfortunately, the effective coordination
mechanism that existed during the project preparation period, ceased to operate after the project
became effective. Bappenas' efforts to re-initiate high-level coordination mechanisms did not
come to fruition, although there was coordination at a technical level. Accordingly, the successful
land policy study program did not proceed to policy formulation. Although Bappenas has advised
that the studies would be inputs to the National Medium Term Development Plan (NMTDP),
2010-2014, this remains to be seen, and in the absence of a high-level coordination mechanism
would seem to be unlikely.

Another shortcoming, mentioned previously, were the inconsistencies in defining the KPIs and
other indicators, and their linkage to the PDQs. The M&E arrangements also were not as strong
as they could have been, as explained in more detail in Section 2.3.

Government commitment and stakeholder involvement

While at entry the government was clearly committed to the objectives of the project and there'
was high-level oversight and direction during. preparation,' the commitment of specific agencies
to some elements of the project design was not as strong as it could have been. In part this was
because the responsibilities and interests of different agencies in implementing the project were
not always in hannony, which contributed to implementation arrangements that were fairly
complex while at the same time creating greater challenges for project coordination, oversight,
and leadership. Government commitment during implementation and assessment of commitment
as a risk are discussed in other sections.

Stakeholders were consulted regularly throughout the design phase of the project, and their input
was reflected in the draft environmental assessment and environmental management plan. The
Bank's preparation team independently met with, civil society organizations to learn first-hand
the concerns of the various stakeholders, ranging from, traditional community groups to the
mayors' association. The project also included provisions for ongoing stakeholder and civil
society consultation and involvem.ent during most aspects of project implementation.

Assessment ofrisks

The main risk that was underestimated was lack of effective coordination from the Steering
Committee, which was rated as modest but should have been substantial or even high,
considering both its likelihood and impact on implementation and outcomes. Another key risk,
the weak capacity of BPN to implement the project, and particularly the capacity of top


                                                 7
management to foster major institutional, policy, and regulatory change, was not specifically
assessed as a risk in the PAD, but should· have been considered substantial or high. A closely
related risk, the commitment of BPN to reform, transparency, and openness,·was properly rated
as substantial, but like many of the other risks, the mitigation measures proposed were aimed
more at limiting exposure of the project by slowing or scaling back the project in response to risk,
rather than reducing the likelihood of the risk and mitigating its impact.

Corruption concerns were reflected in the assessment matrix in terms of openness, transparency,
financial management, and accountability in different parts of the project, which were all rated as
substantial (except for ~ocal governments, which rated low). The project included a detailed anti-
corruption framework, and the three implementing agencies agreed to specific mitigation
measures in six main areas: (a) enhanced disclosure provisions; (b) standardization of procedures;
in particular bidding and contractdoouments; (c) service standards development and monitoring;
(d) civil society oversight and feedback; (e) complaints handling mechanisms ·and the use of·
sanctions; and (t) strengthening of internal controls and payment validation.

2.2    Implementation

Implementation was strong in terms of activities related to land titling and local government
capacity, but weaker in policy development, institutional· development, and particularly land
information systems. The project got off to a slow start, largely for reasons beyond its control
and once activities were well underway there was uneven performance and commitment from the
implementing agencies, and lack of strong coordination and leadership from the government.
Some project design and preparation factors contributed to implementation problems, but were
not the main cause for the project's shortcomings.

Transition ofgovernment and natural disasters

Two major events that took place following project approval and effectiveness substantially
slowed project start-up .during the first two years of implementation: (a) Indonesia's ·first~ever
direct presidential election and the transition· of power to anew administration, and (b) the
devastating tsunami that struck Aceh in December 2004, followed by a major earthquake off
North Sumatra in March 2005. The new government took office in October 2004, introducing its
own reform agenda, significant changes to budgetary and procurement systems, and significant
turnover in key management and staff positions, including the head to the main implementing
agency (BPN). The recovery and reconstruction efforts in the aftermath of the tsunami and
earthquake dominated the attention of most national government institutions for some time,
including BPN. The Bank and the government prepared a series of emergency reconstruction
projects, including the Reconstruction of Aceh Land Administration System Project (RALAS),
which was implemented by BPN and ran in parallel with LMPDP. Having to ''fight on two
fronts" at the same time strained the agency's capacity, particularly that of its top management.

Factors generally subject to government control
The project's major activities suffered from a pattern of "stop-start" implementation related to
the government's bulky and complicated system for releasing the DIPA, including donor funds,
which by law must pass through the parliament and then a series of additional steps. These


                                                8
 regulations can also result in delays when changes are made to project activities or the specific
 use of funds, as well as transferring uilused funds from one year's implementation plan to the
 next. In the first calendar year of implementation (2005), the budget release process was not
 completed until June; Similar delays occurred throughout project implementation.
                            ,    ,



 The project also suffered from the government's failure to establish the LMPDP Project Steering
 Committee, as called for iil the project design and required by the legal agreement. This
 committee was to play a key role in guiding land policy development, the implementation of
 which was particularly affected as a result. The fact that this committee could not be set up may
 indicate that the government and/or BPN is reluctant to change the institutional status quo in
 areas where BPN enjoys a de-facto policymaking role. Stronger government oversight or
 intervention could also have helped address the factors contributing to BPN's under-performance
 in work planning and reporting and its failure to comply with a number of loan covenants..

 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control

. The project had one overall Central Project Manageplent Unit (CPMU) established within BPN
  as well as 'three project implementation units (PIUs) established within MoHA, BAPPENAS, and
  BPN to carry out the activities of each implementing agency. Two of the project's implementing
. agencies (MoHA and BAPPENAS) made appropriate staffmg and resource commitments to their
  PIUs and provided adequate technical and managerial skills. But BPN, the agency responsible
 'for the overall implementation as well·as most project activities (90 percent of the project by
  cost), did not assign full time staff to manage the project and also lacked strong leadership.

 Unfortunately BPN was reluctant to utilize Credit hired key expert consultants, in areas such as
 project management, M&E, procurement, FM, IT and GIS. The project design, identified BPN's
 capacity weaknesses and proposed hiring of TA in response. Unfortunately, this did not occur.
 Again, both Bappenas and MoHA, which also had capacity limitations, hired the requisite TA,
 utilizing the CreditlLoan, and achieved significant success in project implementation.

 BPN did not seem sufficiently committed to making progress in areas under the project other
 than issuing.titles. Even when it came to titling activities, BPN Pusat (central office in Jakarta)
 was a bottleneck because it did not decentralize much of the decision-making. Without full-time
 BPN staff to manage to the project, the agency could not adequately identify and resolve
 implementation issues without assistance from the Bank. Full-time BPN project management
 staff could have fostered:
    •   Stronger ownership of the project and accountability for implementation progress
        (particularly for the tasks other than land titling).
    •   Greater initiative in solving performance issues (project management, alignment of
        project planniIig with budgeting, disbursement planning and procurement planning, as
        well as project M&E and reporting)
    •   Better understanding of procurementlbudget process issues.




                                                 9
QAG assessments (QSA7 and QALP-l)

The QSA7 report noted: "Project implementation suffered in the initial phase due to lack of
Government budgetary allocation which coincided with emergence of country level challenges
such as changing political scenario, the Tsunami and the earthquake. The budget problem is
rooted in the national laws that require donor lending to pass through the parliamentary process,
which unnecessarily delays the clearance of annual release of funds for the projects. This was
further aggravated by changes in the senior staff at the national and project level."

A more recent QAG assessment in November 2008 (QALP-l) agreed with the most current ISR
ratings for progress toward development objectives (moderately ~atisfactory) and overall
implementation progress (unsatisfactory). It rated quality of project design as moderately
satisfactory, implementation as unsatisfactory, and Bank supervision as satisfactory, stating that
"In essence, this project has been very poorly implemented, despite good. supervision effort."

The findings were generally in line with those expressed in this ICR, and the main shortcomings
in implementation related to the lack ofa high-level coordination (or steering) committee, lack of
appropriate counterpart staffing for the project, irregular budget flows, weak procurement
capacity and performance, insufficient socialization of the project, and the persIstence of
informal payments in land titling.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

BPN was unable to effectively monitor some of its key project activities, and did not establish
                                                                                    a
monitoring capacity through an independent national consulting firm, university, or NGO, as was
intended under the project design. Some weaknesses in the project's M&E system were related to the
design of the original project results framework, but the main shortcomings were due to poor M&E
capacity and implementation. On the other hand, Bappenas and MoHA were able to very effectively
monitor the implementation of their project activities under Components 1 and 5 respectively.

Design .

The project design outlined an ambitious M&E approach based on a combination of internal and
external monitoring and reporting, and required that the details of the system be finalized and put
in place during. the initial stages of implementation. Responsibility for internal monitoring would
be assigned to the relevant agencies or implementation units, while the external monitoring would·
be carried out by an independent national consulting firm, university, or NGO for some aspects and
by stakeholders and CSOs involved with the .project for others. The external monitoring would
coverall key project activities, including land titling, performance of the implementing agencies
and local governments, land disputes, complaints handling, and compliance with service standards.
The service standard monitoring was given special attention, though it would begin at a later stage,
after the standards were in place. Socio-economic impacts would be measured through a baseline
survey (SEBS) in the first year and an impact survey (SEIS) in the final year of the project.

As mentioned in Section 1.7, there were some discrepancies between the KPls stated in the
beginning of the PAD and those listed in the results framework in Annex 1. Also, some of the
indicators were difficult to measure over the implementation period of the project or to clearly


                                                10
attribute to the project activities. Furthermore, measurement of the majority of the PDQ
indicators in the annex relied entirely on the SEIS.

It is noted that the November 2008 QALP-l reported that scheduling the main baseline survey
for well after project effectiveness was a serious shortcoming, particularly "given the Bank's
long engagement in the sector and the time it took to prepare the project." It also said that the ten
indicators for the PDQ were too numerous and too demanding.

Implementation

The project baseline (SEBS) was only completed in May 2007, at the time of the project's MTR.
Besides being-late, it was also poorly executed and incomplete, and did not address or establish a
baseline for the majority of the ten PDQ outcome indicators it was intended to measure.

The impact survey (SEIS) was also poorly managed, failed to assess the majority of PDQ
            and was ineffective in assessing its impacts. The SEIS consultants reported to the
indicators, _
Bank, after the fact, that they had not seen the PAD or been provided with key project
supervision documents before designing and carrying out the survey. There was little evidence
that the extensive comments provided by the Bank on the SEIS consultant's inception report
were considered in carrying out the survey and drafting the final report, and BPNdid respond to
Bank requests to share intermediary reports from the SEIS team.

Throughout implementation, the project lacked a timely and reliable monitoring system, even for
project inputs. For example, four months after the project closed, reliable data on disbursements by
component was still not available. In general, the overall M&E system did not provide information
on beneficiaries and usually did not provide good information prior to supervision missions.

Utilization

There was no effective monitoring system to provide feedback to help improve BPN's day-to-
day operations in titling or land office management. -Similarly, both the SEBS and SEIS would
seem to have been prepared more to comply with Bank requirements rather than for utilization
within the implementing agencies to improve project management monitoring.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance"

Environmental safoguards

The project was designated as Environmental Category B. The direct project activities had
negligible potential for environmental impacts, mainly related to renovation of some existing
offices. These civil works were covered by the building renovation permits based on Indonesian
regulations that the Bank determined were sufficient for the type of works carried out.

Land titling h8s no direct environmental impact" on land. The titling process essentially
formalizes the existing occupancy of the land, confirming the possessory rights of the legitimate
occupants with a land title certificate. It is noted however, that once people do have a title, they
are more likely to invest in their property, including making improvements. The SEIS reported


                                                 11
that almost 48% of respondents would be willing to improve their land after they received Ii title.
Any such improvements would be subject to the government's environmental, planning and
building regulations. The project implementation complied with environmental safeguards.

Social safeguards

The project built on the preparation team's social specialists to educate the adjudication teams,
raising their awareness and training them. To safeguard indigenous peoples' issues, the project
precluded titling where ownership claims were contested or claimed by indigenous people, any
government entity, or a community. In addition, off Java, it precluded titling activities in the
rural areas. Systematic adjudication was not undertaken in forestry and conflict areas. The
project implementation complied with social safeguards.

Financial management and Procurement

Although the financial management system for LMPDP needed strengthening during
implementation, at the transaction level it worked reasonably well. However, FM reports usually
were not delivered on schedule and were not always consistent or properly authenticated by senior
officers. Delays in FM report submission were often due to late submission of reports from the
respective PIUs to the CPMU. There also was not an effective, integrated system for collectively
tracking and analyzing the detailed contract and account details contained in individual files.
Despite continuing shortcomings, FM issues did not significantly affect project outputs and
outcomes, though it made accounting for resources slow and cumbersome. The main budget issue
affecting implementation progress, as discussed in Section 2.2, was the recurring delay in
completing the procedural process for releasing funds approved in the government's DIPA.

Annual procurement planning was problematic, and for a couple of years the Bank team worked
full-tin;te with the project to provide intensive guidance to complete the task. Weaknesses in
preparation of bidding documents and in systematic compliance with standard procurement and
bid evaluation procedures also caused some problems and delays, but these decreased as the
project progressed and capacity increased.

2.5 Post-Completion OperationlNext Phase

Although ~ was some discussion of project extension, and interest on the part of BPN in
continuing activities related to institutional development and LIS, the project closed on schedule and
there is no specific plan for a follow-on operation or next phase. In discussions with BPN on
extension, BPN advised the Bank that it did not wish to undertake systematic titling, despite the fact
that at least 70 percent of the country remains to be titled. Both Bappenas and MOHA advised that
they had achieved their respective objectives under the project and did not need to continue: From the
range of policy studies and NLPF development, Bappenas has been effective in bringing a number of
key land tenure issues into the preparation ofNMTDP. In the case ofMOHA, with the finalization of
the strategic implementation plan for local government land management, the goverpment budget
will be utilized for a national roll-out to all 300 LOUs and 3600 districts. MOHA's strategic
implementation plan for local government land management has been developed from the valuable
lessons, practical experience and capacity building from Component 5 of the project


                                                 12
3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

At the time of the ICR, the project objectives continued to be highly relevant. Improved land tenure
security, service delivery in land titling, and local government capacity for land management are
important for reducing poverty. promoting economic growth, and strengthening governance and
institutional capacity. At approval, the main Country Assistance Strategy goals supported by the
project were effective implementation of decentralization ~d sustainable income-generating
opportunities for the poor. The operation is still relevant to the goals of the 2009-12 Country
Partnership Strategy, which builds on the governance focus of the 2004-08 Country Assistance
Strategy by emphasizing improvement of government programs and strengthening institutions.

While the project objectives, components, and activities were highly relevant throughout the
implementation period, implementation suffered in large part because the design overestimated
the capacity and commitment of the main implementing agency and underestimated the need for
strong government coordination and leadership. The fact that the policy development and
institutional and service delivery objectives of the project fell short, reinforces their continuing
relevance but also indicates that stronger implementation arrangements and government
commitment are required to aChieve them.

In addition, better monitoring and evaluation arrangements and more specific and measurable
outcome indicators would help improve performance and identify. areas where linkages between
activities, outputs, and outcomes need to be strengthened. For example, like previous projects,
LMPDP produced various land studies, reports, and strategies in specific topical areas, but these
did not lead to clear and cohesive policy directions or reform. More specific policy goals, such as
resolving conflicts between the basic agrarian and forestry laws, could provide a clearer roadmap
for policy development and addressing key issues affecting land tenure security.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Land tenure security

In regard to the objective of improving land tenure security, the project was quite successful in
terms of producing and distributing new titles through the systematic land titling component.
However, land tenure insecurity cOmes not only from lack of titles, but also from lack of clear
laws, regulations, and policies, and from conflicts between laws. In this regard, the project fell
short. While it produced a National Land Policy Framework (NLPF) and many worthwhile
policy and planning studies, they have not yet resulted in regulatory reform, the adoption of a
clear overarching regulatory framework, or resolution of legal inconsistencies such as the
conflict between the basic agrarian and forestry laws. The government's ability to formulate land
policy and regulations, an important underpinning of tenure ~urity, did not tangibly improve.

Furthermore, many of the indicators for tenure security and the impact of tenure security were
not conclusively measured in the project's closing socioeconomic impact survey. Still, the tenure
security gains from titling alone were substantial, directly benefited at least two million



                                                13
 landowners, and there is some evidence that this in tum improved the investment environment,
 strengthened land markets, and increased economic opportunities.

Service delivery

In terms of enhancing the efficiency, transparency, and impr(}vingservice delivery of land titling
and registration, the project was substantially less successful. Although improvement in service
delivery (including governance) was a critical element of the project design, only minimal progress
was made. Service delivery standards were prepared, but no monitoring was undertaken and there
is no data to show that service actually improved. Regarding. governance, including the persistence
of informal payments in the titling process, concerns were raised by both the media and the
supervision team, and while BPN acknowledged the concerns, it never took decisive remedial
action. Efficiency of titling remained more or less at the same level as during the LAP project
(1994-2001) and were not enhanced through the project's technology improvements using global
positioning and electronic total station technologies as well as GIS. Ultimately, the project's titling
outputs were entirely budget driven, and although effi~iency gains were well within BPN's
capacity, output levels were constrained by the budget assigned. That is, productivity was a
function of budget and planned unit cost, rather than by capacity and potential to deliver at a more
efficient unit cost.

Development of a new land information system (LIS), which was relevant to both the tenure
security and service delivery objectives of the project, made only modest progress on
intermediate steps, with no tangible progress toward establishing an actual system.

Local government capacity

 The project was considerably more successful.in achieving the objective of enhancing local
government capacity to undertake land management functions with great efficiency and
transparency. The local governments were motivated to address this issue (and enhance their
capacity) because they found efficient undertaking of land management functions could lead to
improvement of their finances and local services. The activities and outputs of the local
government component-piloting operational strategic plans in five local governments and
providing training to staff in. 400 local governments-were fully achieved. However, the
indicators related to this objective faced the familiar challenge of how to measure capacity
outcomes rather than activities and outputs, so while implementation was quite successful and
the perception of local governments favorable, the project did not include mechanisms to clearly
measure the capacity strengthening outcomes in tangible terms;

3.3 Efficiency

The project cost ofUS$51.6 million puts the cost of producing and distributing roughly 1.7 million
titles at US$30 per title. This compares favorably with the US$65 per title as indicated in the recent
ICR for Lao PDR, Second Land Titling Project. This positive efficiency result of LMPDP can be
attributed to the project spending 83 percent of the total cost on systematic land titling which led to
worthwhile improvement in land security for 99 percent of the respondents where the systematic
land titling program was undertaken. The per title cost drops to about US$25, if only direct costs



                                                 14
for land titling are considered, and could be as low as US$17 per title if one assumes the number of
titles (2.1 million) and direct titling costs (US$35.6 million) indicated in the Government's report.

At Approval, with various benefits that had been quantified (such. as, the increase in the use of titles to
obtain credit going up by 12.8 percent in the project area etc.), the PAD had estimated a project ERR
of 33 percent, and a FRR of 16 percent. The Socio Economic Impact Study (SEIS) undertaken at the
end of project implementation did not estimate the benefits quantitatively. Consequently, without
reliable quantified data on benefits, such calculations were not attempted for the ICR

The ICR estimates titled land value to be US$360 per parcel and the value of all land titled under
the project (1.7 milFon titles, the output validated by the Bank) at over US$600 million. This
implies that to cover the cost of the project the increase in value of the land required is less than
9 percent. This is quite conceivable particularly in the semi-urban, communities where the
probability of conflicts 'and the value of land titles rise more than they do in rural communities.
The above calculations also demonstrate why sporadic titling with its US$150 per parcel price
tag,makes sense only in some communities.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The'overall outcome of the project is rated moderately unsatisfactory. While relevance was high,
and efficiency was reasonably good, there were significant shortcomings in the achievement of
some objectives. The project had mixed results in achieving the first main objective (land, tenure
and service delivery) but was more successful in achieving the goals related to the second
objective (local government capacity). However, the first part ofthePDO, which can be viewed
as two distinct but interrelated objectives, is considered more important to the overall project
objectives as well as higher-level development impacts not directly measured by the project.

On the first objective, the project had moderately satisfactory outcomes in acCelerating systematic
land titling, achieving at 92% of its target of 2.5 million titles. 3 More than 22 percent were issued
to women, and another 4 percent to women as joint owners. Results of the socioeconomic impact
surveys (see Section 3.6 and Annex 5) reflect strong positive perceptions among stakeholders of
the transparency and fairness of the systematic titling, as well as the importance of land titles and
the belief that titles increase land values. Although the survey was not designed to compile
objective data to support these perceptions, more than 90 percent of respondents expressed positive
opinions on these core questions. However, while issuing land titles is one critical element in
improving land tenure security, progress was unsatisfactory in other key areas related to enhancing
the efficiency, transparency, and improving service delivery of land titling and registration. Re-
engineering of model BPN land offices was not completed. Service standards were developed and
adopted, but were not implemented and monitored. Development of a new land infonnation system



3Following the closure ofLMPDP at December 31, 2009, BPN has advised in its final report for the ICR, dated Feb
25,2011, that 2,308,815 titles were registered (issued), which would represent an achievement of 92%. The Bank
was unable to validate this final achievement.



                                                      15
did not proceed beyond the planning stage. Many ofthe phmned. intennediatepolicy and regulatory
studies and strategies were completed, but they were not coordinated and carried through in a way
that would achieve the intended policy outcomes. For example, there was no resolution of
problems arising from competing and sometimes conflicting laws for forest and agricultural lands.

Similarly, efficiency, transparency, and service delivery for sporadic land titling and subsequent
registration efforts were not significantly improved by the project. There was evidence in the
socioeconomic impact survey of positive perceptions about the effect of title security on land
values, economic opportunity, investment, access to credit, and strengthening of land markets.
However, the survey only.included participants in the systematic titling program, and the survey
design and fmdings were not highly rigorous. Part of the problem in this regard is that these
indicators verge on higher-level development impacts, rather than project outcomes that are both
measurable over a short period and attributable to the project.

·The project had satisfactory achievement of the second main objective, namely to enhance local
 government capacity to undertake land management functions with great efficiency and
 transparency. The local government land management pilots were successful and provide a
 model that can be scaled up nationwide. Training of local government officials and staff met the
 target of 400 local governments (1,125 individualS). While these indicators measure outputs·
 rather than outcomes, the strong interest and participation from local governments is evidence of •
 the value and timeliness of the training and capacity building. The project also helped
 strengthened the capacity of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA), which is responsible for
 facilitating local governments' adoption of these decentralized responsibilities, and created both
 a needs assessment and a strategic plan for ongoing capacity building in the sector.

3.5 OverarchingThemes, ~her Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty. lloverty-based targeting and direct measurement of poverty impacts was not part of the
project design,· but it is believed to have mainly benefited poor households. The socioeconomic
baseline study suggested that 70-80 percent of the beneficiary households had annual incomes
below US$I,OOO (roughly US$250 per capita). Even if there was underreporting of income, it is
evident that most beneficiaries had low incomes. Furthermore, subsidization of titling fees under
the project's systematic titling program benefited many households that cOuld not have afforded
a title under the regular (sporadic) titling program.

Gender. The systematic titling program put considerable effort into ensuring women's rights to
titles. This was facilitated by the prevailing culture where women enjoy land ownership under'
the traditional titling system, though formal titles have typically named men rather than·women
as the landowner. Overall, 22.5 percent of the titles registered under the project went to women,
and 4.2 percent included women as co-owners. Titling to women increased as the project
progressed, with the SEIS reporting that roughly. 46 percent of the titles distributed through the
project in 2009 went to women.

Social Development. By having an effective participatory process in place in all project areas,
the project also delivered the social development outcome of reducing conflict over land. Similar

                                               16
gains were not achieved for those communities in "forest" land because the overlapping
jurisdiction of laws in those areas remained unresolved under the project.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

There was minimal institutional change/strengthening of BPN during the project despite the
development of a comprehensive strategic plan for the agency. Institutional gains at Bappenas
were also limited. On the other hand, the institutional strengthening at MOHA was substantial.
With the completion of the local land management pilots, MOHA gained valuable expertise
needed to effectively assist local government units (LGUs) on an ongoing basis. The training
provided to more than 1,000 LGU officials similarly strengthened capacity in 400 LGUs.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Toward the end of the project, LMPDP was able to achieve some harmonization of a range of
different activities supporting land-related legal reform, viz. with another Bank-funded operation
and also an Asian Development Bank (ADB) funded program, which has paved the way for
drafting of a new draft law on land acquisition. During the final two years of project
implementation, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) began providing technical assistance for
revision of land laws, with particular emphasis on valuation and land acquisition under its program
for "Enhancing the Legal and Administrative Framework for Land" (ELAF). This was independent
of LMPDP. At the same time, the Bank commenced analytical work on land acquisition in
conjunction with an mRD-funded Infrastructure Development Policy Loan (IDPL) project.
Component 1 underLMPDP was undertook a number of policy studies. Although these three
activities were disconnected, the Bank task team engaged in regular dialogue with each. For a long
time these activities were disconnected, despite the Bank team's continued recommendations to
BPN, to undertake a leadership and coordination role in order to harmonize the respective efforts.
Successive Bank supervision missions during 2008 and 2009, as reported in the respective aide-
memoires, gave a lot of focus to this issue, including bringing the matter to the attention of the
BPN Head, who also endorsed the need for harmonization, through the land acquisition committee
that he chaired. Subsequently, by the time of preparing this ICR, the government announced a new
draft law on land acquisition, which had draWn upon the respective efforts discussed above.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Although a workshop was not held specifically for the purpose of the ICR, the project's final
socioeconomic impact survey (SEIS) product:;d many findings on the views of project
beneficiaries and stakeholders about the project's systematic land titling program (Component 3).
The survey found evidence of good program performance and/or that respondents had strong
favorable perceptions of most aspects of the project's systematic titling program, including:
       •   Inclusion of communities in the land titling process.
       •   Inclusion of gender concerns and promotion of title rights for women.
       •   Dissemination of program and titling information though public campaigns (posters,
           leaflets, radio, television, and public notification).



                                                17
        •   Usage of titles received and post-titling impact on land values in the area.
        •   Understanding ofthe content and use ofland titles (including use as collateral).
        •. Quality of titles.
        •   Technical performance offield teams.
        •   Knowledge and use of the complaints handling mechanism.
        •   Increased options for investment, land use, or other economic opportunities.

Some of the findings reflected strong positive perceptions of the value of titles (more than 90
percent for most key questions, such as the effect on land values), but the survey did not attempt
the more difficult task of compiling and analyzing objective data to support those perceptions.
Around 45 percent of respondents were unfamiliar with using titles as collateral for borrowing.
Unfortunately the survey did not clearly advise on the proportion that had used or would consider
using their titles to help access formal credit. The Executive Summary of the SEIS is at Annex 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

The risk to the limited land tenure outcomes achieved by registering new land titles in the project
areas is low to moderate, and the risks to outcomes achieved in strengthening local government
capacity is moderate. However, the .risk to the outcomes of improving land tenure security
generally (outside the project's accelerated title program) and enhancing the transparency,
efficiency, and quality of land titling and service delivery is high. That is, there is a high likelihood
that the intended outcomes expected but not yet realized under the project still will not be achieved.

The land titles already issued under the project clearly improved the tenure security of the direct
beneficiaries of that program. There is negligible risk that the security of those titles will be
compromised, which in itself is a significant benefit. There is moderate risk to realizing the
higher level development impacts that should result from having secure tenure, because it is
unclear whether beneficiaries can fully take full advantage of their tenure security if land markets,
regulations, and services in general are still not efficient, reliable, and trustworthy.

Risk to the local government capacity strengthening achieved under the project is moderate. The
two main factors are that MoRA is now better positioned to scale up these efforts and continue
strengthening local capacity, and that local governments and stakeholders have strong incentives
to better carry out their decentralized land management responsibilities and functions. However,
the track record for local capacity building in Indonesia's decentralization program is not strong,
and if MoRA does not have the resources to continue capacity building, local governments
ultimately might not be able to effectively carry out their decentralized responsibilities in land
management, administration, and planning.

The greatest challenge is posed by the lack of improvements in efficiency, transparency, and
service delivery for land titling and regulation overall in Indonesia. The unrealized outputs and
outcomes (in policy and regulatory reform, institutional capacity, model land offices,


                                                  18
computerized information systems, and governance) have less likelihood of being realized now
that the project is closed. A number of the intermediate outputs have been completed, and there
have been early steps toward enhancements in some areas (for example, development of service
standards), but not to the threshold required to ensure sustainability. The pace of titling is likely
to fall back to pre-project levels, prospects for resolving tenure security issues related to poorly
defined or conflicting laws and regulations are not promising, and the institutional capacity and
political commitment to carry forward needed refonns is uncertain ..

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Bank preparation identified and addressed very relevant problems in the land sector and
developed a detailed anti-corruption strategy. Background analysis was extensive and well-done,
consultation with relevant stakeholders was effectively used to improve the project design, and
the composition and resources of the preparation team were more than sufficient. Nevertheless,
the team could have better incorporated the experiences and lessons learned from the Bank's
previous land project in Indonesia (LAP), and there could have been more careful consideration
of the institutional differences and capacity of the three implementing agencies in the project
design and implementation arrangements. Although the project results framework included the
indicators needed to track the project outputs and outcomes, they were not always consistently
stated (variation between the KPIs and the RF) and included too many PD~ indicators that could
only be measured through an end-of-project impact assessment.

The Bank's independent Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA7) undertaken in late 2006
assessed the project as being well-designed, but the independent Bank Quality Assessment of
Lending Portfolio (QALP-l) in 2008 rated the quality of design as moderately satisfactory,
which is in line with the assessment in this ICR.

(b) Quality a/Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank supervision team utilized its solid experience with systematic land titling very
effectively. The Bank's expertise in this area helped activities keep pace with the project schedule
even though BPN was strained by having to address, in parallel, tsunami -affected areas through the
RALAS Project at the same time as it implemented LMPDP. When the work on systematic titling
was well underway, the Bank's task team leader (TTL) was able to establish a good dialogue on
local government and with MORA that led to satisfactory results in Component 5. The TL was
deployed full-time to Indonesia for more than a year beginning in early 2005, working closely with
BPN in support of both RALAS and LMPDP. Later the TTL managed the project from
Washington, with the support of a small team of experienced professionals in Indonesia monitoring
RALAS on a full-time basis and providing cross-support to LMPDP.


                                                 19
 On fiduciary aspects, local expertise based in the country office provided ongoing supervision as
 well as targeted support to the implementing agencies at critical junctures that generally helped
 prevent shortcomings in this area from jeopardizing implementation progress. However, at times,
 the Bank was slow in processing procurement requests from the borrower, which· contributed to
 project implementation delays. The Bank initiated independent fiduciary reviews were generally
 late in finalization and the subsequent communications of the respective review findings to the
 borrower were delayed for such long periods, that such reviews proved to be of limited value to
 improving borrower performance.

 The Bank supervision team used F AO support extensively for supervising the land policy and
 institutional development components and to a lesser degree the titling work. As part of the MTR,
 the Chief of FAO's Land Tenure Service undertook an independent review of all project
 components, arriving at findings that were similar to those of the Bank team.

 The project supervision team repeatedly encouraged BPN to take more substantive action to address
 governance concerns and implement anti-corruption measures. The Bank also instituted independent
 reviews of FM, procurement and, towards the end of the project the results of the anti-corruption
 framework. Although BPN eventually acknowledged that serious governance issues existed, and
 these were discussed in the government's completion report, no demonstrable actions were taken and
 there seemed to be a lack of commitment to addressing entrenched corruption in land administration.

 The Bank's independent QSA7 undertaken in late 2006 assessed Bank supervision as Moderately
 Satisfactory. In 2008, the Bank's QALP-l rated Bank-supervision as Satisfactory, and noted that
 the project was poorly implemented "despite good supervision effort" by the Bank.

 (c) Justification ofRatingfor Overall Bank Performance

 Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

 The rating is based on the combination of (a) a moderately unsatisfactory rating for Quality at Entry
 and (b) a moderately satisfactory rating for Quality of Supervision. Although the project's Outcome
 rating is moderately unsatisfactory, Overall Bank Performance is rated MS in this case rather than
 MU because the Bank's perfonnance, and in particular the MU performance in ensuring quality at
 entry, was not a significant factor in the project failing to achieve an MS rating for Outcomes.

 5.2 Borrower Performance

 (a) Government Performance

 Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

- The rating is based on the government's unwillingness or inability to responsively engage with the
  Bank supervision team despite repeated indications of BPN's weak performance in annual work
  program planning, project management and reporting: The government also did not ensure
  compliance with some key loan covenants that affected project outcomes, particularly the
  establishment and maintenance of a high-level Steering (or coordination) Committee and the


                                                 20
assignment of adequate project staffing. The lack of such a committee was problematic because it
was intended not only to provide general guidance, coordination, and leadership, but also to serve a
direct role as steering committee for land policy development, which ultimately produced many
studies and policy frameworks but little policy or regulatory reform. The government helped
ensure that the three implementing agencies complied with the project's budget requirements, but
seemed less interested in intervening or providing strong guidance for the project otherwise.
Project implementation was also affected every year by procedural delays in the release of budget
allocations, which the government could have more actively helped to resolve.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The rating is based mainly on BPN's performance, which was at best moderately unsatisfactory.
The uneven leadership and commitment of senior management at BPN was a key reason that the
agency made little progress other than in systematic land titling, and even in that area BPN
headquarters became a bottleneck because it did not decentralize decision-making. It was also
largely unresponsive to concerns about informal payments in land titling, and failed to assign
BPN staff on a full-time basis for project management in both the CPMU and the BPN-specific
PIU, which led to poor work planning and reporting. A mitigating factor that prevents BPN's
performance from being rated unsatisfactory is that its capacity was strained· by working
simultaneously on the e~ergency land project in Aceh.

The performance of MOHA and BAPPENAS is rated satisfactory, and their senior management had
the skills and commitment to deliver the tasks for which they were responsible. However, while·
BAPPENAS was responsible for implementing the Land Policy Development activities in
Component 1, elevating the studies into policy development and regulations required the engagement
of a high-level committee. It is noted that at least two critical issues from the NLPF and the policy
studies were successfully included in theNMTDP 2010-2014. Unfortunately, the Coordination
Committee, which had been effective during project preparation, ceased to exist, once the project
became effective, and actual policy formulation did not proceed. This was not anticipated in the
project design, although it was anticipated that BPN itself, in its role as the lead the implementing
agency, would provide strong project-level coordination, between the three implementing agencies.

Since the tasks and responsibilities of BAPPENAS and MoHA were relatively modest compared
to those of BPN, and since BPN was also the lead implementing agency, the performance of
BPN was the primary determinant of the overall implementing agency rating.

(c) Justification ofRatingfor Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Overall borrower's performance is deemed moderately unsatisfactory for the reasons stated
above. Essentially, the borrower did not take effective charge of its project and did not
effectively utilize the advice and support provided by the Bank.




                                                21
6. Lessons Learned

(a) General Lessons

The Contentious Nature of Land Sector Reforms. In any country, bringing about refonns to
the land sector is always contentious and highly political. As such, policy and institutional
refonns are extraordinarily challenging and invariably take a long time to achieve. Therefore,
whilst identification of the long-tenn refonn agenda is extremely valuable, great patience is
required, and a slower pace of implementation should be planned for with realistic targets.

La£k of High Level Oversight and Coordination. High level engagement and oversight is
required throughout the period of project implementation to ensure the policy and institutional
refonn agendas are progressed, and to also re-calibrate the project implementation schedule and
priorities as is deemed necessary due to delays and unexpected challenges encountered. It is also
important to have such high level coordination in place for a project which has more than one
implementing agency.

(b) Spe£ifi£ Lessons for Land Administration in Indonesia

Alignment of Project Implementatioil Plan with the Government's Budget Cy£le.LMPDP
became effective in August 2004, but unfortunately this date was not aligned with the government
budget or DIPA cycle, meaning that there was little progress for over one year. The DIPA cycle is
fairly rigid, and if an agency misses the preparation and submission schedule for the forthcoming
project year, procurement and disbursement cannot progress. Therefore, the Project
Implementation Plan must make allowance for the date of project effectiveness, and both the
borrower and external financier must be cognizant of the impacts of missing the DIPA schedule.

Project Complexity. LMPDP was a complex and ambitious project with three implementing
agencies and ambitious targets working in a sector with weak governance. The initial project
LAP experienced many similar challenges to those experienced by LMPDP, especially regarding
policy and institutional refonn, capacity, project management and governance. At times during
the implementation of LMPDP, especially in trying to address. the challenges, sensitive
relationship issues eclipsed the actual project issues. Therefore, especially in working in the
Indonesia land sector, a less ambitious project design with simple implementation arrangements
would lead to more effective implementation.

Project Baseline and PD~ Indi£ators. The Results Framework and the M&E system go hand-
in-hand and should be designed with implementation in mind. The experience under LMPDP is a
reminder that objectives should be kept as simple as possible and should avoid including
vaguely-specified impacts and outcomes whose achievement requires achieving progress outside
of the Project's control. Broadly-defined outcome indicators are difficult (if not impossible) to
measure and in the case of this Project show that the operational aspects of M&E had not been
sufficiently thought through at the design stage. For a Results Framework to be credible, it is
essential to have the core elements of an M&E system established before project implementation
commences, including having all baseline data prepared.




                                              22
The project baseline, SEBS~ largely did not produce baseline data that would enable
measurement of progress against the PD~ indicators. Thus it is very important that the baseline
fulfils the fundamental purpose of providing core data against which progress can be measured.

LMPDP incorporated ten. PDO indicators. All of these indicators were intenoed to measure factors
(or perceptions), that could actually be measured under the project's M&E system. Rather, they
were resultant impacts and hence intended to be assessed through the SEIS. LMPDP's SEIS was
weakly designed,. and largely did not assess the PD~ indicators. QALP-l advised: "Moreover, the
PAD included 10 indicators for the two-part DO: these were too many and too demanding".

The project SEBS should preferably be undertaken prior to completion of project appraisal, and
be used to influence the project design, including the PDQ indicators. It is best if the majority of
indicators can be measured through actual project implementation under the M&E system, and
progress monitored, rather than rely only on an end of project socio-economic assessment that
measures perceptions. Completion of the SEBS only around the time of the MTR, allowed
insufficient time to even consider in any potential project re-structuring.

Land policy reform. Little progress has been made in the overall land policy reform agenda
despite significant investment under LAP, LMPDP and the Land Policy Dialogue AAA program.
Additional interventions have been conducted through the Swedish funded IPSLA, ADB-funded
ELAF and the support of the Bank for the preparation of the draft land acquisition law over the
past two years (in conjunction with the Bank's IDPL series). The legal and regulatory environment
of Indonesia is very complex, and was aptly named by the BPN Head as ''the jungle of regulations".
As mentioned above, unless there is a high level engagement in land policy reform, then policy
studies do not lead to policy development and the subsequent reform of laws and regulations.

Need for full-time project staff. The borrower's ICR report makes a strong case for full-time
project staff to be assigned both at the central and provincial levels. Under LAP, BPN developed
significant project and technical capacity. However, under LMPDP, the majority of such
experienced staff were not assigned to the project, and certainly none worked full-time.
Throughout LMPDP's history, BPN underwent frequent institutional changes, with staff being
relocated and retired. The other implementing agencies, Bappenas and MOHA, fared better in
this area, as government staff assigned, albeit not on a full-time basis, stayed with the project for
most of the implementation, and made effective use of consultants/contractors.

Reluctance of the Borrower to use CreditILoan Funds for Technical Assistance. All of the
earlier land administration projects in East Asia, have had comprehensive T A programs funded
by a donor partner through a grant. The experience has been that where donor grant TA is not
available, there is a strong resistance to utilizing the Loan and Credit funds to procure TA.
LMPDP, which did not have a donor partner to provide grant TA, was designed with dependency
on TA to be procured from the Credit and Loan funds. For the most part, this did not occur, for
those aspects of the project under BPN, and this significantly impacted project management,
M&E, procurement, FM and technical aspects of the project. LMPDP drew some benefit through
cross-support from RALAS project monitoring staff funded by the Bank, and also the country
presence of the task manager during 2005-06. However, in such circumstances, a simpler, less
ambitious project design, with intensive Bank supervision would help overcome the lack of TA.



                                                23
The effectiveness of having a long list of legal covenants to mitigate project implementation
risks. LMPDP had a long list of legal covenants, primarily to mitigate the many project risks.
However, as identified by QALP-l, in working with the country sensitivi~ies, it was not possible
for the Bank to enforce many of the covenants. QALP-l noted that: "The long list of dated
covenants indicated, however, that the borrower had not taken many prior actions, and suggested
that commitment was not wholehearted."

That such a long list of covenants was designed, and on top of a long project preparation period
of around five years, would suggest that implementation issues could be expected. Hence, it is
important that where implementation commitment may be a concern, the best mitigation may be
to design a scaled-down project.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrowerllmplementing AgencieslPartnen

(a) Borrowerllmplementing Agencies

A summary of the implementing agencies' report is at Annex 7.·The report was submitted to the
Bank on February 25,2011. As this comprehensive report comprises abnost 300 pages, this ICR
has included only the sections: (a) Executive Summary; and (b) Chapter V Lessons Learned and
Recommendations. The full report, as submitted, has been placed· on the project files of the
World Bank. The Bank also very much appreciates the cooperation of the implementing agencies
in reviewing the Draft ICR Report and submitting detailed, thoughtful comments in a timely
manner. The· full list of the implementing· agencies' comments are also included at Annex 7.The
following are key comments from the World Bank on the implementing agencies' report:
   •   Project ranngs. The borrower specific comments on the ratings assigned in the ICR to
       project performance are acknowledged. Following a review, and especially in light of the
       Bank's own concerns on the preparation of the project, the Bank performance for quality
       at entry has been adjusted to moderately unsatisfactory. The borrower's comments
       especially concerning procuremeJ:it delays have also been noted, and accordingly the
       Bank performance for quality of supervision has been adjusted to moderately satisfactory.
   •   Number of titles distributed Regarding the number of titles registered and then
       distributed to land owners, the differences reported by the implementing agencies. in the
       finalized government report, submitted February 25, 2011, are acknowledged in project
       accotnplishments and also in the efficiency analysis. However, the Bank was not able to
       validate any increases in these results after project closure.
   •   Procurement. The Bank agrees that there were delays in the processing of reque.sts by the
       Bank team. The Bank office in Jakarta is working to remedy this. However, the Bank
       notes the complexities of procurement under the project which were exacerbated by there
       being three implementing agencies, and for BPN, provincial PIUs. Unfortunately, delays
       to procurement were experienced throughout LMPDP implementation due to the
       folfowing: (a) late submission of annual procurement plans; (b) incomplete and erroneous
       submissions; (c) failure to follow advice of the Bank procurement team. Many of these
       deficiencies could have been minimized through developing greater procurement
       capacity in BPN, through the early hiring of a procurement expert. Therefore, it is
       important for both the Bank and the borrower to remedy procurement weaknesses.


                                              24
•    Loan Cancellations. The Bank notes the concerns raised by the borrower regarding the
     Bank's slow processing of the government's two requests to cancel loan funds. The Bank
     records show that the borrower's two separate submissions, involved a series of submission
     withdrawal and re-submission by the borrower following identification of errors.
•    Loan/Credit Amounts. The small variations for the Loan/Credit Revised Amount and
     Disbursed Amount are considered to due to slight differences in the manner of
     calculating SDR equivalents.
•    KPls. It is agreed that the formulation ofKPIs could have been improved, and especially
     those indicators related to the PDOs, could have been more measurable and relevant. It is
     noted that as BPN did not deliver the SEBS until around the time of the MTR, and given
     overall difficulties of engagement, it was not possible to achieve any commitment to re-
     visit KPIs through a project restructuring.
 •   Assignment of Full-time Project Staff, It is agreed that the assignment of full-time staff is
     required for successful project management and implementation, and indeed the
     CreditILoan agreed required that there be qualified and experienced staff available at all
     times. The implementing agencies were regularly reminded of this require~ent, and also
     of the need to hire experienced consultants.
•    Re-assignment and Transferring of BPN Staff. It is agreed that this was a significant
     impediment to the CPMU and the PIUs under BPN. Experienced staff were frequently
     moved and replaced and project capacity weakened.
.•   Study Tours. It is agreed that the program of overseas study tours undertaken by
     representatives of the three implementing agencies and also the three universities were
     relevant to the project and provide areas of experience that would be beneficial for
     implementation to Indonesia.
•    Governance. It is agreed that corruption and collusion in land affairs are major issues and
     require the commitment of senior BPN management.
•    Land policy development. On land policy development, the project was designed to develop
     policy, using the studies undertaken. Whilst studies were successfully completed, these had
     not progressed to the level of actual development of government policy. Nonetheless, the
     studies provide useful inputs to any land policy formulation that may progress. Bappenas'
     success in having a number of key issues from the NLPF and policy studies included in the
     NMTDP 2010-14, is acknowledged. It is also noted thatBappenas and the Bank exchanged
     letters regarding the synchronization of policy studies under LMPDP Component 1 and
     BPN's own policy work. Bappenas' efforts to subsequently harmonize these activities from
     2009 are acknowledged. This has also been noted in Annex 2 of the ICR.
•    Complexity of land laws and regulations. It is agreed that there continues to be a complex
     plethora of land laws and regulations in Indonesia and government leadership to develop a
     single comprehensive land law would overcome the contradictions of the various agrarian
     and forestry laws and provide a coherent legal framework for all government institutions.
•    Public Awareness for titling and complaints. It is agreed that community awareness and
     understanding are critical for successful implementation of a land registration program.
     BPN should undertake more frequent and intense programs of public awareness-raising


                                             25
         on land registration and the associated benefits of the fonnal system for transfers and
         collaterization. There is also a need for more intensive public awareness of recourse for
         complaints, grievances and land disputes.
     •   Priorities for titling. It is agreed that given that a majority of Indonesian still remains to
         be titled, prioritization of registration programs should be given to the areas most in need,
         especially in areas of changing land use and also areas of high land conflict in order to
         bring about the resolution of disputes.
     •   Re-eng;neering of land offices and LIS development. The comments on the work funded
         by Spain under LOC are noted. The PAD also noted the initial work on LOC, and the
         project's Components 2 and 4 was designed to build upon this early work. Unfortunately,
         no further work was undertaken during the implementation under LMPDP.
     •   Layanan Rakyat Untuk Sertifikasi Tanah (LARASITA - The Peoples' Services Program
         for Land Certification). The initial developments of LARASITA are acknowledged, but
         the Bank supervision team observed that actual implementation was confined to a small
         number of pilot sites and was not mainstreamed. Conceptually LARASITA is very
         innovative and has significant potential to serve the needs of remote land owners.
         However, it requires a very significant investment commitment. More importantly, unless
         BPN is able to address the serious weaknesses in data security, records management,
         governance and general service delivery, then LARASITA would be unable to deliver
         any fonD. of sustainable benefit to land administration reform.
     •   Sistem Layanan InformaSi Mandiri (SLIM-- Land Information Services System). The .
         Component 5 pilot programs were generally very successful, and the proposal from
         MoHA that SLIM should be rolled out on a national basis, is endorsed.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: This component supported:
   •   Subcomponent. 1. 1 Development of Government Capacity to Formulate Land Policy;
   •   Subcomponent 1.2 Development of a National Land Policy; and
   •   Su~mponent      1.3 Formulation of Specific Land Policy/Regulatory Instruments.

Expected outcomes: NLPF developed; improvement in government capacity to .formulate
policy; and priority land policies and regulatory instruments formul~ted and adopted.

Achievement: Moderately Satisfactory

The achievement of the specific. outputs identified at appraisal under this component can be
summarized as follows:                     .
       •   The component did create a small land policy technical secretariat within
           BAPPENAS, which provided oversight to the preparation of several land-related
           policy studies. These studies were supervised by a management consultant firm,. with
           the studies themselves prepared by specific consultant teams. Overall there was
           limited public consultation undertaken. The Government was unable to create the
           LMPDP Coordinating Committee that was to provide strategic oversight and
           guidance to the policy development process and endorse policy study
           recommendations. Consequently, the inclusion of all sector ministries and agencies in
           the land policy development and implementation process was far from ideal, and
           there was no Government leadership to make recommendations on which agency was
           best suited to take the lead in developing each of the policy areas.
       •   While a National Land Policy Framework (NLPF) was developed, and it workshop
           was convened to prepare the draft NMTDP, it is too early to judge whether the NLPF
           will provide valuable input to the proposed revisions in the BAL and other important
           laws and regulations in the country. related to land and land resources such forest and
           mining. The consultation process in the revision of the BAL was not undertaken.
           Furthermore, whilst Bappenas undertook related policy studies under this component,
           BPN itself also undertook work outside of the project, with a lack of harmonization
           between the efforts of the two institutions up until 2009.
       •   Policy studies on Instruments of Land Tax and Fee Structure, Support for Local
           Government in Spatial Planning and Land Use control, Adat Land Tenure, Land
           Market, and Distribution of State Land were completed and final reports were
           submitted to the Bank. Consultative workshops on the final draft reports for two
           studies on Sustainability of Land Titling and Registration Programs and Impact
           Assessment of the disharmony among the Laws and Regulations related to Land were
           conducted, although broader public consultation was not achieved.
       •   There were no land policies or regulatory instruments formulated and adopted.
       •   Overall, capacity in Bappenas was enhanced under the project.


                                              28
Component 2: This component supported:
       •   Subcomponent 2.1 Development and Implementation ofBPN Long-tenn Strategic
           Plan;
       •   Subcomponent 2.2 Re-EngineeringofLand Offices;
       •   Subcomponent 2.3 Support to the Legal Department ofBPN
       •   Subcomponent 2.4 Education and Training; and
       •   Subcomponent 2.5 Overall Project Management

Expected outcomes: Land administration strengthened; operational capacity and service levels
improved.

Achievement: Moderately Unsatisfactory


The achievement of the specific outputs identified at appraisal under this component can be
summarized as follows:
       •   BPN prepared an initial Strategic Plan for the period 2007-2009, which overall
           covered the key elements of the land administration reform agenda for Indonesia
           including online service delivery, good governance, data security, acCeleration of land
           tenure security and so forth. Unfortunately, BPN did not proceed to implement in any
           major way, the identified actions under the Strategic Plan. BPN also announced its
           intentions to revise the Strategic Plan to cover the period 2010-14.
       •   BPN dropped the reengineering effort at 5 land offices although it started to display
           publicly at provincial/district land offices standard service lists that included both the
           time-frame and the schedule of fees for the services. It also decided that it would
           monitor on its own. the implementation of th~ standards, instead of using an
           independent entity. However, because the pace of the development of ~tandards
           development was slow, BPN at Completion of the project is in no position to
           introduce/monitor these standards. No progress was made on the computerization of
           land records and enhancing security of land records, although it was raised as a major
           issue in the BPN Strategic Plan and continues to be a major risk.
       •   Although -serious governance issues were raised concerning the delivery of land
           administration services by BPN land offices, whilst BPN acknowledged the concerns
           both during the project life and also in its report to the ICR, no specific action was
           taken.
       •   Land administration education programs at the three universities i.e., Universitas
           Gajah Mada (UGM, Yogyakarta), Institut Tecknologi Bandung (ITB). and Institut
           Pertanian Bogor (IPB) were developed and had· reached the second intakes before
           Loan closure. Although the quality of the programs developed were sound, there was
           no commitment to sustain the programs beyond the life of the project.




                                                29
       •   On the sub-component that was to provide support to BPN's Legal Department, there
           was no implementation. Overall project management and commitment was weak
           throughout the life of project implementation. BPN was challenged throughout the
           project period within the critical activities of annual planning, budget preparation,
           procurement, financial management, M&E and reporting. A major weakness in
           implementation was that the government did not appoint any full-time personnel to
           manage and implement the project.
       •   Overall, there was a lack of project coordination, especially between the three
           separate implementing agencies. To a large degree, this meant that the project
           appeared to be three independent projects under implementation. The LMPDP
           Steering Committee, which had functioned during project preparation and had been
           chaired by EKON, did not convene throughout the entire project implementation
           period.
       •   A socio-economic and environmental impact assessment study was completed at the
           end of the project period.


Component 3: This component supported:
       •   Subcomponent 3.1: Community Awareness and Participation;
       •   Subcomponent 3.2: Systematic Land Titling;
       •   Subcomponent 3.3: Streamlining Land Office Registration Processes;
       •   Subcomponent 3.4: Development of the Private Surveying Sector.

Expected outcomes: Land titles are issued efficiently and effectively; development of the
private surveying sector.

Achievement: Moderately Satisfactory

The achievement of the specific outputs identified at appraisal under this component can be
summarized as follows:
   •   Approximately 2 million land parcels were registered following surveying and
       adjudication with signed land title certificates prepared - representing an achievement of
       80 percent of the project target of 2.5 million. From these, approximately 1.7 million
       certificates were distributed to owners, equivalent to 85 percent of all titles prepared
       (against the project target of95 percent).
   •   More than'450,000 titles were issued to women owners and a further 89,000 issued in
       joint names (husband and wife) spouses)
   •   Supported information dissemination to communities before surveying and adjudication
       started in the community. Organized community information campaigns, through focus
       groups discussions and workshops to explain the project objectives, rationale and benefits,
       as well as explain the forms, the costs, the procedures and legal rights of the communities,
       covering men and women separately.


                                               30
   •   In addition to community infonnation dissemination, supported infonnation dissemina-
       tion through mass media (television, radio and newspapers) and posters about systematic,
       sporadic land titling program, and land transaction registration.
   •   The component helped collect community land profiles to define village boundaries,
       describe land distribution and identify any pre-existing land disputes. This infonnation
       was used in the planning of the titling program and later for monitoring the
       socioeconomic impacts of the project. Community members were recruited to join the
       systematic adjudication teams (SATs) and were provided on the job training. Provided on
       the job training to local civil society or community members to undertake the village
       level information dissemination and community awareness and participation campaigns.
   •   BPN was unable to reduce costs even though technological changes pennitted it to
       deliver titles more efficiently. The cadastral survey component of the systematic program
       was fully contracted to the private sector. However, this did not demonstrate any
       efficiency gains as throughout productive remained at levels detennined under LAP in
       1997, as budget assignment, including payment of allowances, was set on those dated
       productivity levels .In addition to the work related to systematic titling, the component
       was unable to streamline sporadic titling activities (titling on demand).
   •   The component was unable to support an industry study to fmd out, among other things,
       what will stimulate the private cadastral surveying sector. No systematic review of
       legislation for licensing of surveyors and assistance was undertaken that could lead to the
       development of regulations governing industry practice. Lastly, the component did not
       finance technical assistance and training to private sector surveyors, and support the
       establishment of a viable industry association, which could be encouraged to exercise
       control over industry standards and regulatory controls.


Component 4: This component supported:
   •   Subcomponent 4.1: Development of a Land Infonnation Strategy
   •   Subcomponent 4.2: Establishment of LIS Infrastructure
   •   Subcomponent 4.3: Deveiop LIS Pilot Study.

Expected outcomes: Development of a national LIS for decentralized and improved land
administration and management is created and operational.

Achievement: Unsatisfactory

The achievement of the outputs identified at appraisal under this component can be summarized
as follows:
   •   Outline LIS Plan prepared under BPN Strategic Plan 2007-2009. LIS strategy indicating
       the key features that need to be incorporated in the development of a national LIS was
       outlined in the BPN Strategic Plan. However, the Land Infonnation System Steering
       Committee w:as not established, and no LIS Support Group dedicated to providing


                                              31
       technical advisory support to the Government is currently in place. No key technical
       standards and the key LIS policies, as identified in the LIS strategy (from the first
       subcomponent) were developed.
   •   Limited progress made due to lack of BPN high level engagement, and institutional
       support.
           ,
   •   An international LIS expert undertook a review of BPN's requirements and for the
       preparation of the LIS Strategic Plan, in late 2009, which was delivered as the project
       implementation closed.
   •   The envisaged pilot study spanning one district and incorporating data and information
       relating to land management contributed by a range of agencies was not undertaken.
       Consequently, BPN is not in a position to finalize the design and implementation plan of
       the national land information system as is required by the Presidential Decree 34/2003
       Article 1.                                                               .

Component 5: This component supported:
   •   Subcomponent 5.1: Assessment of Local Government's Capacity to Undertake Land
       Administration and Management Functions;
   •   Subcomponent 5.2: Training and Capacity Building;
   •   Subcomponent 5.3: Preparation of Strategic Plan for Broader Strengthening of Local
       Government Land Management;
   •   Subcomponent 5.4: Support to Project Management Unit.

Expected outcomes: LGU land management functions reviewed and capacity assessed; LGUs
strengthened to efficiently undertake land management functions.

Achievement: Highly Satisfactory


The achievement of the outputs identified at appraisal under this component can be summarized
as follows:
       •       Assessed local government's capacity through several case studies. The case studies
               evaluated the current norms, standard operating procedures and practices; existing
               human and other resources for implementation, and corruption issues and ways to
               address them. Based on them, the project developed a self-assessment instrument to
               be used nationally. The fmal report prioritized training and other needs, responding to
               demand from local government units.
       •       Provided training for staff of local government entities on a variety of topics,
               including participatory land use. planning, community mapping, participatory
               decision-making for issuance of location permit, land dispute resolution, and
               identification of land to be acquired for public purposes. The training program was
               expanded to other parts of the country through regional training workshops and other

                  designed to support MoHA in c8rrying out its role in support of local government
                  land management, because MoHA had limited experience in undertaking large
                  international projects. The component built MoHA's capacity to serve the
                  deconcentrated management system and helped MoHA ready itself to manage much
                  larger initiatives in support of local government entities.

               The project did not set a specific target and the SEBS did not establish a baseline. The SEIS
               reported that more than 99% of respondents viewed land certificates as a valuable document, and
               94% specifically believed that it increased land values. Given the short time frame and the man~
               factors other than titling that could affect actual prices, these perceptions of stakeholders may I
               actually be more meaningful than simple data on prices alone. In LAP, 133% of urban and 33% of I
               semi-urban beneficiaries said that land titles had increased their land value (SMERU 2003).

                 This indicator lacked a specific target or baseline, and data was not available on complaints
                 handled under the project. The very high rates of satisfaction reported in Indicator 6 suggest that
                    number of complaints was low. Even if data were available, its usefulness would be
                 questionable since improved complaints handling and mechanisms could increase the number of
                 recorded complaints even though there were fewer complaints or disputes.

                 There were no specific targets or baseline for this indicator, and it was not assessed by the SEIS.
                 By their nature, informal payments are difficult to monitor or document, and are not likely to be

                        BPN has decided to revise and update the Strategic Plan in 2009 (for 2010-2014). Though
                        proposed to be part ofLMPDP 2009 procurement plan, BPN has decided to use government
                        resources for this task and hence drop~d out of the LMPDP pian. The revised Strategic 'Plan is
                        expected to be available by the first quarter of2010.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

As was expected at Appraisal, most project benefits at Completion have been derived from the
implementation of the systematic land titling, under Component 3. This is mainly because the
outcome of improved land security came only in areas where systematic land titling could be
undertaken. In other areas, the outcome of improved land tenure security and the corresponding
ben~fits could have come only if the policy environment was improved or only if BPN service of
sporadic land titling, and broader land administration services was improved, and such
improvements could be monitored. When they did not materialize, the benefits from improved
land security in those areas also did not materialize. The benefit from the other important
outcome that of improved capacity of local goveriunent, was never measured under the project.

The "project cost of US$51.6 million puts the cost of delivering roughly 1.7 million titles at
US$30 per title. This compares favorably with the US$65 per title as indicated in a recent ICRof
a land project in a nearby country (viz. Lao PDR, Second Land Titling Project). This positive
efficiency result ofLMPDP can be attributed to the projectspending 83 percent of the total cost
on systematic land titling which led to worthwhile improvement in "land security for 99 percent
of the respondents where systematic land titling program was undertaken. The per title cost drops
to about US$25, if only direct costs for land titling are considered, and could be as low as US$17
per title if one assumes the number of titles (2.1 million) and direct titling costs (US$35.6
million) indicated in the Government's report.

The Cost Benefit Analysis Summary carried at Appraisal (Annex 4 of the PAD) calculated the
ERR from holding a title based on a household survey implemented under the previous project.
This survey had indicated that land titles improved: (a) tenure security, (b) access to credit; (c)
investment incentives of land owners; and (d) land prices. The SEIS carried out under LMPDP
confirmed (a) and (d) for 94-99 percent of the respondents, but on (b) found that less than half
the land owners had ever used land certificates to obtain credit, and on (c) found that titles did
not result in increased investments in agricultural inputs and on land directly. At Approval, with
various benefits that had been quantified (such as the increase in use of title to obtain credit
going up by 12.8 percent in project area etc.), the PAD had estimated a project ERR of 33
percent, and FRR of 16 percent. SEIS did not estimate the benefits quantitatively. Consequently,
without reliable quantified data on benefits, such calculations were not attempted for the ICR.

SEIS also did not summarize (over the whole land titling program) titled land area on the basis of
land use, such as, housing, farming, fisheries, industries etc. This may be because different land
use in different communities (semi-urban, rural, or island) differed considerably in plot sizes and
per square meter prices. For example, land for housing (including the attached yard) is about 100
sq. m. on average in a farming community but their farm land sizes are much larger. Prices per
sq. meters similarly had wide ranges.

The ICR estimates titled land value to be US$360 per parcel or the value of all land titled under
the project (1.7 million titles) over US$600 million. This implies that to cover the cost of the
project the increase in valu~ of the land required is less than 9 percent. This is quite conceivable
particularly in the semi-urban communities where the probability of conflicts and the value of
land titles rise more than they do in rural communities. The above calculations also demonstrate
why sporadic titling with its US$150 per parcel price tag makes sense only in some communities.

Executive Summary of the Socio-Economic Impact Assessment4

I. Introduction.

1. This assessment study is to evaluate the socio-economic impact of land registration in six
areas, in which' its base line conditions had been surveyed in 2007. The area studied is divided
into two main categories of rural and sub-urban in Java and outside Java. Lampung, in South of
Sumatra, and Sambas in Kalimatan Barat and Barito Kuala in Kalimantan Selatan, represented
rural areas; whereas Cilegon in Banten, Depok, in West Java, and some villages in Gunung Kidul,
Central !ava, represents the sub-urban areas.

2. Lack of law and legal condition: Data from the baseline study reveals the actual socio-economic
condition and situation of the studied areas. The data,however, did not cover yet the law and legal
situation implemented by the government institutions that had caused the present legal and socio-
economic condition. In fact, the present socio-economic condition is the effect, caused by mode of
the government, policy, in implementing land and agrarian law and legal system.

3. Socio-economic theory, historical background of land and agrarian law: To better understand and
evaluate the soci<reconomic impact of land registration, it is necessary to use some eclectiq and
combine theory of soci<reconomic changes, law and legal system implemented by the government
institutions, and the background history of the mode of how land and agrarian policy implemented
by the previous Dutch government. Mode' of the previous Dutch land and agrarian policy imple-
mented since 1870, did has a direct imp8ct for the poor socio-economic condition of the people and
lack of landownership document, as well as lack of access to participate in Banking system for
obtaining capital for business enterprise, as described in the socioeconomic baseline study.

4. Present situation of Indonesia land and agrarian law condition: Briefly and succinct, the land
and agrarian law condition in Indonesia is still implemented the 'dual system' of land and
agrarian law that give birth to the 'dual economic' system introduced in the Dutch era. Until now,
Indonesia has no Land Law of its own but Basic Agrarian Law (BAL).

The BAL of the year 1960, had revoked some articles of land and agrarian norms in the Dutch
Civil Code, but since it was developed independently without clear and good ground of
Indonesian Land Law philosophy, doctrine, principles, and theory, the BAL is implemented
under the shadow background of the Dutch Civil Code. Thus, data found and described in the
base line study in 2007, confirm the still prevailing impact of the Dutch isolation policy of land
right for the Natives, and the dual agrarian policy to prioritize land use for big business
enterprise in collaboration with the state government's officials.

II. The objective and task of the study.

5. The objective of the study is to collect and analyze field evidence of the impact of land
registration program by measuring change in certain indicators and to consider policy
conclusions and implications for future policy development.

6. The assessment focus is on eleven issues, namely:
        (a)    Community perceptions on the titling process,
        (b)    Inclusion of communities in the land titling process,
       (c)     An overview of active participants in the land titling process at village level,
        (d)    Inclusion of gender concerns in the titling process and promoting rights of women,
       (e)      Dissemination of information though public .campaigns (carried out by BPN
              . through distribution of posters, leaflets, mass media such as radio and television)
                and public notification,
       (f)     Usage of titles received and post-titling impact on land valued in the area,
       (g)     Understanding of the contents of land titles and their usage,
       (h)     Views on quality of titles issued,
       (i)     Views on technical perfonnance of field teams,
       G)      Knowledge and use of the complaints handling mechanism,
       (k) Change in land use pattern.

7. Main tasks (Implementation objectives):
       (a)     Examine social and institutional capacity at local level for governing land rights,
       (b)    Forecast possible negative impacts of the program and suggest mechanism to
              minimize them,                                      .
       (c)    Fonnulate relevant policy recommendations,
       (d)    Identify areas urgently needing land titling,
       (e)    Support on-going refonn and capacity building in sector institutions.

8. The study has collected data from the field and tabulated for analysis and interpretation

ill. Findings and interpretation.

9. It was found for the 'Community Perception on the titling process', that their participation is
very high that 92.59% evaluate the fairness and 93.29% perceive the process is transparent and
satisfaction of the result is 90.28%.

10. Such high community participation is also to confinn the issue of 'Inclusion of communities
in the land titling processes', in which 92.94% of village officials and community leaders
participate to rally the campaign. It is also, confInned the need for pre-adjudication campaign


                                                    46
and socialization that in the base line study, it found that 66.6% of the households have no
understanding on the Systematic Land Registration. After the pre-adjudication, however, the
understanding for the presence of Systematic Land Registration raises high to motivate the
participants to participate in the program.

11. 'Inclusion of gender concerns in the titling process and promoting rights of women', is also
very high that it comes to 81.13% involves in the decision making to take part in the land
adjudication and 76.62% involves in the adjudication process.

12. Women awareness of their 'de jure' right as landowner is also very high that 96.64% agree for
woman's name should be recorded in the land certificate. Most of the women's name recorded in
the land certificate is for their inherited land and brought in marriage property, and a
consciousness of using husband and wife names, is beginning· to accept. Data from the rural
areas, shows that 19.12% in Lampung Selatan and 33.61 % in Sambas, woman's name is
recorded in the land certificate issued by the Systematic Land Adjudication. In the suburban
areas, the data shows that 27.61% in Cilegon and 30.00% in Depok, as well as 46.52% in
Gunung Kidul, choose for woman's name be recorded in the land certificate. The fact is a blatant
evidence to denionstrate the renascent and awakening of women's consciousness over their land
right and equal status on inherited and common marriage property. Women's right and status is
equal in Adat Law but was neglected and not legally acknowledged by the previous state's law
system.

13. 'Usage of titles received and post-titling impact on land valued is the area', shows that
99.442% perceive land certificate is a valuable document and it has a direct impact for increasing
land price, which is believed by 94.10010 of the participants.

14. There are 45.37% of the participants they never used their land certificate for collateral in
Bank to obtain capital for business. This is of course the remnant impact of the 'isolation' of land
and agrarian policy and land registration introduced by the Dutch that create 'dual economic'
system, where the Natives who are now the citizen of Indonesia, are not familiar to using land
certificate for collateral in the Bank. Thus, the 45.37% who have no idea of using the certificate
as collateral in the Bank, is because it is a new seminal idea for them.

15. There are 52.43% of the participants express their intention to keep the land as their valuable
property and only 47.57% said their willingness to change their land utilization after certification.
From the in-depth interview and FGD, it is clarified by the participants that the change of the
land after certification is for obtaining capital for developing business. Two examples on the
using of the land after certification is found in Sambas where to single parent lady use the
certificate as collateral to obtain capital for developing their paddling gasoline business and
exporting garments to Malaysia. The Public Notary in Sambas confirmed that he had drawn
more the 200 deed for land certificate used as collateral in the Bank.

IV. Institutional capacities and policies reform.

16. BPN as the only authoritative institution to issue land certificate, has the capacity but in some
areas, particularly in the rural areas, the capacity cannot be fulfilled for reason of human



                                                47
resources and equipment. In a rural area like Sambas, Barito Kuala, and Lampung Selatan, BPN
could not fulfill the increasing interest of the community to register their land.

17. Local BPN should be given authority to supervise and control result of the license surveyor,
to meet the quality of maps and land survey product.

18. Local NGO that focus in land issue, exist in four out of six studied areas and they have been
asked by BPN to help disseminating information for Systematic Land Registration and to control
its implementation.

19. Interest of the people in the rural area in Lampung Selatan who had occupied and develop
dwelling place on the forestry claimed land, always turned down by Forestry Department. .

20. Areas urgently needing land titling are: (a) The left over parcels in the previous adjudication
area that has not' yet done; (b) Area adat land law still strongly adheres by the people, but had a
pre-adjudication study to determine the best mode of registeringadat land; and (c) Areas along
provincial border lines.                                                       .

v. Conelusions.
21. Community perceived that land titling process was good and satisfactorily.

22. Systematic Land Titling had helped provided legal document of landownership to the title
holders that they could safely used it to for obtaining capital from the Bank.

23. Generally, community understands the content and relevance.ofthe land program but not yet
understand the way to use it as collateral for economic business.

VI. Recommendations.

24. BPN shall arrange the post-titling program designed to advocate and empower community on
how to prudentially use the land certificate to raise their income yet minimizing potential risk of
losing their asset land.

25. BPN should issue a decree for joint titling in which husband and wife's name are recorded in
the certificate, as well as for siblings over their undivided inherited
property.

26. Revenue for Obtaining Land and Building Right Bea Perolehan Hak atas Tanah dan .
Bangunan) should not be used as a condition in the first time registration.

(a) Borrower's ICR

  The following is a summary of the Government's final report submitted to the World Bank on
  February 25, 2011. As this very comprehensive report is almost 300 pages (including annexes
  and attachments), in accordance with World Bank guidelines for its ICRs, it has been necessary
  to produce a short summary. Accordingly, only the unedited Executive Summary and shortened
  version of the "Lessons Learned and Recommendations" from Chapter V of the report have been
. included. Although this is still lengthier than normal for an ICR, it is considered justified in this
  case to ensure that the Bank's summary fully and fairly represents the borrower's views. The full
  Government report, as submitted, has been placed on the project files of the World Bank.



Land Management and Policy Development Project (LMPDP) was program of the Government of
Indonesia (Gol) funded by Credit Agreement IDA 3884-IND and Loan Agreement mRD 4731-IND
(later was changed to become mRD 7754-IND) between GoI and the World Bank (WB). The loan
and credit agreements were signed on June 2, 2004. This project was declared effective on June 2,
2004 and implemented till December 31, 2009. The Project Appraisal Document for this project was
adopted on March 31, 2004. While the effective date of the project was on January 1, 2005, the
closing date was on December 31,2009 and the closing account was on April 30, 2010.

LMPDP had objectives to improve land tenure security ~d to enhance the efficiency, transparency,
and improve service delivery of land titling and registration; and to enhance local government
capacity to undertake land management function with great efficiency and transparency. Both
objectives were tried to be achieved through activities in 5 components. The five components were:
Development of Land Policy and Regulatory Framework (ComPQnent A) which was implemented
by Bappenas;Institutional Development, Capacity Building, and Titling (Component B) which was
implemented by BPN; Implementation of an Accelerated Land Titling Program (Component C)
which was implemented by BPN; Development of Land Information System (Component C) which
was implemented by BPN; and Capacity Building Support for Local Government (Component E)
which was implemented by MoHA. All components were coordinated by BPN as the executing
agency. Total creditlloan expenditure was USD 41,863,051.75 or equivalent with Rp
400.053.426.008,00 and total Gol fund expensed was Rp 93.629.939.004,00.

Development ofLand Policy and Regulatory Framework

Indonesia is gifted with vast lands rich in natural resources. Without an appropriate policy for its
management, it will be difficult to utilize this potential for the benefit of the people as mandated
by the Indonesian Constitution.

To better realize the potential of land to contribute in poverty reduction and economic growth, it
is not only necessary to have a clear long-term vision but also to take concrete steps to
implement it. It is accordingly high time for Indonesia to design and decide on an appropriate
national land policy that can deal with all those aspects.


                                                 50
In responding to the challenge of the need to refonn the National Land Policy, the Government of
Indonesia (001) had designed the Component A of Land Management and Policy Development
Project (LMPDP). In the implementation, LMPDP supported "11 Land Priority Agenda" which
was issued in middle 2006 (see Annex-I). The 11 Land Priority Agenda was issued to realize "land
for prosperity" and to improve land service.

 The component A of LMPDP has resulted support for the creation of small land policy secretariat
 which has produced National Land Policy Framework (NLPF) and seven studies on specific land
 policy/regulatory instruments as ~ between The Government of Indonesia and The World Bank.

 Institutional Development, Capacity Building, and Training

  Because of the large number of communities spread over many islands, the organizational task of
  land titling 'and management is similarly challenging. The Republic of Indonesia is divided.into 33
  provinces (Wilayah) which are subdivided into 348 Districts (Kabupaten), and 86 Cities (Kota).
  This is the impact of Law on Regional Autonomy Number 22/1999. Until 1999, non-forest land
  matters were administered by the National Land Agency (BPN), a central agency reporting directly
, to the President, through a network of Regional Offices in every Province, and Land Offices in 419
  KabupateniKota. The remaining is handled by representative offices which will become local land
  office when the respective local govepnnent running well., It is obvious that BPN have to prepare
  infrastructures and many competent officers to run all those local land offices.

, Component B of LMPDP was created' to answer the situation of weak institutional capacity of
  the BPN Land Offices. The actions of component B were the development ,and nnplementation
  of long tenn strategic planning for BPN, re-engineering land offices to deliver transparent and
  efficient land administration process, developing policy and preparing law, and strengthening
  education and training in land administration expertise.

During the implementation of component B, many improvements have been achieved. BPN has
fonnulated its strategic plan and its revision. For minimum service standard, BPN has issued
standard operating procedure for Land Service (SPOPP). Capacity of BPN oflicers were also
increased through master program for 75 officers on land administration, capacity building of
three universities who implemented the master program, and training on adjudication,
procurement, and treasury. The effect can be seen as local land offices have been able to manage
project by itself, including human resources, activities, procurement, and financial aspects.

Implementation ofan Accelerated Land Titling Program

As mentioned before, at the beginning of the project, only about 27 million of the nation's
estimated 80 million land parcels (30 percent)' had been registered in the 40 years of land
registration implementation. If this pace of registration continued, land registration would never
catch up with the total number of parcels since this total was estimated to be growing by more than
1 million parcels per year. The appraisal team stated that even Where titling had been substantially
completed, the numbers of registrations of transactions subsequent to the titling were low and
threaten the integrity of the land records as did poor records management. Titled land was
estimated at three to five percent of total land area and was the only land which can be subject of a
private property market system.


                                                51
 Another lesson learned from the LAP Project is that grievance resolution mechanisms· must be
 established to settle land disputes according to the rule of law. The large backlog of unsettled
.land disputes, the· settlement of so many in favor of elites, and the obscurity of the process, bring
 into question the value of the rights being registered. The design of the proposed project also
 reflects these lessons by emphasizing the establishment of grievance resolution facilities and
 expanding the role of the Ombudsman in reviewing grievances independently.

At the beginning of the project, only about 27 million of the nation's estimated 80 million land
parcels (30 percent) had been registered in the 40 years of land registration implementation. If
this pace of registration continued, land registration would never catch up with the total number
of parcels since this total was estimated to be growing by more than 1 million parcels per year.
To deal with this issue, component C of LMPDP was designed. This component supported an
ac.celerated national land titling program through: (i) community awareness and participation; (ii)
systematic land titling; (iii) streamlining of Land Office registration processes (such as the
process of sporadic registration); and (iv) increase in capacity of the private surveying sector.
the component implemented program of systematic registration that initially focuses on five
provinces in Java with modest expansion to 4-5 selected urban centers outside Java.

During LMPDP land adjudication process, LMPDP issued 2,308,805 land titles. This
acceleration is hoped to be continued in the future. Study of Sustainability of Land Registration
in component A showed the significance of this issue, and this has become concern of Bappenas
and BPN itself. The unregistered land parcels and unmapped forest land become challenging
aspect for BPN in the future. Qualitative improvement was also achieved by BPN through
LMPDP. The study Socio-Economic Impact Assessment carned out in 2009 stated that
community perceived that land titling process under LMPDP was good and satisfactorily.
Therefore it can be concluded that BPN's capacity in land titling is improved.

BPN had also planned for studying in streamlining land office registration processes. This study
could not be implemented. However, BPN has issued BPN Head Regulation Num 1 Year 2005
dealing with Standard Operating Procedure for Land Service (SPOPP), which some of its parts
were adjusted to deal with simplification and acceleration of service by· BPN Head Regulation
Num 6 Year 2008..BPN released new regulation to replace above old regulations, i.e. The Head
Regulation Number 1 Year 2010 which considers some articles in Law Number 25 Year 2009
dealing with public service and increasing in public needs. Moreover, service counter (front office)
is also regulated. It is regulated in Head of BPN Regulation Number 3 year 2010. Dealing with
development of private surveying sector, BPN has considered this issue since LAP I Program. It
can be proven by issuance of The Head of BPN Regulation Number 2 year 1998 regarding
Licensed Surveyor. Private surveyors were involved in cadastral survey since then. Besides, in
LMPDP implementation, cadastral survey packages were procured. Therefore, cadastral survey.
industry is growing.

Development ofLand Information System
To. m~t the Land Policy challenges in Indonesia in the field of agrarian refonn, development
planning, development, of land and real estate market, and infrastructure and environmental
issues, the availability of adequate land infonnation is of utmost importance.



                                                 52
Indonesia is aware that this availability can only be realized by extensive use of information and
communication technology and many initiatives have started to automate the production, storage
and use of land information. Progress, however, has not been optimal. Problems have arisen in
the field of regulatory frame~ork, available budgets, conflicting mandates and lack of trained
staff to run the new systems.

Indonesia has to make this change in a much shorter period of time. At one side advanced IT
systems are available from the first moment of automation, on the other side the Land Policy
challenges are serious, political pressure to solve them is high, so action is necesSary. It was
therefore decided to make the establishment of a National Land Information System (NLIS) part
of the LMPDP-project in component D.

It is realized that the component D did not achieve significant result. It was because the program
contained in this component had similarities with another project funded by the GoI (routine
program) and the Government of Spain (LOC program). Through routine program, BPN has made
IT development strategic plan which is focused on land service application, including issuance of
the minimum service standard (SPOPP). Through LOC program, computer in loca1land offices .
has been upgraded including the land service performance and the capacity of the staffs. The LOC
project developed some applications for land services including developed the backup system. This
project also became basis for the commencement ofLARASITA program. The quality of service is
improved ·continuously. In 2009, as mentioned before, BPN as government institution achieved
award from the Ministry ·of Officer Empowerment and Bureaucracy Reform. Backup system
through digitization of land documents are still being carried out recently. 14 million land parcels
records have been digitized of 40 million registered land parcels.

However, there was fundamental result gained i.e. National Land Information System (LIS)
strategic plan through. the. study' of LIS strategic plan. The study indicated the same hypothesis
mentioned above that BPN needs to develop adequate land information system.

Capacity Building Support for Local Government

The strategy of the Government on land affairs is to decentralize public administration, including
land administration and management, to make it responsive and accountable to local
communities. On land matters, the responsibilities between BPN and Districts have been defined
by Keppres 34/2003. The responsibility for the nine functions indicated earlier is with the
District Administration (Kabupatens) while BPN is entrusted with other activities, such as
provision of new titles, activities related to land transfer, developing land policies, and
establishing and monitoring standards, and training.

According to law 22/1999 and Keppres 34/2003, local government has the authority over nine
land service functions: These are: (a) issuance oflocation permit; (b) provision ofland for public
interest; (c) cultivated land dispute settlement; (d)-resolution of compensation for land allocated
for development; (e) to determine the list of occupants land distribution and compensating for
excess land; (t) determination and resolution ofulayat land problems; (g) resolution of neglected
land problems; (h) land opening permit provision; and (i) land use planning within the local
government jurisdiction. Most are unsure how to proceed ahead.


                                               53
Law 22 and Keppres 34/2003 have assigned these functions without transferring personnel,
buildings, and other assets to local governmentto undertake these functions fully and effectively.
Furthennore, the central government did not provide adequate training to local government
officials on how to provide the services efficiently. Therefore, most of local governments are not
able to undertake these functions and, on several occasions, the lack of clear guidelines and
capacity has contributed to mismanagement of land services by local officials.

The LMPDP project through component Eassisted the various government institutions to implement
the above strategy, including developing clear guidelines for those fimctions delegated to local
government, and build the capacity of local government to undertake these fimctions effectively. In
addition, the project assisted in transfonning BPN into a more efficient, open, transparent and
effective institution, including developing, implementing and monitoring clear service standards.

Carried out by Ministry of Home Affairs- Directorate General of Region Autonomy, this
component tried to fasten the implementation of decentralization domain of land areas as
mention in UU.No 32 Year 2004 about regional government as ruled in Keppres No.34 Year
2003 about national policy in land area which is implicitly says kabupatenlkota government
owned 9 land service functions. The activities in component E· included evaluating the capacity
of regional government doing the function of land management, training and capacity building,
strategic plan of Ministry of Home Affair in increasing the administration and land management
in RegioDaI Government, and developing the unit of LMPDP project.

Component E in 5 districts/cities pilot project was actually completed with lack of competent
human resource and technology support. To deal with this issue, this component provided
institutional development program and human resource capacity building to increase their
knowledge in operating land administration services. This component contributed positively
through capacity building of local government by carried out trainings. About 1,135 local
government officers attended the training.


CHAPTER V
MAJOR LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS

A.     Project Management Aspect
(l)    It is obvious that more efficient way of A WP compilation is required. It is suggested for the
       future to simplify the process. The AWP evaluation by the Bank needs simplification as well.
(2)    It should be considered that budgeting should be consistent with document plan.
       Therefore, budget allocated for project in every year should follow disbursement plan. If
       this could not be implemented,then disbursement plan should be rearranged by both
       parties (Gol and the World Bank).
(3)   Lesson learned from detennination of adjudication location in LMPDP is that for the
      future the detennination of adjudication location and cadastral survey should be
      conducted sequentially with land registration. If the detennination .of location and
      cadastral survey is conducted in the first year, then the land registration process is carried




                                                54
        out in the next year. This process is repeated for the other locations. Therefore, it is hoped
        that target achievement for certificate issuance and distribution can be fixed.
, (4)   Forthe future, rotation among project's personnel should be considered seriously to keep
        project performance. (5) For the future, relocation of project's secretariat shoUld be
        avoided to avoid loss of documents and to keep convenience working environment for
        the project personnel.
 (6)    Steering committee and technical committee should be equipped with secretariat filled by
        dedicated full time staff's and management consultant in order to run the committee's
        daily activity. This is to avoid weak coordination among members even the chairman has
        overload work.
 (7)    To ensure periodic reporting from PIUs, in'the future for big project like LMPDP it is
        suggested to develop web-based internal control system that can be filled and submitted
        remotely through internet. This system includes PMR and FMR feature. Based on this
        experience, since early 2010 BPN has been developing system called SKMPP (Sistem
        Kendali Manajemen Pengelolaan Pertanahan). This system is run by Directorate of Land
        Control together with adhoc team (Tim Kendali Pertanahan BPN). This system can be
        seen in www.skmpp.bpn.go.id.
 (8)    It is suggested to provide adequate fund for monitoring and evaluation purpose. The
        value should be stated in project agreement to ensure MoF dan Bappenas commitment for
        its allocation.
 (9)    To increase community participation level, it is suggested to 1) Revitalization of running
        programs in BPN, including; re-coordination in' agency partner for empowerment program
        such as Department of Marine and Fisheries, Department of Agriculture, Department of
        Cooperation and Small Holder Company, Banks and other financial agent, 2) Community
        Base Land Registration Program (pPBM) must functioned as effort to develop community
        will and participation in registering their land. Community participation in this term are: 1)
        community as a willingness in following socialization in land program; 2) community
        become part in land management as an effort for giving a responsibility in increasing'
        community trust in land management; 3) community able to give input in land management,
        psychologically has an attitude in supporting land program.
 (10)   To increase community willingness to join the adjudication program, it is suggested to
        continuously socialize the benefit of land certific.ate for their welfare, such as for cred~t
        and collateral purposes.
 (11)   Full timer.management should be seriously considered for the next project in the future to
        achieve effectiveness in activities.
 (12)   Multi years financial and procurement system is suggested for the future multi years
        project. This is to avoid problem occurred in LMPDP such as late implementation.

 B.     Procurement Aspects
 (1)    Considering the procurement process in the project should follow both the Bank's
        procurement guidelines and the GoI procurement guidelines, it is very important to effort
        well understanding of the two guidelines, not only for the Procurement Committee, but also
        for the bidders.


                                                 55
(2)    In order to meet similar understanding upon time based contract between the Bank and
       the Gol audit system, it is recommended to open possibility to add clausal about
       explanation of the requirement of time based contract audit in Indonesia into the format
       of time based contract, as well as in the contract between the firm and related hired expert.
(3)    If there is change in procurement methodology, it will be better to be applied early to avoid
       uncertain condition for the project management, in particular the procurement committee.
(4)    It is suggested for the project management to have target time to finish ToR and Standard
       Bidding Document for procurement package. Besides, procurement process should
       follow schedule stated in the annual procurement plan. Procurement process that is not
       conducted in timely manner or re-scheduling can affect another project's part, such as
       extended time for management and advisory consultant in component A since re-
       scheduling of two studies in 2009.
(5)    It is suggested also for the Bank's management to have procedure and target time for
       procurement process review hence NOL issuance can be predicted !>y project
       management. Besides, the World Bank should appoint ·dedicated officer to discuss issues
       related to procurement process with the project management. In pro~ssive way, the
       World Bank may take policy that if the review result cannot be obtained on the targeted
       time, then it can be decided that the World Bank has agreed.
(6)    Multi years system for procurement is suggested for the future to avoid dependency with
       the budget document issuance. As previously mentioned, LMPDP consultant
       mobilization. was affected by the budget document issuance. If the multi years system
       was adopted, there would have been no such problem.
(7)    To avoid ambiguity between the Bank's guidelines and the Presidential Regulation one,
       procurement training should be conducted early of the project and in 'adequate number.
(8)    It is suggested to: (1) formulation of new type of SBD for ''works'' which states clearly
       that the contract is "lump sum" which related to output, instead of "time based"; (2) the
       owner estimate should only state the unit price of whole activity/process, instead of
       describe detail cost such as man-month, transportation, accommodation, etc. These are to
       avoid discrepancy such as on cadastral'survey package.
(9)    To avoid redundancy in audit and to save cost, may be it will be better to appoint one
       auditor only instead of many auditor as applied in LMPDP. As described earlier, three
       auditors were appointed to audit·LMPDP, i.e. BPKP, BPN's inspectorate general, and the
       auditor from the World Bank.
(10)   All procurement mechanism and system should be carried out consistently by all parties.

c.     Financial Aspects
1)     For SP2D GUlNihil, KPPN should issue SP2D called SP2D Pengganti (SP2D
       Replacement) and submit the copy to project management for FMR purpose. Besides, BI
       should submit regular p~tout of special account to proj~ct management for cross check
       purpose regarding issued SP2D. Moreover, the World Bank should issued client connection
       regularly to project management hence the update status of replenishment can be provided.




                                               56
(2)    Adequate capable financial officer and hislher assistant should be ·provided, either in the
       executing/implementing agency or the World Bank itself. This is ·to ensure good financial
       management and coordination. Capacity of KPPN officers should be mentioned here as well.
       Some KPPN's officers had no experience in project funded by foreign loan/grant. This
       affected financial disbursement particularly in portion detennination of RK and RMP.
       Subsequently, this affected FMR compilation. Sufficient treasury training may become one
       solution for lack of financial officer. For alternative, support from financial expert/consultant
       (as applied in the last quarter ofLMPDP, which is too short) is a good solution.
(3)    Both parties should state equipment lifetime, in Project Appraisal Document (pAD) such
       as for server, computer, vehicle, etc. Subsequently, the cost table should accommodate
       disbursement plan for their replacements. This is to avoid disturbance in project
       implementation caused by inadequate/damaged equipment.
 (4)   Flexible or multi years financial system is suggested to ensure replenishment of eligible
       expenditure although beyond the due date regulated by Gors financial disbursement system
       such as in case of Kabupaten Blora, Banjar, Tanah Bumbu, and NTB province in year 2009.
       It is hoped also that problem in the beginning of fiscal years related to DiPA (budget
       document) and its guidance can be avoided. Moreover, the zero disbursement in the first
       quarter and the escalation of disbursement in the last quarter in each year can be prevented
       as well.
(5)    Price escalation policy which stated in agreement document is strongly          recommend~.
       This is to avoid irrelevant unit cost that has caused problem in LMPDP.
(6)    Good correspondence between both parties, in this case the project management and the
       Bank, was a critical point for the successful of the program. Miscommunication or lack of
       communication may cause loss to one party/both. No response from the Bank regarding
       request for the second loan cancellation from GoI would make loss to GoI since the
       commitment fee that should be paid
(7)    Application of State Treasurer's Special Account (RK-BUN) should be avoided. This
       practice is clearly unfair. Honestly the borrower has rights to use the fund since the
       borrower will pay the commitment fee. Supply of sufficient fund as stated in the
       agreement is mandatory for the lender. Insufficient fund in the special account such as in
       LMPDP and RALAS has decreased the project performance and made loss to the GoI.
(8)    Development and usage of on-line financial reporting system for the same kind of project
       in the future should be taken into account. For LMPDP case, the on-line system should
       connect the executing agency, KPPN, BI, and the World Bank. Replenishment process
       should be on-line among BPN as the executing agency, KPPN, BI, PKN, and the World
       Bank. The point is: the executing agency (in this case: BPN) should get privilege from
       MoF (PKN) to monitor the process. BPN should have privilege to communicate directly
       with BI regarding financial consolidation such as to solve pending and outstanding issues.
       BI should provide the real time status or print out of RK (special account) regularly and
       automatically. The World Bank should also provide and issue regularly the status of client
       connection. It is hoped that through this kind of system, problem such as pending and
       outstanding issues can be avoided. It would be better ifFMR used was on-line one and user
       friendly. This is to make the compilation ofFMR either in PIU or PMU run smoothly.



                                                 57
(9)    Faster method for revision of budget document (DIP A) is needed. Late in adjudication
       process caused by slow DIPA revision process such as in 2005 and 2009 should become
       lesson learned for the future.

D.     Land Policy Formulation
(1)   Despite the LMPDP has been closed on the end of year 2009, the Standard Operating
      Procedure (SOP) of Policy Study Process can continually be used as the instrument to
      conduct the consultative process of land policy formulation. Besides that, the experiences
      of implementation of Component A LMPDP also will be useful in preparation of the next
      National Medium Term Development Plan (NMTDP) 2014-2019.
(2)   It is admitted that after the loan signing of LMPDP, the function of Coordination
      committee of LMPDP indeed was no longer effective as expected due to reorganization
      in respective institutions. In dealing with such situation, with coordination function
      carried by Bappenas, the NLPF and outputs of policy studies have been used in
      preparation of the substance of NMTDP2010-2014. The NMTDP 2010-2014 has been
      legalized by Presidential Regulation number 5 year 2010. Besides, in its role as the
      secretariat of National Spatial Plan Coordination Board, Bappenas also can bring
      strategic and current land issues to be discussed in that forum, which established by
      Presidential Decree No.4 year 2009 and consists of related ministries, including BPN.
(3)   It can be concluded that such a formulation of land policy through land policy secretariat
      was quite effective. This become lesson learned for the future to run effective secretariat
      like this. In addition, the NLPF may become the reference of land policy framework for
      respective institutions.
(4)   Public campaign. Considering that maintenance and updating ofwww.landpolicy.or.id was
      less optimal, in the future the more intensive monitoring is needed. Moreover, an effort to
      sustain that website is also needed. For the time being, available alternative is linking or
      integrating the website with the website of National Spatial Plan Coordination Board
      (www.bkprn.org), combine it with BPN's website www.bpn.go.id or Bappenas' one·
      www.bappenas.go.id to ensure its sustainability. May be it will be better also for RRI and
      TVRI (GoI's broadcast radio and television, respectively) to have special program
      regarding land issues. The themes may suit community's need. Regarding bulletin, BPN's
      Public Relations Bureau may continue its issuance and distribution to community.
(5)   Partnerships with Advisory Consultant, Management Consultant, and Studies Consultants.
      One office for Advisory Consultant, Management Consultant and Studies Consultants is
      indeed very useful to attempt coordination and effectiveness of Component A LMPDP.
      The availability of Standard Operating Procedure of working together was significant to
      build efficient and effective cooperation among those related parties. Moreover,
      providing interval time between the mobilization of management consultant and other
      consultants will also be helpful for the management consultant to establish and prepare
      operationalization of the one office. This kind of partnership is suggested in the future.
(6)   It is also important to take into account that it will be better if the ICR preparation can be
      initiated earlier, probably one or two year before the closing date. Therefore, for the
      future, the ICR preparation should be covered in the scope of work of both Advisory
      Consultant and Management Consultant.


                                               58
(7)   Some recommended relevant policy can be fonnulated as the followings:
      a) Clarify the legal status of land registration that it is to legally strengthening. and
         confinning the legal status of a title holder from being a 'de facto' landowner to become
         a 'de jure' one. The civil right legal status of the owner should not be confused with the
         power of a man (corpus) to do legal action. Thus, an underage orphan, as a man is the
         sense of 'corpus', is eligible to own land and be registered as a 'de jure' ownership.
      b) Adat land rights are not siniilarto communal land or 'hakulayat'. Therefore, to register
         adat right of the adat community's land is always possible, providing that the intensive
         study should be conducted prior to the titling program. The study· should discover and
         find the best safety mode to converse the adat title in compliance to rights in the article
         16 of BAL, and the mode to protect the adat status of the land in the certificate. This
         means, Indonesia should be able to develop his own model of land registration
      c) BPN should issue a decree forjoint titling names of husband and wife, register land under
         the name of women and men, register the land under the name ofan orphan or under age.
      d) Revenue for obtaining right on land and building (BPHTB) should not be used as a
         condition to register lands in the first time registration. The reason for that is because
         the first time land registration is a State's mode of confinning the legal status of a title
         holder to become a 'de jure' landowner and to bring the landowner be registered in a
         modem State's land administration system.
      e). Announcements and field preparation in the community of the chosen area for systematic
          adjudication should be made at least two months before mobilizing adjudication team in
          the relevant village. The announcement is to let the relevant community members know
          of the incoming program, and to explain them the kinds of documents should be provided.
          Explain and train the village administration staff to help mobilize the community
          members to agree among the abutted landowners of the land boundaries and boundary
          stakes placement with a clear mark on the sticks. It is a good idea, if the adjoining
          landowners' agreement on their land boundaries and boundary sticks placement be put in
          a written statement endorsed by the village head or other staff member.
      f) Systematic land adjudication should be prioritized and continuously conducted to cover
         the whole lands within the state's territory. It is highly recommended, because it has
         been proven that systematic adjudication is the most effective mode to systematically
         register lands with affordable cost for the poor people, good quality and validity of
         survey document, and timely issuing thdand certificate for the landowners.
      g) The basic category for choosing areas to implement the systematic land adjudication
         is on the basis of village, instead of total parcels target. After all land in the target
         villages totally registered, then followed by the next adjoining village(s) until the
         whole area ofland in the country, fully registered and administered properly.
      h) The fonn and legal status of the prevailing land registration regulation, PP No. 24 of the
         year 1997, should be strengthened to become a Law that covers all land title
         registrations. Title registration, should not be interpreted and specified to only for the
         private individual rights but also including state, public and Adat community's rights.
         This is necessary, because the legal status of a land title, as understood in the land law



                                               59
             doctrine and principle, is a civil right of 'man' in the sense of a 'corpus' to hold land as
             a landowner with freehold title.
        i) State and government as body corporate with sovereignty power and authority to
           eontrolland within the state's territory, is by law doctrine are the landowner, either as
           a land possessor or a landowner. The -title registration is therefore, should cover all
           partels so that each parcel within the state territory could· be determine its specific
           title and title holder, regardless of the agrarian rights over the lands.
       j) Consequently, forest lands under forestry authority and domain, should; also be
          systematically registered and determine the specific title of the Forestry Minister.
          This is because, the Ministry of Forestry only hold the agrarian rights of managing
          the land which is possessed and control by the state. Therefore, Land Law registration
          should also covers all forest areas within the state territory.
       k) Anticipation to the equal status of women and men in landownership, as provided in
          Article 9 (2) of the Basic Agrarian Law of 1960, the PP No. 24/1997 should be revised by
          added a special article to allow the joint titling namely to mention the name of husband
          and wife in the certificate, and all siblings names' over the undivided inherited land.
       1) It is necessary to enact the special Indonesian Land Law to coordinate the other
          agrarian laws namely: Basic Agrarian Law, Forestry Law, Mining Law, Apartment
          Law, Spatial, etc. That is to end up the existing 'dual agrarian' and even 'multiplicity'
          agrarian laws and policy ruled by Basic Agrarian Law, Forestry Law, Mining Law,
          Apartment Law, Spatial Law, etc.

E.     Institutional Development & Capacity BuDding
To support the on-going reform and capacity building in sector institutions, it is suggested that:
       (1)      AdMinistrative and surveyor staffs in the Land Office, needs improvement both in
                quality and quantity, particularly in the rural areas.
       (2)      Staffs that had worked in systematic land adjudication should be rewarded by
                promotion of ranks or structural position in the office.
       (3)      Training to improve staffs' skill and intellectual ability in understanding land law
                is necessary to be able to handle their jobs both in the office and in the field. (4)
                Improve and empower the landowners to be responsible in boundary stakes and to
                take good care of their boundaries sticks. Landowners should understand that
                removing a boundary stick from its original spot is a criminal act.
       (4)      Improve and empower the landowners to be responsible in boundary stakes and to
                take good care of their boundalies sticks. Landowners should understand that
                removing a boundary stick from its original spot is a criminal act.
       (5)      Improve the skill and ability to take care all land documents including the 'warkah'
                in a good and systematic filing cabinet that can be quickly trace when needed.
       (6)      BPN surveyors' staffs should be increase in number and quality to help speed up
                land survey and to control the license surveyors' work in the systematic
                adjudication activities.                                                      '



                                                  60
     (7)    BPN should be endowed with power and authority to supervise and control the
            quality of license surveyors' work in the field.
     (8)    Field adjudication honorarium should be paid high enough to motivate them
            concentrate in their works in the field.
     (9)    BPN should provide a regulation to· empower surveyor to enter any house yard
            and parcel to survey and measure the area securely, and that any hindrance by the
            landowners to stop the activities is counted as a criminal act.
     (10)   The doctrine of negative system in land registration should be changed to make it
            positive, right after the land was registered.

F.   Accelerated Land Titling
     (1)    It is suggested to continue the public campaign for adjudication. Although the
            base line study found 66:6% of the household have no understanding of
            Systematic Land Registration, after pre-adjudication public campaign, the
            understanding increase as depicted in the community perceptions. Surprisingly
            that 94.79% of the respondents confirms that they understand the important of all
            information contains in the land certificate are important and 78.13% said that all
            information contained in the land certificate meet their requirement. This kind of
            evaluation must have the result of a better understanding about content of the land
            certificate, which is also correspond with discovered in the base line study about
            96.2% of community's interest to have their land be registered.
     (2)     Campaign in understanding of the contents of land tittles and usage of titles
            received and post-titling impact on land valued in the area One of proposed
             objectives of the LMPDP project is to improve land tenure security. Improved land
            tenure security would reduce land conflicts; induce more land-related investment,
            and increase lending through land titles as collateral, which will all contribute to
            sustaining economic recovery. In the long term, the project will contribute to
            increased government revenues from land related taxes and fees, which could be
            utilized for better public services to the community. It is evident that most
            beneficiaries have not ever used the land title to access credit to improve their
            economicllivelihoods activity. Community empowerment on the use of land
            certificate to improve their economic activity seems to be the next agenda. This
            empowerment program is needed so those communities able to improve their
            economic activity yet maintain their asset (land ownership). Field data shows that
            only 45.37% of the participants had ever used land certificate to obtain credit in the
            Bank. Considering of unfamiliar usage of Banking system by the Natives
            Indonesian because of the Dutch isolation land and agrarian policy that create 'dual
            economy', then the use of land certificate after systematic registration, is a big leap
            ahead in breaking the 'dual economy' system. Another impressive fact in this
            regard, is the use of land certificate by the Native Indonesian for collateral. This is
            impressive, because the participants who are used to be the Natives and now
            become the Indonesian citizen, has for the first time obtain land certificate that can
            be mortgaged in the Bank for obtaining credit. Community awareness and
            understanding on the benefit of land certificate will contribute to success and



                                             61
      acceleration of any land titling and registration programs. It is expected that the
      more community awareness and understanding on the benefit of land titling and
      registration, the more self-initiated and self-financed land titling and registration
      will happen. Community's understands on the content and relevance of the land
      titles is high enough to reach 79.86%. The awareness, however, is only on the
      physical appearance and typographical of a land certificate. In-depth interview and
      FGD confirms that people in the community has not yet understand about the legal
      status and consequence of having a land certificate. The understanding of land
      certificate as a legal prove and state protection and guarantee of their 'de jure' civil
      right is unaware. This is normal, because not only the layman in the community but
      the learnt intellectual members of the community and government officials as well,
      have no understanding of land certificate as a legal protection, guarantee and
      security of their 'de jure' title as a landowner. As a consequence of the lack of
      understanding land certificate as 'de jure' evidence, then the awareness of its
      relevance to legal consequence ofland title is also unknown. The low understand of
      legal consequence and status of the land title, make people in the community only
      have the ability to evaluate the physical error appears in the land certificate.

       This ability is high enough that it reaches 80.79%. But they can only discover the
       typographical err of name recording and parcel's area mistakes. The title holder
       never cares about checking the accuracy and existence of boundary sticks
       placement and its physical existence in the field. They are also did not aware and
       did not know about their legal obligations to take care of the boundaries sticks, and
      the legal consequence of moving a boundary stick from its original spot is· a
      criminal act. Thus, communities understand of the law and legal consequence of
      land title and land certificate is still very low. The acknowledgement of 45.37% of
      the participants to use their land certificate to obtain credit, suggest that it is caused
      by merely economic interest, not be based on a law and legal awareness of a land
      certificate. Nonetheless, this is a good sign of social and economic impact of having
      a land certificate as a 'de jure' title for business enterprise. The fact explain that
      land certificate provide open access for the landowners to participate in the modem
      economy business. An access that for centuries, because of the Dutch land and
      agrarian isolation policy, never been provided before for the Natives Indonesian
      both in rural or sub-urban and in the cities. The Dutch land registration norms as
      ruled in the Dutch Civil Code54, only valid for the European and Foreign Orientals,
      for their Dutch landownership calls 'eigendom'. The Native Indonesians who owns
      landownership under Adat Law, is not legally recognized and never been registered
      for its 'de jure' right. Therefore, the Native Indonesians are excluded from using
      land certificate for banking collateral to obtain credit. Hence, the 45.37% of the
      participants using their land certificate for obtaining credit is a great leap forward to
      experiencing banking system in modem economic live.
(3)   Changes in Land Use Patterns. Field data reveals that there are 42.82% participants
      perceives that land use often change after certification, which is supported by
      47.57% who say that they will change their land utilization after registration. In-
      depth interview and FGD reveals that the change of land use after certification is
      caused by developing commercial business and house development. Change in the


                                        62
       land use pattern for business investment is increasing up to 47.57%, both in rural
       and sub-urban areas. In rural areas like Sambas and Barito Kuala, title holders
       generally tend to use their land certificate for obtaining capital in the bank for
       developing small business. In Sambas, orange and coconut business is booming that
       many of the landowners develop a combination of agricultural use of their paddy
       field and orange orchards. In Barito Kuala, by contrast, many participants still
       questions about the need of registering their land. The query is based on the fact
       that for decades .living in their adat community, there is no land conflict and lives
       goes smoothly and peacefully. The social situation is understandable, because
       Barito Kuala belongs to the rural area where city is being develop and economic
       live has not flourish yet. But when economic and city lives flourish like it is in
       Sambas, then the need for land registration will increase. Actually there is no direct
       correlation between land registration and change in the land use pattern. Change in
       the land use pattern is commonly caused by population and economic increase and
       government developmental policy. In this three main causes, a lot of land will be
       needed that land acquisition program will be developed regardless of it is registered
       or not. But obviously land registration has direct impact in increasing land value
       and price in the land market. This is confirmed by the fact of 48.26% of the
       participants said that after registration, a lot of land transactions happen. The need
       for having land certificates in the community is very high for economic purposes. It
       is also suggest that socioeconomic impact of land registration is to provide open
       access for the common people in the society to use the certificate as collateral for
       obtaining credit and cash capital from the bank or other formal financial institutions.
       Thus, the mode of changes in land use pattern after land registration is not to use it
       for non eConomic purpose, which could make the landowners lost their land, but in
       the contrary to enhance their prosperity. In addition, land registration also has its
       direct impact to the poor people to reduce their reliance on moneylenders for
       obtaining cash money with very high interest.
(4)    Tax holiday policy regarding BPHTB tax for first time land registration. Another
       nuisance is the insistence of collecting the Revenue for Obtaining Right on Land and
       Building (Bea Perolehan Hak atas Tanah dan Bangunan-abbrv. BPHTB) in the, first
       time registration. ,The insistence makes a lot of landowners drop out from
       participating in systematic adjudication, because of lack of money to pay the revenue.
       As described in the previous chapter, the critical issue. in the land certification was the
       inability of people to pay taxes under the BPHTB. Learning for the future is the need
       of coordination with the Ministry of Finance and local governments to give about
       BPHTB and "pologoro" (amount of money as the income for village) policy. This is
       recommended also by Study on Sustainability of Land Titling and Registration.
(5)    APBD (local budget) for first time land registration (if applicable).55
(6)    Another choice for first time land registration fund is through private partnership.
       The third party provides the fund with land management authority compensation.56
(7)   . Areas urgently needing land titling are:
       •   The left over parcels in the previous adjudication area that has not yet done.



                                          63
       •   The adjacent village of the previous adjudicated area, to avoid envy of the
           adjacent community and to fulfill the principle .of fully systematic
           adjudication.
       •   Areas where economic and commercial growth is growing, to help the title
           holders able to obtain capital gain.
       •   Area where land and. agrarian conflict and disputes are plenty, but need pre-
           adjudication study to identify types of conflict and stimulate the disputants to
           speed up solving their conflict because the prognim is planned to be
           conducted.
       •   Area that are covered by house dwellers in the forestry land.
       •   Villages next to cities.
       •   Area where adat land law still strongly adheres by the people, but had a pre-
           adjudication study to determine the best mode of registering adat land.
       •   Areas a long State's border lines should also be systematically adjudicated,
           whether occupied, unoccupied, tilled or forest land.
 (8)   It is recommended that LMPDP also cover the pre-adjudication cost, or clearly
       acknowledge that pre-adjudication cost may exist and further declare that LMPDP
       lets people decided among themselves whatever cost is applicable;
(9)    BPN shall conduct ~ore frequent and intensive socialization on how to submit
       complaint or report on land disputes to BPNlland office;
(10)   BPN shall arrange post-titling prognim designed·· to advocate and empower
       community on how to prudentially use the land certificate to rise their income yet
       minimizing potential risk of losing their assetlland;
(11)   Clarify the legal status ofland registration to legally strengthening and confirming the
       legal status of a title. holder from beh,.g a 'de facto' landowner to become a 'de jure'
       one. The civil right legal status of the owner should not be confused with the power
       of a man (corpus) to do legal action. Thus, an under-age orphan, asa man is the sense
       of 'corpus', is eligible to own land and be registered as a 'de jure' ownership;
(12)   Adat land rights are not similar to communal land or 'hak ulayat'. Therefore, to
       register adatright of the adat community's land is always possible, providing that
       the serious study should be conducted prior to the titling prognim. The study
       should discover and find the best safely mode to converse the adat title in
       compliance to rights in the article 16 of BAL, and the mode to protect the adat
       status of the land in the certificate. This means, Indonesia should be able to
       develop his own model of land registration;
(13)   BPN should issue a decree for joint titling names of husband and wife, register
       land under the name of women and men, register the land under the name of an
       orphan or under age;
(14)    Revenue for obtaining land right and building (BPHTB) should not be used as a
       condition to register lands in the first time registration. The·· reason for that is



                                        64
        because the first time land registration is a State's mode of confirming the legal
        status of a title holder to become a 'de jure' landowner and to bring the landowner
        be registered in a modern State's land administration system;
(15)    Announcements and field preparation in the conununity of the chosen area for
        systematic adjudication should be made at least two months before mobilizing
        adjudication team in the relevant village. The announcement is to let the relevant
        community members know of the incoming program, and to explain them the
        kinds of documents should be provided. Explain and train the village
        administration staff to help mobilize the community members to agree among the
        abutted landowners of the land boundaries and boundary. stakes placement with a
        clear mark on the sticks. It is a good idea, if the adjoining landowners' agreement
        on their land boundaries and boundary stakes placement be put in a written
        statement endorsed by the village head or other staff member.
(16)    It is recommended that BPN should adopt to implement only one mode of land
        registration model namely Systematic Registration as administered in the
        Government Regulation (PP) No. 24 of the year 1997. This is necessary, to help
        avoid the multiple modes of land registration that causes several forms and
        appearance of land title certificates, which is confusing when it is used as legal
        evidence in law suits.
(17)    The basis to determine the systematic registration is on the village unit ra,ther than
        target number in several scattered villages. It has··· been a fact that target number
        creates scattered unsystematic registered parcels in a village that had impaired the
        feature of systematic registration, and creates envy among people in the village as
        well as difficulty in dispute settlement.
(18)    Systematic registration should not only cover the first time registered parcels but
        also including the sporadic regi~ parcels in the village. To resurvey the
        registered sporadic parcels within the systematic registration village area, is' to
        renew or revised or to reconfirm the accuracy of spatial and textual data of the
        registered parcels in the village; which help develop, the one clear systematic land
        administration system in the village and in Indonesia as a whole.
(19)    BPN should take active initiative to develop a Land Law of Indonesia, as the basis
        for. legal foundation and guidance to integrate the development and
        implementation of all agrarian laws in Indonesia. This is the only way to
        overcome the contradictory norms and regulations and yet to synchronize and
        abolish· the dual and even multiple systems of agrarian laws implemented by
        several government institutions in Indonesia without Land Law principle, doctrine,
        theory and philosophy to coherently synchronize the agrarian rules and norms
        enforce by several different government institutions.
(20)     The basic principle of land policy for Indonesia, should be defined and enforced
         that all Indonesian citizen are the landowner and are equally entitle with no
         gender inequality to own land as a freehold ownership calls 'hak milik',
       . regardless of them being a 'de facto' or 'de jure' landownership.




                                         65
       (21)    Based on the landownership theory and the doctrine of State's right of land
               control (hak menguasai dari Negara) over land, then it is recommended that every
               single inch of land within the state's territory along its borderlines should be
               registered. This is to include the demilitarized zone along the state's borderline
               with. the neighboring foreign state. That·is to legally confirms the 'de facto' claim
               of the state to become the 'de jure' state right of control. It is necessary, to
               strengthen the legal claim against any foreigners' entrance or encroachment into
               the State's territory ·that raises state power and authority to call for State's legal
               defend its borderline under the land doctrine of 'trespass' principle.

G.     National Land Information System
A very important part of the proposed·NLIS strategy therefore is the establishment of a National
Council for Land Infonnation of Indonesia. This Council has to take leadership in the development
of the NLIS in conjunction with the NSDI. The Council is not taking over responsibilities from the
participating organizations but coordinating the solution of the problems that are hindering the
establishment of the NLIS and the NSDI. The Council should be assisted by a number of technical
working groups for specific issues regarding the NLIS. The Council should have the following tasks:
       (1)     A continuous effort to convince the political leaders of Indonesia and the
               Indonesian society that a sustainable investment in the NLIS is necessary to solve
               the Land Policy issues
       (2)     To show to the participating organizations that the joint commitment is real a.t)d to
               stimulate mutual cooperation
       (3)     To manage relations with the wider group of stakeholders of the NLIS
       (4)     To solve the issues that are hindering the implementation of the NLIS like:
               • Incompatibility of regulations
               • . Conflicting mandates with respect to the NLIS
               • Data sharing issues
               • Coordination of investments
       (5)    To take custodianship for the infonnation component in a number of pilot projects
              where the solution for important Land Policy issues are tested. These pilots should
              deliver solved Land Policy issues and NLIS-showcases for further development.
              The pilot area in Makassar to test the approach for the improvement of infonnal
              settlements (IPSLA) is a very suitable opportunity in the urban environment.
              Another good possibility is in Sleman were a well trained district government office
              is established. In the rural areas also pilots should be developed to test specific
              needs of processes of agrarian refonn and land access and in an urban area to test
              the support to the urban land market. These pilot project need a coordinated
              approach involving all NLIS stakeholders, all land infonnation should be made
              available~ the used IT systems should be made compatible and staff of all
              stakeholders should be trained to use the relevant elements of the NLIS. Also a
              transparent environment is needed to be able to use the results in other areas.
       (6)    The Council will also be responsible for the development of an integrated
              Knowledge Management Strategy for the NLIS. The development of the NLIS


                                                66
             will change the necessary capacity of staff and organizations. Important elements
             of this Knowledge Management Strategy can be:
             •   To coordinate educational programs with national and international universities.
             •   To discuss structure ofUniversitj courses
             •   To organize regular conferences and workshops to discuss NLIS and NSDI issues
             •   To spread knowledge developed in the pilot projects,. successes and lessons
                 learned.
      (7) . Implementation of the NLIS has to be well planned based on geographic priorities
            derived from the Land Policy.

H.    Capacity Building Support for Local Government
By gathering and analyzing the data related to land matters, land use, permits, and SLIM
development, the following conclusive items are proposed below:
      (1)    Updating the system and the textual and spatial data is compulsory to make SLIM
             sustainable.
      (2)    Land management needs to be improved to meet sustainable environmental
             conditions. Trainings related to land management especially in monitoring and
             evaluation, arid also in land dispute resolution is highly recommended.
      (3)    Capacity of Regional Government should be upgraded immediately to all
             district/city with aerial photography.
      (4)    Directorate DPOD & HAL is suggested to facilitate the development of SLIM in
             land area to all district and city in Indonesia. Successful of SLIM in five area will
             become good example for other districts in whole country.
      (5)    For the SLIM successful, the government need the budget support for aerial
             photography, monitoring and evaluation, and the system development itself.
      (6)    Experience from other countries which has been described in chapter 3 (from
             overseas study in Australia, China, Germany, and South Korea) should become
             lesson learned for GoI in improving land management.

I.    Good Governance.and Anti Corruption Framework
      (1)   . In the future, to enhance disclosure provisions, it is required to make publicly
              available the date of payment in any contract and'the date of request for such
             payment. The bank implementation team is required to bring up this issue and
             provide adequate guidance to the implementing agency of their future project.
      (2)    Senior management commitment and force is required to address the mitigation
             measures. BPN could benefit immensely from learning how to put together
             change management programs to address not only anti-corruption issues but other
             issues as well, such as improving customer service and containing cost.
      (3)    To reduce corruption and collusion in land affairs, clarify and streamline all land .
             allocation criteria and procedures for land distribution, certification, acquisition,
             and transformation (and rezoning) of interest in land by providing regulatory


                                              67
               transparency, on-line public records with land and tax infonnation, and provide
               due process (fundamental principles of justice) for public review and appeal.
        (4)    The Gol (BPN, MoHA, and Bappenas) have consistently involved
               NGO/universities in procurement committee for transparency and good
               governance. Indeed, MoHA and BPN have issued letter to Bupatilwalikota around
               Indonesia in suggestion not to collect retribution or other kinds of fee for
               processing of land documents in this project.

J.     Gender Mainstreaming
Good achievement related to gender issues should be continued in another project in the future.

K.     Community Participation
Based on research result, recommendations for BPN in community empowennent for the future
can be described below:
       (1).    Revitalization of running programs in BPN, including; re-coordination in agency
               partner for empowennent program such as Department of Marine and Fisheries,
               Department of Agriculture, Department of Cooperation and Small Holder
               Company, Banks and other financial agent,
       (2)    Community Base Land Registration Program (MPBM) must functioned as effort
              to develqp community will and participation in registering their land. Community
              participation in "this tenn are: 1) community has a willingness in following
              socialization in land program; 2) community become pint in land management as
              an effort for giving a responsibility in increasing community· trust in land
              management; 3) community able to give input in land management,
              psychologically has an attitude in supporting land program.
       (3)    BPN shall arrange the post-titling program designed to advocate and empower
              community on how to prudentially use the land certificate to raise their income
              yet minimizing potential risk of losing their assetlland.

L.     Negative impacts of this kind of program and sugg"ted mechanisms to minimb:e
       them
       (1)    In the community level, the possible negative impacts of the program is the
              neglecting of women's right as the landowner by the not well trained field
              adjudication team members. Another possible negative impact is the neglecting of
              recording the name of an OIphan and under age in the certificate, due to the reliance
              of the lawyers on the Dutch Civil Code that only an adult or the name of a guardian
              that appear in the certificate. As a result, it is predicted that the misused of the
              OIphan and under age land by the guardian, is very likely to happen on the risk of
              the OIphan and under age interests.
       (2)    Add item in the land investigation fonn (DI 20 I) by adding specification of the
              three type of landed property namely: (a) the joint or common property, (b).
              inherited property, and (c). brought in marriage property.




                                               68
       (3)     Clarifying the meaning of civil right on land and the landownership theory, in
               which land titling program is only to ascertain and confirming the legal status of
               an owner, from the 'de facto' to become a 'de jure' owner. Hence, a land parcel
               can be registered under an under age's or even a baby's name, but any legal action
               over the land should be represented by the guardian.                     .
       (4)     The possibility of land lost which may further followed by rise of poverty was
               submitted during FGD in Kabupaten Lampung Selatan and Kota Cilegon.
               Respondent said that if beneficiaries do not have adequate understanding on how to
               prudentially use the land certificate to obtain credit from formal financial institution,
               they may end up at land lost as the bank confiscate the land due to credit failure.
       (5)     In order to mitigate this negative impact, post-titling empowerment prograln should
               be provided to educate beneficiaries on how to prudentially use the land certificate.
       (6)     Some people perceived that adjudication program is totally free from any cost.
               They did not know which cost component covered by the World Bank. They did
               not know that other cost related to pre-adjudication may exist i.e. for the issuance of
               surat k:eterangan tanah, duty stamp, boundary stake or reasonable fee for volunteer
               which work for the people. Illegal fee should be interpreted as any collection by
               BPN, Land Office, and adjudication team or license surveyor contractor.
       (7)     The terms "gratis" (totally free) and "semua biaya ditanggung Bank Dunia" (all
               cost covered by the World Bank) imply that any collection for money related to
               adjudication program is illegal.
       (8)     In order to mitigate the next case, the project shall clarify on all misunderstanding
               with regard to. cost components for land adjudication and explain which cost
               component is covered by project/World Bank and which cost component is not
               covered. The project shall further inform that all cost components which is not
               covered by LMPDP shall be part of community participation.

M.     KPIs
Formulation of KPI should be discussed thoroughly in order to suit the regulation related to the
implementation. It should be stated objectively and realistic.
