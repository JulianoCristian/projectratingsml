APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT
SUMARY
i.        The Government of Gabon has requested assistance in the financing
of an education project which would be jointly financed by the International
Bank for Ileconstruction and Developmentç the French Governnent and Gabon.
The proposed project was appraised by a Bank mission which visitcd Gabon in
June, 1967.
iM.       The project, as modified during appraisal, would consist of the
construction and equipment of (a) a teachers' college with an attached primary
school for practice teaching, (b) a new secondary school to replace an
unsuitable existing school, (c) extensions to tèree secondary schools, and
(d) extensions to two accelerated industrial training centers, together with
(e)'a technical assistance ccmponent, and (f) a fellowship programn  The esti-
mated cost is US $3.6 miZIiJon equivalent.
iii.      The educational and skill levels of the population are low and
large numbers of expatriates now occupy high-level and middle-level posts.
The output of the second level education and training system is inadequate
to meet the needs of an expanding and potentially rich economy. The proposed
project would assist achievement of planned educational objectives designed
to increase Gabonese participation in the economic life of the
country.
iv.       The project would provide for additional enrollments of about lO
pupils in general secondary education, 180 in teacher-training, 360 in the
annexed primary school, and 40 in vocational training. It would form part
of the planned increase in the percentage of the age group 12-19 in all
types of secondary schools from 10% in 1966 to 15.5% in 1975.  In the same
period the teachers' college would help raise the trained teacher percentage
from 26% to 66% of the prinmry school teaching force with considerable improve-
ment in the quality of the secondary school input.
v.        Application of the improved secondary school curricula, with
greater stress on the sciences and practical subjects, would be mnade possible
by the provision of laboratories and workshops. Improvement of the quality
of education should reduce the present high costs of education at both primarj
and secondary levels caused by excessive drop-out and repetition.
vi.       The supply of qualified entrants to the project schools and job
opportunities for the output are assured. However, although sufficient
teachers for the project schools now and when in full operation would be
available from the Fonds d'Aide-et de Cooperatibn (F.A.C.) sources, an
adequate supply for the whole secondary school system,9.i.zx4ng evontual
roplac,oment oa non-Gabonose teachers; is assured only if the Goverrnent imple-
ments a fel}awship program for preparation of secondary school teachers; the
project includes financing of such a program.



- ii -
vii.    School locations and sites are satisZactory.  Schedules of accommo-
dation and equipment are economical and consistent with functional needse
Estimated costs of construction, furniture and equipment are reasonable.
Contract awards and procurenient will conform to international competitive bid-
ding procedures.
viii.   A project unit and the employment of private architects will be
necessary for implementation of the project. There is no shortage of competent
local building contractors.
ix.     The Government is able to meet its share of the capital cost of the
proposed project and the consequential recurrent expenditures.
x.      Of the estimated cost of the project of US $3.60 miLlione 26% would
provide for construction of teaching spaces, 4% for dormitories, 4% for staff
housing, 15% for furniture and equipmentS 4% for site development, 3% for
professional fees, 20% for technical assistance, and 11% for fellowships.
Contingencies and a local cost adjustment factor to meet higher building costs
in the interior make up the total. The foreign exchange component is estimated
at $2.28 million or 63% of the estimated total cost of the project. The dis-
bursement period would be 4 years; construction would be completed by Septem-
ber, 1971.
xi.     It is proposed that the Bank should finance 50% of the total costs or
$1.8 million, FoA.C. 13% or $0.48 million, and Gabon 37% or $1.32 million.
The FOA.CO contribution would be a grant applied exclusively to the technical
assistance iteme the Bank loan to all other items. Excluding the cost of
technical assistance, the proposed Bank loan of $1e8 million would represent
63% of the estimated remaining total cost of $2.88 million; the estimated
foreign exchange component of this portion of the project would be $1.8 million
or 63%.
xii.    The project is suitable for a loan of $1.80 million or 50% of the total
cost for a period of 25 years including a grace period of 10 years. Funds not
disbursed at completion of the project would be available for cancellation.



APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION MROJECT 1W GABON
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01    In May 1967 Gabon requested Bank financial assistance to expand and
improve its secondary level education facilities. A Bank appraisal mission
comprising Messrs. C. L. Germanacos (general educator), Kin Maung Thint
(architect), and H. H. Thias (economist) visited Gabon in June, 1967. Assist-
ance had been provided in the preparation of the application by a Unesco
project preparation mission in July, 1966,9 subsequent to identification of
priority needs by a Bank/Unesco reconnaissance mission in November3 1965.
1.02    The proposed Bank project is part of a comprehensive program which
includes expansion in technical., conumercial,D agricultural and forestry educa-
tion and training. Account was taken of projects in these fields which ari
under way and those for which the assistance of other agencies had been
requested or obtained (paras. 3.13, 3.15-3.17, 3,24-3.25).
1.03    The project as subnitted consisted of the construction and equipmen&  +
a pedagogic institute for educational research and text-book development, a
primary schools' teacher-training college with attached application primary
school9 extensions and improvements to four lyceesP and minor extensions to t-
accelerated industrial training centers.
1.04    The appraisal mission has made four major modifications acceptable to
the Governmentt (i) exclusion of the pedagogic institute which F.A.C. has
already undertaken to construct and equip3 (Ji) construction of a new lycee
at Port Gentil rather than expansion of the existing school; (iii) addition
of a technical assistance item which would provide key personnel for the
project schools; (iv) addition of a fellawship program to build up a Gabonees
secondary school teaching force.
l.05    The total estimated cost of $3.6  million would be jointly financed
by the Bank, the French Governnent and Gabor, with the French contribution - a
grant - of $480,000 being applied exclusively to meeting the French costs of
the technical assistance item. Gabon has requested grants of equipment to the
value of about  $70,000 from FoA.C. for the four project lycees, and from
Unicef equipment for the project teacherst col:ege to the value of about
$60, ooo0

2. SOF?,0--CT:IC_     2rTp7ÏS
2.01      Population density in Gabon is 1.8 inlabitants per Km2.   The
greater part of the population of 468,Oo, which includes 6,500 non-Africans,
is scattered in small settlements lining the roads and waterways. An
estimated 25% of the population lives in towns of 2000 and more inhabitants;
about 55,000 are in the capital, Libreville, and 25,000 in Port Gentil,
the main industrial center.
2.02      The Gabonese people comprise numerous ethnic groups, each with its
own language.   French is the official language and also the medium of
instruction thraughout the education system.' Only 135 of the population over
14 years of age were énumerated as literate in} the 1960-1961 Census; only 1%
had had some post-primary education.
2.03      The per capita GDP income is estimated at $480 in 1966, but the per
capita GNP is only about $300. The econon.y has favorable devolopment pros-
pocts but tho lack 6f people, of skills and of communications are the main
.oonstraints on botter exploitation of the rich natural resources.
2.04      Agricultural activities are to a large extent subsistence but
there is a smnall export of cocoa, coffee and groundnuts. The main source
of income at present lies in the forests and mining activities; 40h' of
foreign trade receipts come from the export of okoume timber used in plywood
manufacture and trimbor products; 40h from n.inorils, including 1_wnganese,
uranium, and gold. crude ail accounts for another 15;;.  Th, r_cont discovery
of large deposits of high quality iron-ore could add a newz dimension to the
country's dovolopment prospects. 1/
2.05      Developrment of the resources continues to be largely dependent
on foreign investments and inflow of technical, administrative and entre-
preneurial skills. In the public sector, French expertise assists in
operational, administrative and advisory capacities. In the government's
economic development plans, high priority is given to improvement and
expansion of the education and training systern with a view to greater
Gabonese participation at aU levels of tho econanic life of the country.
1/ The economic and manpower projections for 1975 used ihi this report do
not take into.account possible exploitation of thest f iroa-iore resources.

3. EDUCATION AND TRAINING
The Structure and Administration of Education
3.01      The education system coiprises a primary school course of six
years, folloæing which selectod students proceed for a two-year general
secondary course in tlhe co1leogs or lycees (Armex 1); after coiipletion
of Grade 8 students eithier (i) continue in the general seccndary school
for twio more ycars to the B.E.P.C. level or take a five-year course leading
to the Baccalaureat; or (ii) are channelled into technical schools for
a three, four or five year course. Holders of the B.E.P.C. may also
compete for places in the teacher-training centers or the Teachers'
College. Some primary school graduates enter apprenticeship or home
economics centers.
3.02      The Minister of National Education is responsible for both
public and private education. All private education is denominational.
Policy formulation is somewhat circumscribed by local pressure to maintain
equivalence with the standards and objectives of the Ftcnch education system.
The organization of the Ministry (Annex 2) is compact and effective
and the directors of the various divisions combine professional with
administrative duties. F.A.C. provides advisory services to the rabher
inexperienced but promising Gabonese administrators.   The inspectorate
is decentralized and supervises public and private primary schools Mnd the
colleges; the quality of the inspactorate is being inproved. Thm lycees are
supervised by inspectors sont periodically by France.   Thio ch-urch authorlt_es
have their owin administrative services and inspectorates but cooperation
between the state and church authorities is exenplary.
3.03      A small planning and statistics unit has been trained by a
Unesco planning adviser. This should now be in a position to program
educational plans. In 196h, S.E.D.E.S. made a survey of education and
prepared a sound ten-year plan for educational development.
Primary Education
3.o4      In 1966-67, enrollment in Tho 627 primary schlools was 81,000,
equivalent to about 75 percent of the 6-15 years age-group, with the
proportion of girls in the schools rising from 29 percent in 1955 to
46 percent in 1966-67 (Annexes 3-5). Of the total enrollment, 47 per-
cent is in public schools. The teacher-pupil ratio of l:hl is accept-
able, but only 26 percent of the teaching force is trained   (Annex 6)
3.05      The 1975 target of 100,000 in the primary and in post-primary
'terminal' schools (para, 3.l4), cquivalont to 100 percont of the 6-13 years
age-group or 83 percent of the '6-15 cohorts, seens feasible. Priority is ncw
to be given to imuproving the efficiency of thie system by further curriculum
reform, by improving scolool facilities and teachèr training, and up-grading
the field teaching force.  This should decrease the piesent i-£gh costs of-
educationrby aceelerating the observod trend of improvomeont in tlle drop-out
ratos, estfimatod at 65 percent over the six years course, and of répetition
which resulta in only 5 percent of the studonts completing the course
in six yoars..

Second Leveol Ehiicati.on
3.06      Enrollments:  Despite a trebling of enrollment since 1960, the
enrollment in all types of secondary schools of 6,994 in 1967, estimated
as 10 percent of the 12-19 years age group, is inadequate when related to
the needs of the econony (Annexes 4 and 5). 64 percent of the students
attend 35 public schools; 36 percent attend 30 church schools. The
proportion of girls has now reached 24 percent , and is rising.
3.07      Some 75 percent of the total enrollment is in general secondary
schools; this predominance is, in the present Gabon context, justified
and will continue to be so for some time syice,.,in the restructured system,
the intake into the technical and teacher-training schools is drawn from
the general secondary schools and not directly from primary education
(Annex 1).
3.08      The teaching force of 4h7 (Annex 6) includes 299 French of
whom 194 are F.A.C. technical assistance teachers. The large majority
of the French are suitably qualified, but the turn-over of such teachers
is high. Most of the 11h Gabonese are qualified primary school teachers
or qualified workshop instructors. The public secondary schools on the
whole are well-staffed with competent teachers.
3.09      Student and staff accommodation:  The population spread,
communication difficulties and housing conditions have necessitated the
provision of hostel accommodation for about one third of the secondary
enrollment. The Government is atterapting to contain this drain on
expenditures by stricter application of its zoning policy whereby
students will attend as far as possible the schools nearest their homes.
Staff. housing has to be provided to attract qualified teachers, particu-
larly expatriates, to the small towns in the rural areas.
General Secondary Education
3.10      The 33 general secondary schools have a student population of
5,203. Output in 1966 was 369 B.E.P.C. and 46 Baccalauret holders. The
average size of 160 pupils makes the schools expensive to operate; the
small class groups in the top grades are especially uneconomic. Teacher-
pupil ratio is 1-17. The Government has acted wisely in rastricting
second cycle Grades 11 and 12 facilities to nine lycees, including the
four project schools, and then concentrating all successful Grade 12
students in two of these lycees.
3.11      The recent curricula reformi gives enriancocd importance to the
sciences and to practical work.  Tile public second.ary scliools, all built in
the last ten years out for small onrolLments, are inadequately equippced for
science and practical subjocts tcacihing. Toaching metlod.s are satisfactory
since thlc pradouincitly oxpatriate staff is for tlh most part adequately
qualified.

3.12      Drop-out  amounts to about 48% in the first cycle and about 30%
in the second cycle.  The examination pass rate for B.E.P.C. level has been
49%, and 43% for Baccalaureat.  In terms of the initial enrollment, the
examination pass rate is 26% at B.E.P.C.. and 30% at Baccalaureat.   These
unacceptably lo rates sh,ould improve as a result of measures already taken
(para. 3.23)> and could be further improved by making the system more
flexible, by more careful solection of students -by provi.sion af guidence
servicese and by ensuring a more stable teaching force (para. 3.08).
Technical Educetion and Vocational Training
3.13     Technical education, including commercial, is offered at three
levels (Annex 1) to 1000 students in 5 public and 2 private schools. With
F. E. ] grants, the Libreville Technical Lycee is being expanded to meet 1970
requirements.  Awards in 1966 numbered 12 B.E.I., 4 B.E<C., 129 C.A.P.
3.14     Fourteen apprenticeship centers give preliminary industrial training
to 420 youths; two home economics centers deal with-80 girls. These centers
are likaly to become the nuclei of the planned post-prim=ay ttermina1l schools
which are to offer two-year practical courses i-n agriculture .nd related
wopksLoe  ractice to older pritriy school leLwrers who faU  to gain secondary
scnoo plces.
3.15     A Polytechnic Institute was established in temporary quarters in
1964 under the auspices of the Fondation d'Enseignement Superieur dtAfrique
Centrale to train technicians at post-secondary level for Gabon, Chad,
Congo (Brazzaville) and the Central African Republic. The intake, hawever,
at the Baccalaureat level is not yet available and the Institute has operated
at a lower level. Eight Gabonese are enrolled.
3.16     The Mini.stry of Labour operates two accelerated training centers with
F.A.C., I.L.0,, and US AID financial and technical assistance. Both have
well-equipped workshops and offer courses in auto-mechanics, building construc-
tion, electricity and carpentry.  EnrolLments are 98, with about four appli-
cants for every place.
3.17     Other ministries provide training for nurses,n midwives and health
inspectors (136 trainees), for forestry (14), and for middle-level administra-
tive personnel (43). Two commercial training centers have been established
for office workers with I.L.0. and Peace Corps assistance.
Teacher Training
3.18     Primary school teacher training has been re-organized and up-graded.
As from 1966, training commences at Grade I1 with either a one-year profession-
al course offered in four centers to provide an output of 100 Grade II trained
teachers per annum, or a four-year general education and professional trainLno
course, Grades 11-14, at the Libreville Teachers' College, with a possible
output of 15-20 Grade I trained teachers (see para. 5.11). With Unesco and
Uaicef assistance a center was constructed and equipped to provide some basic
in-service training for unqualified teachers in batches of 50 over a 3-months
course.



- 6 -
3.19     AL-.ost all teac'her-trainers are expatriates.  Teaching methods and
curricula are satisfactory.
3.20     Secondary school teachers (28 scholars in 1967) are trained outside
Gabon, principally at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Abidjan and in French
universities.
Higher Education
3.21     At present there are no facilities in Gabon for higher studies.
There are 387 Gabonese students at upper secondary and post-secondary
institutions outside Gabon; they receive generous scholarships from the
Governnent or from bilateral and international sources (Annex 7).   The
scholarship program is not always in line with the manpower needs of the
country or rigorously controlled   It appears that many scholars do not return
to Gabon on completion of their studies.
Adult Education
3.22     Gabon has received assistance from Unesco to operate a radio
literacy and social program which in 1966 had 190 radio clubs and some
3,000 participants. The possibilities of educational radio and television
are to be explored by the Pedagogic Institute.
Secondary Level Education Development Targets for 1975
3.23     Enroilments:  Projected enrollments in 1975-76 in secondary level
education are 13,190 or 15.5'O of the 12-19 years age group, with 10,450 in
general secondary schools, 2,400 in technical and 340 in teacher training
(Annex 8).  This implies deceleration of the recent rate of growth, necessary
in view of the financial and teacher-supply implications of unplanned expan-
sion. The Governnent should considor applyi.n   tho S.E.DE E.S.1/ recmmendation
of limiting rocruitment int  Grade 7, and intensify its efforts to iiprovc
,u..lity =nd the floti of studonts t rough tb0 schools to roduca wa^.tQgc 2nd
repetition; thus augmenting enrolL-.nt by internal gro.vth, incroesing output
and relucing per graduate costs. To tlhis ond stops hwve becon taken; as frora
1970 tho excxLination barrier between Grades 7 and 8 will be rernovred and mean-
ulile renedial neasures cre being applied in Grade 7.
3.24     Proportionately the greatest increase in enrollments will be in the
technical field. * ith F.E.D. grants the Libreville Technical Lycee is being
expanded to meet 1970 requirements. Plans are being formulated for develop-
ments in the early seventies in the other technical schools and for relocating
some of these in the light of proposed regional developments. The terminal
schools (para. 3.1.W will give basic agricultu-ral and workshop training to
adolescents in' tho rural areas.  F.A.C. is being requested to assist wiîth
these.

3.25    The Forestry School at Cap SsterJas is to be expanded from its present
enrollment of 14 to 48 with output at secondary and post-secondary level.
Assistance is being sought from France, Germany and the UNDP jointly. The
Agricultural School at d'Oyem is to be revived but plans for this are not yet
formulated.  The improved and expanded output of the technical schools and
of the general secondary schools should provide a more satisfactory intake for
the Polytechnic Institute for which F.A.C. assistance has been sought, and for
the Forestry and Agricultural schools.
3.26    Outputs: By 1971, about 2,600 students would be enrolled in Grade 7
of the first cycle of the secondary general schools. Some 800 would transfer
after two years to the technical schools and another 800 would enter employment
during the course, leaving about 1,000 to qualify for the B.E.P.C. in 1975
(Annex 9). The B.E.PoC. holders wqould be channelled into various courses in
second cycle institutions of the Ministries of Education, Agriculture, Forestry
and Health and some directly into jobs.
3.27    The 1972-73 enrollment in Grade 11, the first year of second cycle
general secondary education, would be 600. These would provide an output in
1975 of some 250 (200 Gabonese) baccalaureates who may proceed to higher
education or go into jobs directly. About 350 of the initial enrollnent
would leave school during the course for training or employment in the govern-
ment service or the private sector.
3.28    Staff requirements: Primary school staff requirements, for the
projected enrollment in 1975 of 100,000, at a teacher-student ratio of 1:40,
are 2,500 of whom 1,655 would be trained teachers (Annex 10).
3.29    Gradual Gabonization of the secondary school teaching force and coping
with secondary school expansion teacher needs entail the formulation, vigorous
implementation and rigorous control of a fellowship program for secondary
school teacher training. Assuming that the target in 1975 is 40% of the
teaching force to be Gabonese as compared with 25% today, Gabon would have to
train 200 teachers of the appropriate disciplines by 1975. This estimate
assumes, also, that the number of French technical assistance and contract
teachers would increase from the present 300 to 380 in 1975. To achieve a
target of 40% Gabonese by 1975 and commencing the fellowships program in
September, 1968, Gabon proposes to award an average of 30 fellowships per year
for a two-year teacher training course for prospective first-cycle secondary
school teachers, and 10 a year at universities or equivalent institutions for
preparation of second cycle secondary and technical schoolsi teachers. The
alternative is reliance on the availability of increased numbers of technical
assistance teachers and appointment of increased numbers of costly contract
teachers.

4. FINANCING AID COSTS OF EDUCATION
Cpital and Recurrent E4penditures
4.01     Total expenditures on education and training in 1966 amounted to
CFAF 3020 million made up as f ollows:
Capital           Recurrent,            Total
Source           CFAF millions      CFAF millions         CFAF millions
Gabon                 173                1,487                1,660
French Aid            400                 430                   830
F.E.D. and other
foreign aid          400                  130                  530
Total       973               2v047                3,020
4.02     Foreign aid thus amounted to $5.5 million of the total of $12.2
million.  This aid provides mainly for construction and equipment of schools,
teachers and advisers, and scholarships for studios outside Gahon.   Although
capital contributions are quantitatively the more irmiportantg forming 55% of
the total foreign aid, the technical assistance is more crucial. WLithout it,
the secondary schools could not operate. Salaries for F.A.C. personnel are
about $12,000 per man-year for civilian teachers, and $4,000 f r military
draftaes serving as volunteers.  The Gabonese salary contribution to be
deducted from these figures is about $2,400, but a sum of about $3,000 must
be added for housing and other benefits furnished by Gabon.
4.03     In the period 1960-1967 Gabonese budget allocations to education
increased by more than l50%, but have decreased as a percentage of the budget
from 15.6% in 1960 to 13.1% in 1966, with the beginnings of an upward rise
again in 1967 to 13.7% (Annex 12). In terms of GDP there has been a steady
rise from 2.4% in 1960 to 3.0% in 1966, and the appropriation for 1967 is
3.3%. This effort is the most impressive of all French-speaking African
countries.
4.04     An analysis of the education and training appropriations for 1966
is given in Annex 12.  Excluding foreign aid recurrent expenditures amount
to CFAF 1487 million and capital expenditures to CFAF 173 million, or 15.8% of
the recurrent and 5.5% of the investment budget respectively.
4.05     In 1966, CFAF 1378 million or 93% of the CFAF 14887 million governmrent
recurrent expenditures were chcnnelled through the Ministry of Education, and
7% through other ministries (Annex 12). The contribution of private enter-
prises (in the form of an apprenticeship tax) to the budget ainounted to about
CFAF 25 million. The rural communities spent CFAF 12 million on the repair
and maintenance of their primary schools.



-9-
MXinistry of Educzton :- t';ires
4.06     The Ministry of Education meets the capital and recurrent expendi-
tures of all public schools.  Recently it took over the salary costs of
private education and also makes subventions for other expenditures. Education
is free at all primary and secondary schools.   In addition, all Gabonese
entering secondar-y schools, public or private, receive cash grants, and those
living away from home are either accommiodated free in hostels or receive a
cash living allowance subject to successful performance.   This echolarship
system is to be revieiçed in view of the financial buxden the planned
expansion of secondary education would impose.
4.07     Ni.nistry of Education recurrent expenditures in 1966 were allocated:
52% for primary education, 27% for secondary general, 4% for teacher-training,
10%s for technical and 7% for administration and other charges. The alloca-
tions to secondary level education are high in relation to the number of
students enrolled at this level due to the scholarship system, provision of
hostels, expensive foreign teachers and uneconomic small school units.
Expenditures for buildingst maintenance and for supplies of instructional
materials are inadequate and should be increased even though minor maintenance
works in the rural primary schools are the responsibility of the local
communities.
4.08     Capital expenditures on education have amounted to some CFAF 2.5
billion since independence in 1960, but 83% of this sum has been financed
by foreign sources.  The domestic budgetary efforts of CFAF 173 and 187
million reported for 1966 and 1967 respectively are in each case tlhree times
the expenditures of 1965. Gabon is applying more of its domestic funds in
absolute and relative terms to investmient in education.
Future Expenditure Levels
4-o9     To estimate 1iînistry of Education recurrent expenditures in 1975,
tile follotrng assumptions are made: (i) enrollments of 100,000 in primary
and 13,190 in second level education; (ii) 66%o of teachers in primary schools
trained; (iii) progressive Gabonization of the secondary schools' teaching
force, and teacher-student ratios as shown in Annex 8; (iv) the total
expenditures on scholarships within Gabon increase by 88% over present
expenditures, wlhich is the percentage projected growth of enrollment in
secondary education; (v) improved provisions for school maintenance, equip-
ment and instructional materials.
4.10     On these assumiptions the recurrent budget of the Ministry of
Education would be of the order of CFAF 2750 million as comnpared with CFAF
1378 million in 1966 (Annex 12). This means an average real increase of
8.0% per annumr, compared with 7.5% per annun in the period 1960-1966. Gabon
should be able to sustain this rate of increase. The estimated 1975 recurrent
expenditure would represent 3.4% of the estimated GDP of CFAF 80.9 billion as
ccmpared with 2.5% of 1966 - for Niriistry of Education expenditures only -
and about 15% of the estimated total governrent recurrent expenditure budget.
Foreign aid to Ministry of Education recurrent expenditures in 1975 would
amount to about CFAF 650 million assuming that 220 FAC technical assistance
teachers were made available.

5. THE NEED FCR THE PROJECT
Human Resources Develoeient Needs
5.01     The Iabor Force:   In 1965, 43,500 (39,900 males and 3,600 females)
were emDloyed in the modern sector, mostly concentrated at Libreville, Port
Gentil and the mining centers.  The foreign labor force amounted to 5,100
of whom 2,200 were French. The labor force in mid-1966 was estimated at
46>5000
5.02     Analysis of the labor force (Annex 13) shows that the percentage
of foreigners increases sharply in the upper levels of skills, the increase
being more marked in the private sector than the public. The distribution
of the labor force among sectors of economic activity is shotkm in Annex 14.
5.03     Needs: Economic projections for Gabon for 1975 give a GDP figure of
CFAF 80.9 billion which means an average annual growth rate of 4.3% for the
period 1966-1975. Assuming an overall annual productivity increase of 1.3%,
this would require in the modern sector a labor force of 61,000 in 1975, or
an increase of 14,500 over 1966. Assuming that foreign labor recruiitment
increases at 4% per annum and local labor at 3% then about 2,200 of the
additional labor force would be foreigners and 12,300 Gabonese.
5.04     It may then be considered (Annex 15) that 8,500 of the additional
Gabonese workers would require some type of secondary or higher education anci
training or up-grading qualification to take up jobs as skilled workers,
supervisory staff, technicians, and junior and senior executives in the various
branches of economic activity.  The main sources from which domestic skilled
manpower is to be developed are (i) the second level education systemi, (ii)
the accelerated training centers and (iii) the part-tine and on-.the-job
trainiing of workers.
5.05     The estimated additional mmpower needs shown above do not Liclude
the requirements of the education system itself for 1400 additional qualified
teachers (Annexes 8 and 10)o   This gives a total of some 10,000 additional
workers requiring some secondary or higher education and training level
qualification.
5.06     The present secondary school system with its limited output could
not satisfy the needs for skilled manpowier and the intake requirements into
further education and training; nor is the expansion planned for 1975 (paras.
3.23-3.25) expected to make good all the shortages over this short period.
The build-up of the education system can niove forward only in terms of the
existing and potential availability of financial and human resources.
5.07     The inability of the system to rmeet the estimated additional
requiremients during 1966-1975 is shown in the following table:



- il -
(i) Estimated additional skieled personnel required           10,000
(ii)  Estimaated output at B.E.P.C. level  (Annex 9)    7,000
(iii) Estimated output of technical schools and
vocational centers                             3,000
10,000
Deduct output at B.E.P.C. levels stili under
full-time tuition in 1975                      2,800  J.00
Deficit                      2,80o
1/ This includes those B.E.P.C. holders who in the period go on to complete
post-first cycle secondary levels of any type of education or training
based on the B.E.P.C.
If exploitation of the newly-discovered iron-ore deposits (para. 2004) is
started in the near future, the consequent economic developmelnt would widen
this manpower gap, as would any circuistance adversely affecting recruitment
of foreign skilled workers.
5.08     The bottleneck to meeting manpower needs is the secolidary school
system. Since expansion of technical, agr .clltural, forestry, commercial
and medical education and training facilities at craft, teclmician and
professional levels depends on adequate output at Grades 8, 10 and 13 of the
general secondary school, it is necessary to expand general secondary facili-
ties and ensure greater and improred output.  The present educational plans
(1965-70) therefore aim at providing a suitable base for cons derably increas-
ing output in the secondary schools in the middle and later seventies. The
system will steadily move away from meeting mainly the immediate needs of
the education and training system to supplying qualiiied workers directly to
the econony.  Improved and expanded accelerated training centers will make a
more immediate impact in providing semi-skilled rriorkers in greater nuimbers as
from 1969, all of whom could be available for up-grading courses in trades
essential to the economy. The workshops and instructors of these and other
schools would also be used for out-of-school up-grading courses.
The Educational Need
5.09     The main problem in primary education is that of poor productivity
combined with high cost. Improving efficiency would reduce costs; smoother
flow of students through the primary school iyould imnprove retention rates
and thus eliminate expenditures caused-by students taking on average 8.2
years to complete a 6-year course.  Better qualified output should follow from
curriculum revision relevant to the needs of Gabon, improving instructional
aids and experimenting with new media such as educational radio and television,
and from up-grading unqualified practising teachers. The Pedagogic Institute
is intended to deal with these aspects of improvement.



- 12 -
5.10      The most direct approach to the problem of inefficiency, however,
is to provide the schoo s with qualified teachers.  Raising the proportion
of trained teachers from 26 percent to 66 percent by 1975 is a realistic
and necessary target achievable by expanding teacher training for an
output of about 180 annually (Annex 10).  The teachers would need to be
more highly educated and training methods brought up-to-date.
5.11      Re-organization and up-grading programs are already in operation.
Henceforward, about 100 Grade II trained teachers annually will enter the
schools from 4 small teacher training centers. They will have had at least
10 years of education before receiving a one-year professional course as
compared with the past practice of a two-year general and professionai course.
or none at all, after 6 yecrs of primary education. In addition, an even more
highly educated and trained elite group of 20 Grade I teachers, increasing to
40-45, annually will receive a 4-year course of second-cycle secondary education
and professional training. This corps is now being educated and trained at
the Teacherst College in Libreville in temporary, non-functional, ill-equipped
buildings. The provision of suitably equipped accommodation ranks as the
highest priority of educational needs. Another h0 Grade II teachers will
become available annually from the existing program for up-grading of un-
qualified teachers (Annex 10).
5.12      The pressing need for secondary school expansion has been explained
above (para. 5.04, et seq). Equally urgent is the provision of facilities
for application of a more balanced curriculum in which skills are learned
by practical application.  Laboratories, workshops, special subjects rooms
and libraries are urgently needed as additions to existing secondary schools
if they are to provide a modern education and produce graduates of higher
quality.  The provision of such teaching spaces would also add to the
capacity of the schools.
5.13      The two vocational training centers recruit from all over the
country. As no hostel accommodation is provided, students live in lodgings
where facilities for study are often non-existent; nor have the centers
areas where the students may retire during free time in the school day to
read or to study. A smaill library open during the day and evenings at each
of the centers would help meet the need.
5.14    -The proiect submitted to the Bank (Chapter 6)   in conjunction with
other on-going and proposed projects (paras. 3.24-3.255, cannot immediately
meet all the needs referred to above, but it aims at providing a sound base
for future development consistent with economic and social plans. The quality
of the primary school output, improved by raising teachers' standards, should
provide a better secondary school input. Improved and expanded secondary
school education will better meet labor markot needs, both directly and after
further training of output in specialized institutions.

6. THE PROJECT
General
6.01    The p.oposed project, at a total estimated cost of CFAF 889 million
or US $3.6 ni.lion equivalent, with the foreign exchange component estimated
at US $2.28 million, would comprise construction and equipment ofs
(i)  a primary teacher-training college at Libreville for 240 students'
with boarding capacity for 180 students and four staff houses,
and with an annexed application primary school for 360;
(ii)  a lycee at Port Gentil for 510 students and two staff houses;
(iii) expansion of three lycees, Franceville, NtDende and Oyemn9 for a
total enrollment of 1550 and six staff houses;
(iv) minor extensions to the two accelerated vocaticnal training
centers at Libreville and Port Gentil for an enrollment of l35Q^
(v) technical assistance;
and    (vi) fellowships required for the efficient operation of the project
schools at (i), (ii) and (iii) above.
6.02    Estimated project costs, by type of education, and enrollments are
shown below:

- 14 -
add 1690 new places by increas4.ng the capacity of the project schools from
about 1110 in 1967 to about 2800 in 1975. To ensure that the development of
the project schools conforms to the national and regional educational needs and
is consistent with the proposed schedules of accommodation, the enrollment
structure will be in line with the schedule in Annex 16.
6.04    Construction would include 39 classrooms, 10 laboratories, 6 demon-
stration laboratories, 4 workshops, 10 special subject rooms and 7 libraries
(kAnex 17). These figures include some existing spaces which are to be re-
modelled, In the teacherst college and each lycee, one teaching space at
least would have facilities for visual aids and allowance is also made for
possible introduction of educational television.
6.05    The required seven sites are acquired and are satisfactory. The
location of the project schools accords with the geographic distribution of
the population and the national and regional needs on which the secondary
education zoning policy is based (see Map).
6.06    Equipnent and furniture lists have been reviewed and are satisfactory
in scale, and estimated costs are reasonable.
6.07    Recurrent expenditures of the project schools in 1975 would be CFAF
290 million or 8% of the education recurrent budget. Gabon should be able to
meet these expenditures and also its share of the capital expenditures of the
proposed project.
Elements of the Project
6.08    The Teachers' College: The highest priority has been accorded to the
supply of higher quality teachers in sufficient numbers to improve the
qualified teacher ratio in the primary schools from the present 26% to 66% by
1975 (see paras. 5.11 and 5.12). The existing Teacherst College has an
enrollment of 58. There were 100 candidates in 1966 for the 25 places.
Intake and performance are limited by the inadequacies of the temporary build-
ings. Intake in the new College would be 60 in 1969 and level off at 80 in
1970; enrollment in 1974 would be 240 with an output of 40-45 Grade I teachers.
The increasing output at B.E.P.C. level and the recently improved teachers'
salaries assure the required intake. It is planned to increase enrollment of
girls from 2 as at present to 40 or more by 1973.
6.09    The revised curriculum of the Teachers' College satisfactorily com-
bines academic, practical and professional studies.  In addition to the
regular course, students would spend two months in each of two of the long
vacations in more advanced workshop instruction in the Technical Lycee. Other
short courses and extra-curricular activities are so planned as to ensure
that the graduates are equipped to assume community development responsibili-
ties. Teaching practice and observation and demonstration lessons would be
organized in the application primary school and in other primary schools. The
application school would also serve as a model and experimentation school.

6.10     Some trainees may reach Baccalaureat academic standards. The besu
of these who have the aptitude may go on to a higher teacher-training insti-
tution to qualify as first-cycle secondary school teachers.
6.11     The cost of the new college is estimated at US $0.99 million with a
foreign exchange component of about US $0.57 million. F.A.C. would provide
such additionc-l teachers as .re nacossary from foreign sources. Annex 18
shows the additional teacher needs for the proposed expansion.
6.12     General Secondaiy Educationa:  The estimated cost of this project itera
is $1.14 million inc1uding a fdreign cxcbinge component of $0.81.   To fulfil
their role in the oducation devclopmncnt programo, three of the four project
lycoes require additional acco.rm,iod.tion.  At present they 'havo inadequato
classroon rnd administration arei-s and badly designed, ill-equipped labora-
tories. Tlhe addition of labaratories and workshops would permit application
of tLe. better-balancod, revised curriculum vhllich includos workstop practice
and practical science learning. Annex 17 givos dotc-ils of the facilities
needed at each school to make gcod these deficiencies and provide for the
planned expansion or each.
6.13     However, since the Port Gentil Lycea would require expensive
rehabilitation for secondary school usage, the Governnient accepted the mis-
sion's reconmendation to build a new lycee on a new site. The existing
school adjoins a heavily-overcrawded primary school. The continuous growth
of Port Gentil makes primary school places an urgent necessity which can be
provided by the present secondary school building when vacated.
6.14     Intake into the schools is assured froin the primary school output
of the catchment area.  Intake into the second cycle is assured from satellite
first cycle secondary schools on a regional zoning basis. Large
numbers of students would have to find accommodation as they do naw with
relatives and other famUilies, since existing hostel accommodation is
insufficient - the governnent is advisedly restricting further commitments.
6.15     Earollments in the first cycle of the project lycees would in
1974-1975 be 17%, and in the second cycle 44%., of the total planned elroll-
ment of: general secondary education.  The qualified annual output at the
first cycle level of the project lycees would rise from an estimated 80 in
1967 to an estimated 240 in 1975, or 25% of the total output at this level.
There would be no output at the Baccalaureat level as the project lycees are
not plamned to offer the third year (Grade 13) of the second cycle course,
but they should provide an output of 150 students qualified to move into the
centralized Grade 13 facilities at Libreville, or 50% of the planned input.
6.16     None of the project lycees -iiould have a classical stream, and a
second foreign language (other than French) would be introduced only in tne
second cycle. In the second cycle, too, the lycees would adopt only the
science curriculum. Su.cb. measures av-rt uneconomic fragmentation of the
class groups, and also ensure a supply of niatliematics-science oriented
students for jobs and for further technological and scientific studies to
increase Gabonese participation in the economic developinent of the country.

6.17    The Accelerated TranuinL_Location.il Centers:  The Libreville
Vocational Training Center proposes to offer a course in auto-body repair for
15 students annually. lhe equipment is available from FAC sources; the
construction and furnishing of the workshop is included in the project. In-
addition, both the Libreville and Port Gentil centers need a library to com-
plete their accamoodation requirements (para. 5.14). Total cost would be
about US $60000 with a foreign exclange component of US $30,000.
6.18    The Fellowship Program: The need to build up a Gabonese secondary
school teaching force has been explained in para. 3.29. The fellowship item
would assist Gabon in financing the program formulated for this purpose. -
Between September, 1968 and August, 1972, 78 trainees would be awarded two-
year fellowships at a secondary schoolst teacher-training establishment outside
Gabon. The estimated cost at $29500 per man-year would be $390,000. These
teachers would be available to take over from the qualified teachers supplied
to the project schools by FAC under its present technical assistance programo
6.19    The Technical Assistance Component: The technical assistance
component of the project applies to tlhe key personnel required to ensure
effective and efficient teaching$ supervision and guidance in the Teacherst
College and the four lycees. During 1968-1972 the schools would be expanding
rapidly at the same time as the revised curricula are to be applied inten-
sively.  The physical and pedagogic difficulties need to be handled by
experienced educators and administrators. The young, qualified Gabonese
teachers need more experience before they can ta-ae over the direction of the
project schools. F.A.Co would provide adviser-principals who would help train
their future replacements. Teclnical assistance is, therefore, included in
the project for 5 adviser-principals at 20 man-years. The new orientations
and content of the professional courses at the Teacherst College-also require
high quality teacher-trainers; this would caU for three teacher-trainers
(education subjects), 12 man-years, and 1 Head of the Maths-Science Department
and 1 Head of the Language-Social Studies Department-, 8 man-yearse Cost of
these key personnel is calculated at $18>000-per man-year; or $720,000 for
40 man-years over the period September, 1968-August, 1972.  The cost at
$18,000 per man-year is higher than the present cost (para. 4.02) to alaow
for a possible increase in costs of technical assistancee and because-the key
personnel referred to would be a group of more experienced and highly-
qualified educators than the qualified teachers provided under the normal FAC
technical assistance program to the project schools.

The Government of Gabon is providing the sites without cost to the project.
6.21    The construction cost estimates for the proposed project have been
derived from recent building experience and are based upon gross building ccst.
per square meter in Libreville and Port Gentil. Each category of building il
the project was analysed and the costs adjusted to take account of modifica-
tions and necessary improvements. The cost of buildings and equipment in thle
interior regions was adjusted upward depending upon accessibility and trars-
portation costs; this additional charge is shown in the cost estimates



as the local cost adjustzient elcmacrit. An average price incroase allowance of
7%. based on recent trends (para. 6.27), should cover the anticipated rise in
building costs during the iniplementation period. A further 10% has been
allowed for unforeseen construction and site development costs; that is, there
is a total contingency allowance of 17% of the construction costs excluding
professional fees and technical assistance. A similar provision of 17% is made
to cover possible increases in the cost of furniture and equipmente
6.22    Schedules of accommodation follow economic space standards and are
consistent with functional needs. Capital costs (excluding contingencies, site
development and professional fees) per student place are considered reasonable
in the Gabon context at $1,270 for the TeachersÎ College, $320 for the applica-
tion primary school, $550 for the new general secondary school, and $1,240 for
each student hostel place.
6.23    The foreign exchange component of $2.28 million is 63% of the total
project cost and is estimated at 55% of construction, 25% of site development$
35% of furniture, 100% of equipment, 65% of professional fees, 66% of technica'
assistance, and 100% of fellowships.
Construction
6.24    General:  Recent construction in Libreville has been cf reasonably
good standard. structurally and architecturally. Howevere the standard of
school construction varies widely. There are no building by-lawsp but certain
principles are recommended by the Town Planning Department in matters of
safety and hygiene. Architectural and engineering practices follow acceptable
procedures based upon the French system.
6.25    Almost all building materials are imported, and the landed costs are
high; costs are higher in the interior regions because of high transportation
charges. The extraction of timber has so far been for export and restricted to
ok2ume. Extraction and processing of other woods more suitable for structural
purposes in building is limited.
6.26    There is a shortage of building skills; during peak construction
periods additional needs were supplied by neighboring countries. In general
the efficiency and output of local labor is comparatively low, a contributing
factor to the relatively high construction costs.
6.27    Contracting firmsns  The larger firms are usually foreign-based with
registered subsidiaries in Gabon; most local firms are "jobbing" builders.  The
12 large firms, mostly French, engaged in the building trade appear to be
technically competent and reasonably well-equipped. The increase in building
activity and in construction costs following Independence has now slowed down,
and the industry should have no difficulty in meeting the requirements of the
proposed project. If this trend continues, construction prices should remain
reasonably stable except for the average yearly increase of about 3% as in the
past few years, and keener competitive bidding of contractors can be expected.
6.28    Professional services:  Until recently the Ministry of Public Works was
primarily interested in roads and bridges; now it also handles public buildings,
but is equipped to undertake only minor architectural studies.



- 19 -
Private experLenced architectes are employed for la.rge scale projects, with the
Miniistry dealing competently with supervision, tendering and contract awards.
A similar procedure will be followed for the project.
6.29    The two private architectural firms in the countryç both French»
appear qualified.  One firm has had considerable experience on the west coast
of Africa, and it has recently designed classrooms for the Miinistry of
Education which are functional and ecor.omical.
6.30    Tendering and Contract AwardsO  Tendering is normally public; it is
advertisedii~In thelcal press and radio and conmxnLicated to the embassies in
cases of international bidding. RBds are considered by a special corrnittee
set up by decree; usually the lowast evaluated bîd is accepted. The governnent
would invite international bidding for the supply of ail equipment and furni-
ture and for the construction of the schools in the proposed project.
6.31    Operation and Maintenance:  The schools in the project proposed for
extensions are of simple design and durable construction, but the maintenance
and upkeep of premises is not always satisfactory. Funds for maintenance of
school buildings are centrally controlled by the Ministry of Education, a
system which leads to unreasonable delays in executing urgent repairs. Prin-
cipals of schools, acting through the local executive engineers of the Ministry,r
of Works, could be delegated authority to proceed with minor, urgent repairs
out cf funds allocated annually to the school budget for this purposeo
Assurances have been obtained from the governmnent that, the recurrent expenditure
vote for the project schools will contain annual provision of funds for
maintenance equal to at least le5% of their construction costs, as weil as for
efficient operation of the schools.
Imlemuentation
6.32    A special administrative unit, under the over-all control of the
Ministry of Planning5 will be established to supervise the execution of the
projecto The members of this unit will include an experienced and competent
architect or engireer from the Ministry of Public Works;, an educator know-
ledgeable in school construction and administration from the Ministry of
Education, and an official experienced in the procedures of accounting and
auditing, The architect and the educator of this unit would have to be
acceptable to the Bank.
6.33    The consulting architectural firm selected would be responsible for the
supervision and certification of contractorgs bills. Constant superintendence
of the works would be provided by the Ministry of Public Works. Trie project
unit would coordinate the field activities of the Mlxistry of Public Wlorks and
the normal architectural services furnished by the consulting architectural
firm.
Disbursements
6.34    The estimated project cost is $3.60 million; Bank-Gabon financing is
estimated at $2.88 million for Schedule A items - construction, site



- 20 -
preparation, professional focs, local cost advstnientS followsrhips, furniture,
equipment and contingencies; F.A.C.-Gabon financing is estimated at $0.72
million for Schedule B items, that is. technical assistance (para. 6.20).
6.35    A Bank loan of $1.8 million would represent 50% of the total estimated
project cost, or 63% of Schedule A costs. It would cover the estimated foreign
exchange component of Schedule A. The Bank would disburse or reimburse
(i) 100% of foreign exchange costs for equipment and fellowshipsq and (ii) on
a percentage basis for civil works, professional fees and furniture of
Schedule A. However, should actual expenditure exceed the present cost estimate
the percentage for reimbursement of (ii) would be revised downward so that
disbursements would spread throughout the implementation period to coincide
with the completion of the project. Funds not disbursed at the completion of
the project would be available for cancellation.
6.36    The funds of Schedule A would be disbursed over a four-year period
(Annexes 20 and 21). Schedule B disbursements would start in September 1968
and should be completed in August 1972 (Annex 20)o

7.01    Recent economic performance and the potential of the econony
necessitate a greater supply and better quality of Gabonese personnel for
middle and higher level posts (paras. 5.03.5.08). The bottleneek to meeting
qualified manpower needs has been the inadequacies of the secondary school
system (paras. 3.11-313, 3021, 5.08).
7.02    Implementation of education development programs has begun with measures
affecting enrollments, flows, the structure and the curricula (paraso 3>10-3.11,
3.23, 5.09). During negotiations the Governnent agreed: (i) to consider con-
trolling secondary school expansion to the planned target figures through
application of stricter selective intake measures (para. 3.23); (ii) to review
the internal scholarship program (para. 4.06), and (iii) to control the enroll=
ment structure of the project schools (para. 6.03).
7.03    The project is designed to reinforce the qualitative developmentsp and
also the planned physical developments. The quality of the secondary school
intake and output would be improved, the output increased, the unit costs
reduced. The required intake into secondary education is assured and the output
can be absorbed (paras. 3.26-3.27, 5.06-5.08 and 6.14).
7.04    The project teachers' coIlege would permit implementation of measures
to expand and improve primary teacher-training (paras. 6.08 and 6.09). A
program is to be implemented as from September, 1968 to ensure an adequate
secondary school teacher supply, in view of the uncertainty of obtaining a
greatly expanded foreign supply (paras. 3.29, 6.18)o
7.05    The project lycees need to be expanded, modernized and equipped in
accordance with their role in the education development program and also for
the effective application of the reformed curricula (paras. 5.13, 6.12).
School design, schedules of accommodation, equipment and furniture lists are
adequate for the purpose, and estimated costs are reasonable (paras. 6.06 and
6.22).
7.06    Ail sites have been acquired and are satisfactory.  The location of the
project schools accords with the population distribution (para. 6e05).
7.07    Bank financing would be applied to the Schedule A items of the project
as defined in para. 6.34; French financing to the technical assistance item
which FAC has agreed to provide. The Gabon share of the project costs and the
recurrent expenditures generated by the project can be met by the government
(para. 6.07).
7.08    International competitive bidding procedures would be followed (para.
6.30).
7.09    Assurances have been obtained on the following matters on which the
successful implementation of the project depends:



- 22 -
(i) the ava-lahilty ft- frmn F,,A.C. or other sources of the
addit_onal. teacXer requireî1ents for the projcet schools
(para. 6.11 and 6.18);
(ii) the allocation of funds for the proper maintenance and
operation of the schools (para. 6.31);
(iii) employment of an experienced private architectural firmy
acceptable to the Bank, as consulting architects (para. 6.28);
(iv)  appointment of a project director and a government architect/
engineer acceptable to the Bank, with supporting staff for
administration. supervision, procurement and accounting (para.
6.32).
7elO    The project provides a suitable basis for a loan of US $1.8 million
for 25 years, including a grace period of 10 years.
