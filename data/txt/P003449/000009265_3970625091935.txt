MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
AND THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN OF $45 MILLION
AND A rROPOSED CREDIT OF SDR 78.9 MILLION
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A SHANGHAI SEWERAGE PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan of US$45 million and a
proposed development credit of SDR 78.9 million (US$100 million equivalent)
to China is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be for 20 years
including five years grace, at standard variable interest rate, and the
credit would be on standard IDA terms, and would help finance a sewerage
project in the municipality of Shanghai.
2.        Background.  About 37% of China's roughly one billion population
lives in cities and towns, with 57 cities having populations exceeding one
million, 267 cities having 50,000 to one million people, and 7,511 towns
having up to 50,000 people. Rapid urban growth, estimated to be 4 to 6%
p.a. in recent years, has been largely caused by a steady migration of
surplus farm workers to nearby market towns and cities due to increased farm
efficiency from the economic reform started in 1979. It is estimated that
the urbanization level in China could reach 50% by the year 2000, with a
large part of this occurring in the large and medium-sized cities, where job
opportunities are better. Shanghai, located near the mouth of the
Changjiang (Yangtze River), is China's largest and most highly
industrialized municipality, with an urban population of over 7 million in
the city districts, and another 6 million in its rural counties. With only
1.2% of the country's population the municipalicy contributes 10.6% of its
gross industrial output. The municipality, known for its dynamism, is
experiencing serious pressure in urban population expansion which it is
trying very hard to control.   Shanghai suffers from serious lack of urban
services, in particular services for environmental pollution control, due to
neglect in the past, when the bulk of its resources was diverted for
industrial development. Industries have, until recently, been allowed to
discharge their effluents with little or no treatment into local water
courses. Widespread pollution has been caused by this and by increasing
pollution load from domestic wastewater discharge due to higher incomes,
population increase and a shift from the traditional bucket system for human
excreta disposal to a water-borne system. Polluted environmental conditions
have seriously affected the living conditions of the people and Shanghai's
image in the international trading community. Because of the importance of
Shanghai's economy to the country, both the Central Government and the
Municipal Government of Shanghai are placing great importance to the
improvement of environmental conditions of the city through this project.
3.        The Ministry of Urban and Rural Construction and Environmental
Protection (MURCEP) is the central agency providing overall guidance to the
local governments on matters concerning the planning and programming of



-2-
investments for all works in cities and towns, including sewerage.
Provinces and municipalities, such as Shanghai, are responsible for works in
cities and towns under their jurisdiction, executed through various
provincial or municipal commissions and bureaus. The central Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), while administratively part of MURCEP, reports
directly to the State Council. The EPA sets national environmental
standards and provides guidance and supervision to provincial/municipal
environmental protection bureaus.
4.        Project Obiectives.  The project aims at improving environmental
conditions of the city through physical works to remove and appropriately
dispose of wastewater, and to set up an appropriate institutional framework,
encompassing organizational, financial, technical and legislative matters,
for management of liquid wastes and for environmental protection. It would
also provide a model to demonstrate the policies and measures needed to
resolve the rapidly growing issue of environmental pollution in large cities
in China.
5.        Project Description.  The project is the first stage of an
environmental improvement program (estimated total investment of about $1
billion) needed to resolve the environmental pollution problem of the city.
The project would address the worst polluted areas along Suzhou Creek, a
tributary of the Huangpu River, in the northern half of tne city containing
central commercial districts, industrial areas and dense residential areas
with an estimated population of about 3 million people. It includes the
construction of a link and intercepting sewer system to collect and
transport wastewater in the project area to the estuary of the Changjiang
for disposal. Project elements consist of a 35 km long trunk intercepting
sewer (3m to 4m dia. and twin 4.25m x 3.5m box section), 32 km of link
sewers (0.45m to 3m dia.), two pump stations on the intercepting sewer and
eight pump stations on the link sewers, a screening plant and 2.6 km of
outfall tunnels (twin 3.5m dia.). The second stage project, planned to be
started in 1991, would provide the remain_ng works for the City's wastewater
disposal. Although the physical works of the second stage can be
independently constructed, the systems in the two stages may be linked
eventually to facilitate operation. The project will also provide
assistance to carry out the following four project-related studies: (i) a
management and organization study to determine organizational and staffing
needs for the Shanghai Sewerage Company (SSC); (ii) a sewerage tariff study
to determine sewerage charges required for SSC to achieve its financial
objectives, with due coasidbration given to consumer affordability; (iii) a
river basin management study of the Huangpu River for the purpose of setting
up the institutional framework for water resources allocation and waste
discharge control in the region; and (iv) a sewer system study to examine
economic ways of rehabilitating the existing aging combir.ed sewer system in
Shanghai. A comprehensive training program for SSC staff and staff
responsible for project implementation, to be carried out over a period of
four years, is also included.
6.        Rationale for Bank/IDA Involvement.  Environmental pollution
control and large scale sewerage development works are new fields in China.
The proposed project includes major construction work to relieve serious
water pollution conditions in Shanghai. The project also encompasses the
complex tasks of establishing a self-financing sewerage enterprise and



-3-
developing for it rules and guidelines for efficient operation, and of
developing the institution and the measures required to imanage the water
resources in the city's waterways, all of which China has little experience
in. Successful implementation of the project would also provide a model for
liquid waste management which can be emulated by other cities in China.
Bank/IDA experience and technical assistance can provide the necessary
expertise to guide and support this work. The proposed project is large and
has complex technical problems requiring external expertise which the
Bank/IDA can assist to provide.
7.        Agreed Actions.  Shanghai Municipality (SM) has already completed
the following actions: (a) implementation of sewerage charges of Y 0.12/m3
for all commercial and industrial users in the city commencing December 1,
1986; (b) signing of the charter by the Shanghai Municipal Authorities for a
sewerage enterprise, the Shanghai Sewerage Company (SSG) to be operated on a
financially viable basis. SM has agreed on the following additional
actions: (a) registration of the SSC, which would complete the formal
process of establishing it as an enterprise, as a condition of loan/credit
effectiveness; (b) conducting of a management and organization study for SSC
and to develop for it appropriate management, financial and accounting
systems; (c) continuing to levy sewerage charges on commercial and
industrial users, conducting of a sewerage tariff study to propose
appropriate tariffs required for SSC's financial viability and to provide
incentives for industrial users to pretreat their effluents, and to charge
tariffs on all users to meet, not later than 1993, all operating and
maintenance expenses and the larger of either depreciation or total debt
service; (d) passing of new water pollution control regulations and sewer
regulations, and conducting of the Huangpu River basin managerTnent study to
achieve better water allocation and waste discharge control in the region;
(e) resettlement of persons affected by the project to be carried out in a
manner and according to a schedule satisfactory to the Bank/IDA; (f)
consultants satisfactory to the Bank/IDA to be engaged on a continuous basis
to advise on detailed design, preparation of contract documents, supervision
of project construction and conducting of project-related studies; and (g) a
Transfer and Operations Agreement incorporating the financial arrangements
for the transfer of assets and debts of the project from SM to SSC to be
concluded with SSC.
8.        Justification.  Waterways in Shanghai are already extremely
polluted, and pollution loads are expected to increase further with
projected growth in industrial output and domestic wastewater discharge.
Such conditions would cause serious deterioration in the environmental
quality of Shanghai, and the proposed project is required to alleviate these
conditions. Apart from substantial benefits from relieving water pollution
and improving environmental quality, the project would also have major
longer-term benefits in establishing an efficient institutional framework
for managing liquid wastes in Shanghai. It would establish a financially
self-supporting sewerage company, provide staff training, and strengthen
Shanghai Municipality's (SM) capability to monitor and control environmental
pollution. It would also establish an organization to allocate water
resources and set effluent discharge standards for the Huangpu River. It is
difficult, if not impossible, to quantify the benefits of the proposed
project. Thus the principal evaluation criteria for selecting this project
is that it is the least-cost approach to achieving the desired water quality



-4-
objectives. The least cost analysis studied five different approaches to
solving the problem. The selected approach, from which the project is
derived, is the least-cost approach, and is about half as costly as the next
best alternative. The selected approach was then subjected to a further
study which optimized the design configuration for the project.
10.       Risks.  There is a remote possibility that environmental quality
in the Changjiang estuary could be worse than anticipated as a result of
unforeseen stronger effluents entering the system or from an actual lower
assimilative capacity in the Changjiang than is now expected. Monitors
have, however, been built into the project to ensure that abnormal sewage
effluents would be detected early and remedies found. Moreover, model
studies on the estuary have shown a large margin of safety in the
assimilative capacity of the Changjiang. It is also possible that the water
quality objectives (and hence the benefits associated with environmental
improvement) in Suzhou Creek and the Huangpu River will not be reached even
though major sources of pollution in the City are intercepted. This can
arise from increased point and non-point pollution upstream of the project
area. This risk is reduced by the strong interest of SM to improve
environmental quality, and the measures taken to manage the water resources
of the Huangpu River. Managerial and financial risks are minimal given the
strong commitment of the Municipality to reduce water pollution and,
accordingly, the importance they attach to this project.
9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Association
and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan and
credit.
