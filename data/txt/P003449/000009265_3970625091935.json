In\n            addition, this project provides a model to demonstrate the\n            policies and measures needed to resolve the rapidly growing\n            issue of environmental pollution in China's larger\n            cities.  The project consists of the construction of a link\n            and intercepting sewer system to collect and transport\n            wastewater in the project area to the estuary of the\n            Changjiang for disposal, the assistance to carry out four\n            project related studies and a comprehensive training\n            program. The four studies to be completed involve:\n            management and organization; a sewerage tariff study; a\n            river basin management study; and, an examination of the\n            economic ways of rehabilitating the existing combined sewer\n            system in Shanhai."}, "docdt": "1987-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
