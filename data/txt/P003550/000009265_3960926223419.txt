MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA FOR
THE DA XING AN LING FOREST FIRE REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed emergency
credit to the People's Republic of China for SDR 41.1 mil.ion (US$56.9 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity and help finance accelerated timber
salvaging operations, establishment of a comprehensive fire protection system,
technical assistance, and research and other assistance in the regeneration of
the fire damaged area in the Da Xing An Ling (DXAL) forests.
Fire Disaster
2.       In May 1987 the most disastrous forest fire in China's history burned
about 870,000 ha in the northern part of the DXAL natural forest area, killed
193 people, and destroyed the houses of 56,000 people and a large part of the
region's infrastructure. By November 1987 the Ministry of Forestry (MFO) had
already reconstructed 80 of the houses and nearly all the destroyed infra-
structure in the area. After this exceptional achievement, MFO is now
determined to restore the productive capacity of the forest resources and to
salvage the burned timber in order to restore the economic basis for the
people affected by the fire and to recover an enormous national resource.
3.       The fire left dead trees with a total volume of 38 million cbm, of
which an estimated 15 million cbm (national softwood imports of three years)
are high quality larch and pine with an approximate railside value of US$980
million. Although the trees were killed by the fire, most of the wood has not
been affected but must be salvaged within two to three years following the
fire before insect and fungus destroy the timber.
4.       Over the last 22 years fire destroyed on average 180,000 ha of
forests annually. Fire detection and fire suppression are inadequate and need
urgent improvement to reduce the negative impact on China's wood balance and
the pressure on the remaining forest resources. Currently only major forest
fires of more than 60 ha are detected and reach an average size of more than
4,000 ha when extinguished, because of obsolete equipment, inadequate infra-
structure and inappropriate management.
Rationale of IDA Involvement
5.       The disastrous fire requires quick action to salvage high'quality
timber and to establish a fire protection system to avoid another major disas-
ter in these important timber resources. In addition, immediate action is
required to minimize economic disruption for about 60,000 people who make
their living in wood harvesting, logging and processing in the fire-damaged
area. China currently lacks the budgetary resources, the managerial expertise
and, to a lesser extent, the technology for coping with the formidable task of
salvaging 15 million cbm within a period of less than two and a half years,



-2
and to establish over a three-year period a comprehensive fire protection
system for an area as large as the Federal Republic of Germany. The proposed
program would support the improvement of fire protection in the DXAL forests
and would significantly reduce fire losses within two to three years. It
would be a first step in the Government's efforts in establishing a nationwide
fire protection system for China's forests. Also, the project would have a
major impact on the country's timber supply since in the short term it will
recover 9 million cbm of timber which would have been lost without the
project, and over the long term prevent the loss by fire of about 2 million
cbm of commercial timber annually.
Proiect Obiectives
6.       Given the limited time left and the enormous quantity of timber to be
salvaged, the proposed project would first of all concentrate on supporting
the salvage operations and assist MFO in planning and managing these opera-
tions, and financing and procusing the necessary equipment. Assisting the HFO
in establishing a comprehenisive fire protection system for the entire DXAL
area i5 a task of almost equal urgency. Finally, to restore and maintain the
sustainable productiv-e capacity of these forests, it would also support a tree
seed production program and research to determine an optimal forest regenera-
tion system.
Project Description
7.       The project would support:
(a) An acceleratpd timber salvage program to recover about 14 million cbm
of dead timber of lumber quality (virtually all remaining commercial
timber) by April 1990. The logs which cannot immediately be exported
from the area will be stored in water, 'thus avoiding use of chemical
wood preservatives. Construction and upgrading of 3,900 km access
and logging roads over a period of four years would be required to
complete the salvage program.
(b)  Establishment of a comprehensive fire protection sXstem covering the
entire DXAL area of approximately 22 million ha. The program will
focus on aerial and satellite fire detection and on aerial suppres-
sion to initiate fire fighting measures at early stages of fire.
(c) Research on regeneration methods, nursery technology and silvicul-
tural management of the sub-boreaj. forest in DXAL. The project would
provide for regeneration trials and help to select appropriate
nursery technology. In addition, since the quantities of seed for
even a modest sowing or planting program are not available in China
or elsewhere, the project would help to improve MFO's seed collection
and processing capability.
(d) Provision of technical assistance and training to support planning
and implementation of project activities and to improve management of
forest resources in the project area.
8.       The project, to be carried out over four years, provides funds for
equipment, vehicles, aitcraft, civil works, technical assistance, and



-3-
training. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$517 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$58.8 million (11?). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in China are given in Schedule C and D,
respectively. A map is also attached. A Technical Annex is attached in lieu
of the Staff Appraisal Report.
Agreed Actions
9.       The Government agreed (a) to transfer from other forest bureaux, and
to purchase locally, sufficient road construction and logging equipment for
salvaging 4 million cbm of logs in 1988, 7 million cbm of logs in 1989, and 3
million cbm in 1990; and (b) to engage appropriate consultants to improve
productivity of the salvaging operations.
Benefits
10.      The benefits from an accelerated logging program in the disaster area
are that 9 million cbm of burnt sawlogs which would otherwise deteriorate are
harvested, preserved temporarily in water and brought to the market. This
additional volume of sawlogs is assumed to be import replacing. The benefits
of improved fire management will reduce the average annual burnt area from
180,000 ha to 30,000 ha. The economic rates of return of both components may
well exceed 2001, while the financial returns would also be extremely high,
provided effective action commences quickly.
Risks
11.      The major risk of the project relates to the proper management of the
very large scale salvage operations, which may be unprecedented in size any-
where. The risk of not reaching the agreed production targets is greatly
reduced however, since the Government held in early May 1988 the workshop
proposed by the appraisal mission for road planning, organization of felling,
logging and river timber storage. Another risk would be that the effects of
fire protection measures are smaller than anticipated. In order to reduce the
latter risk a substantial training component for implementing the comprehen-
sive fire protection system has been included. The project would require
supervision every three months in the first year, making early adjustments
when problems occur.
Recommendation
12.      I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.

CHINA
THE DA XING AN LING FOREST FIRE REHABILITATION PROJECT
A. BACKGROUND
1.       The forest sector of China accounts at present for 5Z of the gross
value of agricultural output. Employment in forestry and forest industries
totals 2.2 million. China is faced with a rapidly increasing gap between wood
supply and demand. The annual roundwood harvest within the state plan is
currently about 60 million cbm and another 70 million cbm are produced for
self-use by villages and rural households. The government estimates that
consumption of industrial roundwood is currently increasing by 22 p.a. and
reached about 140 million cbm in 1986. To make up for the increasing shortage
in quality timber (a) roundwood imports were raised from vn&.: one million cbm
p.a. in 1970 to 12 million cbm p.a. in 1986, of wlhich the '  -.est increase was
in softwood (5 million cbm) mainly conifer logs from USA, VbSV, and Chile;
(b) accessible forest resources are being severely overcut; and (c) untapped
resources will be opened up through a major Government modernization program
for state-owned forest enterprises with focus on improved silvicultural
management and on expansion of the forest road network to reach over-mature
timber stands in remote areas. However, these efforts are set back by enor-
mous annual fire losses which are estimated to reach 20Z of the nation's
industrial timber production. In the light of these constraints the catastro-
phic fire which occurred in 1987 (para. 3) in the DXAL area will have a disas-
trous impact on the nation's softwood supply if no immediate action is taken
to salvage timber, to prevent further disasters and to restore the producti-
vity of these forest resources.
DXAL Forest Resources
2.       The DXAL area, in the far northern portion of Heilongjiang Province
and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, is China's most important timber
producer and covers 22.7 million ha of which 13.5 million ha are closed forest
stands. The total standing volume is estimated at 1.2J billion cbm, of which
1.12 billion cbm is contained in large, commercially productive blocks. The
dominant species are larch (Larix gmelini, syn dahurica) comprising 70X of the
total standing volume; white birch (Betula platyphylla) taking up to 20Z;
Scots pine (Pinus silvestris var mongolica) with 7Z; and spruce (Picea koyamai
var koreansis), poplar and oak species making up the remaining 3Z. The mean
annual increment in this cold and dry northern region is approximately between
1 and 1.5 cbm/ha in the larch and pine stands.
Fire Disaster
3.       In May 1987 the most disastrous forest fire in China's history burned
about 870,000 ha in the eastern part of the DXAL natural forest area, killed
193 people, and destroyed the houses of 56,000 people and a large part of the
region's infrastructure. By November 1987 MFO had already reconstructed 80%
of the houses and nearly all the destroyed infrastructure in the area. After
this exceptional achievement, which is impressive by any standard in the
world, MFO is now determined to restore the productive capacity of the forest



- 11 -                     Technical Annex
Page 2
resources and to salvage the burned timber in order to restore the economic
basis for the people affected by the fire and to recover an enormous national
resource.
4.       Four out of the eight forest bureaux in Heilongjiang were to various
degrees affected by the fire. The Forest Bureaux of Tahe lost 41Z, Amuer 29Z,
Tuqiang 43Z and Xilingji 41Z of their forest stands. The fire left dead trees
with a total volume of 38 million cbm, of which an estimated 15 million cbm
(national softwood imports of three years) are high quality larch and pine
logs (diameter >18 cm) with an approximate railside value of US$980 million.
Although the trees were killed by the fire, most of the wood has not been
affected but must be salvaged within two to three years following the fire
before insect and fungus destroy the timber.
5.       Fire was always a major hazard for the DXAL forest resources.  Over
the last 22 years fire destroyed on average 180,000 ha of forests annually.
Fire detection and fire suppression are inadequate and need urgent improvement
to reduce the negative impact on China's wood balance and the pressure on the
remaining forest resources. Currently only major forest fires of more than 60
ha are detected and reach an average size of more than 4,000 ha when extin-
guished, because of obsolete equipment, inadequate infrastructure and inappro-
priate management.
B. BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY
6.       The Bank's response and strategy has been to: (a) assist the
Government in identifying an emergency program to salvage the timber of the
fire damaged area and in developing a reliable fire protection system for the
entire DXAL forest area; (b) ensure that the organizational and managerial
infrastructure be established to carry out such a large-scale program;
(c) provide the necessary equipment either through purchase or transfer from
unaffected regions and the technical kivow-how to achieve the targets in log
production and forest protection from future fires; and (d) to process the
project in the shortest possible time to minimize the losses. Immediate
action is required to minimize economic disruption for about 60,000 people who
make their living in wood harvesting, logging and processing in the fire-
damaged area. China currently lacks the budgetary resources, the managerial
expertise and, to a lesser extent, the technology for coping with the formid-
able task of salvaging 15 million cbm within a period of less than two and a
half years, and to establish over a three-year period a comprehensive fire
protection system for the entire DXAL area. The proposed program would
support the improvement of fire protection in the DXAL forests and would
significantly reduce fire losses within two to three years. It would be a
first step in the Government's efforts in establishing a nationwide fire
protection system for China's forests. Also, the project would have a major
impact on the country's timber supply since it will in the short term recover
9 million cbm timber which would have been lost without the project, and over
the long term prevent the loss by fire of about 2 million cbm of commercial
timber annually.

C. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
7.       The project would support:
(a)  An accelerated timber salvage program to recover by April 1990,
15 million cbm Tlfrom the four forest bureaux affected by the fire.
The salvage program would comprise (i) felling, logging and trans-
porting of 14 million cbm of timber of which 5 million cbm would
temporarily be stored in rivers or treated with sprinklers until road
and rail capacities allow transport and marketing of the additional
timber. Since the logs would be stored in local rivers, the use of
chemical wood preservatives is unnecessary. Main storage areas will
be a 200 km section in the Amuer River, and an 80 km section of the
Pangu River. Both are tributaries of the Heilongjiang River and
cross the heavily damaged forest areas; and (ii) construction and
upgrading of 3,900 km of access and logging roads over a period of
four years. For implementing the program MFO will transfer 15
complete road construction units and 125 complete logging units from
other forest bureaux and purchase of local machinery including
accessories to equip an additional 15 road construction units and 267
logging units.2' Foreign equipment worth about US$17 million would
be added to improve the productivity of the above units. The capa-
city built up for the salvage operation will be used after 1990 for
opening up 5 million ha of virgin forests in DXAL, for controlled,
selective logging of over-mature stands.
(b) Establishment of a comprehensive fire protection system covering the
entire DXAL area. The program will focus on aerial and satellite
fire detection and on aerial suppression to initiate firefighting
1/  The schedule of timber production would be as follows:

Without-project capacity shown in brackets.
One million cbm had been salvaged by the beginning of January 1988.
2/  In early fall 1987 MOF replaced, to a large extent, equipment destroyed
by the fire. After the identification mission the DXAL Forest
Corporation (DFC) began to transfer equipment from the unaffected
forest bureaux; thus by beginning of 1988 170 logging units and 45 road
construction units were operational with a log production capacity of 2
million cbm. Equipment would only be transferred from the forest
bureaux of DFC which depend on the same limited railway capacity as the
fire affected forest bureaux for marketing the salvaged timber. Thus
transferring equipment to the fire affected area would keep these road
construction and logging units employed during the salvage operation.

measures at early fire stages, reducing average fire size at detec-
tion from 60 ha currently to approximately 2 ha.  In addition,
improved communication systems, ground facilities for aircraft and
better firefighting methods would be added to the program. The
objective would be to reduce annual fire losses from 180,000 to
30,000 ha.
(c) Research on regeneration methods, nursery technology and silvicul-
tural management of the sub-boreal forest in DXAL. LIttle knowledge
exists for this region of extreme climatic conditions on species
succession in the natural regeneration process. Species succession
patterns may not allow immediate replanting or sowing of larch and
pine in completely burned areas, which would thus determine a heavy
reliance on natural regeneration. The project would therefore
provide for regeneration trials and help to select appropriate
nursery technology. In addition, since the quantities of seed of
appropriate species for even a modest sowing or planting program are
not available in China or elsewhere, the project would help to
improve MFO's seed collect!on and processing capability.
Cd) Technical assistance and training with focus on filling the gaps
where China currently lacks the appropriate expertise. Emphasis
would be given to workshops which would bring together the experience
and knowledge of the local staff with the know-how and technology of
foreign consultants. The project would provide short and long term
consultancies. In addition, provision would be made for study tours
and seminars on relevant subjects to be determined during implemen-
tation.
8.       The project, to be carried out over a period of three years, provides
funds for items requiring foreign exchange such as logging and road construc-
tion equipment, airplanes, helicopters, vehicles, equipment, civil works,
technical assistance and study tours. The total cost of the project is
estimated at US$517 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
US$58.8 million (11?). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A.
D. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
9.       The project would be implemented by MFO.  As recommended by the iden-
tification mission, the State Planning Commission (SPC) has formed a task
force chaired by the Vice-Chairman of SPC to coordinate project support on the
highest Government level and centralize management of the salvage operations.
The members of the coordinating group are the Vice-Ministers of Forestry,
Commerce and Railways, and the Deputy Director of the State Material Bureau.
A salvage operation unit has been established in the DXAL Forestry Corporation
headquarters in Jagedaqi and a 'Front Production Commanding Headquarters"
(FPCH) in Tuqiarg in the center of the fire disaster area. The responsible
Manager is the Deputy Director of the Forest Industries Bureau reporting
directly to one of the two Vice-Ministers of Forestry. He is stationed for
the time of the salvage operations in Tuqiang.

Page 5
10.      The DXAL forest region is, for administrative purposes, divided into
two areas. The western part of the region, with 7.3 million ha of forests, is
under the control of the DXAL Forest Administration of Inner Mongolia with
headquarters in Yakeshi. The forests are managed through 17 forest bureaux.
This area would be included in the comprehensive fire protection system to be
developed under the project. The eastern part (in Heilongjiang Province),
with 6.1 million ha of forests, is managed by the DXAL Forestry Corporation
which is directly under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Forestry (MFO) in
Beijing. The area is organized in 8 forest bureaux, 67 state forest farms and
39 silvicultural management sectors. Four of these forest bureaux were
affected by the fire. DXAL Forestry Corporation is supervised by the Forest
Industry Bureau, a division in MFO.                       t
11.      The salvage operations are currently organized based on a timber
salvage operations plan which was prepared by the identification mission in
November 1987 and approved and implemented by MFO in January 1988. For imple-
mentation of this component, 13 p/m of short term consultants would be hired
for assisting DFC in logging, river storage, timber transport and forest
pathology. Terms of reference, timing, and scope of consultant assignments
are listed in the Technical Working Paper I (Project File).
12.      The implementation of the fire protection component would be based on
a fire protection plan as detailed in Technical Working Paper 1I. The air-
craft procured by MFO would be maintained either under a service contract
concluded with the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) or by a new
air service company to be established shortly. Consultant services of 7 p/m
would be required to assist MFO in preparing implementation plans for fire
prevention systems. Strong emphasis would be given to training and study
tours to familiarize the forestry staff in DXAL with new technologies to be
introduced under the project (Working Paper II in Project File).
13.      Details of implementing regeneration research and seed supply as well
as the final selection of the appropriate equipment would be determined in two
workshops to be held in May 1988. These workshops would also include
seminars for establishing scientific trial plots and their evaluation. A
total of 4 p/m of foreign consultants are required for implementing the
research program which will also be supported by study tours to familiarize
MFO staff with up-to-date technology.
14.      MFO made provision for eliminating dead trees with less than 18 cm
diameter. This biomass (25 million cbm) may increase the fire hazard and may
cause a sudden increase of insect populations in that area and threaten
adjacent healthy forest stands. At negotiations MFO informed IDA that they
have already started to remove the dead wood or burn it in place.
Procurement
15.      Procurement  under the project would be in accordance with Bank/IDA
guidelines and is summarized in Schedule B. Specifically the following proce-
dure would be adopted:
(a) machinery, equipment, vehicles and aircraft would be purchased or
bulked as far as possible. Orders of US$200,000 and above up to an
aggregate amount of US$45 million would be procured through ICB;



- 15 -                     Technical Annex
Page 6
(b) machinery and aircraft up to an aggregate amount of US$7 million to
be required immediately would be procured under LIB;
(c) local equipment, machinery, vehicles and aircraft would be purchased
directly since, in general, only one manufacturer per item is avail-
able;
(d) civil works contracts would be awarded in accordance with local
competitive bidding procedures acceptable to IDA; and
(e) for contracts estimated to cost US$200,000 or more the Association
would have to review the invitations to bid and proposed awards and
final contracts.
Disbursement
16.      The estimated schedule of disbursements of the IDA credit per year is
in Schedule B. Funds from the credit would be disbursed on the following
basis:
(a) 1002 of foreign expenditures or 100% of local expenditures (ex-
factory cost) for machinery, vehicles, aircraft and equipment;
(b) 1002 of foreign expenditures for technical assistance, study tours,
seminars and workshops; and
(c) 902 of civil works.
17.      Payments made after February 16, 1988 against advanced contracts up
to an aggregate amount of US$7 million would be retroactively financed. MFO
would open a special account of US$5.5 million equivalent in a bank acceptable
to the Association. Deposits and payments have to be made in accordance with
the provisions in the Credit Agreement.
18.      Accounts and Audits.  Government financial procedures would be
followed for management and accounting. MCO would maintain separate accounts
and records for the project. Expenditures of less than US$200,000 equivalent
would be reimbursed on the basis of statement of expenditures for which with-
drawals MFO would arrange to maintain separate records and accounts. Auditors
acceptable to the Association would audit the project accounts each year. The
Project would be closed on March 31, 1992.
Environmental and Legal Aspects of Log Storage and Water Transport
19.      MFO plans to store temporarily (three to five years) up to 5 million
cbm of larch and pine logs in the Amuer and Pangu Rivers. The two rivers are
tributaries of the Heilongjiang (Amur) River which forms the border with the
USSR. Water storage of logs is standard practice for protecting timber from
insect and fungus infestations until it can be transported or processed.
Water preservation is an environmentally sound method for wood preservation
since it neither requires chemicals nor does it pollute the storage water.
The stored logs will not increase or divert the flow of either of the two
rivers or of the Heilongjiang River itself or impede navigation on these



- 16 -                        Technical Annex
Page 7
rivers. Most of the wood will eventually be rafted to the nearest road
connection within the fire-damaged area from which place it will be transpor-
ted by trucks. Less than 10 of the stored wood may be rafted to the
Heilongjiang River and from there transported by barges down the Heilongjiang
River, as has been done regularly for many years. The Heilongjiang River
itself will not be used for rafting logs. The Government has agreed that the
Project will be carried out in compliance with environmental standards accep-

20.      Timber Salvage Component.  The benefit from an accelerated logging
program in the burned area are essentially that 9 million cbm of dead sawlogs
which would otherwise deteriorate are harvested, stored in water, and brought
to the market. The wood would enter the market over a four-year period. This
means that the additional volume arriving on the market will be less than
current imports, and will be a relatively small proportion of total consump-
tion. No downward supply price effects are therefore envisioned.
21.      The incremental costs of the project are the additional costs of
machinery purchase (and tranpser of existing equipment from elsewhere), and
the manpower and other recurrent costs required to run the incremental logging
and storage operation. Adjustments are made to costs to allow for capitaliza-
tion of salvage value of newly purchased equipment at the end of the project.
Costs and benefits are scheduled over a four year period, 1988-1991; all bene-
fits from additional log sales are assumed to be realized by the last year,
i.e., 1991. The economic analysis assumes that all domestic costs are 25X
higher than financial costs, to allow for generalized price distortions.
22.      Two sensitivity tests were applied to the basic analysis.  The first
entailed reducing the selling price of logs by 30X (a most unlikely outcome,
given the administered nature of prices, and the fact that this administered
price is already well below the economic price). The second test assumes that
more rapid deterioration of the dead timber occurs, so that only 9 million cbm
can be salvaged instead of the 14 million envisioned: 5 million in 1988, 4
million in 1989. This test assumes that recurrent costs of logging decline in
proportion to reduced volumes, but that equipment purchases remain as in the
base case. The following table summarizes the results of analysis of the
salvage component:

23.      Fire Protection component.  The benefit of improved fire management
made possible under the project will be to reduce the average annual area
burned in the forest region from about 180,000 hectares to 30,000 hectares.
Benefits are calculated on the basis of the estimated average sawlog volume
harvested per hectare, using an average standing value of RMB 115 per cbm;
this being the residual of the average railhead price of RMB 247/per cbm less
harvesting and transport costs. The price from the economic or implicit
market viewpoint will be of the order of RMB 100 per cbm higher than this.
Standing value will therefore be higher, but by less than RMB 100 per cbm, to
allow for the fact that economic costs are generally assumed higher than
financial.
24.      If sustained yield management were in place, then an area lost to
fire would require immediate downward adjustment of allowable logging volumes
and thus the impact of the loss would be immediate; under this assumption,
benefit from the project in the area of forest protected will accrue imme-
diately. Alternatively, if a fixed cutting cycle is in place, then benefits
from fire control will accrue in the year that a particular area protected
would have been logged. In the following analysis a 30 year logging cycle is
assumed, and the benefits of protection accrue in equal parts in years 1 to
30.
25.      The costs of the project are the costs of investment in aircraft,
weather forecasting, and communications and other equipment necessary, and of
the manpower and other recurrent costs necessary to carry out the program.
26.      The analysis of returns is based on a 15 year costs program:  bene-
fits are streamed over 30 years (under the cutting cfcle assumption). The
area saved from burning is assumed to be 50? of the annual average in year 1,
and 75Z in year 2, to allow for the program to become established.
27.      The following table shows the result of financial and economic
analyses of the fire protection component. The first sensitivity test applied
assumes that the average price of sawlogs declines by 30X. The second test
assumes that the area saved from burning is reduced from 150,000 ha p.a. to
100,000 ha p.a.

(b) to inform IDA on the results of the aerial survey to determine the
commercial volume of dead trees and the analysis of the wood deterio-
ration by August 1988; and
(c) in addition to the semi-annual progress report, MFO would provide
IDA, every three months, with a production-report including the log
volume produced, preserved and transferred to railway stations.
