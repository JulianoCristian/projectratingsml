Quick action is now required to salvage high quality\n            timber and to establish a fire protection system to avoid\n            another major disaster in these important timber resources.\n            The Daxinganling Forest Fire Rehabilitation Project will\n            support an accelerated salvage program to recover about 14\n            million cbm of dead timber of lumber quality.  The logs\n            which cannot be immediately exported from the area will be\n            stored in water. The project will also provide for the\n            establishment of a comprehensive fire protection system\n            covering the entire DXAL area. The program will focus on\n            aerial and satellite fire detection and on aerial\n            suppression measures. Research will be initiated on\n            regeneration methods, nursery technology and silvicultural\n            management. Technical assistance will be provided to support\n            planning and implementation of project activities and to\n            improve management of forest resources in the project area."}, "docdt": "1988-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
