MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT OF SDR 15 MILLION (US$20.4 MILLION EQUIVALENT)
TO THE KINGDCM OF LESOTHO
FOR ANl URBAN SECTOR REORIENTATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum on a proposed development credit to the
Kingdom of Lesotho for SDR 15 million (US$ 20.4 million equivalent) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
and would help finance a program of urban development aimed to achieve
greater autonomy and self-sufficiency in the u-San sector. Most of the
proceeds of the IDA credit would be channelled as loans and grants to three
key implementing agencies: a newly constituted local authority, the Maseru
Municipal Council (MMC); a restructured housing corporation, the Lesotho
Housing and Land Development Corporation (LHLDC); and a strengthened
mortgage finance entity, the Lesotho Building Finance Corporaticn (LBFC).
The loans would carry an annual interest rate of 4% to MMC and 82 to LHLDC;
they would be repaid over 25 years, including 5 years of grace. The
Kingdom of Lesotho would bear the foreign exchange risk of the credit.
2.       Background.  The great majority of the population of Lesotho live
in the rural areas, but urban popilation is increasing much faster than
rural. Over the past 10 years urban population growth rates averaged close
to 10% per annum in Maseru, the m3in city which comprises nearly 60% or
about 130,000 of the total urban population. The high urban p'.pulation
growth rates (coupled with a significant differential in urbar-rural
incomes) are a matter of concern, because they are a reflection not only of
greater opportunities in urban areas, but also of policies favoring urban
areas. This bias is most apparent in the extent to which the urban sector
depends on scarce public sector resources in spite of seriously
deteriorating government finances and the lack of effective cost recovery
policies wnich result in a continuing need for subsidies to urban areas
(e.g. direct subsidies for recurrent expenses of urban areas represent
close to 18% of the entire GOL budget deficit). Major urban sector
problems include the lack of autonomous urban governments which can provide
municipal services from self-generated revenues; the limited production of
serviced urban land and houses; institutional weaknesses in the housing
subsector; and inefficient and weak land markets which perpetuate subsidies
through pricing practices that do not recover full economic costs of plots
and hence promote low densities (with resultant high unit infrastructure
costs) and spatially imbalanced development (including greater than
necessary loss of agricultural lands). Governwent recognizes these
problems and is undertaking a number of policy initiatives: (a) legislation
has recently been introduced to establish urban local government in Lesotho
(including passage of the Urban Local Government Act, the Municipal
Valuation and Rating Act, and the Town and Country Planning Act) in order
to decentralize planning, operations and financial management of the urban
areas; and (b) a National Housing Policy and Implementation Plan was
completed in early 1987 and Government is in the process of putting a
number of its recommendations into effect including: (i) a rationalization



of responsibilities among housing institutions to improve output (by
reduction in the number of public sector institutions responsible for
housing and concentration of public lnvestmnts on land development)5 (1i)
shift of mortgage provision responsibilities from development agencies to
existing financial intermediaries (and In particular LIFC) and
strengthening their cost recovery performance and resource mobilixation;
and (iii) creation of a Land Comnission (currently sitting) to review the
Land Act in order to improve Instruments for Government's managment of
conversion of land from traditional to formal tenure. The Improved policy
and institutional framework of the urban sector, including the emrgence of
a formal land market, promotes Increased private sector participation in
the supply of serviced land and housing. The First Urban Project (Credit
1036-LSO) laid the groundwork for many of these initiatives by *ncouraging
enactment of the legislative basis necessary for operating urban local
government and introducing lower-cost, affordable housing standards and
cost recovery principles. Implementation of this project has been
satisfactory, with the credit closing date occurring on June 30, 1987.
3.       Prolect Ob1ectives.  The proposed project aims to implement a
program of policy reform that shifts the sector towards greater financial
self-sufficiency and accountability, building on the initiatives already
under way. This program would includt,: (a) the development of
decentralized local urban manageusent through the establishment and
operation of MIC; (b) support for the restructuring of the institations
responsible for the supply of housing into a new agency, LHLDC, in order to
improve efficiency, ensure an increased supply, and remove duplication of
responsibilities; (cj increase the availability of long-teim finance
through LBFC to a broad range of income groups for plot purchase and house
development; (d) improve the functioning of land markets to permit truer
economic land pricing; and (e) promote sound cost recovery policies and
practices.
4.       Prolect Description.  The project would consist of the following
components: (a) 5-year plan of MMC (US$21.4 million), comprising
establishment and recurrent costs and investments including upgrading of
about 3,000 plots at Maseru South; (b) construction of about 1,500 serviced
residential plots at Thetsane (US$2.9 million) and provision of about 1,500
mortgage loans for house construction at Thetsane and about 1,900 mortgage
loans for house improvement at Maseru South (US$12.7 million); and (c)
technical assistance and training (US$5.2 million) to (i) MMC for providing
essential line function support during the initial start-up period of
operations; (ii) LBFC for strengthening its internal management procedures
and systems; (iii) LHLDC for developing appropriate policies, and an
implementation and management capability in accordance with its new
mandate; (iv) Department of Lands, Surveys and Physical Planning (LSPP) for
developing the expertise to prepare a tenurial inventory of the traditional
areas within the MMC boundaries, to issue leases (converting land from
traditional to formal tenure) and implement a revaluation program; and (v)
Department of Housing (DOH) for developing, monitoring and evaluating
appropriate housing policies and programs. In order to facilitate project
preparation, an advance under the Project Preparation Facility has been
made available to GOL. Schedule A summarizes project costs and the



.uinaucing p:..aui. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements,
aind tthe disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project procesaing events and the status of Bank group operations in
Lesotho are given in Schedules C and D respectively. Two maps (IbRD 20697
and 20698) are attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 6983-LSO, dated
February 29, 1988, is also attached.
5.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The proposed project would fully
support IDA's country assistance strategy by limiting the need for central
government resource transfers and reducing the scale of parastatals
operating in the urban sector. The project would build on previous IDA
support to the sector and complement IDA's operations in agriculture and
industry. IDA involvement would help ensure that the policy and program
initiatives and improved cost recovery strategies proposed under the
project would be implemented (particularly during the critical early years
of the new institutions). Timing is particularly appropriate as Government
is now committed to the objectives of the project and IDA's dialogue with
Government has been strengthened through the gains made under che First
Urban Project.
6.       Actions Agreed.  A condition of effectiveness is the establishment
and staffing of a Special Projects Unit (SPU) within MMC. Agreement was
obtained during negotiations on the following actions: (a) establishment of
the Project Management Team (PMT) by September 1988; (b) adoption of a
National Urban Housing Policy by December 31, 1988 to increase the supply
of serviced, urban residential land; (c) GOL maintenance of its subvention
to MMC at no more than M 1 million per year (in nominal terms) with a
review by June 1989 to determine further steps which would lead to
elimination of subventions by end-FY93; (d) MMC action program to improve
collection of property taxes and to raise property taxes and charges to
levels which would be sufficient to cover the rec'urrent costs of providing
municipal services and debt service without government subventions after
FY92/93; (e) MMC submission for IDA's review and approval of a prioritized
project list of its capital investment program by October 1, for each
following fiscal year; (f) assets and liabilities of LEHCO-OP and LHC to be
transferred to LHC.DC by September 30, 1988 so that LHLDC is adequately
capitalized to enable it to operate on a sound financial basis; (g) action
program to introduce appropriate rent increases on properties transferred
to LHLDC, sufficient to cover the costs of maintenance and management; (h)
LHLDC to prepare a corporate plan and introduce appropriate accounting,
budgeting, and financial management systems acceptable to IDA by December
31, 1988; (i) LHLDC to submit for IDA's review and approval leases and
simplified title transfers for the Thetsane plots by September 1988; (j)
adoption of suitable plot pricing policies, and beneficiary eligibility and
plot allocation criteria; (k) an appropriate interest rate policy for LBFC
with interest rates set at levels sufficient to cover administration and
interest costs, provide a reasonable contribution to capital and reserves,
and achieve a 3.52 spread on borrowing and lending activities by January 1,
1992; (1) LBFC action program to increase collections of mortgage payments
as a percentage of amounts due from 802 currently to 92X by end March 1993;
(m) LBFC installation of appropriate accounting and computer systems by
December 1988; (n) GOL declaration of project areas as selected development



- 4 -
areas by September 1988 to permit land acquisitions to be completed; (o)
LSPP revaluation of all properties on existing tax rolls in Maseru for
FY88-89 and for those In the municipal area during 7Y91-921 (p) GOL to
amend the Land Act by December 31, 1988 to allow for title in the foLm of a
revalidated tenure insurement.
7.       Justification and Risks.  Substantial benefits vill accrue from
reducing the Government's deficit, increasing the supply of affordable low-
income housing and the availability of long-term mortgage finance,
improving urban services throughout Mas-ru, (including extension of intra-
Maseru transport routes and road maintenance), and introducing urban
services and extending municipal rates into the peri-urban areas of Maseru.
Fully satisfactory economic rates of return are antlicpated for the housing
and related infrastructure component of the project, %rith a particularly
high rate of return for the upgrading at Maseru South. Possible risks
include: delays in the process of institutional reform; inadequate
improvement in cost recovery; and delays in acquiring the land for the
proposed sites and services development. These risks are mitigated by the
Government's current determination to reduce subsidies to the sector, as
well as its commitment to the project's objectives.
8.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recoimend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
