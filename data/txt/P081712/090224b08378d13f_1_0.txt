TOWA PROJECT
TOWA ANNUAL REPORT JUNE 2014

The Total War against HIV and AIDS (TOWA) project was financed through a credit from
the International Development Association (IDA). The project, which was coordinated by
the National AIDS Control Council (NACC) , contributes to the partnership in the national
response to HIV and AIDS as articulated in the Kenya National HIV and AIDS Strategic
Plans (KNASP-2005/2006 -2008/2009 and 2009/2010-2012/2013). The objectives of the
TOWA project were to:

•     Expand the coverage of targeted HIV and AIDS prevention and mitigation interventions.
•     Expand access to bed nets among targeted people living with HIV and AIDS and
      other households in malaria risk areas.


The two main project components were:
•     Strengthening the Governance and Coordination Capacity of the National AIDS Control
    ·,.Council (NACC).
•    ·supporting program implementation by making financial resources available to Civil
      Society Organizations (CSOs), private sector and the public sector, for target activities
          ,.
      identified through the Joint Annual Programme Review (JAPR)


CSOs and private sector Sub-Project Implementing entities (PSls) participated through
submission of proposals in response to Call for Proposals (CfP) made by NACC. The
proposals were submitted and approved at three levels: National Ad-hoc Committee,
District Technical Committee (OTC) and Constituency AIDS Control Committee (CACC) .
Once approved the proposals are forwarded to the Project Co-ordination Office at NACC
headquarters for administrative review.


PricewaterhouseCoopers Kenya was the Financial Management Agency (FMA) charged
with the responsibility of disbursement of funds and review of accountability reports from
approved sub-project implementing entities (PSls) operating at all administrative levels of
the country.

    TOWA PROJECT
    The TOWA project was expected to close officially on the 31st of December 2013.
    However, due delays in accessing funds, the project closure date was extended to June
    30th 2014 .
    During the financial period under review, NACC did not disburse funds to Project Sub
                        '
    Implementers (PSls). Instead, NACC focused efforts on following up accountability from
    implementers. As at the closure date the accountability from PSls stood at 99% of all the
    disbursements made.

                 Bank statements and records of the organization for 2013/2014 financial year;

             •   To establish that proper books/records of account have been maintained and are
                 in agreement with the supporting documents, information and explanations
                 obtained from NACC, FMA and PSls.

             •   To establish that the expenditure was incurred in accordance with the Grant
                 Agreement signed by the implementing agency and in accordance with the
                 approved proposals and work plans by the PSls.

             •   To ascertain that the funds received were used in accordance with the conditions
                 of the grant agreement with attention to the economy and efficiency and only for
                 the purpose which the financing was provided . That goods and services obtaineCil
                 from third parties were procured in accordance with the relevant procurement
                 procedures. That all the necessary supporting documents, records and accounts
                 have been kept in respect of all reported expenditures;



                                                                                                   2
   •   To ensure that proper records/ books have consistently been prepared in
       accordance with the accountability guidelines issued by the FMA and in
       accordance with the International Public Sector Accounting (IPSAS) and give a
       true and fair view of the expenditure of the project;

   •   To identify any systemic issues including internal control weakness,
       accountability concerns and noncompliance with the project legal documents and
       GOK financial regulations and procedures .

   •   To determine and quantify any ineligible expenditure or funds used for the
       purposes not intended in the project as per the Legal Agreement and GOK
       regulations.

   •   To cover a sample of at least 20% of PSls or at least 30% of the monetary value
       of funds disbursed to the PSls in the allocated region for the period ended 30

The · 6irectors of the National AIDS Control Council (NACC) are responsible for the
preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with
lnternation9I Public Sector Accounting Standards (Accrual Basis) and for such internal
control as directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Directors are also responsible for the submission of the financial statements to the
Auditor-General in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Public Audit Act,
2003.


Auditor-General's Responsibility


My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on the
audit and report in accordance with the provisions of Section 15(2) of the Public Audit
Act, 2003. The audit was conducted in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing . .Those standards require compliance with ethical requirements and that .the .
audit be planned and performed t~ obtain reasonable assurance about whether the:
financial statements are free from material misstatement.




                                                                                       3



                                                                                           .j
                                                                                            ~
                                                                                           'i'

                                                                                            II
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the
auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.            In making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation
and fair presentation of tile financial statements in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Project's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating
the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements.


I believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for my qualified audit opinion .



Basis for Qualified Opinion

1. 0    ,. Results of the Audit of the Financial Statements

1.1      Trade and Other Receivables

 Trade and other receivables figure as at 30 June 2014 of Kshs.127,458,655 includes
 advances to the Financial Management Agency amounting to Kshs.109,752,890.00 (Per
 note 7 to the Financial Statements) which form the bulk of the receivables. According to
 the 3 Addendum to the contract for consultants' services (lump-sum) between NACC
 and FMA dated 18 January 2013, the contract was extended to 30 June 2013. The final
 FMA report was received in January 2014. However, the contractual obligation for the
 Financial Management Agency to account for the advances was affected by the lapse of
 time stipulated in the contract document which put into jeopardy the legal redress
 available to NACC to recover the advances from the Agency. Further, the receivable
 figure includes Kshs.13,015,733.00 due from field officers and Kshs.2,773,583.00 in
 respect of Constituency AIDS goordir:iating Committee (CACC) advance~ whose
 recoverability is also . doubtful a.s the project h~s coi:ne to an . e[:ld . . ··In adqiti_on the

 current NACC officers but no recoveries had been made fro'!l ~he,ir : splarie~ . by 30 June
 2014, as required by the Government Financial Regulations and ·Procedures . ·

lri the circumstances, it has not been possible to confirm the recoverability of.trade and
other receivables balance of Kshs.127,458,655 :

                                                                                                4
1.2     Trade and Other Payables

Included in the trade and other payables balance as at 30 June 2014 of
Kshs.103,651,872.00 is an amount of Kshs.14,536,712.00 attributed to GOK-D control
account which was incurred for TOWA project activities from the account without
authority from the Treasury. This amount was not budgeted for and had not been
reimbursed by the donor to GOK account as at 30 June 2014. In the circumstances, the
reimbursement of Kshs.14,~36,712.00 to GOK is doubtful as the project has already
closed .

2.      Results of the Audit of Funds Distributed to SPls by Appointed Auditors

2.1     Audit of NACC and FMA


Delay in Project Fund Disbursements

Review of the Project disbursements indicated that the FMA during the financial year
ended 30th June 2014, applied for Kshs.13,720,019 based on approved proposals and
work plan. However, the total amount applied for was not disbursed by the close of the
projett. The implication of this observation is that proposals reviewed and approved for
funding in the FY 2013/2014 were not funded as planned. These delays in disbursement
heavily distorted the project implementation plans, resulting in poor project impact.

2.2     Audit of Ministries and other SAGAs involved in TOWA Project
        Implementation

Audit of sampled Ministries and SAGAs reviewed that the said entities incurred
unsupported expenditure amounting to Kshs .300,000 and had un-applied balance of
Kshs.4,958,234. Results of a sample selection of 22 out of a population of 56 entitities
were as follows:

 2.4     Management issues

 2.4.1    Poor Book Keeping


Of the sampled 421 PS1.s, it was noted that poor record keeping was the most prevalent
control weakness among the PSls . 256 of the 421 PSls did not keep proper books of
Account. This translates into 61 % of the population .
Failure to keep proper books of Account may result in some Project Funds not being
accounted for.


 2.4.2 Lack of Accounting Records



Of the 421 PS1 s sampled 183 or 43% of them did not keep accounting records at all.
This is a major control weakness as funds may not have been accounted for.
·• ,.


2.4.3        Bank Reconciliations

106 of the 421 PS ls, did not perform bank reconciliations. This translated to failure by
25% of the sampled population to adhere to a key control procedure.


2.4.4        Non - Existence of SPls


· Fifty four (54) SPls were found not to exist. This may have resulted in project funds
  being disbursed to ghost SPls.                                                 ,. .

2.4.5     Other control weaknesses
    •    Seven (7) of the sampled and existing PSI did have written procedures .
    •    Two (2) PSI did not have asset registers.
    •    Twenty one (21) PS ls did not have established Headquarters
    •    Twenty eight (28) SPls did not have qualified staff
    •    Fifty seven (57) SP1 s did not have terms of reference
    •    Eighty six (86) SPls did not have registration certificates
    •    Sixty six (66) SPls incurred unauthorised expenditure
    •    Ninety three (93) SPls did not support their expenditure
   •     Fifty one (51) PSls did not have contract documents
   •     Fourteen (14) SPls didnot refund their balances

                                                                                       8
Qualified Opinion

In my opinion, except for the effect of the matters described in the Basis for Qualified
Opinion paragraph, the financial statements present fairly in all material respects, the
financial position of the Project as at 30 June 2014, and of its financial performance and
its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with International Public Sector
Accounting Standards (Accrual Basis) and comply with the Financing Agreement
No.4336 - KE and CR. No 4841-KE.
                            '

In addition, the special account statement presents fairly, transactions for the year and
the ending balance has been reconciled with the books of account.


Emphasis of the Matter

Ineligible. Expenditure

From the audit review ineligible expenditure incurred by SAGAs and the Ministries is
recoverable by World Bank. However, World Bank may consider mitigating factors in
deciding recoverability of ineligible expenditure by PS ls due to:
   .,. ,.
1)    Inherent weakness in the design and architecture of Community Driven
Development Projects (COD) where audit trail is difficult to execute. ·

2)     There are no elaborate structures to achieve adequate internal and accounting
controls at the tail end of Project Implementation.

My opinion is not qualified in respect to this matter.

      NATIONAL AIDS CONTROL COUNCIL
      TOWA PROJECT
      NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30TH JUNE 2014

      The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements
      are set out below:

      1.1 Statement of compliance and basis of preparation
             The TOWA project financial statements have been prepared in accordance with and
             comply with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) with particular
             emphasis on Accrual Basis Financial Reporting under the Accrual Basis of
             Accounting . The statement of cash flows has been prepared using the indirect
             method.
             The financial statements are presented in Kenya Shillings, which is the functional and
             reporting currency of the Project and all values are rounded to the nearest one
             Shilling. The accounting policies adopted have been consistently applied to all of the
             years presented .
             The financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis following the Grant
             agreement's expenditure categories. The accrual basis of accounting recognises
             transactions when they occur and not necessarily when cash is received or paid out
      ~   ,. by the Project.

 i.          In-kind donations
             ln-'kind donations are contributions made to the Project in the form of actual goods
             and/or services rather than in money or cash terms . These donations may include
             vehicles, equipment or personnel services. Where the financial value of in-kind
             donations can be reliably determined, the Project includes such value in the statement
             of financial performance both as revenue and as an expense in equal and opposite
             amounts; otherwise, the donation is not recorded .
ii.          Cash and cash equivalents
             Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and cash at bank. Bank account
             balances include amounts held at various commercial banks at the end of the financial
             year/period. For the purposes of these financial statements, cash and cash
             equivalents do not include short term cash imprests and advances to authorised
             public officers and/or institutions which had not been surrendered or accounted for at
             the end of the financial year/period .

        SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

 iii.       Pending bills (Accounts payable)

            Pending bills consist of unpaid liabilities at the end of the financial year/period arising
            from contracted goods or services during the year/period or in past years/periods.
            When the pending bills are finally settled, such payments are included in the
            statement of statem~nt of financial position and statement of cash flows in the year in
            which the payments are made.


 iv.        Budget

            The budget is developed on the cash basis, for the entire project period. The Project's
            budget was approved as required by Law and National Treasury Regulations, as well
            as by the participating development partners, as detailed in the project grant
            agreement.

 v.         Exchange rate differences
