The project\n            implementation has recently slowed down due to funds flow\n            problems. Consequently, the project is unlikely to disburse\n            funds to Central Statistics Organization (CSO) selected\n            under the last round of call for proposals.  An extension\n            will allow full implementation of activities by these CSOs\n            which have already been contracted to complete their tasks\n            without compromising on quality.   The extension will also\n            allow the project to implement actions to address specific\n            needs of Indigenous People based on the recently completed\n            consultations. The project grant manual will be revised to\n            address the needs of Indigenous People as the normal call\n            for proposal is unlikely to meet the needs of this special\n            group. Further, this will also allow the project to complete\n            the Impact evaluation being undertaken with technical\n            assistance from the Bank which was delayed due to longer\n            than originally envisaged time taken for contracting the\n            survey firms. This impact evaluation will provide valuable\n            lessons on innovative approaches for HIV/AIDS prevention."}, "docdt": "2013-03-14T00:00:00Z"}
