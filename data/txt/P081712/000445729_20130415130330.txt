                                Restructuring Paper


1. The closing date for the Kenya Total War against HIV/AIDS Project - P081712 (Credit
   43360 and Credit 48410), will be extended from June 30, 2013 until December 31, 2013, and
   reallocation of funds will be done as per the attached table of withdrawal. The proposed
   reallocation will redirect resources to activities needing additional funds and ensure
   utilization of the remaining Credit. The development objectives and targets of the project
   will remain the same.

2. The Project is on track to achieve its Development Objectives. To date 8,897 Community
   Based Organizations (CBOs), selected through transparent call for proposal process, have
   received grants to improve community behaviors to prevent HIV/AIDS. This surpasses the
   original project target of 8,400. The National AIDS Control Council (NACC) is
   implementing the Governance Action Plan to address weaknesses identified by the in-depth
   fiduciary review. Since 2011, a total of 950 CBOs have been identified for investigation. Of
   these, a total of 559 (59%) have been checked and cleared while 8 cases were referred to the
   Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. Procurement of essential medicines and Long
   Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) planned under the project has been completed. The LLINs
   procured through UNICEF have been distributed in the Coastal Province and the 3 highland
   malaria epidemic prone districts of the Rift Valley Province. The post distribution survey will
   provide an update on household net ownership while the on-going Kenya AIDS Indicator
   Survey (KAIS) will also provide independent information on the other key project indicators.

3. The project implementation has recently slowed down due to funds flow problems.
   Consequently, the project is unlikely to disburse funds to CSOs selected under the last round
   of call for proposals. An extension will allow full implementation of activities by these
   CSOs which have already been contracted to complete their tasks without compromising on
   quality. The extension will also allow the project to implement actions to address specific
   needs of Indigenous People based on the recently completed consultations. The project’s
   grant manual will be revised to address the needs of Indigenous People as the normal call for
   proposal is unlikely to meet the needs of this special group. Further, this will also allow the
   project to complete the Impact Evaluation being undertaken with technical assistance from
   the Bank which was delayed due to longer than originally envisaged time taken for
   contracting the survey firms. This impact evaluation will provide valuable lessons on
   innovative approaches for HIV/AIDS prevention.

4. The proposed extension is necessary to allow for implementation of awarded contracts to
   CSOs and completion of the final phase of the Project. A revised procurement plan has been
   prepared with a timeline for ensuring that ongoing activities are fully implemented by
   December 31, 2013. This will be the second extension of the project. The first extension of
   one year in December 2010 was done in the context of the restructuring and additional
   financing of the project.
