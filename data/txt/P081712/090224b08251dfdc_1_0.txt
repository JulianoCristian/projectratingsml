                         The Project Development Objectives are to: (a) expand the coverage of targeted HIV and AIDS prevention and mitigation measures; and(b) expand access to bed nets
                         among targeted people living with HIV and AIDS and other households in malaria risk areas.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         With the good progress reported by the Kenya AIDS indicator study 2012 (KAIS 2012), the achievement of the project development objectives (PDOs) and implementation status are
                         maintained as satisfactory as upgraded in the last ISR. The final results matrix for the country and project for the first quarter (March 2014) will be available end of May, as is the
                         reporting practice for the program. The new information will therefore be reflected in the project ICR. So far, the project has supported grants to over 10,800 civil society/private
                         sector organizations to implement HIV prevention activities and performance of over 80% of such grantees was rated either good or excellent by the performance auditor. Over 6

                         million individuals have been provided with HIV/AIDS counseling and testing services during the life of the project out of which 1.8 million were supported directly by the project. The
                         project also supported procurement and distribution of over 350 million condoms and the KAIS 2012 shows an increased use of condoms among the youth. The 70 million additional
                         condoms that were programmed to be procured during the six months extension of the project will not be delivered. The $ 2 million will be used for paying taxes and levies amongst
                         other small payments which would have had to be paid by Government although they qualify under the project. No cancellation of funds is anticipated. There have been issues of

                         availability of condoms internationally, which was made worse by Kenya's insistence that the condoms must be branded with the Ministry’s logo, requiring a dedicated line of
                         production. The mass distribution of 2.8 million bed nets procured under the project was done in the Coast province and the three endemic districts of the Rift Valley. The KAIS 2012
                         shows that the project target of 80% having at least one bed net by household in malaria endemic districts supported by the project has been reached. The planned procurement and
                         distribution of TB drugs was also successfully completed.

                         The project was restructured and PDOs adjusted in 2010 to include the additional funding of $20 million for the procurement of bed nets and also to replace the $33 million that was
                         supposed to be co-financed by DFID, who failed to come through per the original project design. The result matrix was revised and a new PDO introduced to reflect the new focus on
                         households in malaria endemic areas in districts supported by the project that have at least one insecticidal bed net. Most of the original result matrix remained with a few changes.
                         The duality of evaluation of activities of this project post-restructuring and before is therefore not very different except for the universal bed nets distribution. The restructuring also
                         triggered the safeguard on Indigenous people, whose plan was developed and implemented thereafter.
