1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Economic Development and Poverty

1.     When the project was prepared, the Kenyan economy was growing at around 6
percent annually. Macro-economic reforms were being carried out, but structural reforms
remained incomplete. The Government prepared an Economic Recovery Strategy (ERS)
for Wealth and Employment Creation, reached an agreement with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) on a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program,
moved to improve relationships with donors, and developed new strategies for
socioeconomic development 1.

2.     Income inequality was high with regional income disparities. About 56 percent of
households were estimated to be below the poverty line in 2003. The AIDS epidemic
contributed significantly to the poverty and desperation of many Kenyans, with over 1.4
million people infected with HIV (including 156,000 children), about 200 new infections
daily among adults and slightly over 100,000 deaths annually.

Governance and Anti-Corruption

3.      Available evidence at the time suggested that corruption had declined, but was still
apparent especially in the process of obtaining permits and tax evasion. There was
deterioration in the judiciary and in the administration of government procurement. The
Government set ambitious goals for governance improvement, adopted some important
measures, and made progress in reforming public resources and administration. However,
progress in implementing the governance strengthening program and in achieving results
was mixed.

4.     Parts of the World Bank portfolio, including the HIV and AIDS Program, were
faced with significant governance problems. A series of reviews and special audits
conducted since 2004 identified a range of problems including weaknesses in financial
management systems; lack of fraud risk management; weak oversight by senior
Government officials; inconsistent application of the World Bank’s Procurement
Guidelines; and failure to share lessons learned and best practices. The 2006 Detailed
Implementation Reviews (DIRs) also confirmed corruption risks in Bank-funded
operations although the risks differed across sectors.

HIV and AIDS Epidemic and Response

5.     The HIV epidemic in Kenya was heterogeneous and still a massive threat. Among
adolescents and adults aged 15 to 64, HIV prevalence was estimated at 7.1 percent


1
 During the 1990’s Kenya’s economic performance was weak and real per capita income contracted by an
average of 0.5 percent annually.

                                                 1
representing 1.4 million people. Women were more likely to be infected (8.4 percent) than
men (5.4 percent). Most new infections were in young people, with girls most at risk. In
the 15 to 24 years age group, women were four times more likely to be infected (5.6
percent) than men (1.4 percent).

6.      The impact of HIV and AIDS on the economy was devastating and the epidemic
remained the greatest development challenge that Kenya has faced. In 2005, it was
estimated that the GDP was 14.5 percent lower than it would have been without AIDS. At
the household level, the impact was profound with 36 percent of children from HIV-
affected households dropping out of school, compared to 25 percent from non-HIV-
affected households; and health expenditure was 75 percent higher in households with
HIV-related illnesses.

7.      The heterogeneity of the epidemic demanded that higher priority be given to several
key drivers of the epidemic: (a) increased targeting of priority activities for youth,
especially young women; (b) addressing issues of poverty; (c) gender inequality, gender-
based and sexual violence; (d) stigma and discrimination; (e) injection safety in health care
settings; and (f) targeting significantly higher risk activities and populations, notably:(i)
sex work, both commercial and transactional in nature; (ii) HIV transmission within
marriages or ‘regular/stable’ partnerships; (iii) intergenerational sex involving younger
women and older men, along with casual sex and concurrent sexual partnerships; (iv)
injecting drug use, combined with effects of alcohol abuse; and (v) men-having-sex-with-
men (MSM).

8.      The Government, together with a wide range of stakeholders, developed the second
Kenya National HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan (KNASP II) for the period 2005/06 to
2009/10. The objectives were to reduce the spread of HIV, improve the quality of life of
those infected and affected, and mitigate the socio-economic impact of the epidemic.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

9.     The PDO was to assist Kenya to expand the coverage of targeted HIV and AIDS
prevention and mitigation interventions. This would be done through: (a) sustaining the
improved institutional performance of the National Aids Control Council (NACC); and (b)
supporting the implementation of the KNASP.

10.     The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were: (a) NACC composite score on the
annual independent performance evaluation; (b) Proportion of overall targets met for
NACC-funded programs in civil society/private sector and public sector beneficiaries; (c)
Five key outcome indicators for prevention and mitigation namely: (i) Proportion of youth
aged 15 to 24 years reporting condom use in the last sexual encounter with a non-regular
partner; (ii) Proportion of sexually active youth 15 to 24 years who report having had sex
with a non-spousal, non-regular partner in the past 12 months; (iii) Number of persons who
undergo testing and counseling; (iv) Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) receiving
care/support in the past 12 months; and (v) Number of male and female condoms
distributed.



                                             2
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

11.    The Revised PDO was to: (a) expand the coverage of targeted HIV and AIDS
prevention and mitigation measures; and (b) expand access to bed nets among targeted
People Living with HIV and AIDS and other households in malaria risk areas.

12.     The revised KPIs were: (a) Proportion of recipients of subproject grants scoring
“Very Good” or “Excellent” for target achievement in the annual performance audit during
the year; (b) Number (cumulative) of civil society/private sector grants supported by the
end of the year; (c) Proportion of youth aged 15-24 reporting condom use in the last sexual
encounter with a non-regular partner (of those reporting sexual intercourse with a non-
regular partner in the last 12 months); (d) Proportion of sexually active youth 15- 24 who
report having had sex with a non-spousal, non-regular partner in the past 12 months; (e)
Percentage of households in malaria endemic areas in the districts supported by the TOWA
Project that have at least one Insecticide treated (ITN); and (f) Number of individuals
provided with counseling and testing services (through TOWA) in the past 12 months, and
three core beneficiary indicators: (i) Number of individuals with access to an ITN; (ii)
Number of youth reached with HIV prevention messages; and (iii) Number of HIV+ clients
provided with palliative care.

13.     The PDO and KPIs were revised during the (adaptive) restructuring that provided
additional financing, approved by the Board on November 18, 2010. The revised PDO
reflected the increased focus on providing bed nets to prevent malaria. Following a global
study (that included Kenya) that showed the impact of mass distribution of long lasting
insecticide treated nets (LLITNs) on the morbidity and mortality on women and children,
the Government of Kenya responded through a policy of Universal Coverage of LLITNs
in high malaria endemic areas. The TOWA project was restructured to support the scale up
of LLITNs in high risk areas of the country. The original funding of US$4 million for
procurement of 500,000 LLITNs for PLHIV was increased to US24 million to procure a
total of 2.8 million LLITNs and expand the beneficiary group to include women and
children through mass distribution of bed nets. In addition, KPIs were revised to (i) clarify
definitions of some key indicators, especially success criteria for grants under the Call for
Proposals (CfPs); (ii) adjust some targets upwards in light of additional financing and early
project results; and (iii) extend the closing date by 18 months to facilitate the achievement
of the revised targets and the planned impact evaluation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

14.    (a) Populations at high risk of contracting and transmitting HIV and for whom
preventive services were at the time very limited--commercial sex workers (CSWs), MSM,
intravenous drug users (IDUs), the disabled, prisoners, highly mobile populations such as
truck drivers and migrant workers, and sero-discordant couples -- would benefit from
expanded access to preventive services enabling them to reduce their risk of HIV infection.
(b) Targeting priority activities with largest impact in preventing HIV would benefit youth
especially girls; women including widows; workers in small and medium enterprises and
micro enterprises and the informal sector; and people exposed to sexual violence. (c)
Provision of mitigating interventions to OVCs and people living with HIV and AIDS

                                             3
(PLWHA) would enable children to stay in school, provide additional income and improve
nutrition and other aspects of well-being. (d) Systems and capacity were to be strengthened
to enable improved performance in agencies responsible for providing or supporting HIV
services: (i) the NACC and its decentralized structures: the Constituency AIDS Control
Committees (CACCs) and the District Technical Committees (DTCs); (ii) selected public
sector ministries and departments (listed in paragraph 23); (iii) Civil Society Organizations;
(iv) Research institutions and University.

1.5 Original Components

15.    The project had two key components: (1) Strengthening NACC’s role in
governance and coordination; and (2) Continuing support for program implementation.

Component 1: Strengthening Governance and Coordination Capacity (US$29.8
million; US$19.7 million) 2:

16.    The component provided support to strengthen the NACC for managing and
implementing the long-run response to HIV in Kenya, and to enhance capacity to use
resources from all sources effectively for results. There were four sub-components:

17.     Sub-Component (1a): Strategic Leadership (US$I3.4 million; US$8.1million):
support for: (i) regular strategic reviews of the KNASP -- primarily the Joint Annual
Programme Review (JAPR) and the mid-term review of the Program; (ii) sustain Program
operations through providing operating costs of Constituency AIDS Control Committees
(CACCs), District Technical Committees (DTCs) and NACC Field Officers; (iii) limited
minor works to ensure an efficient operating environment; (iv) institutional capacity
building of NACC, mainly training for staff, technical committees, and the NACC board
and its committees; (v) advisory support and technical assistance for NACC to prioritize,
strengthen and focus Program targeting to be more strategic and selective; and (vi) strategic
communications including information education and communication (IEC), mass media,
etc. supporting the NACC Program.

18.     Sub Component (1b): Accountability and Verification (US$8.5 million;
US$6.0million): to procure independent consulting firms for five tasks: (i) Financial
Management Agency (FMA) to manage financial aspects of grants made under the Project;
(ii) compliance verification agency (CVA) to check compliance of grant proposals with the
terms and conditions of the CfP for grants; (iii) Performance Auditor, to verify that grants
are used for the purpose intended, combining technical audit and financial audit (value for
money); (iv) Procurement Management Agency (PMA) to monitor procurement by the
NACC; and (v) external Financial Auditors.

19.   Sub Component (1c): Information-based Management (US$4.9 million;
US$3.5million): Activities to improve the local evidence base for decision making


2
  The cost figures relate to: (i) the combined IDA, DFID (expected) and Government financing, excluding
the contingency amount; and (ii) the IDA allocation alone, again excluding the unallocated contingency
amount.

                                                   4
through: (i) developing the Management Information System (MIS); (ii) further
strengthening the M&E system and reporting; and (iii) operational research.

20.     Sub Component (1d): Capacity Building of Implementing Partners (US$3.0
million; US$2.1 million): to strengthen grant performance by: (i) provision of technical
support to community-level grantees (capacity building and facilitation); (ii) networking
and facilitation at regional level for needs assessment, coordination, and the public-private
sector interface; and (iii) for coordination of processes such as responding to CfPs,
participating in the JAPR, strengthening monitoring and reporting, social accountability,
and public disclosure.

Component 2: Support for Program Implementation (US$81 million; US$57.3
million)

21.     This component made financial resources available to civil society, and public
sector, private sector and research institutions, for initiatives within the KNASP, and for
procurement of essential commodities. The component had three sub-components:

22.     Sub-component (2a): Grant Awards (US$53 million; US$37.5 million): grants to
civil society and the private sector, for result-based proposals and activities in areas and
for populations prioritized within the KNASP framework and identified in annual JAPRs.
Proposals were assessed and selected on the basis of their expected results, using a set of
clear rules and criteria.

23.      Sub-component (2b): Mainstreaming Public Sector Programs (US$8 million;
US$5.7 million): for mainstreaming HIV in the public sector, within the priority areas in
the KNASP. The funds were expected to amplify interventions planned by the targeted
ministries in their own Medium Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs), Budgets and
Annual Plans of Operations and not to fund separate projects or work-plans. As indicated
in the KNASP, key public sectors important in the fight against HIV and AIDS were
targeted. The initial public sectors targeted were: Transport, Agriculture (including
cooperatives, livestock and fisheries), Health, Education (including Teachers Service
Commission, Commission of Higher Education and Ministry of Science and Technology),
Governance (Judiciary, Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs, Attorney General,
Kenya Police, and Police Administration); and Directorate of Personnel Management. The
list of priority sectors would be examined during each JAPR and revised based on the
priorities identified. The Project would also support the African Regional Capacity
Building Project for HIV and AIDS Prevention, Care &Treatment (ARCAN) follow-up
activities to train 813 ARCAN Trainer Graduates and help achieve cascading training
between 2006 -2009.

24.     Sub-component (2c): Essential Commodities (US$20 million; US$14.7 million):
procurement and distribution of selected malaria and TB commodities essential to the fight
against HIV and AIDS for which there were funding gaps: (i) US$12 million for condom
procurement; (ii) US$4 million toward procurement of first line TB drugs; and (iii) US$4
million toward procurement of ITN for free distribution among PLWHA in malaria zones;
and (iv) if necessary, small amounts of other commodities such as test kits, laboratory
equipment and reagents on a highly limited basis.

                                             5
     1.6 Revised Components
     25.    The components remained the same. The only change in the project components
     was to rename the subcomponents as thematic areas, and change the name of the original
     sub-component 1c to Evidence Based Management.

     1.7 Other Significant Changes

     Amendments to the TOWA Project Financing Agreement (FA)

     26.    The FA was amended to adjust the project to the delayed availability and cancelling
     of planned DFID co-financing, and to allow for rapid procurement of additional bed nets
     (Table 1).

     Table 1: Amendments to the TOWA Project
SN   Date        Amendment                                                   Comments
     August      To increase the share of expenditures covered by IDA,        IDA contribution was increased to cover the original
     2008:       from 71 percent to 100 percent until June 30, 2009, and     UK Department for International Development
                 reduce the IDA percentage back to 42 percent from July      (DFID) planned allocation in year-1 and year-2 with
                 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010.                                   the expectation that the IDA share would drop back
                                                                             when DFID funding became available in year-3
     August,     To maintain the disbursement rate at 100 percent until      This amendment was made for the percentage of
     2009        June 30, 2010, with IDA funding then planned to be just     expenditures covered by IDA to be maintained at
                 31 percent from July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011 (and 71       100 percent until June 30, 2010, as DFID support
                 percent thereafter). The co-financing deadline for the      had not been forthcoming in FY09.
                 DFID financing was also moved to July 31, 2010.
     August,     To effect an increase in the procurement prior              This amendment was part of a country-wide change
     2009        review threshold for the TOWA project                       in procurement review thresholds and fiduciary
                                                                             parameters.
     August      To: (a) increase the disbursement percentage from 31        This amendment was to recognize that DFID would
     2010:       percent to 100 percent in FY11; (b) Reallocate Project      not be co-financing the Project, and to make
                 funds principally to allow for urgent procurement of        additional funds available for procurement of
                 additional bed nets; and (c) remove the dated covenant on   urgently needed bed nets for the malaria program.
                 the DFID Co-financing Agreement.

     Changes in Project Cost and Financing

     27.     The project cost at appraisal was US$115 million and the actual project cost was
     US$135 million. The project was originally financed by an IDA credit of SDR 52.9 million
     (US$80 million), 70 percent of the original cost with joint funding expected from DFID
     (US$33 million) and US$2 million from Government. The Additional Financing request
     of US$55 million approved in November 2010 provided for: US$33 million to “replace”
     the planned co-financing DFID had been unable to provide; an additional US$10 million
     to scale up the malaria bed net program 3; and $12 million to facilitate achievement of the
     revised targets, including the full implementation of grants under the fourth and fifth CfP
     (Tables 2 and 3).

Project Restructuring

29.    The first (level 2) restructuring 4 was done at the same time as the fourth
Amendment of the Financing Agreement, approved by the Country Director in August
2010. The restructuring: (i) reallocated funds to continue to enable the increased
disbursement percentage from IDA to adjust for planned DFIF co-financing not becoming
available, and (ii) enabled the urgent purchase of additional bed nets (amounting to US$10
million) for the malaria program.

30.     The second (level-1) restructuring 5 was for the additional financing credit for the
Project approved on November 18, 2010 by the Board. The additional financing of US$55
million was to: (i) make up for the US$33 million funds from DFID, which was not going
to be available as co-financing, to fund the fourth and fifth CfPs; (ii) allocate another
US$10 million (bringing the total provision under the TOWA to US$24 million) to scale
up the malaria bed net program and help attain universal coverage of bed nets in the high
malaria risk areas of the country (Table 2); (iii) support the project restructuring and restore
some of the funding, especially for commodities, that had been reallocated (mainly to bed
nets) in August 2010; (iv) respond to the triggering of the safeguards policy for IP; (v)
allow for completion of the planned IE that was delayed and to enable data on population-
level performance indicators to be obtained from the planned AIDS and malaria indicator
surveys; (vi) extend the Project for another 18 months, particularly to continue fiduciary
and M&E strengthening, and to achieve the revised PDO and increased KPI targets (see
para 12).

  Level -2 restructuring approved by the RVP applies to cumulative extensions of closing date of two years
or more; Policy exceptions/waivers (on a case by case basis) OR Level -2 restructuring approved by Country
Director applies to all other project modifications other than Level 1 and Level 2(RVP approved). These
include changes such as: changes in outcome indicators or targets; modifications in project scope or design;
addition or cancellation of project activities or components; changes from a safeguards category C to B;
reallocation of proceeds and/or cancellation of funds; changes in executing units or currency denominations,
implementation plans or schedules; New action plans to bring a poorly performing project back on track;
new reporting requirements (or other adjustments to improve implementation); Extension of new
loan/credit/grant closing dates; New implementation dates that under terms of the legal agreement may be
put into effect by notice.
5
  Level-1 restructuring- Approved by the Board applies to modifications in a project’s Development
Objectives (DOs) or changes in the safeguard category—from a lesser category set in the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD) to a Category A, or trigger of a new safeguard policy. Level One restructurings are
submitted to the Board of Executive Directors for approval under absence of objection (AOB) procedures.

                                                     8
31.     The third restructuring (level 2) was approved on March 14, 2013 by the Country
Director to extend the closing date from June 30, 2013 to December 31, 2013 to allow for:
(i) full implementation without compromising quality of activities by CSOs who had
already been contracted; (ii) implementation of actions to address specific needs of
Indigenous People (IPs) and revision of the project implementation manual to address the
needs of IPs as the normal call for proposals was unlikely to meet the needs of this special
group; (iii) completion of the Impact Evaluation (IE) that was delayed due to longer than
envisaged time to contract the survey firms. The IE was expected to provide valuable
lessons on innovative approaches for HIV and AIDS prevention; (iv) reallocation of
resources to activities needing additional funds and to ensure utilization of the remaining
Credit. The development objectives and targets of the project remained the same.

32.     The fourth restructuring (level 2) on, December 4, 2013 approved by the Country
Director, was to extend the closing date from December 31, 2013 to June 30, 2014 to
enable: (i) final completion of project activities at an advanced stage, delayed when the
Government introduced changes in the financial system in keeping with the new
constitution that resulted in substantial delays in getting funds to the project; (ii)
reallocation of funds to enable full utilization of the remaining Credit, redirecting resources
to activities needing additional funds, including procurement of additional condoms for an
amount of US$2 million to avert a national stock-out while Government organizes long
term procurement with the Global Fund.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

33.     The project was prepared in two years from 2005 to 2007, reasonable given the
scope, and need to address carefully various audit issues raised and for thorough
preparation especially on issues of systems and fiduciary measures. Results from a
thorough analysis of the governance and anti-corruption situation in the country,
governance of the national HIV and AIDS program and of other World Bank projects and
programs were incorporated into project design 6. Care was taken to ensure that the TOWA
project design responded to the governance challenges encountered under KHADREP
including the weak structural issues under the NACC.

34.     The preparation was grounded in extensive country analysis. Careful analysis of
the epidemiology and burden of HIV and AIDS in Kenya guided the focus. Project design
also benefited from studies of the shortcomings and strengths of national HIV programs
(including IEG’s 2005 review), and the best available and respected scientific evidence and
technical advice, knowledge and expertise on HIV and AIDS within the Government of
Kenya, the United Nations (UN) Joint Team on HIV and AIDS, and the World Bank. The
project design followed the requirements and criteria for repeater project under the Multi-


6
  Including recommendations from efficiency monitoring unit (EMU) of the Office of the President following
an , investigative review of the NACC; results from an independent Forensic Audit of the KHADREP; and
Detailed Implementation Review (DIR) conducted by the World Bank Department of Institutional Integrity
(INT) confirmed the earlier findings of the Government’s own investigations and the Forensic Audit, that the
KHADREP Project had “strong indicators that were consistent with potential fraud, corruption and collusion.

                                                     9
Country HIV and AIDS Program (MAP) for Africa, which had evolved to be more
prioritized than the original MAP.

35.     Steps were taken to complement plans for further governance strengthening
measures, as part of the design work for the TOWA Project; notably the enhanced
processes, systems and control measures for program coordination, public sector and civil
society programs, Monitoring and Evaluation, management and governance 7. There was
clear evidence that the NACC was committed to carrying out governance reforms and
monitoring and evaluation strategies that would make the TOWA Project a success story
for Kenya 8.

36.    Board approval was delayed by 20 months because of the post-election issues that
the country was dealing with.

37.     The project was aligned with: Kenya’s strategy for economic growth with poverty
reduction as defined in the Investment Program for the Economic Recovery Strategy (IP-
ERS) for Wealth and Employment Creation; the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP);
and World Bank development assistance strategies for Kenya. The design reflected the
focus of the CAS of May 2004 and findings from the CAS Progress Report of March 2007
that reaffirmed World Bank commitment to support the fight against HIV and AIDS. The
2010 additional financing was consistent with the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for
2010-2013 which identified investing in human development as one of its basic priorities,
and aimed at achieving more inclusive growth and reducing inequality and social
exclusion.

38.      Rationale for Bank Involvement: The World Bank’s extensive experience in
supporting national HIV programs and strong commitment to harmonization and alignment
was greatly valued. The TOWA Project was expected to: (a) continue to support further
institutional strengthening and governance improvements in the NACC; (b) fill important
gaps in the financing of the KNASP; (c) contribute to the harmonization and alignment
agenda in Kenya through enhanced partnership among the World Bank, DFID and UN
System in support of the KNASP; and continue to support NACC’s coordination of all HIV
and AIDS stakeholders in Kenya within the framework of KNASP and an annual JAPR
process.




7
  Most notable among the many lessons and recommendations distilled and incorporated in the project design
were: (a) A results-oriented and performance-based award mechanism for grants; (b) Limiting participation
of community-based organizations to those with established track records of performance; (c) Introduction
of transparent decision making processes with full disclosure of information; and (d) Recruitment of
independent Fiduciary Agents (as listed in paragraph 16). Responsibility for project coordination and
management was placed in the NACC.
8
  Development of Governance Action Plan and the risk management matrix; adoption of risk management
policy; introduction of performance contracts and wealth declarations; capacity building program in NACC,
creation of the Internal Audit Division, M&E strengthening and CACC training.

                                                   10
Assessment of Project Design

39.     The project was well designed, with appropriate objectives and indicators (given
the available data) and a results framework that established clear links from activities to
some coverage outcomes. While the PDO committed the project to expand the coverage of
targeted HIV and AIDS prevention and mitigation measures, the indicators measuring the
coverage of most key interventions especially for most at risk populations were limited
with the exception of coverage data for the youth 15-24 years. At the time of project
preparation and restructuring for additional financing, data on MARPs was not available.
This was a major bottleneck to effective targeting and programming for MARPs. A MARP
size estimation consensus report was only produced in 2013 that provided population size
estimates and coverage baseline data for some identified indicators for MARPs. The project
used output data to monitor provision of services to key populations, tracking the number
of people in various MARP groups reached, but estimating MARP total population sizes
(and hence coverage levels) remains a challenge due to the private nature of sexual activity
and criminalization of MARP-related activities.

40.     The design responded to three main challenges facing Kenya’s HIV response -- the
need for: (i) further governance strengthening and enhanced strategic leadership by the
NACC; (ii) increased targeting and focus on results; and (iii) improved harmonization and
alignment among development partners. The design included robust institutional
strengthening to address the challenges and weakness that had dogged the KHADREP
project. Strategic review and adjustment each year through the JAPR process would
contribute strongly to (ii) and (iii), enable better “learning-by-doing,” and ensure a strong
participatory and community-focused approach, noted to be a strength of the Bank’s
response to HIV in Africa. Strategic allocation of funds primarily to lower levels was
informed by previous experience, which had shown the comparative advantage of reaching
out to the community level, because it ensured wider geographical coverage to target
beneficiaries in more effective and efficient ways. The project performance and monitoring
indicators were derived from the results and monitoring framework of the KNASP.
Extensions of the project enabled most targets to be met and exceeded; the few that were
dramatically over-achieved appear to have been poorly set, and should have been revised.

41.     The Government of Kenya’s commitment on HIV was demonstrated before and
during project preparation. The Government had declared HIV and AIDS a national
disaster in 1999, and established the NACC to coordinate a multi-sectoral national
response. The National HIV Response has been guided by a series of national strategic
plans starting with the Kenya National HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan of 2000 to 2005
(KNASP I). The TOWA project was designed as an integral part of the implementation of
the Kenya National HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan II and III focussing on HIV prevention
and mitigation measures at the community level and through public sector mainstreaming.
Commitment and ownership was demonstrated in a letter of policy support for the TOWA
project issued by the Finance Minister on April 12, 2007, confirming the Government’s
commitment to transparency and accountability and enhancing governance and fighting
corruption in Kenya.

42.   Kenya was perceived as a high risk environment. The Project Appraisal Document
(PAD) and Project Paper gave a candid and realistic assessment of project risks. Project

                                             11
planning sought to mitigate the governance risks experienced under the KHADREP. The
main risks identified were: (a) Failure of partners and the Government to effectively
coordinate their support for the KNASP and the National Malaria Strategy; (b) Weak
institutional capacities of implementing agencies, especially at the district, constituency
and community levels, that could adversely impact PDO achievement; and (c)
Vulnerability to fraud and corruption especially in contract award and management and
decentralized procurement. The mitigation measures as stated were appropriate.

Quality at Entry

43.   There was no formal Quality at Entry assessment by the Quality Assurance Group
(QAG).

2.2 Implementation

44.     Initial delays were due to the time needed to recruit the fiduciary strengthening
consultants, the post-election violence in early 2008 and slow procurement of essential
commodities. Despite the slow start and challenging period in the early years of the project,
overall, project implementation and progress towards the PDO was satisfactory for much
of the project life, except for mainstreaming HIV in public sector programs, and delays in
carrying out the audits of the grants. Project management and oversight improved
significantly over time, and almost all planned activities were completed by the time of
project closure with 100 percent disbursed SDR 87.28 million).

Factors that contributed positively to implementation of planned activities:

45.     Strong participation by the vibrant NGO/CSO community and an effective process
for setting priorities for grant awards: Prioritized results areas were selected annually
based on the framework of the KNASP and areas identified as priorities in the Joint HIV
and AIDS Programme Review (JAPR). Actual interventions were selected after assessing
which proposals had best potential to achieve results contributing to the national objectives.

46.     Clearly documented procedures, guidelines and standards for the granting
mechanism and JAPR: Grant selection, guidance and implementation monitoring was done
through a decentralised structure comprising the NACC Secretariat, District Technical
Committees, and the Constituency AIDS Control Committees at district and constituency
level, with guidance and oversight from the independent fiduciary agencies.

47.     Good organization; and effective performance monitoring, fiduciary control and
accountability: The project implementation arrangements were practical and well aligned
with NACCs existing decentralized structures. HIV was mainstreamed in the district
development programs with effective coordination, supervision and monitoring of the
response at grassroots levels. Project performance was continually monitored through the
project Results Framework and the Fiduciary Agencies, who provided effective fiduciary
controls (although weak fiduciary capacity of some NACC structures at the decentralized
level posed some challenges).



                                             12
48.     Extensive capacity building: NACC capacity was strengthened through setting up
sound financial and reporting systems, and technical and managerial training for NACC
staff at all levels. The capacity of PSIs to plan, network, coordinate, mobilize local
resources, manage their finances, monitor and report on their sub-projects was enhanced
through technical and advisory services. The Board was trained on how to provide
oversight of the national response

Factors that contributed negatively to implementation of planned activities

49.     Weak capacity of some project sub-implementers (PSIs): The grant proposal
format and very detailed guidelines were technically challenging to some potential
applicants, and inadequate skills in proposal writing in some made it difficult for good
ideas to be funded.

50.      The grant process did not follow intended timelines: Project guidelines envisaged
at least two calls for proposals each year, and grants to be made within two months of the
advertisement. The project was not able to meet these standards, application deadlines were
short, the vetting process took long, and selecting priority areas for various groups proved
difficult. Only five CfPs were done within the life of the project March 2008- June 2014.

51.     Implementation delays: (i) Procurement of essential commodities (bed nets, TB
drugs and condoms) was delayed by slow clearance by the Kenya Bureau of Standards. (ii)
Failure to execute the planned co-financing agreement with DFID delayed project
implementation from 2007-2010. (iii) The volatile political climate in 2007-2008, post-
election violence and activity of vigilante groups in some regions were disruptive. (iv)The
change-over to the new Government, with mergers of some state departments and
expansions of others, also slowed implementation.

52.     NACC Organizational challenges: (i) The NACC was hampered by the lack of an
appropriate legal framework and independence to effectively execute its mandate; (ii)
there was limited staff capacity in regional field offices to cover and support all districts;
(iii) NACC’s planning and performance management functions did not cascade well to
decentralized levels, leading to the general failure of the decentralized structures to develop
local plans was envisaged under the KNASP III; (iv) the Oversight and Performance
Monitoring Committee (OPMC) did not fully succeed in building strong linkages across
different parts of the KNASP program that would help prevent duplication of efforts and
capacity gaps, and steer joint planning processes.

53.      There was no effective coordination of Behavior Change Communication and
Education (BCC/BCE) activities. A BCC consortium was formed but remained inactive for
most of KNASP III implementation. Cultural, social, privacy and religious factors make it
difficult to develop effective messages about HIV; technical and strategic communication
skills to do this are scarce.

54.    It was inherently difficult to reach marginalized groups most at risk for HIV
(MARPs). Lack of baseline data for MARPs including services being provided was a
challenge. Although Kenya’s Constitution highlights values, human rights and
fundamental freedoms that are essential for advancing the rights of MARPs, there are

                                              13
limited policy and legal enforcement tools for helping address the needs and issues of
MARPs.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

KNASP M&E
55.     A comprehensive National HIV and AIDS M&E framework was developed so all
stakeholders could use one agreed country-level monitoring and evaluation system 9. The
National M&E Framework to a large extent ensured that the national HIV indicators and
targets; subsystems for data collection, entry and reporting as well as coordination of the
M&E national response were in place. Different data collection subsystems were used
including: (a) COBPAR System used by CBOs to capture data on HIV interventions at the
community level, CBO financial resources by source, beneficiary, results areas, and
timeliness and completeness; (b) Behavioral Surveillance Surveys to systematically
monitor behavioral trends and risky behavior patterns over time among MARPs and
capture data on HIV prevalence and related behavior change among MARPs in in hotspots;
(c) Facility-Based Sentinel Sero-prevalence Surveillance Surveys especially for PMTCT;
(d) The Health Management Information System gathered data on HIV prevention, care
and treatment services at all health facility levels including at the community level,
including HIV and STIs prevalence in the general public and MARPs; (e) The KDHS 2014
and KAIS 2012 gathered information on HIV and STI incidence and prevalence, coverage
of services on prevention, mitigation and treatment; and (f) The Kenya HIV and AIDS
Research Coordinating Mechanism (KARSCOM) provided data and information from
various research studies.

Project M&E Design
56.     The project design gave concerted attention to M&E, which had been weak under
KHADREP. The project M&E was designed within the overall context of the KNASP
M&E. By appraisal of TOWA, the NACC had made considerable progress in strengthening
M&E systems. A new community-based monitoring system was designed, with a
comprehensive CBO database, the Program Activity Reporting (COBPAR) System, and
Financial reporting system. Clear procedures and systems were also designed for reporting
by AIDS Control Units (ACU) and key sectoral public sector entities, and for interagency
coordination for national reporting.

57.      The evaluation criteria for the project reflected in the PDO and indicators focused
on inputs, outputs, and outcomes (access and behavior change), but not impact. This would
normally be grounds for criticism, but it can be seen as a sensible decision given the
difficulties of measuring changes in HIV incidence. Most indicators meet the SMART
criteria. The exceptions are the two indicators on sexual behavior (condom use, non-regular
sexual partners) – these rely on self-reported data which are subject to social desirability
bias and not reliable even to measure trends. Biological data are expensive and logistically
challenging to collect, but data on prevalence of selected STIs was expected to be available.

M&E implementation
58.      Despite the delay in project effectiveness, the NACC implemented almost all M&E
activities in the project’s original first-year work plan on schedule using alternative funding
sources, including rolling out the KNASP M&E Framework and the comprehensive
KNASP M&E Implementation Manual and complementary TOWA Project M&E
Implementation Manual. The M&E Division recruited and trained an M&E Coordination
Specialist, a database administrator and analyst/programmer. The COBPAR system
database for grant reporting was made accessible through the NACC’s new local area
network/wide area network (LAN/WAN). Monitoring and Coordination Groups (MCG)
were set up for each priority area, with members from all relevant key implementing
agencies and strategic partners. Formal linkages were created with entities responsible for
other sources of data. The M&E Technical Working Group was revived and actively
coordinated M&E activities, standards and essential funding for M&E. The project funded
the HIV testing module of the KDHS 2007, and part of the costs of the KAIS 2012. NACC
produced a “Data Booklet” summarizing new epidemic information. For most of project
implementation, the M&E systems worked well, and data collection targets were generally
met (details in next section).

M&E data quality
59.     An analysis of the indicators in M&E Framework for KNASP III showed that 22
(40%) out of 55 indicators had baseline targets and 2013 status, hence it was possible to
determine the level of progress. However, 33 (60%) of the indicators lacked baseline
indicators or targets, including indicators for most key populations - MSMs, sex workers,
and IDUs. In some instances the framework used outdated 2003 or 2007 baseline values
which could have changed by the time the plan began to be implemented 10.

60.     The end term review of the KNASP III showed that the reporting subsystems were
utilized. The NACC end term evaluation of the grants and mainstreaming public sector
programs also indicated evidence of a relatively efficient performance, monitoring and
accountability system with 85 percent adequacy of monitoring. All CBOs engaged in HIV
related activities were expected to report their activities to NACC using the COBPAR.
Reporting levels were good, although less so among civil society actors who were not
funded by NACC through the TOWA funds. Although the PSIs were expected to report
every quarter most reports were submitted long after the deadline.

61.    While there was a high rate of reporting from health sector (Pillar 1) and civil
Society (Pillar 3), the reporting rate for the public sector was below 50 percent and the
majority of reporting related to service coverage, not service quality. Concerns were raised
about data quality with respect to completeness, accuracy and double reporting. These were
addressed by the fiduciary agents (mainly FMA and PA) for CSOs funded by TOWA. The
CSOs had the targets set with support from the FMA and were not allowed to proceed to
the next stage, or funded unless they met the targets and resolved any data concerns.

M&E data utilization
62.     All Constituency AIDS Coordination Committees and District Technical
Committees were trained in collecting, analyzing and using data for effective
programming. Current data on the epidemic and response were used in each Joint Annual
Programme review (JAPR) to identify gaps and set priorities for the next year. The MCGs
were responsible for monitoring progress against the results framework. They provided
stakeholders with a forum for cooperation to overcome implementation delays and
bottlenecks as well as making specific recommendations for policy action to the Inter-
agency Coordinating Committee (ICC), for example, to develop specific new guidance for
serving Indigenous People. The data from the KDHS 2007 and KAIS 2012 (partly financed
through the project) guided the priorities and strategies of the new Kenya National Strategic
AIDS Plan. The End Term Review of KNASP III reported that data and results from M&E
and research were used for informed decision making by HIV and AIDS actors in the
country. In particular, the country sharpened the focus on MARPs in response to results
from the 2008/2009 KDHS and the “Know Your Epidemic and Know Your Response”
study which showed increased transmission among key populations and increased HIV
prevalence among married couples. The controversial message ‘Tia Condom Mpangoni’
(ensure you have a condom in your plan) was one such message developed to respond to
the evidence. The data also informed key messages about VMMC in Nyanza and Turkana.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

63.     Safeguard compliance under the project was Satisfactory: The project was
appraised as a Category B project. As a repeater project, the TOWA Project used existing
arrangements for safeguards issues, which had been successfully implemented under the
KHADREP. The national medical waste management action plan was updated and
disclosed and implemented under the Health Sector Support Project. Enhanced concerns
about Indigenous People triggered Safeguard policy OP 4.10 during preparation for the
additional financing, on the criterion of being structurally subordinate to the dominant
societies and the state, leading to marginalization and discrimination. An Indigenous
People Planning Framework (IPPF) was prepared, disclosed on the Borrower’s website
and in the World Bank’s Info Shop, and successfully implemented through targeted
assistance in local sub-projects.

64.     Financial Management (FM) compliance under the project is rated
Satisfactory: The FMA provided oversight on all aspects of grant management, including
managing the grant award process, making financial payments to subproject grant
recipients and collecting and verifying financial and program monitoring data. The
subproject grant recipients were required to submit quarterly targets per indicator. Funding
flows according to detailed work plans and budgets were linked to the indicator quarterly
targets. The FMA field officers at provincial level built capacity of the subproject grant
recipients and monitored their performance in FM. Disbursements of both the original and
additional financing improved over time. Recognizing the adequacy of the FM and
disbursement arrangements of the Project managed by qualified accounting staff under the
NACC, a recommendation was made to use existing FM arrangements as per the original
project appraisal document for the Additional Financing credit.



                                             16
65.     Procurement compliance was Moderately Unsatisfactory: Procurement of
essential commodities faced many delays and challenges in the early years of the project
due to weak NACC capacity at national and local levels. In 2010, during preparation of the
additional financing, the procurement risk remained “high”. Alternative mechanisms of
procurement were sought through the UN. Although these also faced substantial delays, a
decision was made to continue procurements with the UN agencies. Subsequently,
KEMSA’s capacity was strengthened through IDA support to the Ministry of Health, and
later procurements for the TOWA project were done successfully through KEMSA.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

66.     Transition arrangements are cause for concern, especially regarding funding. The
HIV response in Kenya has benefitted from a clear national strategic agenda to which all
partners have contributed in a coordinated manner. Sustaining the gains made through
Kenya’s national response is an urgent challenge. The NACC has put in place transition
arrangements to try and ensure financial sustainability, institutional sustainability, and
political sustainability of the gains made under the TOWA project.

67.     Financial Sustainability: Most funding for HIV in Kenya has come from external
sources, (Global Fund to Fight HIV and AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM), Presidential
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), World Bank credits, JICA and DFID), with
the government contributing about 18 percent. To cope with the phasing out of external
funding, Kenya has set up an HIV Trust/Investment Fund. An HIV investment unit was set
up in the NACC in fiscal year 2015/16 to plan how to source and leverage funding. The
HIV Fund is expected to implement innovative financing mechanisms to raise resources
that will be ring-fenced for high priority areas and interventions and underfunded areas
within the HIV response as identified in Kenya’s Strategic Framework. Strong efforts are
being made to ensure value for money through improving the efficiency and effectiveness
of HIV services. Kenya is also seeking to learn how other countries are financing their
HIV/AIDS programs and promoting cost effective cost-saving models of HIV service
delivery.

68.     Institutional Sustainability: With the ongoing devolution, NAC is making efforts
to ensure that resources are allocated to HIV and AIDS programs. NACC will continue to
advocate for HIV in the country, and to provide strategic guidance and technical support,
coordination and mobilization of resources, while the HIV and AIDS services will be
funded from County Budgets. NACC has met with Country Governors to lobby for
increased HIV funding, and there are ongoing negotiations with the National Government.
Follow-up is needed to ensure County budgets include clear budget lines for HIV and are
able to effectively respond to HIV prevention and control. NACC is seeking ways to sustain
the investment in strengthened governance, institutional structures, M&E capacity and
other capacity of various service providers.

69.    Political Sustainability: In response to the political changes, NACC has set up an
HIV framework rather than an HIV plan. Recognizing the constitutional role of the
Counties in funding and implementing HIV activities, NACC has been helping each
Country develop HIV plans, with the help of partners especially UNAIDS, other
development partners. NAC is advocating for HIV and AIDS through continuous dialogue

                                           17
and mobilization of Government including the Office of the President, the First Lady,
Members of Parliament, County Governors and County First Ladies to ensure political
sustainability of HIV and AIDS support in the counties and the country.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation - Rating: High

70.     Relevance of the original and revised objectives remains High. Kenya still has
a severe and heterogeneous HIV epidemic, with high levels of malaria in parts of the
country. The objectives are fully consistent with Kenya’s Investment Program for the
Economic Recovery Strategy pillar-2 and 3 which focus on continued efforts to reduce the
spread of HIV and improving governance respectively; (b) KNASP II 2005/06-2009/10
that focused on prevention of new infections; improving the quality of life of people
infected and affected by HIV and AIDS; and mitigating the socio-economic impact;
continued in KNASP III 209/10-2012/13 and KASF 2014/2015-2018-2019; (c) other
national policies: the Vision 2030 health goals; National Malaria Policy and Malaria
Strategy 2009-13; National Guidelines for Comprehensive Management of Health Risks
and Consequences of Drug Use aimed at providing guidance on improving the
effectiveness of Needle Syringe Programs (NSP), Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST) and
other prevention programs for MARPs; and the Education Sector Policy on HIV and AIDS
that aims to develop programs to enhance HIV prevention, care and support for school
pupils and education personnel. The objectives also align with the joint Bank-IFC CAS
pillars on strengthening public sector management and accountability, monitoring and
evaluation capacity; and investing in people for poverty reduction including continued
support for the HIV and AIDS response; the World Bank Kenya Country Partnership
Strategy FY 2010-2013; and the United Nations General Assembly targets for scaling up
HIV prevention, treatment, care and support, and mitigation of its socio-economic impacts
for achievement of Millennium Development Goal (MDG)#6.

71.      Project design relevance is rated high. The detailed results chains in the PAD and
Project Paper links the project development outcomes to intermediate results; project
activities were carefully chosen for their expected contribution to these results. The strong
focus on community action and annual priority setting through the JAPR to guide each
grant round maintained strong targeting on the needs of population groups where current
data indicated most new infections were occurring. Components to improve governance,
coordination and implementation capacity proved their continued relevance over the
project life. During restructuring, the project design was explicitly reaffirmed.

72.     Implementation arrangements remain substantially relevant. The TOWA
project was designed as an integral part of the implementation of the KNASP II and III,
specifically to support scaling up priority targeted HIV prevention and socio economic
interventions, and strengthening the NACC. The implementation arrangements remained
the same after restructuring and were integrated within NACC and its decentralised
structures with clear division of roles and responsibilities. NACC remained focused on its
key mandate of coordination and ensuring and enhancing stakeholder participation. The
project through the JAPR and other NACC committees at national and decentralised levels

     nurtured and supported strong partnerships with stakeholders including development
     partners.

     73.    Overall rating of relevance is high: Given the high relevance of objectives and
     design and substantial relevance in implementation, project relevance is rated as high.

     3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (Efficacy)

     74.     The original and revised PDOs define outcomes (expanded coverage and access) to
     be achieved that are very directly linked to output indicators. These are expected to reduce
     new infections through behavior change, but, as noted above, no data are available for the
     two behavior change outcome indicators (condom use and non-regular sexual partners
     among young people). The data reported below documents that most other indicator targets
     were exceeded. The question of whether these outputs and outcomes can reliably be
     attributed to the project rather than to other funding rests on the reliability of the data
     sources. Four factors promote confidence in the data: the use of independent agents and
     audits, the joint annual reviews at which project monitoring data and progress were openly
     discussed with all partners and stakeholder representatives; routine Bank procedures for
     procurement review and payments; and NACC’s commissioning of an independent
     assessment of the project at its end. Grant sub-implementers had to report quarterly and
     submit original receipts and activity returns to the FMA, the independent audits verified
     reporting. The original PDO also specified that the project result in sustained improvement
     of the NACC’s performance, and defined clear measurable associated indicators; and that
     the project should contribute to implementing the national AIDS plan. The links between
     project activities and these two outcomes are also direct, their achievement is assessed in
     subsequent paragraphs. No objectives or targets for impact on the epidemic were defined,
     (such as reduced HIV incidence) which is difficult to measure, available data are presented
     below.

     Original PDO 1: Sustaining the improved institutional performance of the NACC

     75.      During the initial years of the project, NACC achieved improvements in
     institutional performance, although not all the targets for the outcome, intermediate
     outcome, and output indicators were fully achieved before the November 2010
     restructuring (Tables 6, 7). Improved M&E performance has been described above. The
     NACC composite score on the annual independent performance evaluation was “good”,
     short of the target of “very good”. The target proportion of overall targets met for NACC-
     funded programs in civil society/private sector (beneficiaries) and public sector
     (beneficiaries) was fully achieved with achievement rates of 103 percent and 147 percent
     respectively (Table 6).

     76.     By the 2010 project restructuring, seven of the 12 original intermediate outcome
     targets were fully achieved or exceeded, one fell slightly short (Table 7, line 10), and four
     indicators were either in process or not yet due.

     77.     Output targets in 3 of 5 areas were achieved or exceeded, there were shortfalls in
     the other two (See Table 2b, Annex 2 for more details):
     • Eleven costed annual work plans were developed, surpassing the target of 10.
     • The 1,722 civil society and private sector organizations supported per year fell short of
         the target of 2,500; the cumulative number of 2,372 was 40% of the target of 5,900.

         11,800
•        15 million male and female condoms were being distributed monthly, well above the
         target of 13 million
•        7 public sector organizations were supported in mainstreaming, well below the target
         of 21

78.    NACC’s institutional performance was sustained and improved after restructuring.
Table 8 shows all five targets for NACC performance on governance and coordination met
or exceeded by the end of the project, as measured by independent audits and surveys.
NACC was able to develop KNASP III, the Kenya AIDS Strategic Framework 2014/2015
- 2018/2019, a National AIDS Spending Assessment (NASA) and the HIV and AIDS
Sustainable Financing Paper. The independent 2014 end term review of KNASP III noted
that NACC successfully spearheaded day-to-day coordination of KNASP III
implementation.

79.     In executing its coordination mandate, NACC was supported by the Inter-Agency
Coordinating Committee (ICC) 11 and the OPMC. The ICC effectively coordinated the
JAPR; ensured inclusion of all development partners, (i.e., the Global Fund Country
Coordinating Mechanism, TOWA-World Bank, Government of Kenya, UK- Department
for International Development (DFID), Joint UN Team, Development Partners for Health,
GAVI, including Private sector and Civil society umbrella organizations.




11
   The ICC was a multi-stakeholder forum that oversaw the national prevention, treatment, social
protection and other sub-committees that monitored and coordinated delivery of the higher-level results. It
included representatives from key national ministries, faith-based communities, People Living with HIV,
the private sector, NGOs, and other civil society groups.

                                                      21
80.     The project achieved this objective largely through: strengthening NACC strategic
leadership, governance and management capacity through training and new monitoring and
information systems; provision of advisory and technical services; and incremental
operating costs for the NACC Secretariat and its decentralized structures; and the extensive
and carefully managed grant program with annual strategic targeting to define priority
results areas for the interventions.

Original PDO 2: Implementation of the KNASP

81.     KDHS 2009 data for two of the original PDO 2 key outcome indicators was not
available to measure the two behavior change indicators (Table 9). Given the unreliability
of self-reported data on sexual behavior and that distribution of condoms does not
guarantee their use, most weight is given to indicator 3. By November 2010, 4.5 million
people had benefited from the project support, of whom 61 percent receiving counseling
and testing, 25 percent received targeted behavior change communications, and 14 percent
received specialized HIV services (Annex 2). Through the community grants mechanism,
2.7 million people were counseled and tested. The project made a major contribution to
increasing the number of people knowing their HIV status, particularly in higher risk
groups, and their being able to access prevention services, treatment, care and support.

82.     Scale up of HIV prevention and mitigation interventions greatly exceeded project
targets (Table 10), reaching 22 million people in all. The project funded 10,712 sub-project
grants to civil society/private sector Project Sub-Implementers (PSIs) -- 98% of the 10,912
proposals approved, and 128 percent of the target (Table 10 line 1), with steady increases
throughout the project (Figure 1). The total cost of US$53.308 million was close to planned
expenditure of US$ 53.175 million. The project accounted for about one third of the 29,157

         83.     KDHS 2014 data for the two original PDO 2 key outcome indicators was not
         available. A proxy condom use indicator from KAIS 2012 showed very large increases in
         reported condom use at first sex among women and men age group 15-24 years compared
         to KAIS 2007: from 26% to 67% for women and from 29% to 58% for men. While in this
         self-reported data has very large confidence intervals, the very large increase suggests that
         there may in fact have been an improvement.

84.     The ‘Know Your Epidemic, Know Your Response’ analysis done in 2008 showed
the need to target MARPs. The study showed that MSMs contributed 15% of new
infections; FSWs and their clients 14%; and IDUs 4% of new infections. Greater attention
was then given to MARPs, but there were no reliable MARP size estimations across the
country, or data on what services reached them. The lack of data on MARPs was a major
bottleneck for effective targeting and programming. A more recent mapping study
estimated that MARPs accounted for 33 percent of new infections among adults (CGPH et
al, 2012).

85.      Under the TOWA, 16 percent (1228) of the civil society/private sector grants
targeted MARPS (13 percent / US$6.9 million of total grant expenditure) in line with the
KNASP III prioritization of MARPS for HIV prevention and care. More than 7.5 million
MARPs were reached. Support under TOWA greatly contributed to increased uptake of
HIV services by MARPs over the period 2008 to 2013 with: (i) 1,616,585 MARPs
mobilized and sensitized on HIV and AIDS –121% of the target of 1,332,145; (ii) 999,143
(113%) against an initial target of 878,360 of MARPs were counselled and tested; (iii) 3,006
-- 108% OF THE ORIGINAL TARGET OF 2,779 PEER EDUCATORS WERE TRAINED TO PROVIDE HIV and AIDS preventive
education; and (iv) MARPs received 3,438,288 condoms, 118% of the target of
2,904,408 12. For more achievements of MARPs reached under the TOWA –see table 2c in
annex 2.

86.    HCT: The project reached 5.6 million individuals with counselling and testing
annually (32 times the target) and 983,166 couples (155 times the target) (see Table 10).
Overall the percentage of people ever testing for HIV more than doubled over the life-cycle
of the project and KNASP III from 34% in 2008 to 72% in 2012 (KAIS 2012).

87.     The 322 million condoms procured and distributed under the project was more than
twice the target (Table 10). Focused targeting resulted in 4.9 million youths reached with
HIV prevention messages under TOWA, 14 times the target, with increased reach
throughout project implementation. Provision of palliative care to 10,574 people was three
times the target (Table 10).

88.     Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC): The number of people reached
with behavior change communication messages on VMMC under the Total War on HIV
and AIDS (TOWA) for the period 2008/2013 rose to 243,403(117%) of the original target
of 207,413. 11,754 males (140%) were provided with or referred to VMMC services
against an originally planned target population of 8,399 males; 2,258 (110%) people were
trained to support VMMC against a target of 2,040 13.

89.    Overall, the VMMC prevalence rose from 85% in 2007 to 91% in 2012 nationally,
and from 48% to 66% in Nyanza (KAIS 2012).

Specialized HIV and AIDS Services
90.    A total 854,272 people benefited from other specialized services at a total cost of
US$ 2.54 million. This included: (i) palliative care to PLWHA (reported above); (ii)
outreach, education and condom promotion and provision to 1,440 community leaders and
80,000 community members of vulnerable and marginalized groups (VMG); (iii) support
for 43,481 orphans and vulnerable children (OVC, see Figure 3); and (iv) services to
prevent mother-to-child transmission for 403,097 mothers. However, only 9 in 1000 OVC
received at least one type of OVC support (KAIS 2012), and the 53 percent of pregnant
women who accessed PMTCT service was below the KNASP III target.

Public Sector Mainstreaming

91.     The project provided US$2.95 million to 51 public sector institutions, matching
their own funds mobilized through the MTEF process, to scale up planned HIV
mainstreamed interventions in the public sector in line with KNASP II and III priorities.
Although this component fell short of targets, achievements included:
• Establishment of ACUS (although structural, staffing, and organizational challenges
    impeded their ability to mainstream HIV within their Ministries/Agencies).
• Increased sensitization on HIV and AIDS through peer education and distribution of
    IEC materials
• Development of Work place HIV policy
• Increased distribution of condoms
• HIV stigma at the work place was openly discussed to encourage positive attitudes
    towards people living with HIV (PLHIV); the Kenya Network of Positive Teachers and
    the Kenya Prison Service ACU are good examples.

92.     Overall achievement of revised PDO#1 is rated satisfactory given the many
outcome indicators on prevention and mitigation measures that were achieved or surpassed;
the numbers of beneficiaries reached through targeting of high risk populations using drop-
in centers, support groups and networks, wellness centers, and stand alone and integrated
sites providing HIV-related services for MARPs and a Human rights approach to increase
demand and access to services by MARPs; the strategic and financial support to PSIs
focusing on initiatives in line with the KNASP and responding to priorities and targets
identified through the JAPR based on set criteria; the increased supply and strong uptake
of VMMC services through early and continuous engagement and sensitization of local
community leaders/elders, politicians, youth, and women’s groups on the importance of
VMMC in HIV prevention. In addition, linkages and relationship among stakeholders for
concerted effort against HIV and AIDS were enhanced -- a key factor in the dramatic
increase in HCT was the effectiveness of the HCT Technical Working Group in pulling all
partners together.

Revised PDO2: Expand access to bed nets among targeted People Living with HIV and
AIDS and other households in malaria risk areas.

93.    The project procured and distributed 2.88 million Insecticide-treated bed nets
(ITNs) in eight high malaria burden counties 14. Cumulatively, 5.25 million individuals
(500,000 PLHIVs through targeted support and 4.75 million through mass distribution) in
malaria endemic areas were reached with an ITN under the project (assuming that two
people would use each ITN provided through general distribution, and one beneficiary per
ITN in targeted distribution).

       purchased and/or distributed.                                              Distribution Reports)

94.     The post distribution survey found that 91.7 percent of households in the endemic
areas own at least 1 bed net; over 75 percent of the households own 2 bed nets. According
to the World Malaria Report 2014, access to treated nets, improved testing and effective
treatment of malaria are credited with success against malaria in Kenya and globally.
(Rainfall is also an important factor.) Malaria deaths in Kenya have fallen steadily from
26,017 deaths in 2010 to only 135 deaths in 2013, despite over two million cases of malaria
infection recorded in Kenya in 2013 (14th highest in Africa).

95.     Procurement and distribution of other essential commodities: The project also
procured and distributed US$1.9 million worth of drugs to help strengthen the response to
TB in Kenya. All TB patients were screened for HIV and all HIV positive people were
screened for TB and those found positive were put on treatment. Over 100,000 patients
benefited from these drugs.

96.     Based on the high coverage of bed nets in high malaria endemic areas, achievement
of revised PDO 2 is rated Satisfactory. Considering data on actual use of bednets (from
the malaria beneficiary survey), and noting that other factors may have contributed (such
as low rainfall and improved health seeking behavior and treatment) it is plausible that the
highly successful distribution of bednets contributed to considerably lower incidence of
malaria and reduced morbidity and mortality from malaria in children under five and
pregnant women in two of the three targeted areas.

KNASP III Outcomes during the life of TOWA Project that indicate impact to
which the project contributed.

97.     BCC was one of the key HIV preventive strategies in KNASP III. The end term
review of KNASP III showed non-achievement of many prevention outcome targets
including low consistent condom use, but notable gains in decreased prevalence among
youth, and strong increases in HIV testing, uptake of male circumcision, and prevention of
mother-to-child transmission.
  • 30.1 million people were sensitized on HIV through BCC or HCT (youth, MARPs,
     couples, and general public)
  • There was no difference among young people (women and men combined) aged 15
     to 24 years reporting sexual debut before the age of 15 years in KAIS 2007 (24%)
     and KAIS 2012 (21%). However, significantly fewer men aged 15-24 reported sexual

                                                    27
     debut before the age of 15 years (27% in KAIS 2012 compared with 347% in KAIS
     2007).
 •   Reported condom use at first sex among women and men aged 15–24 years was 67%
     and 58%, respectively in KRAIS 2012; much higher than the 26% among women and
     29% in men in KAIS 2007. Condom use among youth aged 15 to 24 years was
     significantly lower for women and men who had their sexual debut before age 15
     years (53% and 34% respectively) than for those who had their sexual debut at 15
     years or older (70% and 65% respectively).

98.    VMMC: The percentage of men circumcised in the country rose from 85% in 2007
to 91% in 2012 and from 48% in Nyanza district to 66% (KAIS, 2012).

99.     Increased HCT uptake: The levels of HIV testing in adults aged 15 to 64 years
more than doubled, from 34 percent in 2007 to 72 percent in 2012, close to Kenya’s
national goal of 80 percent coverage by 2013 (KAIS 2012). Women were more likely to
have ever been tested for HIV (80 percent) than men (63 percent). Knowledge of HIV
status among HIV-infected persons tripled from 16 percent in 2007 to 47 percent in 2012.
The TOWA contributed about 15 percent of all national counseling and testing.

100. Prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) coverage increased from
73% in 2009 to 90% in 2012. The MTCT had fallen to 10-15% over five years from 27%,
as per the early infant diagnosis (EID) program implementation data (NASCOP 2012).

101. Decreased HIV incidence: Overall HIV incidence was stable between 2007 and
2012 and across all age groups at 0.5 new infections /100 persons/year. Among young men
and women aged 15-24 years incidence declined from 1.1% in 2007 to 0.9% in 2012.

102. Decreased HIV prevalence: According to KAIS 2012, HIV prevalence continued
to decline slowly among younger age groups. HIV prevalence among men and women
aged 15 to 49 years decreased from 7.1% in 2007 to 5.6% in 2012 (Figure 6). This is despite
the increase in prevalence that would be expected from expanded access to ART. Among
youths, HIV prevalence declined significantly between 2007 and 2012: from 3.5% in 2007
to 1.1% among young persons aged 15-19 years, and from 7.5% to 4.6% among the 20-24
year group.

103. The efficiency analysis draws on peer reviewed literature on cost-effective analysis
of HIV/AIDS and malaria interventions, to assess whether the project funds were allocated
efficiently, to interventions for which there is strong evidence, and whether the project
activities achieved value for money in the way they were implemented. Allocative
efficiency was served by strategic targeting of project resources based on careful analysis
of the epidemic and response during project preparation, and reallocation of resources
during implementation to the activities that were showing the best progress and results; and
in response to evidence-driven adjustment in HIV response priorities, such as the strong
focus on rapid expansion of VCT during the final three years of the project.

Cost effectiveness analysis of Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT),
distribution of condoms, and male circumcision

104. Condom use is a significant determinant of survival for HIV positive people and
an effective means of HIV prevention. In Kenya, about 45% of new HIV infections occur
among men and women aged between 25-44 years 15, most due to unprotected sex. The
number of new infections in Kenya was estimated as 98,000 in 2013 16. HIV positive people
using condoms faced a 52.8% lower risk of death compared to patients not using condoms,
even when the same were on ARTS 17. A total of 332.85 million condoms were distributed
through the project. There were minimal condom stocks lost in the supply chain. This
applies also to the bed nets provided through the project - the number of condoms and
LLINs procured matched the number of the commodities delivered and distributed. The
project used the existing national distribution arrangements to deliver LLINs, a further
efficiency that avoided duplication.

105. An article published in The Lancet in 2000 provided an estimate of the cost-
effectiveness of HIV counselling and testing in Kenya. 18 It reported results of a controlled
trial which suggested that Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT) 10,000 people in
Kenya could avert 1104 infections in the following year, at an average cost per HIV
infection averted of US$ 249, and cost per Disability Adjusted Life Year of only US$13-
27. Sensitivity and economic analysis by the researchers indicated that it would be most
cost-effective to target HIV positive people (who do not know their status), women, and

  Sweat et al, 2000. Cost-effectiveness analysis of voluntary HIV counselling and testing in reducing
sexual transmission of HIV in Kenya and Tanzania, Lancet 356: 113-121. A 2012 review of literature
published between 1990 and 2010 concluded that there was “growing evidence that VCT can change HIV-
related sexual risk behaviors thereby reducing HIV-related risk, and confirming its importance as an HIV
prevention strategy.” Fonner, Denison, Kennedy, Reily and Sweat, 2012, Voluntary counseling and testing
(VCT) for changing HIV-related risk behavior in developing countries, Cochrane Collaboration, DOI:

couples (especially sero-discordant couples). This research suggests that the 5.25 million
people tested for HIV under the TOWA project was a highly cost-effective intervention.
Applying the Sweat et al estimated parameters, the TOWA project potentially averted
609,960 HIV infections, and may have saved approximately 151 million dollars, if each
averted infection saves USD 249.

106. As noted above, male circumcision (VMMC) reduces risk of HIV transmission by
60%, and is highly cost effective in a high prevalence context like Kenya. 19 AN expert
panel concluded that one HIV infection could be prevented for every five to 15 men
circumcised in settings with high levels of HIV and low rates of male circumcision, at a
cost of US $150 to $900 per HIV infection averted over 10 years. By comparison, estimates
of discounted lifetime treatment costs per HIV infection typically exceed US $7,000. 20
Funding for this project activity meets a very high standard of allocative efficiency. There
is also strong independent evidence of the (technical) efficiency with which VMMC has
been scaled up in Kenya, through a focused implementation strategy using outreach sites
and fixed clinical facilities supported by multiple implementing agencies within regions
with the highest HIV prevalence and lowest male circumcision rates, supplemented by
services provided via mobile sites to deliver VMMC in underserved areas. 21 A peer-
reviewed assessment of VMMC facility preparedness and correct performance of
procedures in 2011 and 2012 in four countries found that Kenya maintained high levels of
service quality at-scale, scoring generally higher than the 3 other countries (although
shortages in drugs for HIV post-exposure prophylaxis and antibiotics were noted). In a
systematic assessment of six clinical efficiency indicators, almost all facilities sampled in
Kenya met three indicators, and the authors reported that “in Kenya the results have
contributed to revamping of the theatre environment, use of commercially-bundled kits
with disposable instruments, and more frequent supervisory visits to assure quality”, i.e.,
adoption of other efficiency measures. 22

107. Grants: In addition to strategic targeting of project resources based on careful
analysis of the epidemic and response, allocative efficiency was also served by the annual
selection of priority results for each round of grants. Over 11,000 grants were funded,
selected from more than 27,000 proposals. Training project sub-implementers (PSIs),
competition for grants, and restricting participation to PSIs with proven track records, all
contributed to efficiency. PSI skill training included leadership, proposal writing, financial
management, budgeting and budgetary execution, networking and advocacy. Increased PSI

efficiency is evident in improvements in target achievement by PSIs from 69% in rounds
1, 2 and 3 to 89% in rounds 4 and 5. The average grant amount was US$5,000, the unit
costs of the services delivered through the grants was kept low because many grant
implementers were volunteers or local workers on modest stipends.

108. The grant program also provides an example of NACC’s effort to improve
efficiency during implementation. Initially, EPOS Health Management, a German
consulting firm, was contracted to continuously monitor the performance of PSI, and
ensure conformity with approved work plans. Approximately 541,128 USD was allocated
for this. EPOS audited 2002 PSI in two years. After two years, the model was changed,
and individual local consultants were contracted to conduct performance audits. Within
four months, the local consultants audited 1500 PSI, about 75% of the number audited by
EPOS over two years. This was efficient and cost saving, and contributed to capacity
building in Kenya. The Internal Audit Unit of NACC investigated CSOs identified by the
performance auditors with fiduciary irregularities or other performance constraints.
Between 2011 and the project end, a total of 950 CSOs were identified for investigation
(8% of all grantees). The final ISR reported that 559 (59%) had been checked and cleared
by the Internal Audit Department, 374 CSOs (39%) cases were still open, and only 8 had
needed to be reported to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission.

109. This assessment of the allocative and implementation efficiency of many of the
project activities and components suggests that a rating of satisfactory is warranted.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

110. The project registered clear achievements across service delivery areas and met its
development objectives as measured by achievements of project indicators and most
intermediate outcome indicators for both the original and the revised project objectives.

    3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

    Poverty and Gender Aspects

    111. The Project addressed poverty and inequity by expanding access to prevention and
    mitigation services among underserved populations (see annex 2). Increased access to HIV
    treatment, care and support services is likely to have improved the quality of life of people
    affected and infected with HIV. The income-generating activities provided to 5016
    households with OVCs (104% of the target) through the project directly reduced poverty,
    and the life-prospects of children who the project enabled to stay in school.

    112. National HIV prevalence among the age group 15-65 years is estimated to be 5.6%,
    equivalent to 1.2 million Kenyans (KAIS 2012). HIV prevalence among women is higher
    (6.9%) than for men (4.4%); women are 58% of all people living with HIV (NACC and
    NASCOP, 2012). Young women aged 20-24 years are three times more likely to be
    infected than young men of the same age group. HIV prevalence is six times higher in
    adolescent girls aged 15-19 than in adolescent boys. The strengthened M&E systems
    collected gender disaggregated data to enable women and girls to be targeted to address
    gender disparity. In consultation with development partners and other stakeholders, the
    Government took deliberate actions to create a gender-sensitive decision-making
    environment in the HIV response. These included: developing a gender mainstreaming
    action plan, and implementing recommendations from the HIV Prevention Summit for
    Women.

    113. Sexual Gender Based Violence (SGBV) and Gender Based Violence (GBV) remain
    as critical drivers of the epidemic, with women and young girls bearing the greatest brunt.
    At least 1 in 5 Kenyan women (20.5%) experienced GBV in 2010 compared to 15.9% in


                                                      32
2003 23. However, positive gains have been made. HIV prevalence in young women fell
faster than in young men between KAIS 2007 and 2012. Women are more likely to have
been tested than men (80% versus. 63%).

114. Gender power imbalances are still drivers of the epidemic. Inequities that reduce
women’s opportunities and intensify their vulnerability to HIV infection continue to be
experienced, including acute unmet need for family planning and other sexual and
reproductive health services, which potentially limit their access to health information,
condoms, and support in negotiating safe sex.

Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

115. The strengthened capacity among the PSIs created confidence in development
partners and financing institutions to channel resources through them for implementing
HIV programs. For example, GFATM through the Red Cross asked the most effective
TOWA sub-implementers to become lead implementing agents for activities funded by
GFATM.

116. Communities gained socio-economic benefits from the grant mechanism that
provided IGA to women and OVCs to enhance sustainability of funded interventions, with
continued benefits in the future from profitable IGAs. However, there is room to improve
the setting and management of these IGAs.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Beneficiary Survey to Assess Impact on LLIN Ownership and Use (Revised PDO 2):

117. Post LLINs Distribution Results: The National Malaria Strategy 2009-2017
principally aims at reducing morbidity and mortality caused by malaria by two thirds
between 2007/2008 and 2017. An important strategic approach to achieve this goal was to
protect at least 80% of people living in malaria risk areas by appropriate malaria prevention
interventions with Long-lasting Insecticide treated nets (LLIN) by 2013.

118. Household ownership of any type of net or campaign LLIN: Net ownership
increased after the mass net campaign. The average number of any type of net per
household increased from 1.0 (KMIS 2010) to 2.8 in rural areas; the same is noted in
average number of LLINs owned per household from 0.9 in 2010 to 2.7 as seen in the
evaluation. In the three malaria endemic zones, ownership of at least one net of any type
increased as follows: Lake region increased from 70.7% (KMIS 2010) to 88.3, Coast region
from 69.6% to 86.7%, Highland region from 59.5% to 85.7%.

119. Ownership of at least one LLIN in the Lake endemic region increased from 54.4%
in 2010 to 83.4%, in the Coast endemic region from 56.5% to 82.6%, and in the Highland
region from 48.5% to 83.5%. The average number of LLINs owned per household more
than doubled to: 2.24 in Lake endemic region, 2.15 in Coast endemic, and 2.51 in

     Kenya National Behavioral Survey 2010.

Highlands region. The results show equitable distribution of nets across the wealth quintiles
therefore enabling the poorest to access LLINs equally to the rich.

120. Household retention of campaign LLIN: There was equal ownership of nets in
rural (93.8%) and urban areas (92.7%). In both urban and rural settings, the mean nets
distributed per household were the same three (3) which conforms to 62.5% of the
households receiving three or more nets at the distribution point. Although some nets were
disposed of by households after the mass net campaign, the pattern of LLIN ownership
across wealth quintiles differed little with the lowest quintile recording ownership at
90.6%, and the highest quintile recording 91.4%.

121. Net usage: Use of LLIN the previous night in the endemic areas was reported at
36.5% of all household members, with Lake reporting lower usage of 30.4% compared to
35.5 in Highland, and 49.8% in Coast. Overall use of LLIN was low among the children
aged below five years (29.3%) and 5-14 years (29.7%) compared with other age groups.
Still focusing on children under 5 years, usage in rural areas was lower (27.5%) than in
urban areas (39.6%), and lowest in the Lake area at 16.3% compared to Highland (28.3%)
and Coast (53.9%). This is a major concern for malaria prevention through use of LLIN in
the Lake region where malaria is most prevalent and a major killer disease in children.

122. Reduced Malaria Incidence: The End Term Review of the KNASP showed
reduced Malaria incidence in both Coast and Highland endemic regions - post distribution,
consistent with reported increased use of nets.

Stakeholder Workshops:
123. During the project the NACC engaged stakeholders through consultative
workshops. Two National workshops were held among the various Fiduciary agents
including the Performance Auditor, Financial Management Agency, Procurement Agency
and Independent Compliance Verification Agency together with the World Bank and
NACC staff. NACC held consultations with: 290 CACC Coordinators, the parliamentary
Committee on Health and the Project Management Unit; and all 47 Governors of the 47
Kenyan counties in the face of devolution in Kenya in September 2014. The 47 Governors
agreed to increase the allocation of county budgets to HIV, especially to benefit mothers
and children; and to rely on NACC to provide technical support on County specific needs
As part of TOWA project closure, NACC held brought together development partners,
government agencies, implementers and other stakeholders to discuss issues arising from
the implementation of the project. The detailed findings and results of the consultative
meetings and conferences and the beneficiary survey can be found in Annex 7. In summary,
the closure workshop noted: (a) project objectives had been achieved; (b) the importance
of its decentralized design and its ability to reach and impact communities; (c) the
appreciation of the World Bank’s proactivity and rigor in supervising and guiding the
project; and (d) concern about the sustainability of the achievements and activities
supported under the project.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial


                                             34
127. The risk is Substantial that the PDO achievements will not be sustained, because
of inadequate funding. International resources contributed 80 – 84 percent of the funding
for KNASP III, but most donor support/agreements have ended or will end soon. The
NACC has however, put in place transition arrangements for resource mobilization to
ensure continued support to the gains made under the TOWA project, and also to try and
ensure the institutional and political sustainability of Kenya’s HIV programs.

124. Financial Sustainability: Most funding for HIV in Kenya has come from external
sources, (Global Fund to Fight HIV and AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM), Presidential
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), World Bank credits, JICA and DFID), with
the government contributing about 18 percent. To cope with the phasing out of external
funding, Kenya has set up an HIV Trust/Investment Fund. An HIV investment unit was set
up in the NACC in fiscal year 2015/16 to focus on developing a model to source and
leverage funding. The HIV Fund is expected to implement innovative financing
mechanisms to draw new resources that will be ring-fenced for high priority areas and
interventions and underfunded areas within the HIV response as identified in Kenya’s
Strategic Framework. Secondly, strong efforts are being made to ensure value for money
through improving the efficiency and effectiveness of HIV services. Third, through policy
dialogue, Kenya is seeking to learn how other countries are financing their HIV/AIDS
programs and promoting cost effective cost-saving models of HIV service delivery.

125. Institutional Sustainability: With the ongoing devolution, NAC has made efforts
and will continue to ensure that resources are allocated to HIV and AIDS programs. NACC
will continue to advocate for HIV in the country, provide strategic guidance and technical
support, coordination and mobilization of resources, while the HIV and AIDS services will
be funded from County Budgets. NACC has met with Country Governors to lobby for
increased HIV funding, and there are still ongoing negotiations with the Government.
Follow-up is needed to ensure County budgets include clear budget lines for HIV and
Counties are able to effectively respond to HIV prevention and control. NACC is seeking
ways to sustain the investment in strengthened governance, institutional structures, M&E
capacity and capacity building of various service providers.

126. Political Sustainability: In response to the political changes, NACC has set up an
HIV framework rather than an HIV plan. Recognizing the constitutional role of the
Counties in funding and implementing HIV activities, NACC has been helping each
Country to come up with their HIV plans, with the help of partners especially UNAIDS,
other development partners and also earlier using TOWA funding. NAC has begun its
advocacy for HIV and AIDS through continuous dialogue and mobilization of Government
including the Office of the President, the First Lady; Members of Parliament, County
Governors and County First Ladies to ensure political sustainability of HIV and AIDS
support in the counties and the country.

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

127. Although preparation of the TOWA project was done in a difficult context marred
by poor governance and corruption, the project preparation and design was consultative,
evidence based, and thorough. The team performed very well in delivering a project that
was fully aligned with Government and Bank priorities and global development goals. The
design was informed by robust wide ranging analysis including of the prevailing political,
governance and corruption situation in the country and the disease burden of HIV and
AIDS. Project design fully reflected the lessons learned from the KHADREP and previous
Bank supported HIV and AIDS projects including recommendations from the DIR, the
2005 IEG review of Bank AIDS support, and lessons from AIDS projects and programs
supported by other development partners. During project design, the team ensured that they
complied with requirements and criteria established for “repeater projects” under the MAP.

128. The fiduciary assessment of capacities in procurement and financial management
were thorough. Capacity building initiatives were based on the identified implementation
arrangements to ensure readiness for implementation. Relevant safeguards were properly
assessed and addressed in the project design. Institutional arrangements were within the
existing NACC and decentralized structures. Design and preparation for improved M&E
received intensive effort.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

129. The team carried out implementation support missions of high quality; the problem-
solving approach of the team is evidenced in mission reports and analysis. Mission teams
included specialists with diverse expertise. A good practice of these missions was the
thorough follow up on decisions taken in previous missions. The Bank team paid special
attention to the fiduciary capacity of the NACC, followed up and made appropriate
recommendations to assist the NACC to fulfill its mandate of project management and
overall coordination of the national response. Through the HIV partnership and JAPRs,
support from development partners was excellent. This, coupled with the enthusiasm and
commitment from the participating institutions helped the NAC implementing team to
proactively manage emerging implementation problems. The team was proactive in
conducting financial and procurement and reviews and monthly review meetings with
NACC to monitor the Implementation progress. The team provided consistently useful
guidance and support to the NACC Secretariat.

(c) Overall Bank Performance - Satisfactory

5.2 Borrower Performance

                                           36
130. Government demonstrated strong commitment and ownership throughout project
development and implementation, and notably to improving governance. Relevant HIV
policies and strategies are in place and were updated as needed. Hiring of additional staff
was timely, but several agencies contributed to delays in hiring fiduciary agents, and the
decentralization towards the end of the project disrupted financial flows and completion of
activities.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance - Satisfactory

131. NACC - There is a general recognition that the national coordination mechanism
for the HIV epidemic has broadly improved and is performing as expected, and that NACC
has provided strategic leadership, oversight and political mobilization for the national
response. The NACC secretariat has also actively managed the day-to-day coordination of
KNASP III implementation, including execution of the decisions of the Board and Inter-
agency Coordinating Committee; convening stakeholder meetings; and coordinating the
decentralized governance systems as expected under KNASP III 24. As mentioned above,
the capacity of NAC was developed with significant support from the project. The staff
showed high level of professionalism and dedication to achievement of the objectives of
the project.

132. During project preparation, the NACC developed an action plan for improving
governance and accountability and put in place four fiduciary agencies namely: an
independent Financial Management Agency; an independent procurement monitoring
Agency; an independent Compliance Verification Agency; and an independent
Performance (‘value for money’) Auditor. The performance of the project was continually
monitored through the Project’s Results Framework and feedback provide to the
implementing agencies.

133. PSIs – The performance of CSOs was Satisfactory. The CSOs showed a high level
of engagement in the fight against HIV and AIDS including their willingness and
commitment to address the challenges of HIV and AIDS at community level. They
demonstrated high levels of transparency and accountability in implementing the sub-
projects although capacity challenges still remained an issue.

134. Public Sector: Performance of other public sector entities HIV mainstreaming was
moderately unsatisfactory. Disbursements were slow; eventually resources had to be
reallocated to other fast performing activities.

135. RFAs, CACCs and DTCs performance was satisfactory. They facilitated and
supported communities to write fundable proposals, followed up on implementation and
monitored performance.

136. Realistic independent assessment of project progress is an effective mechanism that
improves project management and service delivery. The use of fiduciary Agents to improve
governance and accountability and enhance performance in the implementation of the
project proved very effective in supporting NACC to achieve significant performance in
accountability, monitoring and evaluation; and consequently improved service delivery
and overall efficiency of the PSIs. The institutional strengthening of NACC and its
decentralized structures to continue the performance improvement achieved under the
TOWA project needs to continue and be sustained.

137. Using independent fiduciary and monitoring agents helps to identify problems of
inappropriate use of disbursed funds early on and effectively address them in a timely
manner them rather than waiting for the external audit at the end of the year. This
contributed to efficient use of the project resources and improved accountability. Once
local capacities in the country are built, such support could be sourced from local
consultants at much lower cost.

138. Effective mechanisms to channel resources and technical assistance to the
community level with clear guidelines on required results is an important ingredient to
ensure achievement of sustained results. The project made financial resources available to
civil society, public sector, private sector, universities and research institutions, focusing
on initiatives in line with the KNASP and responding to priorities identified through the
JAPR. The granting mechanism achieved remarkable results. The project now has an
enormous amount of information on experiences under sub granting to PSIs. The use of
PSI for community led interventions supported by grants through CfP is a good innovative
approach of getting resources to beneficiaries. This approach directly involves the affected
and infected persons and enables their participation in interventions that bring added value
to HIV/AIDS at local level. This innovation can be replicated in other areas where similar
Bank support/financing is ongoing.

139. When grassroots communities are facing crisis, it is possible to turn the crises into
opportunities for improving lives in the community. This has been demonstrated under the
project by ensuring that communities own the process and that resources (no matter how
small) are made available and skills are built.

140. Streamlining institutional arrangements and roles during project design, and
providing needed training to fulfill roles is a necessity for avoiding implementation delays:
The project was implemented within NACCs existing devolved national structures
comprising Nine Regional Offices and DTCs coordinated by the District Development
Officer. The DTCs formed the technical arm of the district development level agenda on
HIV and AIDS programs; and the CACCs coordinated and supervised HIV and AIDS
activities at the community/constituency level. Although the project experienced
effectiveness and initial implementation delays, after follow up and capacity building,
implementation picked up. There is need to ensure that continuous capacity building in
maintained in the light of inadequate capacity issues that were identified at the lower levels.

141.    Strong investment in capacity building at all levels is essential to foster local
development impact. Capacity building of Community Based Organizations requires
sustained facilitation and a responsive program. The regional facilitating agencies, district

                                              38
and constituency AIDS committees effectively played this role. Such capacity building
helped some of the CBOs to access funding from other sources. The capacity built at the
community level through the PSIs, RFAs, DTCs and the CACCs allowed communities to
engage in the development processes thereby creating a positive impact on the levels of
poverty among rural communities.

142. It is important to promote domestic financing in the design of critical disease
control initiatives such as HIV/AIDS which require long term resource commitments lest
they are impacted by vagaries of donor financing.

143. Learning by doing and effective use of program data are critical for fine tuning
programs during implementation. This is very well institutionalized in the project through
the Joint Annual Program Reviews which helped to adjust the project inputs.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

144. The rating of the TOWA project as satisfactory and the rating of NACC as
satisfactory based on the on the oversight role NACC provided to the National Response
and the Capacity building for the project implementers is noted. A statement from Mr.
Henry Mutwiri, representative of the National Treasury, noted that the TOWA project was
less problematic than other projects.

(b) Co –financiers

145. The proposed co-financing with DFID did not come through, as noted earlier in this
ICR. However, DFID continued to support capacity building of RFAs during the life of the
project and seconded a staff to World Bank Kenya CO to work on Bank supported HIV
and AIDS projects and programs including policy dialogue.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

Background:
The Total War against HIV and AIDS (TOWA) Project commenced in 2007 and closed
on June 30, 2014. The project was valued at USD 135 million.

                                      41
        The original PDO was to assist Kenya to expand the coverage of targeted HIV and AIDS
        prevention and mitigation interventions through: (a) Sustaining the improved institutional
        performance of the NACC; and (b) Supporting the implementation of the KNASP. The
        project had two components: (a) Strengthening Governance and Coordination Capacity;
        (b) Support for Program Implementation.

        The Revised Project Development Objective was; (i) Expand the coverage of targeted HIV
        and AIDS prevention and mitigation measures and (ii) Expand access to bed nets among
        targeted People Living with HIV and AIDS and other households in malaria risk areas. The
        Project had two components; (1) Strengthening governance and coordination capacity
        with four thematic areas: Strategic Leadership; Accountability and Verification; Evidence
        Based Management; and Capacity Building of Implementing Partners; (2) Program
        Implementation with three thematic areas: Grant Awards; Mainstreaming in Public
        Sector; and Essential Commodities.

              Table 2d: Revisions to Objectives and Indicators

Revised PDO                  The revised Project development Objectives are to: (i) expand the coverage of targeted HIV and
                             AIDS prevention and mitigation measures; and (ii) expand access to bed nets among targeted People
                             Living with HIV and AIDS and other households in malaria risk areas.
Revised Definition of        Success will be measured as the proportion of beneficiaries scoring “Very Good” or “Excellent” for
‘Success” of grants          target achievement. The need to change the definition of “success” arose from confusion with the
under the CFPs               initial grants under the Total War Against HIV and AIDS (TOWA) as to whether the focus should
                             be on the performance of individual grants or the achievement of aggregate targets. The new
                             indicator will measure success at the level of the individual subproject grant beneficiary. However,
                             the end-of-Project target for the subproject beneficiaries will still be for at least 80 percent of the
                             grants to be rated as successful, using the new definition.
Specific Project             The target for the total number of grants would be restored from about 4,000 (the target in the
Outcome Indicator            recently restructured Project) to 8,400. The original target for the TOWA was 8,400, but the target
                             was reduced as part of the restructuring of the Project, with funding then being reallocated away
                             from grants and commodities to additional bed nets.
New Project Outcome          The new indicator will be a percentage of households that have more than one insecticide-treated
Indicator                    bed net (ITN) in malaria endemic areas. A new intermediate outcome indicator is also introduced to
                             reflect the purchase of the additional bed nets 25
Impact Evaluation            The focus of the impact evaluation will be on determining the effect of Behavior Change
                             Interventions on the prevention of HIV amongst the youth, in Nyanza Province.




              25While the actual use of bed nets would normally be a better indicator, a more modest indictor reflecting household

              Access to bed net is proposed, in view of the limited role of TOWA in supplying the nets to the national malaria
              Program.

Introduction
The Health Sector is one of the key components addressing equity and socio-economic
agenda of the Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment Creation (ERS)
and the social pillar of the Kenya Vision 2030. Kenya’s vision for health is to provide
“equitable and affordable health care at the highest affordable standard” to her citizens.
According to the Kenya Vision 2030 social pillar of Health, the country aims to provide an
efficient integrated and high quality affordable health care to all citizens. There is marked
progress in the health outcomes. This includes improvement in under-five mortality rates
from 92 per 1,000 live births in 2007 to 74 per 1,000 live births in 2009. However, it did
not achieve the year’s target of 55 deaths per 1,000 live births. Immunization coverage
improved from 71 per cent to 77 per cent. Fifty three hospitals are under rehabilitation,
nine of which are completed, 14 are 50 per cent complete, 26 are at below 50 per cent
completion and four are at the foundation stage.

The National Malaria Strategy (NMS) covering the period 2009–2017 was developed in
line with the Government’s first Medium-Term Plan of Kenya Vision 2030 and the
Millennium Development Goals, as well as Roll Back Malaria partnership goals and targets
for malaria control. The National Malaria Strategy is based on and carries forward an
inclusive partnership between the Ministry of Health and other line ministries of the
Government of Kenya, a development and implementing partners in malaria control. The
strategy builds on the achievements and challenges arising during the implementation of
the previous NMS 2001-2010, NHSSP II 2005–2010 and the Economic Recovery Strategy
(2003–2007). 31 This strategy has been reviewed and has led to the development of the
revised Kenya Malaria Strategy 2014-2018

The ultimate vision of the revised Kenya Malaria Strategy is a malaria-free Kenya through
the implementation of the activities that are expected to reduce morbidity and mortality
caused by malaria in the various epidemiological zones by two-thirds of the 2007/08 level.
The specific objectives are:
• To have at least 80% of people living in malaria risk areas using appropriate malaria
    preventive interventions by 2017.
• To have 100% of all suspected malaria cases presenting to a health provider managed
    according to the national malaria treatment guidelines by 2017:
• To ensure that 100% of the malaria epidemic prone and seasonal transmission sub
    counties have the capacity to detect and timely respond to malaria epidemics by 2017.
• Ensure that all malaria indicators are routinely monitored, reported and evaluated in all
    counties by 2017:
• To increase utilization of all malaria control interventions by communities in Kenya to
    at least 80 % by 2017.
• To improve capacity in coordination, leadership, governance and resource mobilization

Relevant to MCU approaches in malaria control, the KMS intended to achieve the
objectives by providing malaria prevention measures and treatment to pregnant women and
ensuring use of insecticide-treated nets by at-risk communities to significantly reduce rates
of disease.
Epidemiological Stratification

Kenya has four malaria epidemiological zones. This stratification has been historical and
related to experiences in relation to occurrence of malaria burden in the country:
a. Endemic – Areas of stable malaria have altitudes ranging from 0 to 1300 meters around
    Lake Victoria in western Kenya and in the coastal regions. Rainfall, temperature and
    humidity are the determinants of the perennial transmission of malaria. The vector life
    cycle is usually short with high survival rate due to the suitable climatic conditions.
    Transmission is intense throughout the year with annual entomological inoculation
    rates between 30 and 100 (risk class equal to or above 20per cent).
b. Seasonal malaria transmission- this epidemiological zone in arid and semi-arid areas
    of northern and south-eastern parts of the country experiences short periods of intense
    malaria transmission during the rainfall seasons. Temperatures are usually high and
    water pools created during the rainy season provide the malaria vectors breeding sites.
    Extreme climatic conditions like El Niño southern oscillation lead to flooding in these
    areas leading to epidemic outbreaks with high morbidity rates due to low immune status
    of the population (risk class less than 5 per cent).
c. Malaria epidemic prone areas of western highlands of Kenya - Malaria transmission
    in the western highlands of Kenya is seasonal, with considerable year-to-year variation.
    The epidemic phenomenon is experienced when climatic conditions favor
    sustainability of minimum temperatures around 180 C. This increase in minimum
    temperatures during the long rains period favors and sustains vector breeding resulting
    in increased intensity of malaria transmission. The whole population is vulnerable and
    case fatality rates during an epidemic can be up to ten-times greater than what is
    experienced in regions where malaria occurs regularly (risk class 5 to less than 20per
    cent).
d. Low risk malaria areas –this zone covers the central highlands of Kenya including
    Nairobi. The temperatures are usually too low to allow completion of the sporagenic
    cycle of the malaria parasite in the vector. However with increasing temperatures and
    changes in the hydrological cycle associated with climate change are likely to increase
    the areas suitable for malaria vector breeding with introduction of malaria transmission
    in areas it never existed (risk class less than 0.1 per cent).

Importance of the survey
The National Malaria Strategy 2009-2017 principally aims at reducing the morbidity and
mortality caused by malaria in the various epidemiological zones by two thirds from the
morbidity and mortality levels observed in the year 2007/2008 by the year 2017. An
important strategic approach to achieve this goal has been to achieve protection of at least
80% of people living in malaria risk areas appropriate malaria prevention interventions
with the Long-lasting Insecticide treated nets (LLIN) by 2013. This is in consideration that
LLIN are the primary preventive tool used to protect populations at risk of malaria in Kenya.


                                             74
Significant investments have been made since 2002 to increase the coverage of LLINs in
Kenya through a variety of distribution mechanisms including:
   1. Routine net distribution targeting pregnant women and children at antenatal care
        clinics. Nets are also distributed through the Comprehensive Care clinics to people
        living with HIV/AIDS
   2. Social marketing: where nets are distributed at a subsidised fee of KShs 50 in
        identified rural shops (“dukas”)
   3. Commercial: where nets are sold at the retail prices mainly in urban supermarkets
        and other retail outlets
   4. Free mass net distribution campaigns conducted in 2006, and more recently in
        2011. The three phased 2011/2012 campaign has implemented two of the three
        phases, and was the only campaign that targeted all members of the household.

This survey therefore aimed to evaluate: the success of phase I, phase II and phase III of
the 2011/2012 mass net distribution campaign; the effect of the post-distribution
information on LLIN ownership, use, and retention in Nyanza, Western, and parts of Rift
Valley regions.
All the three phases of the survey offer an opportunity for the Malaria Control Unit (MCU)
which was formerly known as the Division of Malaria Control (DOMC) to assess whether
Kenya had met Universal coverage target of one (1) net for two (2) people. The results of
the evaluation will also help inform future LLIN distribution strategies especially mass net
distributions.

The evaluation of the mass net campaign was conducted in three phases specifically Phase
1, 2 and 3. The three stage national sample survey was designed to evaluate the Global
Fund, PMI, World Bank and World Vision sponsored LLIN distribution to estimate
indicators of LLIN retention, usage and ownership among households within the four
malaria endemic regions where mass net distribution occurred. Generally the survey was
designed to collect data from randomly selected 272 clusters in the mass net distribution
region. Phase 1 and 2 of the evaluation covered 205 clusters in the Nyanza, Western, and
Rift Valley regions. The remaining 67 clusters; which included 20 clusters in Rift Valley
(Buret, Bomet, and Nandi), and 47 in Coast Region were covered during the third phase of
the evaluation. This final report covers all the three phases of the survey which looks at the
progress towards reaching universal coverage through the distribution of the LLIN as
stipulated in National Malaria Strategic plan 2009-2017.

The survey involved interviewing respondents within randomly selected households. The
respondents were asked questions about their demographic backgrounds, household
characteristics, net ownership, exposure to the campaign, and malaria prevention
messages. This survey also documented the nets owned through the net roster.

Survey Methodology

This three phased survey adopted a descriptive and cross-sectional study approach. The
first two phases of the quantitative survey were conducted between November 2011 and
February 2012 in 4,091 households, with 20,520 individual members, while third phase
which was conducted in March 2014 covered 1,502 households with 7,663 individual
members, giving a total of 5,593 households and 28,183 household members. The overall

                                             75
            response rate for the survey was 99.6%. The interviewer administered questionnaire in the
            first two phases of the survey was done using GPS enabled PDAs while the third phase
            involved use of mobile phone technology in data collection. The data was weighted to
            reflect the population distribution within the different malarial endemicity regions. The
            data was descriptively analyzed with the help of Statistical Package for Social Sciences
            (SPSS) version 21.

            Survey Findings

            Household ownership of any type of net or campaign LLIN; Net ownership increased
            after the mass net campaign in comparison to KMIS 2010. The average number of any type
            of nets per household increased from 1.0 (KMIS 2010) to 2.8 in rural areas; the same is
            noted in average number of LLINs owned per household from 0.9 in 2010 to 2.7 as seen in
            the evaluation. With consideration of malaria epidemiological transmission zones, the Lake
            Endemic region registered an increase ownership of at least one net of any type from
            70.7percent (KMIS 2010) to 88.3 during the evaluation, with the Coast having an increase
            from 69.6 percent to 86.7 percent, while the Highland Epidemic registered an increase of
            85.7 percent up from 59.5 percent during the same time period. The ownership of at least
            one LLIN in the lake endemic region has increased to 83.4 percent from 54.4 percent in
            2010. A result that was replicated in the other regions with Coast Endemic region having
            an increase from 56.5 percent to 82.6 percent, while the Highland Epidemic showing an
            increase from 48.5 percent to 83.5 percent. The average number of LLINs owned per
            household has more than doubled to: 2.24 in lake endemic region, 2.15 in coast endemic,
            and 2.51 in highland epidemic. The results have also shown equitable distribution of net
            distribution across the wealth quintiles therefore enabling the poorest to access LLINs
            equally to the rich.

            Universal coverage
            The finding suggests that universal coverage has been achieved in 58.2 percent of the
            households in the Coast Endemic, 60.5 percent in Lake Endemic and 63.8 percent
            Epidemic Highlands assessed, averaging to 61.6 percent universal coverage. This is below
            the target of 100 percent set by the government of Kenya and may be attributed to non-
            registration and disposing off the nets received during the campaign.

            Household retention of campaign LLIN
            There was equal ownership of nets in rural 93.8 percent and urban areas 92.7 percent. In
            both urban and rural setting, the mean nets distributed per household were the same three
            (3) which conforms to 62.5 percent of the households receiving three or more nets at the
            distribution point. Some nets were disposed by households after the mass net campaign.

                                                                           77
More importantly, the pattern of LLIN ownership across wealth quintiles differed with the
lowest quintile recording ownership at 90.6 percent, and the highest quintile recording 91.4
percent. This is contrary to the skew in the 2010 KMIS report which showed a skew
towards the highest quintile, a finding that prompted the free mass distribution campaign
of 2011/2012.

Net usage
This survey established that use of LLIN the previous night was reported among 36.5
percent of all household members, with Lake Endemic showing lower usage of 30.4
percent compared to 35.5 in Highland Epidemic, and 49.8 percent in coast endemic.
Overall use of LLIN was low among the children aged below five (5) years (29.3 percent)
and people aged 5-14 years (29.7 percent) compared with the other age groups. Still
focusing among the children aged below 5 years, usage among the children in rural areas
was lower (27.5 percent) compared to those in urban areas (39.6 percent). Similarly usage
among these children from lake endemic areas was lower (16.3 percent) compared to
highland epidemic (28.3 percent) and coast endemic (53.9 percent). This is a major concern
in terms of malaria prevention through use of LLIN in the Lake region where malaria is
most prevalent and a major killer disease in children.

Use of LLIN by All Household Members
Table x above shows members of de facto household population who, the night before the
survey, slept under any mosquito net, under an LLIN 32 , and among the population in
households with at least one LLIN by background characteristics. In Highland epidemic,
Lake endemic and Coast endemic zones, 35.5 percent, 30.4 percent and 49.6 percent,
respectively slept under LLIN the night before the survey. There was an increase in the
proportion of population that slept under LLIN the previous night in Highland epidemic
and Coast endemic areas compared to KMIS 2010 report of 32.3 percent and 45.7 percent,
in the respective areas. There was, however, a decrease in Lake Endemic from the previous
38.1 percent (KMIS 2010) to current 30.4 percent. The patterns of LLIN use across wealth
quintiles favor higher socio-economic status quintiles more than the lowest (32.6 percent).
The KMIS report on 2010 also showed a reversed scenario with the LLIN use skewed
towards the higher quintiles than the lowest (24.9 percent) quintile, a finding that prompted
the free mass distribution campaign of 2011/2012.
Use of LLIN by children under five in Intervention Reached Households
Table 16 below shows de facto children under five years of age who, the night before the
survey, slept under a mosquito net, under a LLIN, and among children under five years of
age in intervention reached households with at least one LLIN by background
characteristics. Overall, 38.4 percent of children under five years of age in the intervention
reached households slept under LLIN the night preceding the survey compared to 38.1
percent among household members in similar intervention reached households. In
households with LLIN, a higher proportion of children slept under a LLIN the previous
night (41.5 percent). Use of LIN by children under five varied with age such that the
highest proportion of those aged one year in households with LLLIN used nets the previous

             night. The percentage of children who slept under LLIN the previous night was higher in
             urban (45.7 percent) than in rural areas (37.4 percent). The percentage increase was higher
             in urban settings (5 percent) where households had an LLIN compared to rural areas (2.8
             percent). Use of LLIN the previous night by children in households with an LLIN was
             lowest in Lake Endemic areas (29.6 percent) in contrast to Highland Epidemic (41.9
             percent) and Coast Endemic (64.3 percent). Fewer children among lowest quintile group
             (33.9 percent) slept under LLIN the previous night compared to the rest of the rest of the
             quintile groups. The same trend was noted even among households with an LLIN.

Use of LLIN by Pregnant Women
Table X below illustrates distribution of de facto pregnant women, who, the night before
the survey slept under a mosquito net (treated or untreated), under a LLIN, and among the
population in households with at least one LLIN, the percentage who slept the night before
the survey under LLIN, by background characteristics. The proportion of pregnant mothers
sleeping under LLIN the previous night was higher in urban (52.0 percent) than among
rural households (49.9 percent. Also noteworthy are higher proportions reported from
Coast endemic (59.7 percent) and Lake Endemic zones (49.4 percent) compared to
Highland Epidemic (46.7 percent). There was an increase in usage among all the five
quintile categories post mass LLIN distribution campaign compared with the KMIS 2010
reported usage. The highest increase was noted among the highest quintile group from 29.7
percent (KMIS, 2010) to the current 65.9 percent. The proportion of pregnant women
sleeping under LLIN in households having an LLIN was higher than the corresponding
proportion of those sleeping under LLIN the previous night, regardless of place of
residence, malaria endemicity zone or socio-economic status.

Impact of communication on net-ownership, retention and use
Over 90 percent of the rural households heard about the mass distribution of LLIN
compared to 85.1 percent in urban areas. Looking at the endemicity regions, the proportion
that heard about the campaign differed with the Lake endemic having 93.3 percent.
Highland epidemic at 90.2 percent and Coast Endemic at 80.4 percent. Based on the various
approaches used prior to the campaign, community approach appears to have reached more
households in both rural (42.4 percent) and urban (30.4 percent).
Discussion and Conclusions
The current Kenya National Malaria Strategy aims to reduce significantly the burden of
malaria in the country to levels where the disease is no longer a public health problem. A
number of donors and the government have invested funds in malaria awareness,

                                                      81
prevention, diagnosis and treatment. The main tool for malaria prevention is the long
lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) scaled up through free routine distribution to children and
pregnant women at public health facilities and mass distribution campaigns to individuals
of all ages. From March2011 – August 2012, an estimated 10.6 million nets were
distributed in Nyanza, Western, and selected sub-counties in the Coast and Rift Valley
regions with the aim of covering 21 million people or in the targeted sub-counties. To
assess whether these targets have been reached, the use and retention of the campaign LLIN
and the impact of the malaria information, education and communication activities, the
Division of Malaria Control undertook an evaluation survey among a random sample of
the targeted households. This survey was implemented in phases with Phase I and II being
conducted from November 2011 and February 2012 and Phase III in 2014. The main
objective of survey was to evaluate the Global Fund (GF), President’s Malaria Initiative
(PMI), and World Vision sponsored LLIN distribution to gauge net availability, retention
and use post campaigns.

Net ownership increased after the mass net campaign in comparison to KMIS 2010. The
average number of nets of any type increased in rural areas from 1.0 (KMIS 2010) to 2.58
per household; the same is noted in average number of LLINs owned per household from
0.9 to 2.07. With consideration of malaria epidemiological transmission zones, the Lake
Endemic region registered an increase ownership of at least one any type of net from 70.7
percent (KMIS 2010) to 88.3 percent. The ownership of at least one LLIN in the lake
endemic region has increased to 83.4 percent from 54.4 percent in 2010. The average
number of LLINs owned per household has more than doubled to 2.24 in the same region.
Looking at the entire evaluation zones, the results have also shown equitable distribution
of net distribution across the wealth quintiles therefore enabling the poorest to access
LLINs.

The findings suggest that universal coverage has been achieved in 60.1 percent of the
households in the Lake Endemic, Coast Endemic, and Epidemic Highlands assessed. This
is below the target of 100 percent set by the government of Kenya and may be attributed
to non-registration and disposing off the nets received during the campaign. More nets were
received at the distribution points in rural (89.8 percent) compared to urban areas (82.5
percent). In both urban and rural setting, the mean nets distributed per household was the
same (3) which conforms to 60.1 percent of the households receiving three or more nets at
the distribution point. Some nets were disposed of by households after the mass net
campaign. However, it appears that the pattern of LLIN use across wealth quintiles favor
the higher (40.9 percent) in comparison to lowest (33.2 percent) quintile considering the
households members using LLIN the previous night. The KMIS report on 2010 also
confirmed the scenario with the LLIN use skewed towards the highest (35.1 percent) than
the lowest (24.9 percent) quintile, a finding that negates the intention of the free mass
distribution campaign of 2011/2012.

Among under five year old children, the proportion that slept under LLIN was 30.4 percent
which further confirms the low net use among children, a finding that further suggests need
to critically find better approaches that should to be used promote net use during mass net
distribution campaign for this particular vulnerable population. Apparently, the
communication strategy might not have had great impact on who should use LLINs most.


                                            82
Scaling up LLIN coverage and use by children under five years and pregnant women is
one of the targets of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the Roll Back
Malaria Partnership (RBM). 33 Targeting individual protection to these vulnerable groups
is a priority of the two because these groups bear the highest risk of morbidity and mortality
from malaria. 34Net use among children under five years of age reveal higher usage (39.6
percent) for LLIN in urban areas compared to 27.5 percent in rural settings. However,
according to reports by epidemiological zones, Lake Endemic region registers low LLIN
usage (16.3 percent) compared with Highland Epidemic region (28.3 percent) and Coast
Endemic (53.9 percent). This is a major concern in terms of malaria prevention through
use of LLIN in the Lake region where malaria is most prevalent and a major killer disease
in children. The findings emphasize that increasing net usage in Lake Endemic regions is
key towards increased overall net usage in the current among children under five years of
age.

The use of LLIN use by pregnant mothers remained static. The results show that 50.3
percent slept under LLIN the night preceding the survey which was similar to the reported
50 percent of 2010 KMIS. A drop realized among pregnant women living in households
with LLIN (58.6 percent) compared with the KMIS 2010 (72.5 percent) is worrying and
must be addressed. The low usage among the lowest quintile compared with the highest
quintile in all forms nets is a sign of inequity and needs urgent attention to reverse the trend.

During campaign, it is important to ensure targeted messages reach the most at-risk
populations, to encourage these households to collect LLINs during the distribution day.
Campaign communication involving LLINs require a significant component of behavior
change communication (BCC) to ensure that people do hang and use the nets that they have
received, and that these nets are used by the target groups. Interpersonal communication is
often more effective in promoting change in behavior. Messages can be reinforced by mass
media, visits by community volunteers, and/or health clinic staff. Over 90 percent of the
rural households heard about the mass distribution of LLIN compared to 85.1 percent in
urban areas. The proportion that heard about the campaign in Lake Endemic (93.3 percent)
and Highland epidemic (90.2 percent) was comparable. Based on the various approaches
used prior to the campaign, community health worker approach appears to have reached
more households in both rural (41.3%) and urban (33.5%). Equally useful are the home
visits in rural settings (27.6 percent) compared to urban areas (25.4 percent) and radio
which recorded 22.5 percent and 20.8 percent, in the same settings. Amongst the methods
family appears to be the approach that is equally shared by lowest (20.4 percent) and
highest (21.5 percent) quintiles. In both rural and urban regions, brochures and newspapers
had the effect in reaching the population regarding this campaign. Communication within
the community, radio messages and home visits were the most effective channels.
Outcomes
The main outcome of the mass net distribution campaign was noted in several areas. More
nets were received in rural (89.8 percent) compared to urban areas (82.5 percent).
Registration of households was 100 percent in both rural and urban settings. Eighty-one

percent of households received the nets from government, clinic or hospital which were
the points of net distribution during the mass campaign. The number of nets that were used
for sleeping the previous night was statistically similar to the number of nets that were
hanging for sleeping indicating an association where hanging nets are more likely to be
used for sleeping. Whereas fewer households report owning at least two nets in the rural
setting is compared to urban settings, the reverse is the case for households owning at least
three nets for rural (61.1 percent) compared urban (52.3 percent) areas (48.3 percent). The
intention of mass net distribution was to put more nets in the hands of the general
population. Free net distribution enabled the rural community own more than one net which
translates into more nets for household members thus increasing the likelihood of using the
nets. The net campaign has also ensured that the poor benefit from this government strategy
on malaria prevention. However, net usage still does not favor the lowest quintile, a finding
that requires critical look at any future mass campaign if the goal is to be achieved. This
notwithstanding, the campaign has increased the average number of nets of any type
available per person is 2.9 from the reported 0.2 of KMIS 2010. The current result is above
the targeted universal coverage of 0.5 nets per person (or one net per two people).

Among children, net use in rural areas is lower for LLIN (37.4 percent) and among
households with LLIN (40.2 percent). Similarly, Lake Endemic region reports low usage
(27.5 percent) compared with Coast Endemic region reporting higher usage (58.8 percent).
The pattern of LLIN use across wealth quintiles shows the lowest quintile usage of 33.9
percent below the highest quintiles (46.0 percent). A cause of worry is the drop in reported
proportion among pregnant women living in households with LLIN (54.1 percent)
compared with the KMIS 2010 (72.5 percent), and more particularly, low usage among the
lowest quintile compared with the highest quintile in all forms nets.
Recommendations
1. Mass net distribution campaigns in future should target households where universal
    coverage was not achieved
2. There is need for a follow-up/mop up campaign immediately after the mass
    distribution targeting households that did not achieve universal coverage
3. Messages should be targeted to heads of households to encourage net use amongst
    household members, especially children under five
4. Investment in communication should use channels that had widest reach
5. With increasing availability of TVs in both rural and urban settings, future campaigns
    should include this approach.
6. With increasing availability of TVs in both rural and urban settings, future campaigns
    should include this approach.

TOWA CLOSURE CONFERENCE, NOVEMBER 17-18 2014

The NACC held a two day TOWA Closure Conference in November 17-18 2014. The
participation included the NACC team, NACC board, Ministry of Health officials,
communities, implementing and development partners. The main objectives of the
conference were as follows:
1. Discuss the main issues emerging from the TOWA project.
2. Provide an opportunity to review the key findings and recommendations to inform future
   programming.
3. To celebrate results and appreciate the contribution of key players in the project

Opening Address:
In her opening remarks, the NACC Director Dr. Nduku Kilonzo stated that the purpose of
the TOWA project was to invest in people, strengthen the public sector on related issues
such as accountability, and reduce vulnerability among individuals and communities and
overall strengthening of the HIV and AIDS response during the life of KNASP III. The
Director emphasized the need to prioritize where the epidemic was, investing appropriately
based on the HIV burden and ensuring the inclusion of all actors in the response. She noted
that the conference was an opportunity to reflect on the lessons learnt from the project
moving forward. Dr. Nduku thanked the implementing and development partners, the
Ministry of Health, NACC team and NACC board for the success of the TOWA project.
The Director observed that the TOWA project had contributed immensely to the notable
decline in new HIV infections, prevalence and related deaths. She expressed optimism for
the second phase of the project.

NACC Board Chair, Prof. Mary Getui said that some of the lessons learnt were challenges
that have been addressed though not all. She stated that actors in the TOWA project had
benefited by being better accountants, auditors and implementers through capacity building.
She noted that the project’s call for proposals was participatory from the grassroots through
consultations that gave all players an opportunity to own the process. The Chair recognized
the vital role played by women in ensuring the success of the TOWA project. She observed
that the commodities provided and the networks developed were evidence enough that the
project indeed touched lives positively. She noted that NACC will strengthen its
engagement with the communities within the current devolution structures and that by the
end of the conference the participants will be energized and enriched to even serve better.

The representative of the World Bank Dr Gandham Ramana stated that the TOWA project
being a project of the World Bank had demonstrated results. He noted that although the
project started under difficult circumstances with allegations of past misappropriation and
subsequent stringent measures, the end firmly tells a successful story. Dr Ramana
envisaged the need for broader health system strengthening and further noted that the bank
will work with the Ministry of Health to ensure the noble ambition is realized. He pledged
continued financial support to complement local efforts and initiatives at both national and
county levels


                                            85
A representative from the National Treasury Mr. Henry Mutuiri thanked the implementers
and development partners for their support to the TOWA project and noted that the set
targets were achieved with minimum bottlenecks in relation to accountability issues. Mr.
Mutuiri stated that the HIV prevalence rates had dropped as a result of the good work by
various actors and that the Implementation Completion and Results Report of the TOWA
project due for release later this year will document achievements and lessons learnt which
will provide reference for future donor engagements. He noted that the project’s call for
proposal was competitive and fair and that NACC had been proactive in the affirmative
action that helped in the surpassing of the set targets. He reiterated the importance of
addressing issues of sustainability.

The Cabinet Secretary Ministry of Health, Dr. James Macharia appreciated the
implementing and development partners for the success of the TOWA project and observed
that it was the largest financing ever to the Government of Kenya in the fight against HIV
and AIDS. Dr. Macharia said that the project’s success was good for instilling donor
confidence for future engagements. He stated that the TOWA project had achieved its
objectives among them helping reduce HIV prevalence from 7% to 5.6% though he also
observed that Kenya still remained among the worst hit countries in the world. The Cabinet
Secretary noted that the project had been rated as satisfactory by the World Bank and that
lessons learnt in the course of its implementation included significant government
contribution through different sectors, the need for investing in communities, procurement
of commodities that enhanced access to services, the need to harness resources to ensure
that set goals are achieved and that no one is left out in the response. Dr Macharia said that
the KASF under development will harness resources for the response and that the ministry
will request the World Bank for continued support through the NACC. He called for the
spurring of the HIV Innovative Fund to promote sustainable financing, directing finances
on high impact result areas and strengthening coordination, oversight and strategic
information in line with devolution. The Cabinet Secretary hailed the Futuristic
Governance Assessment carried out by the World Bank and the government of Kenya as a
reference document for many countries. He reiterated that the government was fully
committed to reducing new HIV infections, stigma and discrimination and ensuring
treatment reaches all Kenyans through increased financing. Dr. Macharia commended the
NACC for the satisfactory TOWA project performance and declared the conference
officially opened.

(a) Background focusing on project commencement, value and closure.
(b) Project development objective and components
(c) Key achievements per result area that included outputs and outcome/impacts on;
(d) Component 1: Strengthening Governance and Coordination Capacity:
    • Strategic leadership
    • Capacity building of TOWA grantees and potential grantees
    • Accountability and verification
    • Evidence based management.
(e) Component 2: Support for Program Implementation;

    • A total of 51 public institutions were funded under TOWA
    • Supported procurement of essential commodities i.e. drugs, bed nets and condoms

Comments
• Although the TOWA project provide a great opportunity for capacity building there
  was need to bring on board new partners on the response.
• HIV related stigma and bed ridden cases reduction, adherence and treatment tracing
  should adequately be incorporated as project results
• There was need to quantify knowledge and facts on HIV and include meaningful
  networking between the public and private sectors as project results
• There was need to use community friendly auditors for the project
• It was important to facilitate and motivate volunteers in the project.
• There was need for clarity on the CACCs coordination and engagement in the future.
• The national results should be disaggregated by county since they contributed
  immensely to the project success.
• The Kenya AIDS Strategic Framework under development will help counties develop
  own specific plans to guide the HIV response.
• The recommendations of the conference will inform the Implementation Completion
  and Results Report of the TOWA project.

C. Feedback from TOWA Project Sub Implementers.
Selected groups shared experiences and the impact of the TOWA project as follows;
1. Tusemezane Family Programme

                                          87
The presentation highlights were as follows;
   i.  Organizational background on the description of Tusemezane Family Program and
       its objectives
  ii.  Implemented TOWA projects on behavior change communication/education,
       behavior change communication/education in specific HIV areas and community
       anti-stigma and discrimination campaigns.
 iii. Achievements that included reaching a total of 4,178 young people with behavior
       change communication information and education, training 30 peer educators in
       promoting behavior change among the general population and reaching 5000
       community members with anti-stigma and discrimination messages, among other
       gains.
 iv.   Challenges such as greater demand of outreaches than the available resources and
       sexuality messages facing resistance.
  v.   Lessons learnt that included the need to demystify sex and sexuality especially
       among the adolescence in order to address risky sexual behavior.
 vi.   Best practices such networking and collaboration to strengthen behavior change
       initiatives, accommodative leadership and continuous voluntary outreaches
vii.   Recommendations that included enhancing information by targeting men,
       increasing funding allocation and enhancing HIV prevention activities at primary
       school level.

2. Maseno University Towa story by HIV Coordinator, Ms. Olivia Okal.
Ms. Okal stated that the university was allocated sh. 5 million under the TOWA project to
cater for 15, 000 students and the entire university fraternity. She noted that the funds
facilitated 30 related radio shows, produced IEC material and trained 102 and 50 student
and staff peer educators respectively. Ms. Okal said that the funds also supported capacity
building for students and staff and further enabled sensitization towards reduction of stigma
and discrimination and subsequent HIV status disclosure. She observed that the university
had mainstreamed HIV into its plans and allocated funds for the response.

3. Kenya Prisons Service by Assistant Commissioner of Prisons and ACU
   Coordinator Ms. Mary Chepkonga.
Ms. Chepkonga noted that prisons were awarded 5.8 million under Round 2 of the TOWA
project that facilitated internal and external mainstreaming of HIV. She stated that over
300 prisoners were trained as trainers of trainers as 47 support groups for inmates and 10
for staff were initiated. She observed that TOWA was a capacity building project that
imparted expertise on procurement, accounting and planning to the implementers. Ms.
Chepkonga affirmed that the prisons had since learnt to work with the available little
resources and gave Homa Bay prison as an exemplary story of success on reduced HIV
prevalence and enterprising support groups. She said that under Round 3 mobile outreaches
were conducted and that following the registered success of the project, PEPFAR will
directly fund the Kenya Prisons Service ACU. Ms. Chepkonga called on the counties to
involve prisons at the county level and on the national government to increase funding for
the prisons’ response. She urged the National Treasury to review regulations to facilitate
Kenya Prisons Service and the entire public sector to own bank accounts in order to
accommodate donor funds for program implementation.

4. Kujitegemea HIV/AIDS Afya Support Group by Mr. Raphael Macharia

                                             88
Mr. Macharia’s presentation highlighted the following;
(a) Objectives of the group that included encouraging and increase couple testing and
    counseling at VCT /PMTCT site and also home based, to provide counseling on safer
    conception, family planning and PMTCT for discordant couples and to provide advice
    and referrals to respond to specific reproductive health needs of discordant couples.
(b) Activities on door–to-door counseling and testing and reproductive health needs of
    discordant couples
(c) Challenges that included resistance from a few male partners in couple HCT, most
    couples preferred to be tested separately hence disclosure became a challenge and
    funding stopped midstream affecting implementation of planned activities.
(d) Lessons learnt on the use of community members (especially known PLHIV) to serve
    as guides as they identified and adequately prepared couples before requesting for HCT
    counselors. Community health workers and discordant couples’ peer educators had a
    great impact on the response as they worked directly with the community.

5. Malindi Anti-Retroviral Therapy (MART) Winners from Kilifi County, by Mr.
   Gabriel Sande
Mr. Sande said that MART was formed to ensure quality of life for PLHIV through psycho-
social support. He stated that the group initiated PWP among PLHIV and also capacity
built members of support groups and related networks. Mr. Sande listed achievements of
the group as increased condom uptake, increased testing and tracing treatment defaulters.
He singled out reluctance by men to participate in HIV issues, faith healers promoting
defaulting and lack of support groups for young people as the main challenges faced by the
group. Mr. Sande called for the empowering of people on their rights and understanding of
related guidelines. He affirmed that adherence counsellors were needed on full time basis
and that there was need for capacity strengthening of communities on self-reliance skills.
He also added that continuous resource allocation was necessary to sustain gains made and
that it was important to mainstream GIPA/MIPA in various sectors.

6. Wajir Women for Development by Mr. Abdi Mohammed
Mr. Mohammed observed that before the advent of the TOWA project stigma and
discrimination was high as the local community held misconstrued perception that HIV
belonged elsewhere. He however noted that with the implementation of the project the
county opened up for testing and treatment. He said that the group was working with the
Ministry of Health on PWP in order to curb further infections through couple testing and
counseling. Mr. Mohammed stated that the group had 2 support groups engaging expectant
mothers on PMTCT and that the results registered included 14 HIV free born babies. He
said that Afya Plus and AMREF had funded the group based on the successes of the TOWA
project.

Hawa from Mandera noted that the TOWA project had enabled people to open up and
disclose their HIV status and that stigma and discrimination had reduced although it was
still high. It was observed that VCT uptake had improved with religious leaders sensitized
on HIV and AIDS although there were high rates of denial still recorded among men. She
called on those who were HIV positive to marry among themselves so as to curb the spread
of HIV.


                                           89
7. Xposha Self Help Theatre Group, Vihiga County by Mr. Victor Ijaika Bulemi
Mr. Bulemi’s presentation highlighted the following;
(a) Background information on vision, target groups and area of interest.
(b) Best practices that included youth to youth strategies that ensured more young people
    were reached, working in close collaboration with the Ministry of Health offices for
    referrals and working closely with CACC offices in creation of linkages with other
    partners.
(c) Challenges such as Vihiga bordering Kisumu and Siaya Counties where HIV
    incidences are high as it calls for more collaborations and concerted efforts in ensuring
    that the region moves together
(d) Recommendations that included strengthening the capacity building component at the
    regional and county level to realize more focused groups, capacity build counties and
    lobby them to embrace HIV programming and funding and also fast tract the KASF so
    us to present a framework for sustained efforts at community level.

8. Uriri Constituency, Migori County by Ms. Jane Omamo
Ms. Omamo’s presentation outlined the following;
(a) Background information and aim of the group
(b) Activities of the group that included community mobilization and sensitization, linkage
    and referral system for counseling and support services, capacity building of PLHIV
    and engagement in income generating activities, continued monitoring and evaluation
    of activities, condom distribution and defaulter tracing.
(c) Achievements that included 500 PLHIV trained on family testing, disclosure, PMTCT
    and adherence, scaling up of condom use, increased enrolment for HIV care and
    treatment, increased referral for family planning services and improved quality of life
    for PLHIV.
(d) Challenges such as cultural and religious believes, high financial expectation from the
    community, herbal and traditional healers, inconsistence supply of condoms and lack
    of IGA support by TOWA.
(e) Recommendations that included increasing the general level of funding, project
    framework should have sustainability program for IGA support and periodic joint
    review at the constituency level supported by TOWA.

9. A testimony by a Mr. James Monyare from Zapapo Bee-keeping Group in Laikipia
   confirmed that the project facilitated HIV and AIDS awareness campaigns and VCT and
   treatment with an estimated coverage of 690 people.

10.     A testimony by a Mr. Abdalla Dara Abduba from Tana River observed that the
   project targeted vulnerable and marginalized groups and helped mitigate the poverty
   situation in this remote location and that communities were enlightened on the dangers
   of cultural practices such as female genital mutilation and unsafe male circumcision that
   facilitated HIV transmission.

Remarks
NACC Board Chair, Prof. Mary Getui appreciated the groups for sharing their experiences
of success and hoped that the next TOWA project would facilitate group visits for members
to witness the different unique contexts of the response. She recognized the county


                                             90
representation at the conference and further expressed optimism that the county
governments will commit and plan for the HIV response.

       11. Kenya Assemblies of God Kisii-Mosocho VCT Program by Rev Ezekiel.
It was stated that the program focuses on mobilizing 3000 people and counseling and
testing 2000 individuals in Kisii and Nyamira counties. The highlights of the presentation
were as follows;
    i.     Background of the program detailing partnerships and scope.
   ii.     Challenges that included lack of test kits and rife stigma and how to mitigate them
           through speeding up of the supply process and community mobilization
           respectively. Other challenges included denial after testing HIV positive, use of
           condoms among discordance and suspicious couples.
 iii. Project outcomes such as many couples and youth responding to VCT services,
           increased uptake of condoms, posttest groups formed, increased status disclosure
           and reduced stigma and discrimination.
  iv.      Lessons learnt included intensive mobilization and education within the community
           yielding much response to services, effective and comprehensive campaigns
           through various sectors can help to reduce risk behavior, advocacy can help reduce
           HIV related stigma and discrimination and combination approach in HIV
           prevention is effective.
   v.      Sustainability focusing on strengthening organizational structures, community
           ownership, continuous referrals and referral linkages and networking and
           collaboration.

    12. Reach Out Trust, Mombasa County by Mr. Rueben Ambila
Mr. Ambila noted that harassment by law enforcement agencies and sharing of syringes
with the risk of contracting HIV were key challenges facing the IDUs. He said that the
group contributed 8% of HIV infections as some of them doubled as sex workers and
MSMs. Mr. Ambila stated that the group conducted mobile HTC that reached 1000 people
with 222 individuals testing HIV positive and being referred to care although defaulting
was still high. He observed that 4,100 IEC targeted material was developed, 10 posttest
clubs formed to help manage addiction and 120 health providers trained on IDUs to
mitigate stigma and discrimination in government facilities. He also stated that the group
mobilized and sensitized religious leaders to understand better the IDUs. Mr. Ambila
revealed that since 2011 the organization has provided 500, 000 needles and syringes and
that 70% of IDUs don’t share paraphernalia anymore. He said that the organization had
trained 20 law enforcers that included the police and city inspectorate officers on
understanding the IDUs. Lessons learnt by the organization included the need for
community based outreach as the best way to reach the IDUs, involve communities in
sustainable livelihood and include individuals living positive in HIV planning.

    13. Vision Talent Group from Mukurueini County by Mrs. Zipporah Ndirangu.
Mrs. Ndirangu stated that the group had trained community health workers to take care of
orphans and vulnerable children since fear, stigma and denial had reigned prior to the
advent of the TOWA project. She said that the group facilitated HIV testing and formed 15
support groups to follow up on nutrition and motivation. Mrs. Ndirangu listed activities by
the group among them being IGAs on poultry farming, soap making, table banking,
distribution of condoms, sensitizing the community and treating clients and the community.

                                             91
She said that the group had partnered with health facilities and the government at all levels
and that it had managed to attract additional funding for the response due to the registered
success during the life of the TOWA project. Mrs. Ndirangu observed that the group had
initiated a community innovation on ‘budding’ that ensured friendship and support for
those who turned HIV positive up on testing.

     14. Stay Alive For Us All (SAFUA) Group from Makueni by Ms. Jacinta Mulatya
Ms. Mulatya stated that the TOWA project empowered the group focusing on advocacy,
care and support and that it surpassed the counseling and testing targets after it managed to
mobilize the community to be tested by the Ministry of Health VCT team. The group
partnered with various like entities and linked 1, 240 individuals to care and has since
initiated table banking and even attracted more donors with varied farming activities in
progress.

    15. Counseling and Testing in Nandi by Eunice Tarus
Ms. Tarus stated that the counseling and testing targeting the general population surpassed
the target and that the developed linkages with the community facilitated referrals through
an integrated approach. She noted that Community Health Workers and Community Health
Extension Workers were trained on counseling and managed to reach 4 community health
units. Ms. Tarus said that expectant mothers were encouraged to deliver in health facilities
to support PMTCT initiative. However, over expectation from the community posed a
major challenge as individuals demanded food ratios and bus fare up on being referred.
Community Health Workers also demanded salary for their engagement.

    16. KENEPOTE- by Wellness Programme Assistant Coordinator TSC Ms.
        Magdalene Mwele.
Ms. Mwele’s summary presentation on ‘Journey to Zero’ booklet focused on;
(a) Background information on KENEPOTE and TSC
(b) Objectives that included inculcating spirit of de-stigmatization of HIV positive
    teachers, creating a credible body of literature that may act as a reliable reference on
    the subject of teachers & HIV and communicating TSC and KENEPOTE efforts to
    address challenges posed by HIV and AIDS to the teaching profession, among others.
(c) Salient features of the ‘Journey to Zero’ booklet that included legal and structural
    framework for workplace programmes, principles of the ILO recommendation on HIV
    and AIDS and the World of Work, 2010 (No. 200) and principles of the Public Sector
    Workplace Policy on HIV and AIDS, among others.
(d) TSC best practices that included acknowledging HIV and AIDS as a workplace issue,
    developing a workplace policy and mainstreaming HIV/AIDS workplace issues in the
    commission’s strategic plan.
(e) KENEPOTE best practices that included KENEPOTE being an influential network of
    HIV+ teachers in Kenya despite high levels of stigma and KENEPOTE having a
    tendency to encourage unforced disclosure, among many other practices.
(f) Thematic areas covered in the booklet that included discordance, disability & HIV,
    leadership, management and governance, widow inheritance, social protection, legal
    rights to inheritance, PMTC and reproductive rights, stigma and discrimination,
    religious cohesion and HIV and AIDS, extending services to hard to reach populations
    and partnership sustaining support groups.


                                             92
Comments
The participants commented as follows;
(a) Kitchen gardens were best practices that offered requisite nutrition supplements by
    providing vegetables and fruits.
(b) There was need to embrace public speaking in order to offer talks on HIV and AIDS
    under the ‘ambassadors of hope’ banner.
(c) It was imperative that the OVCs family lineage is safeguarded.
(d) IDUs should not be criminalized but instead they should be understood and assisted in
    the HIV and AIDS response
(e) Adolescents should be helped to cope with HIV positive status and shun denial so as to
    stop the spread of HIV.
(f) The TOWA project was about results and empowering communities at the local level.

D. Kenya AIDS Strategic Framework (KASF) progress update
NACC Economist Peter Kinuthia in his presentation on KASF progress update highlighted
the following;

Background of the KASF Development
The KASF Development process began in May 2014 after undertaking the End of Term
Review of the Third Kenya National AIDS Strategic Plan (KNASP III ETR) process which
was a key building block to the KASF Development set to end in November 2014. The
ETR Report highlighted four main issues that have since informed the development of the
strategic framework. They were namely;
(a) Prevention; We had made progress but more still needed to be done so as to turn the
    tide of new infections.
(b) Treatment; we had made progress in adult ART coverage but pediatric ART coverage
    was still very low.
(c) Monitoring and Evaluation; Data sources and Information Management continued to
    be a challenge even with the ‘3 Ones Principle’.
(d) Sustainable Financing; Ownership of the HIV response through sustaining financing of
    the same domestically was of great importance.
The KASF development process involves four phases as follows:
(a) Phase I: Preparatory Phase
(b) Phase II: Consultation and Drafting Phase
(c) Phase III: Validation and Peer Review
(d) Phase IV: Launch, Dissemination and Implementation

1. Vision
2. Overarching Goal
3. KASF Strategic Objectives that include;
 (a) Reduce new HIV infections by 75%
 (b) Reduce AIDS related mortality by 25%
 (c) Reduce (tolerance to HIV) related stigma and discrimination by 50%
 (d) Increase the domestic financing of the HIV response by 50% (progressively)
4. KASF Strategic Directions for each of the Specific Objectives and Enablers to
    complement Impact Results
5. Sustainable Financing; Fund Structure


                                           93
6. Next Steps moving forward on peer review, editing, printing, the launch of the strategic
   framework slated for November 28, 2014 and subsequent rollout.

Comments
The participants commented as follows;
• Up on successful implementation and completion of the TOWA project, the KASF
   provides a platform for sustainability moving forward.
• The KASF document targets were too ambitious and thus should be reviewed to be
   realistic.
• Social determination of health focusing on OVCs should be strengthened in the KASF
   document.
• During the KASF validation meeting participants noted that the role of NASCOP was
   domineering in the document.
• There was need for defining the role of CACCs, DASCOs, and County Health
   Executives and NACC Field officers in the HIV response at the devolved level in order
   to avoid conflict of interest.
Responses
Mr. Kinuthia responded to the comments as follows;
 • KASF development process was participatory and aims at accelerating prevention of
   HIV infections and therefore the KASF objective of 75% reduction in new HIV
   infections is not ambitious.
 • The strategic framework will addressed issues raised by the participants during the
   conference including issues on OVCs.
 • KASF does not tolerate stigma and discrimination of any form
 • A team of reviewers was looking at the KASF being finalized and that NACC was
   responsible for the overall results as NASCOP focuses on delivery of health services.
 • The KASF will outline the goals and recommended actions so as to inform the
   structure, roles and responsibilities of the CACCs, DASCOs, County Health
   Executives and NACC Field officers in the HIV response.

Lessons learnt
The lessons learnt by various sub implementers were summarized as follows;
 1. Investing in communities and community organizations drives HIV and AIDS
    response positively.
 2. Capacity building of local CSOs improved results
 3. Monitoring and Evaluation, early identification and management of risks improved
    performance of projects
 4. Counseling should not be restricted to HTC but should be holistic.
 5. The TOWA project created linkages between CSOs and local development partners
    as some organizations attracted funding based on successful implementation of the
    TOWA project.
 6. The TOWA project accelerated uptake of HTC thus making it convenient to reach
    government counseling and testing targets.
 7. Parts of the country that were not reachable due to poor infrastructure should rely on
    the local based organizations to provide services
 8. Introduction of the IGA component in the budget guaranteed sustainability of both
    CSOs and programs beyond the project life cycle.

                                            94
 9. The multisectoral approach was key to the HIV and AIDS response.
10. Strengthened systems and controls at the community level was a basis for funding by
    development partners.
11. Sensitizing communities on reduction of stigma and discrimination was imperative in
    the HIV response.
12. Community innovation approaches such as table banking, kitchen gardens,
    community linkages and budding (friendship) help communities cope with HIV.
13. Continuous resource allocation for programmes sustainability was necessary to
     sustain gains made
 14. Sharing of experiences through visits by members of implementing groups was vital
     to witness different unique contexts in the HIV response.

Conclusion and Way Forward
NACC Deputy Director Finance and Administration, Mr. Dennis Kamuren observed that
the TOWA project procedures for accountability were rigorous but urged the
implementers to keep the resilience and hard work demonstrated.

NACC Director, Dr. Nduku Kilonzo appreciated the participants for their continued good
work on the HIV response and urged them to keep the same spirit of delivering results.
She stated that NACC had requested the counties to constitute committees to help organize
the World AIDS Day celebrations to be officiated by respective governors. The Director
noted that once the KASF is launched at the national level, it will be dispatched together
with the County Estimates for the governors to launch it at the county level. She called on
the participants to engage with the NACC field offices in order to ensure that the World
AIDS Day was a success. Dr. Nduku affirmed that NACC will engage even more so as to
secure more partners on the response towards the realization of the Kenya Vision 2030
target of less than 4% HIV prevalence.

NACC Board Chair Prof. Mary Getui hailed the government for continued support and
expressed optimism that TOWA 2 will come forth soon. She stated that with the goodwill
and commitment by various players the response will be able to achieve the ‘Zeros’ much
earlier than 2030. Prof. Getui extended gratitude to the NACC board, management and
secretariat and called on the CACCs to keep NACC devolved structures running
effectively. She acknowledged the First Lady and the ‘Beyond Zero Campaign’ whose
secretariat is housed at NACC for distributing the much needed clinics to counties. The
Chair observed that all the players were important in the response and that the engagement
should be seen as a calling. She reiterated the NACC board’s commitment and support to
the HIV response endeavors. She finally awarded certificates to project implementers and
CACCs for their exemplary performance on the HIV response in Kenya.

A BRIEF OF THE NACC AND GOVERNORS CONSULTATIVE MEETING ON
HIV AND AIDS HELD AT ENASHIPAI ON 29TH SEPTEMBER 2014

The following attended the meeting:
1. 25 Governors

                                           95
2.   US Deputy Chief of Mission,
3.   PEPFAR Coordinator
4.   4 heads of UN agencies (UNAIDS, UNICEF, UNFPA)
5.   NACC Board represented by the Chair and 3 Committee chairs
6.   NACC Director and Secretariat staff

The meeting started at 12.00noon up to 3pm with the following objectives:
1. Prioritization of HIV in the County plans and budgets for FY 2015/16
2. Mobilizing buy-in/ownership for the next 5 year HIV Strategy currently under
   development as this will be essential for delivering on the targets
3. Dissemination of the County HIV estimates, following launch of the Country HIV
   estimates by the Cabinet Secretary

A summary of the issues raised and discussed and resolutions include:
(a) Allocation of budgets to HIV, mothers and children: They are in agreement to
    increase resource allocations and will rely on NACC to provide technical support on
    County specific needs, existing resources and gaps they need to fill and to support their
    officers during the budget development process.
(b) Procurement of HIV test kits, ARVs, condoms and TB drugs: In principle they have
    already agreed to central procurement through KEMSA. A paper that outlines process,
    quantities, distribution and reporting requirements will be useful to get a full Council
    resolution at their next meeting.
(c) Kenya AIDS Strategic Framework: NACC and the CoG to draw an MOU that
    outlines all the areas that we propose delivery of the HIV response including technical
    support to implementation, monitoring, reporting for discussion with the Health
    committee and finally Council. In principle, the Governors agree to collaboration with
    National level in delivering the HIV response, as they need support and assistance.
(d) Resources allocation: NACC to develop guidance on how HIV resources can be
    invested equitably in Counties (including external/partner resources).

Additional issues that were discussed include:
(a) A request from the Governors for better coordination of implementing partners so that
    they know who is working in their regions, what they are doing.
NACC briefed the Governors on the implementing partner process under development with
an implementation timeline of Quarter 3 and that this would be used to inform them.
(b) Strengthened coordination of development partners with increased understanding of
    the resources available and what they are used for.
NACC briefed the Governors that these are now issues for discussion currently on-going
with the development partners through a forum that has been introduced and that the
Cabinet Secretary has supported.
(c) Ensuring utilization of the fully kitted Beyond Zero mobile clinics,
(d) The Governors committed to ensuring utilization of the fully kitted mobile clinics that
    were being donated and recommended further engagement with their CECs.
(e) Dissemination of different policies and plans, technical support to counties were
    discussed
(f) NACC noted that the dissemination of the KASF would be undertaken together with
    dissemination of other policy documents.


                                             96
(g) The Chair of the Council of Governors requested NACC to enhance staffing levels to
    cover each County in his opening remarks.
(h) The Governors noted that the primary engagement mechanism should be the Counties
    and that the current structure that included Constituency AIDS Coordinators was
    challenging for coordination

Annex 6. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Summary of Borrower's ICR
Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1 During the 1990's, Kenya’s economic performance was weak and real per capita
income contracted by an average of 0.5 % annually. The Government elected in
December 2002, prepared an Economic Recovery Strategy (ERS) for Wealth and
Employment Creation, reached agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
on a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program, moved to improve
relationships with donors, and developed new strategies for socioeconomic development.

Inequality and poverty continued to be a major concern. About 56 % of households
were estimated to be below the poverty line in 2003. Income inequality in Kenya w a s
likewise high: in 1998-2002, the Gini index was 43 and the poorest 20 % of the
population received only 6 % of national income, while the richest 20 % took nearly
50 %. Particularly affected w e r e the youth and especially girls, with HIV infection
in young women aged 15 to 19 years being about five times higher than in men of the
same age group.

2. The World Bank has been a major supporter of Kenya’s national response to the HIV
and AIDS epidemic through several projects including:
   i.  The Sexually Transmitted Infections Project (Credit 2686, US$50 million,
       approved December 1995);
  ii.  The DARE Project (Credit 3440, US$54 million, approved December 2000); and
 iii. The KHADREP (Credit 3415, US$50 million, approved December 2000).

Through the TOWA Project, IDA continued to support efforts to sustain governance
improvements in the NACC. IDA played a lead role in supporting anti-corruption and
governance issues in Kenya, and the TOWA Project would support further institutional
strengthening in HIV and AIDS. The TOWA Project would also respond to some
important gaps in the financing of the Kenya National AIDS Strategic Plan. Even though
Kenya received significant amounts of money for HIV and AIDS from other external
sources, there were still some significant gaps in the resourcing of the Program.

3. The project original development objective was to assist Kenya to expand the coverage
of targeted HIV and AIDS prevention and mitigation interventions. This was to be
done through:
(i)      sustaining the improved institutional performance of the NACC; and
(ii)     Supporting the implementation of the KNASP.
In the year 2010, the Project development objectives were revised to:
a) Expand the coverage of the targeted HIV and AIDS prevention and mitigation
     measures
b) Expand access to bed nets amongst targeted PLHIV and the households in malaria risk
     areas.

4. The target beneficiaries under the original and the revised PDO under the TOWA project
included the following: (a) NACC: The NACC institutional structures were strengthened
through the TOWA Project through the governance and accountability component; (b)

                                           98
Civil Society Organisations through the call for proposal process. They were given grants
and received training to better equip them to manage the grants. A number of them have
received funding from other donors due to the training received; (c) Public Sector through
the mainstreaming program; (d) Private Sector; (e) PLWHIV; (f) Key Populations: The
TOWA Project carried out programs targeting youth, women, sex workers, religious
groups among others; (g) Population at large-Essential Commodities (universal coverage),
grassroots; (h) VMGs; (i) OVCs; (j) Research Institutions; (k) Universities.

5. Performance under the project was monitored through the Project’s Results Framework.
The project outcome indicators (POIs) reflect a combination of: (i) measures of
institutional effectiveness of HIV and AIDS coordinating institutions (POI#1) and scope
and degree of wide spread participation (POI#2); (ii) changes in overall behaviour change
outcome indicators that are essential for reducing the risk of HIV transmission, attributable
to all sources of finance (POI#3, POI#4 and POI#6); and (iii) measures of malaria risk
reduction among households of PLHIV and other high-risk malaria households.

6. The authenticity and prudent management of the funded community level sub-projects
was verified and closely monitored to ensure value for money and utmost transparency.
The NACC developed an action plan for improving governance and accountability under
the TOWA Project. Apart from the traditional independent external Financial Audits, the
project had: (i) An independent Financial Management Agency,(ii) An independent
procurement monitoring Agency, iii) An independent Compliance Verification Agency
and iv) An independent Performance (‘value for money’) Auditor.

Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

1. The Project had to undergo several restructurings to ensure that the Project development
Objectives are achieved. The first restructuring- level 2 was done at the same time as the
fourth Amendment of the Financing Agreement approved by the Country Director in
August 2010. The restructuring was for: (i) reallocation of funds to continue with the
increased disbursement percentage from IDA, and (ii) the urgent purchase of additional
bed nets (amounting to US$10 million) for the malaria program.

The second restructuring was for the additional financing credit for the TOWA Project
approved on November 18, 2010 by the Board. This followed from the fourth amendment
and the restructuring approved in August 2010. There were three main reasons for
additional credit: (a) The financing gap caused less than expected co-financing support; (b)
Support the scale up of the Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLITNs) to help attain universal
coverage of bed nets within the high risk areas of the country; and (c) To build upon the
initial stage of Project restructuring in August 2010 where the project original targets were
lowered and Project cost tables changed to facilitate the urgent procurement of
supplementary bed nets, at the expense of other commodities.

The Additional Financing of US$55 million was to: (i) make up for the US$33 million
funds from DFID, which was not going to be available as co-financing through the TOWA
so that the fourth and fifth CfPs are fully funded and can go ahead; (ii) allocate another
US$10 million to scale up the malaria bed net program (bringing the total provision under
the TOWA to US$24 million); (iii) support the project restructuring and restore some of

                                             99
the funding, especially for commodities, that was reallocated (mainly to bed nets) in August
2010; (iv) respond to the triggering of the safeguards for IP; and provide for the extended
operations of the Project for another 18 months, including particularly for continued
fiduciary and M&E strengthening; and revision of the PDO and KPIs.

2. Other Factors affecting Implementation
Capacity Gaps Challenges: Low knowledge retention levels; Replacement of trained
officials; Incomplete and inadequate financial and technical returns; Low literacy levels
and accountability capacity at CBO level
Financials & Accountability Challenges: Incomplete and inadequate financial and
technical returns; Lack of documents to support certain types of expenditure; Heavy
reliance on cash, as cheques are not normally accepted in rural areas; Default on reporting
and poor record maintenance
Governance and Administration Challenges: Late submission of monthly and quarterly
reports by PSIs; Lack of offices for PSIs; High volumes of small transactions; Low
reporting levels mostly in hard to reach areas
Geographical and weather Conditions Challenges: Hard to access areas due to insecurity
and/or poor infrastructure
Socio-Economic Challenges: Failure by some PSIs to attend initial formal cluster training
after invitation; Lack of IGA for the project implementers; Poor timing in terms of local
seasons for implementers.
Political Challenges: The Post-election violence of 2007/2008; Political Campaigns
during the 2012 elections
Programmatic challenges: Unrealistic targets for achievements; Tight Timelines for
implementation; Poor documentation

Assessment of Outcomes
During the Project implementation period remarkable achievements were registered across
various service delivery areas.
Objective 1: Expand the coverage of the targeted HIV and AIDS prevention and mitigation
measures
  i.    Proportion of PSIs scoring “Very Good” or “Excellent” for target achievement in
       the annual audit during the year.




 ii.   Number (cumulative) of civil society/private sector grants supported by the end of
       the year.

                                            100
2. HIV Testing and Counseling
 Over 5.5 million people have been counseled and tested for HIV for a total cost of
 US$3,172,987 (42% of funds).This includes VCT for 2,119,420 Most at Risk
 Populations (38.4%) and VCT for a further 3,406,159 people (61.6 %) who are part of
 the general population. The MARPS covered include 424,466 most at risk youth, 41,727
 long distance truck drivers and Commercial sex workers, 170,322 people in Hard to
 Reach Areas, 1467 Injecting drug Users, plus 1,481,438 MARPS without specific
 categorization.

3. The National HIV/AIDS Prevalence
The result of the various interventions in the fight against HIV & AIDS for the country,
the TOWA Project included, led to the decline in the National Prevalence rate from the
Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey (KAIS) and KDHS Reports among men and women and the
general population.




Source:   Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey 2007/2012 and Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (2003;
2008/9)

4. HIV Prevention-Condom Use and safe sex
Over 7.8 million people were reached through behaviour change communication and HIV
education for a total cost of USD$ 1,793,771 (24% of funds) under the TOWA Project.




                                             101
5. Other Interventions
A further 854,272 people have benefited from other specialized HIV services for a total
cost of US$ 2,541,541 (44% of funds).
This includes:
     256,313 PLHIV that received support
     403,097 mothers that received PMTCT services
     67, 285 OVC that received the minimum package of care
     106,511 people that received home and community based care
6. Vulnerable and Marginalized Groups (VMG’s)
Vulnerable and Marginalized Groups (VMGs) were identified as those in the following
hard to reach counties, Samburu, Narok, Nakuru, Laikipia, Mandera, Wajir, Garisa, Kilifi,
Kwale, Lamu, Taita Taveta, Trans Nzoia, West Pokot, Bungoma, Baringo, Turkana,
Marsabit and Isiolo. Routine services and implementing partners rarely reach these
nomadic and black smith populations.




    1,440 VMG community leaders sensitized on HIV and AIDS awareness, HTC,
     condom promotion
    80,000 VMG community members were mobilized, mobilized and offered
     information and condom demonstration
    328 VMG’s trained as peer educators

 7. Over 43, 481 Orphans and Vulnerable Children were reached through local
 implementing partners with 10,288 OVCs being provided with nutritional support
Objective 2: Expand access to bed nets among targeted people living with HIV and AIDS
and the households in Malaria risk areas.
Long lasting insecticide treated mosquito nets procured and distributed for the PLHIV
(500,000) and for mass distribution (2,375,000) in Malaria endemic regions. A total of




5,250,000 individuals reached.



                                          102
    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
     • The CSOs funded under TOWA had strengthened capacities that enabled them to
         access other sources of funding e.g. impact funding under the WB CDD Project.
     • Increased MTEF funds allocation as a result of TOWA matching funds.
     • It served as catalytic funding opening up other counties and sub-counties to provide
         funds for its HIV programming in the county as part of the post TOWA sustainability
     • The Global Fund through the Red Cross has requested for recommendation for best
         TOWA implementers to be engaged in the implementation of Global Fund as lead
         agents.

    Assessment of Risk to Development Outcomes
    There was clear evidence that the NACC was committed to carrying out governance
    reforms and monitoring and evaluation strategies that would make the TOWA Project a
    success story for the country. However, several changes that were unanticipated at the
    project design occurred and threatened the achievement of the Project Development
    Objectives as the risks crystallized or materialized. Mitigating measures were taken.

Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

1.The Bank provided the required supervision to ensure the proper functioning of the
project and to strengthen the areas that needed more input or attention through its
supervisory missions both operational and Financial. All prior conditions and Financing
Agreements were discussed and agreed upon at entry between the Bank and Borrower and
found to be satisfactory to ensure timely launch of the TOWA Project. Included in the
Credit effectiveness requirements were the fulfilment and establishment of the safeguards
and fiduciary arrangements as well as the M&E systems establishment.
This is the Borrower of record and was therefore instrumental in designing the project
safeguards and signing of the prior Conditions and the Financing Agreements.

2. The exchequer and the National Treasury provided the medium for the transfer of the
project funds. The Borrower also provided disbursements Clinics for the World Project
implementers highlighting key areas as absorption rates among others. The National
Treasury was instrumental in the submission of the IFRs, the Withdrawal applications and
direct payments that needed to be forwarded to the World Bank for Processing.

3. The NACC, as the coordinator of the project, learned several lessons which were
integrated into the implementation of the TOWA project. The lessons learnt included the
accountability and effective monitoring of the community grants which were a major part
of the KHADRE Project. The NACC coordinated the project delivery while taking charge
of the processes and agencies that were instituted as safeguards.

Lessons Learned
1. A number of positive and negative lessons can be drawn from the project experience
(these lessons have general applicability for similar operations). Key lessons learned are
the following:
a) Project Design
        • There was need to incorporate sustainability of future donor programs right
            from design stage
        • The engagement of Financial Management agency (FMA), Independent
            Compliance Verification Agency (ICVA) , Performance auditor (PA) and
            Procurement Monitoring Agency (PMA) denied the NACC an opportunity for
            institutional strengthening and capacity building
        • Need to shorten funds flow processes with NACC being the recipient to
            improve on Disbursements and Accountabilities
        • Need for capacity building framework to streamline capacity building in line
            with KASF priorities
b) Stakeholders Involvement and Collaboration
    • Involvement of all stakeholders was essential to ensure that ownership and
        commitment to project implementation was maintained in relation to priority
        targets.
    • The inclusion focused efforts on communities who needed to benefit most, and to
        strengthen the quality of outcomes.
    • Scale-up of provision and access to HIV and AIDS services due to engagement of
        all stakeholders at all levels
c) Pre-Implementation Preparations

                                           104
   •  The process of community mobilization has resulted in active communities ready
      to go for future projects.
   • Some of the conditions of effectiveness of the Project were not cost-effective e.g.
      Independent Agencies
d) Implementation Arrangements
      • A complex and rigid implementing arrangement did not provide the flexibility
          for testing of new models, quick results and maintaining political and
          operational independence for piloting innovative approaches.
      • More efficient procurement organization and procedures may have avoided
          some serious delays in project implementation. Frequent training on
          procurement procedures during implementation was necessary to avoid
          delays in procurement aspects.
      • An effective TOWA Project Performance committee greatly facilitated timely
          decision making that positively impacted on project implementation.
      • Inadequate time allowed for review of budgets and work plans during FMA
          trainings.
      • Incorporating experiences from KHADREP, effective monitoring and
          evaluation, early identification and management of risks improved the
          performance of the project
      • Governance and institutional strengthening arrangements were put in place
          based on KHADREP lessons which led to low Project implementation risks.
      • Use of existing government structures and process in the implementation such
          as Kenya Medical Supply Agency (KEMSA), KENAO, GoK Financial
          Procedures and M&E Systems improved the Project performance and
          enhanced Project savings.
e) Implementation
   • Revision of the CfPs and Proposal Review Guidelines to incorporate pre-bidding
      training and feedback mechanism
   • International competitive bidding was a good practice that should be upheld. It
      encouraged competition and was cheaper in the long run.
f) Impact of the Project
      • Capacity of project sub-implementers to implement HIV and AIDS
          programmes improved enabling them to access funds from other development
          partners.
      • Matching funds concept increased allocation of MTEF funds for HIV and
          AIDS mainstreaming in government institutions

Conclusion
Performance under the TOWA project was continually monitored through the Project’s
Results Framework. A combination of outcome level indicators and intermediate indicators
had been identified to facilitate monitoring of performance. The Project Appraisal
Document (PAD and the TOWA Operation Manual) were developed to guide the
Implementation of the TOWA Project. All the outcome level Indicators in PDO#1 and
PDO# 2 were achieved and targets surpassed from the originally intended targets.

Two indicators were used to assess the Institutional Performance of NACC: level of
stakeholders’ satisfaction and status of the audit reports. The level of customer satisfaction

                                             105
from the annual independent customer satisfaction surveys increased from 70 percent in
2007 to 87 percent in 2013. On the other hand, although all audit reports on NACC were
qualified, NACC was able to address the issues of qualification within stipulated period of
six months.

All the intermediate indicators contributing to: (i) NACC’s effectiveness in coordinating
program implementation; strengthening accountability and financial management capacity
of NACC; (ii) Use of M&E system in planning, project design and implementation; and
(iii) increased capacity of partners to respond effectively and report through the normal
M&E tools were achieved and surpassed the targets. Trends analysis consistently showed
improvements in target achievements throughout the project life.
