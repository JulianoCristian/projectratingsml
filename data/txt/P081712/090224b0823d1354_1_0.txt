                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation status is upgraded to satisfactory as a result of the project having met the conditions that had reduced the rating to moderately satisfactory in the previous ISR.
                         So far, the project has supported over 10,800 civil society/private sector grants and performance of over 80% of such grantees was rated either good or excellent by the performance
                         auditor. Over 6 million individuals have been provided with HIV/AIDS counseling and testing services during the life of the project out of which 1.3 million were supported directly by
                         the project. The project also supported procurement and distribution of over 150 million condoms and the Kenya AIDS indicators survey 2012 (KIAS 2012) shows an increased use

                         arrive. The mass distribution of bed nets was done in the Coast province and the three endemic districts of the Rift Valley. The KIAS 2012 shows that the project target of 80%
                         having at least one bed net by household in malaria endemic districts supported by the project has been reached. The planned procurement and distribution of TB drugs was also
                         successfully completed.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project implementation status is proposed for upgrading to satisfactory. Over10,800 civil society/private sector organizations received grants for HIV prevention and mitigation
                         measures and performance of 80% of such grantees is rated good or excellent. Over 6 million individuals received HIV counseling which includes 1.3 million directly benefiting from
                         the project. The KIAS 2012 survey confirms an increased use of condoms among the youth and over 80% of households in malaria endemic districts supported by the project have at
                         least one bed net.
