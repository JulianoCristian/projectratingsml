The main\n            components to be financed by the IDA credit will be: civil\n            works, technical assistance and training, ZAPI's\n            incremental operating costs and vehicles and equipment.\n            Economic benefits will result from increased production of\n            coffee, cocoa, rice, fish and food crops, and from cost\n            savings in marketing and processing. At full development an\n            estimated 13,200 farm families will benefit with net farm\n            incomes increasing from a present average of US$490 to\n            US$720.
