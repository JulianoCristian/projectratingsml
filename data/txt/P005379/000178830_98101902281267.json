equivalent, the Bank seeks to meet 10 percent of the\n            additional resources required by BNDE from 1977-1979 to\n            fulfill its role in the expanding Moroccan economy. The\n            project aims to assist BNDE in (i) providing continuing\n            support for the development of the industrial sector in\n            Morocco, both with respect to the private and public sector\n            as well as (ii) expanding its promotional and development\n            efforts, with emphasis on labor-intensive small-scale\n            industries (SSI). To accomplish this objective, the loan\n            provides US$5 million for a pilot project for the promotion\n            of small-scale industries. In addition, the project aspires\n            to help the institution in (iii) mobilizing additional\n            resources, particularly in the international market; and\n            (iv) strengthening its institutional appraisal capabilities,\n            particularly with respect to larger and more complex\n            projects, in line with the demands made on BNDE by the\n            evolving trend of industrial development in Morocco."}, "docdt": "1977-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
