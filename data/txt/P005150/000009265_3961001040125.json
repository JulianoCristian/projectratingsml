"The Structural Adjustment Loan Project\n            (SAL) will pursue three broad objectives: stabilization;\n            structural reform towards the strengthening of a market\n            economy to improve resource allocation and restore\n            sustainable growth; and the construction of a more adequate\n            social safety net to mitigate the effects of the economic\n            reforms on the poor. It emphasizes the structural reforms\n            needed to improve resource allocation and growth. In\n            addition to supporting an adequate medium-term macroeconomic\n            framework and financing plan, it supports the initiation of\n            reforms in the public sector, including privatization. It\n            also supports the Government's resolve to reduce\n            distortion in both prices and the overall incentive\n            environment, to be pursued through the liberalization of\n            price, trade, production and investment controls."}, "docdt": "1991-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
