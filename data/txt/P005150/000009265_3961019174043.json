"Ratings for the Structural Adjustment\n            Loan Project for Egypt were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, project suitability was likely, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            SAL came at a time when the Government's reforms in\n            support of private sector development and away from public\n            sector were well underway. The demise of the Soviet bloc\n            leading to the decline of central planning strategies and\n            the ascendance of free market economies provided an extra\n            impetus to the Egyptian reforms. The magnitude of the\n            macroeconomic imbalances and the distortions in the\n            incentive system warranted a comprehensive approach to\n            reform. The Government felt that strong action was needed\n            and demonstrated a commitment to implement such action. The\n            reforms led to substantial macroeconomic stabilization of\n            the economy. On the other hand, the deeper reforms under the\n            EFF and the SAMP encouraged opposition from vested interest\n            groups, which prompted the Government to pursue a slower\n            reform pace. The Government received very substantial\n            assistance from the Bank and the donor community for\n            implementing its economic reform program, both in terms of\n            financial support and technical advice. The close working\n            relationship with the Government contributed to the\n            satisfactory implementation of a very ambitious\n            stabilization and structural adjustment program."}, "docdt": "1996-01-22T00:00:00Z"}
