A further project objective is to\n            harmonize national management programs in order to achieve,\n            to the maximum extent possible, the reversal of increasing\n            environmental degradation. This project has eight\n            components. They include: 1) fisheries management; 2)\n            fisheries research; 3) fisheries extension, policies, and\n            laws; 4) water hyacinth control; 5) water quality\n            monitoring; 6) industrial and municipal waste management; 7)\n            land use and wetland management; and 8) policy and\n            institutional framework."}, "docdt": "1996-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
