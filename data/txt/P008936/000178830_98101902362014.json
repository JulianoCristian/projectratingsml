southeastern Turkey, and a parallel study of petroleum\n            geochemistry; (ii) technical assistance and training:\n            provision of experts to help TPAO in specialized areas of\n            carbonategeology, reservoir geology, geophysical data\n            control and interpretation and training of TPAO and Ministry\n            of Energy staff, in the fields of geology,

geophysical surveys including\n            data interpretation in southeastern Turkey, by two seismic\n            crews each for two years; (iv) exploratory drilling of four\n            to six medium-depth wells about 3000 meters deep, based on\n            the results of geophysical and geological studies and\n            seismic surveys; (v) a progam of energy audits in the power\n
