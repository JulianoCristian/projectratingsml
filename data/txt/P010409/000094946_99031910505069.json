Women's\n            involvement in system management is critical for performance\n            (as the primary water collectors in most rural households,\n            women have the most interest in ensuring that the water and\n            sanitation service is designed to match their needs and\n            performs well). The study finds that project designers need\n            to pay close attention to existing levels of social capital\n            in communities, and adjust the approach to service delivery\n            accordingly. In communities with low levels of social\n            capital, special efforts may be necessary to motivate and\n            mobilize community members. Policy recommendations include\n            the advisability of respecting beneficiary aspirations for\n            high standards of service. Maximizing house connections and\n            yard taps both fulfill community aspirations and creates the\n            possibility of collecting enough money through fees and\n            tariffs to make a local water committee worthwhile. Factors\n            such as water committee participation in multiple community,\n            participation in system design and construction, improved\n            beneficiary health, and women's participation in the\n            water group are all positively related to above-average\n            financial management and cost recovery."}, "docdt": "1998-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
