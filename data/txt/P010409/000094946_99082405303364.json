The primary project outcome is confirmation of\n            the feasibility of developing mechanisms for decentralized\n            implementation of relatively large projects that call for a\n            high degree of community participation in design,\n            implementation, and operation. The project exceeded all the\n            physical targets agreed at appraisal. However,\n            sustainability is rated as uncertain at this time. Due in\n            part to the innovative and evolving nature of the delivery\n            mechanism tested, it is concluded that considerable\n            sustained efforts would be required to achieve project\n            sustainability. Both World Bank and Borrower performances\n            are rated satisfactory. Key lessons learned include the\n            following: The decentralized community-based development\n            strategy requires further refinement and consolidation.\n            Community-based organizations need intensive training and\n            awareness raising. Re-allocation of technical assistance\n            funds for physical works should be avoided. Strong financial\n            management and controls in community-based projects are\n            essential. Consistency is needed between government policies\n            and programs and (International Development Association) IDA\n            programs to ensure similarity in approach and financing\n            terms. Projects with a high degree of community\n            participation require long-term sustained support of sector\n            development objectives, and IDA's commitment should not\n            be affected by project implementation challenges."}, "docdt": "1999-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
