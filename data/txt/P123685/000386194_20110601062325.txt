Program Development       The main development objectives of the proposed grant are to: (i) promote
Objective and             efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of public resources
Contribution to Country   through improved public financial management (PFM); and (ii) improve
Partnership Strategy:     specific aspects of the investment climate, including streamlined
                          procedures for business registration and licensing, enhanced legal and
                          taxation frameworks to foster private investment and new regulation to
                          support environmental sustainability in public and private investment
                          projects. The development objectives are consistent with pillars 1 (good
                          governance, macroeconomic stability, public administration reform), and 2
                          (private sector-led growth) of the government’s national development
                          program outlined in its poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP). A more
                          immediate objective is to protect basic service delivery, which is
                          threatened by the budgetary support shortfall currently facing the


                                                 vii
                 government.

Benefits:        Expected benefits of the measures supported by the EGRG III include: (i)
                 greater efficiency and transparency in public financial management; (ii)
                 strengthened control and administrative rationalization of the government’s
                 human resources; (iii) more appropriate debt policies backed by stronger
                 debt-management systems; and (iv) an improved business climate and
                 environmental regulations to foster sustainable private sector development.

Risks and Risk    (a) Shortfalls in external budget support flows. The 2010 shortfall,
Mitigation:           about CFAF20 billion compared with 2009 (or 4.9 percent of GDP),
                      prompted a dramatic adjustment in government investment and
                      purchases of goods and services. Further tightening would put the
                      provision of key social services at risk and could potentially
                      undermine progress in public financial management observed over
                      the last two years. The proposed grant will partially fill the financing
                      gap and obviate further budget cuts.
                  (b) Other external shocks. The economy, being poorly diversified, is
                      susceptible to external shocks. In particular, recent increases in food
                      prices could have serious impacts on domestic inflation, government
                      accounts and external balances. The scope for fiscal mitigation of
                      external shocks from internal resources alone is sharply limited, and
                      would require donor support. In addition, despite the significant
                      improvement in the debt profile produced by Guinea-Bissau’s
                      achievement of the HIPC completion point, the risk of external debt
                      distress is still high and shocks to exports or GDP could lead debt
                      ratios to breach threshold levels. The grant supports reforms in public
                      financial management, debt management and related areas, that
                      would help strengthen the country’s ability to attract external support
                      to help cope with shocks.
                  (c) Political risks. Political instability remains a persistent risk,
                      particularly if tangible benefits from the reform program do not
                      swiftly become apparent to the population, or if the costs of reform to
                      influential constituencies become too high. To mitigate these risks
                      continued support from the international community to the
                      government’s economic reform agenda will remain critical.
                  (d) Implementation capacity. Guinea-Bissau’s technical and
                      institutional capacity to implement the reforms supported by the
                      EGRG III is low. To address this risk in the short term the Bank and
                      other partners have made available a combination of capacity building
                      and technical support.

                   THIRD ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE REFORM GRANT


                                      1. INTRODUCTION

1.1      This Program Document proposes a Third Economic Governance Reform Grant
(EGRG III), in the amount of SDR 4 million (US$6.4 million equivalent) to the Republic of
Guinea-Bissau, following on a previous programmatic series of two development policy
operations, EGRG I and II, implemented over 2009-10. As envisaged in the Interim Strategy
Note (ISN), the two previous EGRG operations were stepping stones on the country’s path to the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) completion point, which it reached in December 2010.
The proposed EGRG III would be a stand-alone operation designed to sustain momentum in the
implementation of the reform agenda supported by EGRG I (approved in June 2009) and EGRG II
(approved in June 2010) and would consolidate recent policy achievements in the wake of G uinea-
Bissau reaching the HIPC Completion Point.

1.2       The proposed EGRG III is intended to serve as a bridge operation while the NPRSP
II is finalized and the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) in support of the NPRSP II
is developed. With recent cuts in budget assistance by several development partners, related to
internal political developments, financial assistance for the 2011 budget under the proposed EGRG
III would be critical, limiting the need for further downward fiscal adjustments, preventing an
economically costly compression of the public investment program, and allowing policymakers to
focus their attention on finalizing and launching their new medium-term agenda.

1.3       The proposed operation is designed to assist the Government of Guinea-Bissau in
completing the first steps in a long term process of financial and management reform that
was initiated in 2009. Recognizing the challenges posed by a difficult economic and political
context and a fragile institutional environment, the project will support the completion of
significant reforms in key areas of public administration and private sector development. While
modest in their development objectives, such improvements will be instrumental in enabling the
government to meet the larger objectives of reducing poverty and achieving levels of economic
growth comparable to those of other countries in the region.

1.4        The proposed EGRG III supports the implementation of reform policies aligned
with Guinea-Bissau’s first National Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (NPRSP). The
proposed EGRG III, like the previous DPOs, focuses on two of the four pillars of the NPRSP. The
first of these pillars—strengthening governance, improving the efficiency of public administration
and establishing macroeconomic stability—aims at consolidating the development and
implementation of a modern legal and organizational framework for public financial management
(PFM) that is consistent with West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) standards.
The second pillar—promoting economic growth and job creation—focuses on improving the
business climate to foster more robust private sector development (PSD). The authorities are
finalizing the preparation of the NPRSP II, which they have tentatively scheduled to complete in
the spring of 2011 and present at a donors’ roundtable later in the year. The proposed grant is also
grounded in the International Development Agency (IDA) assistance strategy described in the
Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Guinea-Bissau discussed by the Board on June 15, 2009.

1.5       Guinea-Bissau has made considerable progress in realigning its macroeconomic
policy with its long-term development goals by implementing a focused agenda of
complementary reforms supported by the two previous EGRGs. The government has
considerably strengthened macroeconomic management in recent years, and in May 2010 the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a 3-year arrangement under the Extended Credit
Facility (ECF) for 2010-2013. The first review of the ECF-supported program was approved by the
IMF Board in December 2010. Moreover, in spite of the difficult political climate the authorities
have made progress in the PFM and PSD areas. The implementation of reforms in these areas and
the overall design of the reform program have built on analytical work and capacity-building
activities supported by other IDA-funding instruments. These include the Low Income Countries
Under Stress (LICUS) and State and Peace-building Fund (SPF) grant-funded operations and the
IDA Private Sector Rehabilitation and Development Project (PSRDP). The operation also
complements support provided by the African Development Bank (AfDB), the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), and other donors.

1.6      Despite encouraging progress in recent years on the economic and institutional
fronts, Guinea-Bissau continues to face extraordinary short- and medium-term development
challenges typical of a fragile state. As highlighted in the ISN, recent progress towards
macroeconomic stabilization notwithstanding the country remains locked in a low-equilibrium trap
of continued political instability, weak governance and disappointing economic performance. The
2009 ISN also argues that donors, including the Bank, will have to move toward a more forceful
engagement strategy capable of effectively supporting large-scale systemic change in Guinea-
Bissau. The proposed operation represents a transition to a more ambitious and integrated Bank
program to be described in detail in the next CAS aimed at assisting Guinea Bissau to implement
the upcoming NPRSP II and to break the cycle of low economic growth and persistent instability.
1.7       The proposed EGRG III is also consistent with the orientations for Bank
engagement in fragile states that are outlined in the 2011 World Development Report on
Conflict, Security and Development and the new Africa Strategy. While modest in their
objectives, the EGRG I and II and this stand alone operation promote incremental institutional
development. In this regard, the definition of the areas supported by the proposed operation reflects
a high degree of selectivity with focus on a small number of reforms that are feasible given the
complex political situation weak institutional and technical capacity. In addition, the delivery of
budget support through this proposed operation enables the predictability of inflows of financial
support and enhances the Government fiscal management. Finally, following the new Africa
Strategy recommendations, the proposed EGRG III have benefitted from technical cooperation
with other agencies such as the European Union, the IMF and the AfDB, taking advantage of the
comparative advantages of these partners in specific policy areas at the national, regional and
global levels.

                                    2.   COUNTRY CONTEXT

                     A. B ACKGROUND AND R ECENT P OLITICAL D EVELOPMENTS

2.1      Guinea-Bissau is one of the smallest and poorest countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.
With an estimated 1.54 million inhabitants, the population is young—about 42 percent is under
14 years of age—and is now growing at an average rate of 2.2 percent per year. Annual Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is estimated at US$550. The economy is highly vulnerable to
weather fluctuations: agriculture represented about 50 percent of GDP in 2009 and remains the


                                                  2
main source of employment in rural areas. Cashew is the main cash crop (representing 98 percent
of exports) and is strongly linked to other sectors, such as labor-intensive cashew processing, trade
and transportation.

2.2        Guinea-Bissau is a country with significant, but largely unfulfilled development
potential. The country has good agricultural, mining and even tourism potential, but political
instability following the brief civil war in 1998 has proven to be a severe barrier to economic
development. Macroeconomic management over the last decade was highly uneven and growth
was anemic. Attempts at stabilization in the early 2000s faltered in the wake of ongoing political
instability and severe structural weaknesses in fiscal management. Average GDP growth over the
period 1999-2007 stood at only about 1 percent per year.

2.3       Protracted political instability has plagued the country since the late 1990s. President
João Bernardo Vieira, who came into power after a coup d’état in 1980, was ousted in 1999 after a
brief civil war that began in June 1998. Since 1999, political instability has continued to be high
with 14 successive governments during 1999-2009 and a bloodless coup in 2003. Presidential
elections in June 2005 brought Vieira back from exile and returned him to the presidency. While
the president is constitutionally independent from the legislature and former administrations have
been marked by an extreme concentration of power in the office of the president, the government
is constitutionally subject to parliamentary confidence, and in recent years an increasingly
assertive legislature has fostered tensions between the offices of the president and prime minister.
Parliamentary elections in November 2008, deemed fair and transparent by international observers,
restored to power the historically dominant African Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau
and Cape Verde (PAIGC), which won more than two thirds of the National Assembly’s 100 seats.
Following the back-to-back assassinations of former President Vieira and the army chief of staff in
March 2009, Malam Bacai Sanha of the PAIGC won the presidency by a decisive margin in the
runoff election held at the end of July 2009.

2.4       Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain. The peaceful presidential
election of 2009 seemed to have alleviated tensions and facilitated the consolidation of the PAIGC
administration. Nevertheless, as indicated in the 2009 ISN, due to the persistent political
instability, weak governance and poor economic performance, sources of tensions remain. A
definitive break from this cycle will take time and it should be expected to be punctuated by
recurring political volatility. This was well illustrated in early April 2010, when the Army’s
second-in-command arrested the Prime Minister and the Chief of Staff of the Army. After strong
public demonstrations in favor of the democratically elected government the Prime Minister was
quickly released; however, as a compromise solution to the events in April, the former Chief of
Staff of the Army was officially replaced by one of the leaders of the military insurgency (the
former second-in-command). Moreover, another military figure, the former head of the Navy, was
reinstated in his post, even after having been listed by the US authorities as involved in the global
drug traffic. These events, combined with a general lack of progress on the government ’s security
sector reform agenda, have led to the interruption of aid flows from the European Union and key
bilateral donors. Following negotiations, in April 2011, under Article 96 of the Cotonou Accord,
the government has since undertaken to adopt and implement a roadmap toward addressing the
concerns raised by the EU, which in turn has announced a partial and conditional resumption of its
aid program, albeit without budget support. More broadly, the episodes in April 2010 and further
developments have only reaffirmed the urgent need for, and the complexity of, reform ing Guinea-
Bissau’s security sector in order to reorganize the armed forces and reduce their size.

          Box 2.1: Recent Developments in the Defense and Security Sector Reform
    In spite of the political disruptions that affected the implementation of actions concerned with the defense and
    security sector and led to the suspension of the European Union mission in support to the defense sector reform
    (EU SSR Guinea-Bissau) and budget support operations, Government and other partners’ actions to reform the
    sector were not interrupted during this period.
    In January 2010, the Government adopted the Reform of the Defense and Security Sector (RDSS) program
    adopted. The RDSS aims at downsizing the Army with a new and clearly defined structure. It also aims at
    modernizing and restructuring the police force from nine to four bodies with better defined competences and
    plans to build capacity in the judiciary.
    In April and May of 2010 the legal framework for the defense and security forces’ new mission and mandate
    was revised. The People’s National Assembly approved over a dozen legal texts to reorganize and restructure
    the defense and security sector such as the Law on National Defense and the Armed Forces, the Basic Organic
    Law of the Organization of the Armed Forces, the Statutory Regime of the Armed Forces, the Code of Military
    Justice, the Organic Law of the Ministry of Public Security and Homeland Affairs and the Organic Law of the
    Police Force for Public Order.
    In August 2010, the Committee of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Chiefs of
    Defense Staff and a restricted Group of Chiefs of Defense Staff of the Community of Portuguese- Speaking
    Countries (CPLP) recommended the approval of an action plan to assist Guinea Bissau in overcoming the
    security challenges presently facing the country. The action plan includes the creation of a financing
    mechanism for the efficient implementation of the reform of the Armed Forces through the establishment of a
    pension fund, the redeployment of military personnel, the restructuring, training and improvement of the living
    and working conditions of the Armed Forces.
    In November 2010, ECOWAS approved a road map for the Reform of the Defense and Security Sectors and
    pledged financial and technical support to the Reform. Up to May 2011, the Government of Guinea- Bissau
    has not yet officially adopted this road map. Nonetheless, the initial actions of the plan su ch as technical
    support missions from ECOWAS partners are being implemented.
    In March 2011, the Government of Angola initiated its SSR technical support mission in Guinea-Bissau
    (MISSANG). The mission was set up to initiate the implementation of reforms within Bissau-Guinean defense
    and police forces, namely rehabilitation of military and police infrastructures and training.
    In March 2011, under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, consultations between the Guinea-Bissau
    authorities and EU representatives took place in Brussels. Aid is expected to be partially restored, conditional
    on the government undertaking judiciary investigations and proceedings on the events of April 1, 2010 and the
    definition of a timetable for the implementation of the defense and security reform.



                                    B. R ECENT E CONOMIC D EVELOPMENTS

2.5        Despite continued challenges on the political front and adverse external shocks
during 2008-2010, economic performance improved somewhat. Economic growth has been
resilient, with real GDP slipping only slightly from 3.2 percent in 2008 to 3.0 percent in 2009 and
recovering to 3.5 percent in 2010 driven by good cashew crops, moderate expansion of food crops,
an uptick in construction activity and a gradual normalization of the fiscal situation. With the
continued rise in food and energy prices in the first half of 2008, inflation peaked at an average
annual rate of 10.5 percent—one of the highest rates in WAEMU—before dropping to a negative
1.6 percent in 2009 as food and fuel prices fell back towards levels closer to historical trends and
eventually stabilized at 2.5 percent in 2010, below the WAEMU inflation band. Despite strong
cashew exports the external current account deficit, excluding official transfers, widened to about
10.5 percent and 12 percent of GDP in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The 2008 outcome was
affected by a sharp increase in the import costs of food and fuel. In 2009, declining export prices
for cashew nuts, which fell by almost 30 percent from 2008, led to a 13 percent decrease in the

terms of trade, with the total value of exports plummeting by 10 percent. Moreover, remittances
also declined from 4 percent of GDP in 2008 to 2.7 percent of GDP in 2009. In 2010, however, as
a result of the recovery of cashew prices the external current account deficit is expected to narrow
to 9.3 percent of GDP.

2.6      Fiscal policy was strengthened in 2009, contributing to a satisfactory performance
under the IMF’s Emergency and Post-Conflict Assistance (EPCA) initiative. The EPCA-
supported program focused on meeting current-year expenditures with available resources and

                                                                                        5
avoiding the accumulation of new budgetary arrears. Despite the sharply reduced cashew prices
(taxes on cashew account for some 25 percent of tax revenues), the 2009 domestic primary deficit
closed to 2.9 percent of GDP, well below the previously projected 4.5 percent, reflecting improved
revenue administration and stronger expenditure controls. Domestic primary expenditures fell by
0.5 percent of GDP due mainly to the wage bill being frozen in nominal terms and the imposition
of stricter budgetary controls over spending on goods and services made possible by the new
budget execution system. The wage-bill-to-domestic-revenue ratio fell from 103 percent in 2008 to
66 percent in 2010. Progress was also satisfactory on the implementation of the structural agenda,
with important steps taken in the areas of public financial management, civil service reform and
private sector development.

2.7      Prudent fiscal policies and a return to sound macroeconomic fundamentals have
allowed Guinea-Bissau to weather the adverse impacts of the global financial crisis relatively
well. In 2009, fiscal and external deficits were kept under control and inflation dropped to single
digits. Progress in shoring-up its key macroeconomic indicators while rebuilding the government’s
technical and administrative capacity established the basis for renewed donor support, which
allowed public investment to rise from 6.5 percent to 9 percent of GDP. The negative impact of the
global recession was transmitted mainly through export values and remittances, both cutting into
domestic demand at a time when room for fiscal stimulus was sharply limited. The fiscal impact of
the global financial crisis was significant— slower economic activity and low cashew prices
negatively affected tax revenues—but it also prompted a solid response from the authorities to
begin to strengthen institutional efficiency, leading the government to accelerate tax collection
efforts, tighten spending, and improving expenditure controls.

2.8      On the strength of the government’s efforts towards macroeconomic stabilization, in
May 2010 the IMF approved a three-year program under the Extended Credit Facility
(ECF) for the period 2010-13. Implementation of the program has been broadly satisfactory; the
first review was completed in December 2010 and the second review is expected to be completed
at the end of May, 2011.1 Nonetheless, following the political disruptions of April 2010, Guinea-
Bissau has faced a significant shortfall in anticipated donor support that has complicated its fiscal
management efforts. Budget support operations by the European Union (EU) and key bilateral
donors have been interrupted and only IDA and AfDB budget support operation remained. As a
result, budget support grants fell from 7.3percent of GDP in 2009 to 2.3 percent in 2010. A slight
recovery of budget support flows is expected in 2011 due to the budget support operation (already
disbursed) from the Government of Angola. Despite this setback, the authorities have stayed the
course in terms of the reform agenda, achieving an impressive improvement in domestic revenue

 1
  An IMF mission visited Bissau between March 10 and 23, 2011 to perform the Second Review under the ECF. The
 Statement at the conclusion of the mission indicates that the government’s performance continues to be satisfactory,
 and all the structural criteria as of end- December were met. All quantitative targets were also met. The IMF’s
 Executive Board is scheduled to consider the Second Review of Guinea -Bissau’s economic performance under the
 ECF in May, when the second disbursement of US$3.6 million become s available.

performance, enforcing tighter controls over current spending and, somewhat more
problematically for growth prospects, postponing planned public investments. As a result, the
domestic primary fiscal deficit, initially projected at 4 percent of GDP, is now estimated to have
come out at only 1.4 percent for 2010.

2.9     The authorities also launched the implementation of their medium-term arrears-
clearance plan. Domestic arrears are sizable, and while estimates vary, the stock that has been
identified amounts to about 24 percent of GDP. These include wage arrears, arrears to domestic
banks, the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), and the West African Development
Bank (BOAD), and commercial arrears to the private sector. The authorities’ plan has two stages.
During the first stage arrears were identified and verified. These include arrears owed to
commercial banks and the BCEAO, which entail high financial costs to the government, as well as
public-sector wage arrears from 2008, and pre-civil war arrears to the private sector. At the
beginning of 2010, the arrears to the commercial banks were cleared. In June 2010, an additional
CFAF 3.5 billion (about 0.8 percent of GDP) of arrears to the private sector were also cleared. In
the second stage the government intends to complete the audit of post-civil war arrears and address
them after they have been fully accounted and verified. Given the current and anticipated shortfalls
in budget support, in 2011 the government and the IMF agreed to slowing down the pace of
arrears’ reduction.

2.10 Successful completion of the first and second reviews of the IMF-supported ECF
program coupled with progress on structural reforms allowed Guinea-Bissau to reach the
HIPC Completion Point in December 2010. Sustained policy reform implementation allowed
Guinea-Bissau to receive comprehensive debt relief under the HIPC program and the Multilateral
Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Debt relief has produced a significant improvement in the country’s
public and external debt trajectory, and should help reinforce the economy’s resilience to
macroeconomic shocks. The normalization of relations with creditors and the restoration of donor
support flows are expected to provide further fiscal space for the resumption of vital public
spending—particularly capital investments in priority infrastructure projects—needed to improve
the country’s structural growth potential. The gradual recovery of global economic conditions
should also support an increase in private investment.

                C. M ACROECONOMIC O UTLOOK IN 2011 AND D EBT SUSTAINABILITY

2.11 On the fiscal front, despite the shortfall in budget support flows the government has
maintained its commitment to fiscal discipline. Based on the enhancement of domestic revenue
mobilization and tightening of controls on personnel and operating expenses in 2011, the
government is keeping the overall deficit below 3 percent of GDP. The adoption of stronger tax
collection oversight and the use of electronic devices in customs administration with the gradual
introduction of the ASYCUDA ++ system have allowed the government to increase domestic
revenues by more than 2 percent of GDP between 2009 and 2010. Preliminary figures for 2011
indicate that this increasing trend in domestic revenue could continue over the long term to levels
observed in the West African Region (about 15 percent of GDP). Moreover, the increase in cashew
export volumes, as well as higher international prices, is expected to have a positive impact on
government revenues in 2011. Finally, bilateral budget support from Angola is partially offsetting
the interruption in budget support operations by Guinea-Bissau’s traditional European partners.

2.12 On the expenditure side the government has pursued the strict control of recurrent
expenses. The government maintained the salary freeze begun in 2010, completed the revision and


                                                  8
unification of the payroll bill, and began to regulate the recruitment and appointment of staff in the
education and health sectors. As a result, the personnel-expenses-to-domestic-revenue ratio is
expected to fall to less than 65 percent in 2011. Due to increasing energy and food prices and the
impossibility of continuing to subsidize these goods, the government decided to allow an increase
in domestic fuel prices and to review its subsidies on rice and wheat. Finally, faced with the
shortfall in external budget support, the government has slowed down the process of arrears’
clearance. In this context of fiscal tightening, the resumption of budget support flows could be
used either to finance public investment or to speed up the payment of arrears to the private sector.

2.13 On the external front, the trade and current-account balances are expected to remain
at levels similar to those observed in 2010. Changes in commodity prices are expected to
counteract one another. Cashew exports and oil and food imports are projected to increase without
a clear net effect on the current account. As a result, the external current account deficit (excluding
official transfers) is expected to stabilize around 10 percent of GDP in 2011, and is expected to
gradually decline to 7 percent over the medium term. While the increase in commodity prices
seems to have had a moderate effect on the external balances, this increase and the government
decision to reduce subsidies, will have some effect on domestic inflation, which is expected to rise
to 4.5 percent in 2011.

2.14 In the context of high cashew export prices and tight budget constraints, the
government has very recently reinstated a levy on cashew exports, earmarked to support the
cashew sector. The levy, at FCAF50 per kilo (about US$110 per ton, or 7 percent of current world
prices for Guinea-Bissau’s high-premium cashew), will finance a Fund for the Industrialization of
Agriculture Products (FUNPI) for developing cashew agriculture and processing activities,
managed under a public-private partnership with the local Chamber of Commerce Industry and
Agriculture (CCIA). Coming at the tail end of the harvest season in a context of unusually high
world cashew prices, the levy is not expected to affect current crop volumes, farm incomes, and
gross export earnings to a large degree, so the critical issues for impact assessment are forward-
looking, entailing the effects on future cashew output, farm incomes, and export revenues if the
levy is maintained, especially if world prices fall from their current high level. Moreover, the
potential yield of the levy is high—close to US$16 million this year—and it could thus constitute a
significant source of funding for much needed investments in the cashew sector that could benefit
a large spectrum of stakeholders, if funds and activities are well managed. 2

2.15 The fiscal scenario through 2012 (see Table 2.2) assumes a continuation of recent
trends. Revenues would recover some lost ground, and current spending would be contained
through a combination of improved expenditure controls, a modest decrease from 2009 in the
weight of civil service wages in relation to GDP, and significant cuts in the interest costs of
domestic and foreign debt. However, even this fiscal consolidation scenario assumes the continued
engagement of donors at a high level. Grants, including direct budget support, and loans averaging
the equivalent of almost 11 percent of GDP would be required to finance a minimal level of capital
expenditures in 2012 and increase priority spending on social sectors, infrastructure, and capacity
building to the levels envisaged in the government’s second NPRSP.


 2
   In a previous experience, in 2005, the government had also introduced a discriminatory application of the levy
 across exporters and bundled its introduction with new restrictions on entry into cashew processing, two features
 that are no longer applied. Nonetheless, given the measure’s potentially significant impacts, the Bank team intends
 to support the government in an assessment of the effects of this levy on the incomes of the poor and the economy at
 large, and, if needed, in the identification of more suitable instruments to achieve government objectives.

2.16 Under the joint Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) prepared in December
2010, Guinea-Bissau’s medium and long-term debt sustainability and growth outlook is
positive. Under the baseline scenario that anchored the recent HIPC debt relief operation, GDP
growth could accelerate to 4.5 percent in 2012 and remain at that level over the long term. This
exceeds the historical average by roughly one percentage point, reflecting a past marked by great
political instability and inappropriate macroeconomic policies, conditions which are expected to
improve in the period ahead. Growth is also expected to be supported by the diversification of
agriculture, the rebuilding of infrastructure—especially roads, ports, electricity capacity, and water
systems—and by average growth in cashew production of 4.5 percent over the 2015-2030 period.3

2.17 Guinea-Bissau’s external public debt and external-debt indicators improved
considerably due to the full delivery of HIPC assistance, additional bilateral assistance
beyond HIPC, topping-up assistance4, and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)
assistance approved in December 2010. At end-2010, Guinea-Bissau’s stock of external debt
amounted to US$1,066.7 million, of which US$427.5 million were arrears. As a result of
comprehensive debt relief the present value (PV) of Guinea-Bissau’s debt-to-exports ratio at end-
2010 sharply dropped to 88.4 percent (from 680 percent) and is projected to further decline to 69.1
percent by 2030. Similarly, the PV of the debt-to-GDP and debt-to-revenue ratios also declined,
falling from 22.6 percent and 225.6 percent on average in 200919 to 11.2 percent and 97.5
percent in 2020–30, respectively.

2.18 The government is firmly committed to maintaining debt sustainability. In this regard,
following achievement of the HIPC completion point, the authorities have decided to rely
exclusively on grants and concessional borrowing to meet the government’s financing needs for
the foreseeable future. The authorities are also aware that lasting debt sustainability will depend on
strengthening the administration’s debt-management capacity and mobilizing domestic revenue to
reduce reliance on external financing. In this regard, the government has adopted deci sive
measures in both areas that are supported by the proposed operation.

Macroeconomic Risks in the Short Run

2.19 Rising inflation is becoming the most important source of macroeconomic risks in
2011. Increasing food and fuel prices, which spurred inflation to over 10 percent in 2008, again
pose a risk to macroeconomic stability and present a crucial challenge for fiscal policy. To limit
the transmission of global price increases to the domestic market the government subsidizes
imported food and fuel, but these subsidies have now reached the limit of their usefulness, and
expanding them to offset further price increases would be neither fiscally feasible nor
economically effective. Rising import prices have already pushed annualized inflation to 5 percent
in December 2010, and average inflation is projected to reach 4.5 percent in 2011 . Nevertheless,
with Guinea-Bissau’s participation in the regional monetary union, WAEMU, medium-term
inflation rates are assumed to return to the regional average in 2012—about 2.5 percent per year.


 3
   IDA has been actively supporting the energy sector. The Multi-sector Infrastructure Rehabilitation project (MIRP)
 was restructured in 2010 reallocating resources to increase the energy supply in Bissau and to provide technical
 assistance to improve the performance of the utility company (EAGB). The Emergency Electricity and Water
 Rehabilitation Project (EEWRP) was approved in FY11 and it is focused in the expansion of the electricity
 generation capacity.
 4
   Topping-up assistance was approved by IDA Board on March 21, 2011. Creditors of the Club of Paris approved
 their topping-up assistance on May 11, 2011.


                                                         10
2.20 A deeper shortfall in budget support flows is unlikely. As reflected above, the
interruption of budget support operations by the EU and key donors led to an overall shortfall in
budget support of about CFAF 20 billion or 4 percent of GDP in 2010. The shortfall prompted a
dramatic adjustment in government investments and goods and service purchases. In 2011, the
fiscal program supported by the IMF’s ECF anticipates a modest recovery in budget support flows
of about CFAF 4 billion compared to 2010 levels, with contribution from the African Development
Bank, the government of Angola—whose budget support has already been disbursed—and the
proposed EGRG-III operation.

2.21 Difficulties to control the personnel expenditures in the education sector represent an
important source of fiscal risk in the expenditure side. While the government has been able to
control overall personnel expenditures, irregular recruitment of teachers make unpredictable the
wage bill of the education sector and result in arrears that could jeopardize the government fiscal
adjustment efforts.

2.22 The main downside risks to the macroeconomic outlook remain primarily political.
Political instability could flare up again and the government’s commitment to fiscal stabilization
and to furthering reforms, as illustrated in the recent past, could come under pressure either from
within or outside the government’s political base, especially if tangible benefits of reforms do not
become apparent to the population, or if the costs of reform to narrow constituencies become too
high. The positive growth scenario described above assumes that domestic political stability will
gain further traction. While there is reason to be cautiously optimistic, the reform of the defense
and security sector will test the country’s civilian and military leaderships’ willingness to accept
the changes necessary to move to a new development path.

2.23 On the upside, medium- to long-term growth, investment and exports could be
significantly and positively affected by possible mining ventures to exploit the country’s
bauxite and phosphate resources. Phosphate mining offers serious prospects for expansion of the
mining sector, but would require equally large investments in dedicated infrastructure. The current
growth scenario does not include these possible ventures, given the limited information on the
scope of these projects, their large infrastructure prerequisites and, and the difficult global context.
Though mining is an opportunity, mining is also fraught with risks to sustainable development
prospects in Guinea-Bissau, and there will remain a need to identify and implement structural and
institutional reforms to ensure that the development benefits of mining projects are max imized and
potential downsides are mitigated.

2.24 In summary, the policy framework underlying the government’s macroeconomic
management provides an adequate basis for the proposed operation. The government is
handling the current shortfall in external budget support remarkably well through its maintenance
of a tight fiscal policy and refusal to access unsustainably expensive private credit. However, in
order for the government to reach its modest goals and guarantee the sustainability of the positive
results observed in the last three years, policy implementation must continue to improve. This will
require a sustained commitment to the goals of fiscal stabilization and reforms, as well as efforts
toward continued capacity building.

                                   3. THE GOVERNMENT’S NPRSP

                                A. THE C HALLENGE OF PERVASIVE P OVERTY

3.1     The impact of the 1998-99 conflict, subsequent political instability and poor economic
performance through most of the last decade has contributed to high and persistent rates of
poverty. Guinea-Bissau is one of the world’s poorest countries. It ranked 164 th out of 169
countries on the 2010 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Human Development
Index and poverty is widespread, with a higher incidence in rural areas. In July 2010, the
government’s Statistical Institute undertook a new poverty survey (Inquérito Ligeiro de Avaliação
da Pobreza, ILAP II). Results show that close to 67 percent of the population was living in poverty
in 2010, with 32percent living in extreme poverty, an increase from 2002. About 80 percent of the
poor live in rural areas and practice subsistence agriculture. The country is not likely to reach any
of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015, given current trends and without
significantly donor support.
3.2     The poor in Guinea-Bissau are also affected by the poor quality of, and limited access
to, basic social services. Life expectancy is estimated at 48.6 years in 2010 5, down from 55 years
in 1995. However, encouraging developments in the social sector have emerged from a recent
survey on access to social services. After an observed decline in social indicators until 2006, data
from the 2010 Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey (MICS) shows strong progress on most
indicators related to education, gender equality, health and HIV/AIDS.

                    B. O VERVIEW OF THE N ATIONAL P OVERTY R EDUCTION S TRATEGY

3.3     In 2007 Guinea-Bissau finalized its first National Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(NPRSP). According the Joint IDA-IMF Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) of the NPRSP prepared in
2007, the government strategy was built on grassroots consultations at the National level involving
all segments of the society. The consultative process included three levels of participation: (i) a
political and institutional level engaging the Government and its development partners; (ii) a
technical level, engaging national public and private sector leaders as well as civil society leaders;
and (iii)a popular and community level based on consultations with stakeholders in rural and urban
areas

3.4     Until 2009 progress was largely unobservable, as a number of the most crucial
reforms were slow to produce measurable results and monitoring capacity was limited . The
first Annual Progress Report (APR) presented by the government at the end of 2009 provides a
candid assessment of developments during this period and recognizing the modest progress
obtained under the NPRSP’s four structural pillars: (i) strengthening governance, modernizing the
public administration and establishing greater macroeconomic stability; (ii) enhancing economic
growth and job creation; (iii) increasing access to social services and basic infrastructure; and (iv)
improving the living conditions of vulnerable groups.

3.5    Since 2009, however, impressive advances have been recorded under each of the
NPRSP’s pillars. As reported in the recent 2010 JSAN6 on the Second APR, prepared in August
2010, much of the progress achieved since 2009 has been under the first two pillars. In particular,

several successful measures to improve public financial management and the business climate
were initiated or accelerated during 2009-2010. Much of the substantive progress on major NPRSP
policy areas was achieved during a period of relative peace, stability and security.

                C. PROGRESS WITH P OVERTY R EDUCTION POLICIES AND PROGRAMS

Policies to strengthen governance, improve public administration, and ensure
macroeconomic stability

3.6     The government has been making satisfactory progress on the macroeconomic
stabilization front. Solid performance under the IMF 2009 EPCA program paved the way for the
approval, in May 2010, of a three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF). Guinea-Bissau’s
completion of the first ECF review in December 2010 was, in turn, crucial to meeting one of the
long overdue HIPC completion point requirements. The country’s improved fiscal performance
has been key to the success of its macroeconomic stabilization efforts.

3.7      Satisfactory progress has been achieved in implementing PFM reforms. The legal and
institutional framework for public financial management has been strengthened with the adoption
by the Council of Minister and the National Assembly of a number of key laws aimed at bring ing
the legislation in the area of public finances in conformity with the 1997 WAEMU directives. The
budgetary preparation and execution is supported since late 2008 by the entry into effect of the
budgetary software system SIGFIP, and the adoption of a budgetary nomenclature in line with
WAEMU standards. To improve transparency and oversight in the use of public finances, the
government began publishing comprehensive quarterly budget execution reports in 2010. More
significantly, for the first time since independence the government’s fiscal year (FY) 2009 and
2010 Annual Statement of Accounts was submitted to the Court of Accounts in September 2010
and May 2011, respectively.

3.8    Wide-ranging and well-focused public procurement reforms were adopted by the
authorities in mid-2010. The new Public Procurement Law was passed in June 2010, which
harmonizes procedures with WAEMU standards and internationally recognized good practices.
The new Law establishes a Public Procurement Regulatory Authority with policy formulation and
external oversight responsibilities, as well as a Central Procurement Unit that should replace
individual procurement units for line ministries.

3.9     Initial progress has also been made in implementing reforms to modernize the public
administration. In 2009 the government launched a comprehensive administrative reform
program supported by an EU-funded project Public Administration Reform Assistance Project
(PARAP) which aims at reforming the government’s administrative structure, strengthening
control over the wage bill, reducing the size of the public service, and rationalizing the
management of human resources. During the first half of 2010 the government completed the
verification process and on-site controls for the 2009 biometric census of all public sector staff.
The census helped to identify ―double dippers‖ (officials holding multiple posts) and ―ghost
workers‖ (individuals receiving unearned salaries), which together represent about 18 percent of
employees (almost 4,000 out of the 22, 236) covered by the census.

Policies to promote economic growth and job creation

3.10 Limited progress has been achieved in the expansion and rehabilitation of economic
infrastructure. The poverty reduction strategy has included infrastructure development as one of
its top priorities. However, the performance of the energy, seaport and road transportation sectors
continues to seriously constrain economic growth and poverty reduction.

3.11 The government recognizes the importance of improving the environment for private
sector development. Guinea-Bissau ranks 176th out of 183 countries covered by the World Bank’s
2011 Doing Business report. In two out of the nine issues covered by the survey, the ease of
starting and closing a business, the country ranks in last place; and in an additional area,
registering property, it ranks 175th. In April 2010 a decree simplifying procedures for business
registration and significantly reducing the number of administrative steps required for these
processes, was adopted by the government. Another decree was passed formally mandating the
establishment of a one-stop shop for business registration.

3.12 In addition, the government has made strong progress on the institutional and fiscal
treatment of investment with the adoption of a new Investment Code in December 2009. The
Investment Code of 1991 was rife with the potential for abuse and discretionary preferential
treatment. The new Code ensures that incentives are considered automatic, removing the discretion
that could be exercised by government officials under the old law; it also guarantees that there is
no discrimination among projects on the basis of size, and that the multiplicity of investment
regimes is eliminated to remove confusion and reduce fraud and evasion.

3.13 Finally, the National Assembly recently approved a new Telecommunications Law.
Last year’s EGRG pointed out that in this sector the main challenge is to consolidate an enabling
regulatory framework to allow for further growth and competition. The new law for
telecommunications ensures a level playing field for private investors in a sector that has expanded
rapidly in recent years.

Policies to increase access to social services and basic infrastructures

3.14 Broader access to social services contributed to the strong improvement in education
and health indicators in recent years. This has been well illustrated by the results of the July
2010 Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey (MICS), which show strong progress on most indicators
related to education, gender equality, health and HIV/AIDS. The 2010 MICS follows similar
surveys conducted in 2000 and 2006.
3.15 In the education sector, school enrolment and gender equality in education improved
considerably during the last ten years. The MICS surveys show that school enrolment rates
increased from 42 percent in 2000 to 65 percent in 2010 after falling to 45 percent in 2006. There
was an equally rapid improvement in gender equality in education, with converging school
enrollment rates: the ratio of girls’ to boys’ enrollment grew from 0.67 in 2002 to 0.83 in 2006 and
to 0.94 in 2010. Also remarkable is the reduction in illiteracy rates among young women (15 to 24
years) from 83 percent in 2000 to 72 percent in 2006 and to 61 percent in 2010.
3.16 In the health sector, promising developments have also taken place after 2006. Under-
five child mortality, after increasing from 203 deaths per 1000 births in 2000 to 223 in 2006, fell to
155 in 2010. Infant mortality followed the same pattern, increasing from 124 deaths per 1000
births in 2000 to 138 in 2006 and declining to 104 in 2010. Moreover, in 2009, the government


                                                  14
completed the construction of four new health centers, as well as rehabilitated and re-equipped two
hospitals, expanded the national hospital in Bissau, and renovated the Motor Bra rehabilitation
clinic and appointed new management.

Policies to improve the living conditions of vulnerable groups

3.17 Vulnerable groups are numerous and diverse in Guinea-Bissau, including women,
youth, orphaned children, handicapped, people living with HIV/AIDS, and survivors of
armed conflict. The NPRSP had emphasized the need to improve the lives of vulnerable groups
and prescribed actions to ensure that these groups are effectively able to benefit from economic
opportunities and access social services. The broad strategy in this area is to (i) increase and
improve access to basic social services; and (ii) develop programs to promote the development of
income-generating activities and the economic integration of the most vulnerable populations,
mainly through micro lending and community development.

3.18 This NPRSP pillar has received insufficient attention from successive Bissau-Guinean
governments over the recent past. Government actions targeted to improve the welfare of
vulnerable groups have been concentrated on gender and youth areas. In addition to efforts to
improve girls’ school enrollment rates, key actions undertaken in 2009 and 2010 towards
promoting gender equality centered on drafting proposed legal texts on reproductive health,
violence against women and girls; and trafficking in persons.

The Second National Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (NPRSP II)

3.19 The implementation of the first NPRSP provides a foundation for the preparation of
the second NPRSP, which is expected to be adopted by the Council of Ministers by mid-2011.
The government has demonstrated an impressive and laudable commitment to learning from the
experience of the first NPRSP and to using those lessons to inform future development planning.
The first and second Annual Progress Reports are being used by the government to strengthen their
strategy, including by focusing on a few specific policy objectives, providing guidance on
budgetary prioritization, relying on realistic macroeconomic assumptions, devoting more emphasis
on economic growth, strengthening the results framework and corresponding mechanisms for
monitoring and evaluation, and ensuring overall consistency in government actions.

3.20 The main objectives of the government strategy are to achieve a significant and
lasting reduction in poverty and to make progress toward the achievement of the MDGs. To
that end, the pace of economic growth will need to be stepped up, particularly in those sec tors that
provide employment for the poor, and the economy will need to diversify. Particular attention has
to be given to private sector development, an area where the NPRSP is expected to draw from the
recommendations of the recent Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) and Country Economic
Memorandum (CEM). Efforts must be pursued to improve macroeconomic management and
consolidate administrative reforms to ensure the quality provision of basic public services
(education, healthcare, and water and sanitation). Environmental management will be dealt with
more consistently in the next NPRSP.

                                 CORE REFORM PROGRAM

                               A. L INKS TO THE INTERIM S TRATEGY N OTE

4.1      The Interim Strategy Note (ISN) discussed by the Board in June 2009 sets out the
Bank Group’s support to the government’s reform program for the period FY10-11. The
ISN aims at helping the government to address select and immediate challenges within the
confines of IDA’s limited resource envelope for the country by supporting the government in its
efforts to implement a basic transitional program in a challenging environment. As noted above,
its goals are aligned with the 2008 National Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (NPRSP) and
articulated around three of its pillars: (i) strengthening economic management and (ii) laying the
foundations for growth in existing productive sectors, and (iii) increasing access to and quality of
basic services. Capacity development will be a cross cutting theme, and building partnerships a
guiding principle. The ISN foresees the use of development policy operations, investment
projects and trust fund resources, and the undertaking of analytical and advisory activities.

4.2     By supporting the first three pillars of the NPRSP, the proposed operation is an
integral part of the Bank’s strategy and is seen as an important step in helping stabilize the
economic situation in Guinea-Bissau, support economic recovery and prepare the ground
for the post HIPC completion point period. In particular, the EGRG supports the core
objectives and expected outcomes of the ISN, strengthening economic management with its
focus on improving governance, transparency and efficiency in public expenditure management,
laying foundations for improvements in productive sectors by advancing legal and administrative
reforms aimed at fostering private sector development, and improving service delivery in
education through the strengthening the human resource management in the sector.

                       B. C OLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND O THER D ONORS

4.3    The staffs of the IDA and the IMF collaborate closely on Guinea-Bissau. The
preparation of the Joint Staff Advisory Note on the Second Annual progress Report on the
NPRSP and the HIPC Completion Point Document and the Joint Debt Sustainability Analysis
prepared by the staffs has demanded a high level of cooperation between both institutions in
2010. Regularly IDA typically takes the lead on sectoral issues, including public sector
management, private sector development and infrastructure provision. The IMF takes the lead on
macroeconomic policies. Both institutions support structural reforms in public finance,
procurement, debt management and private sector development. Staffs collaborate in identifying
and supporting reforms in budget systems, accounting and treasury that are part of the IDA
budget support operations and the IMF ECF program with the country. In a number of areas
where the ECF and this operation overlap the work is being carefully coordinated to ensure that
consistent advice is provided to the authorities and that triggers and structural benchmarks are
complementary.7

4.4    In particular, the staffs have closely collaborated on the preparation of the
structural agenda that is supported by the proposed EGRG III and the Fund’s ECF
approved in May 2010. The specific PFM reforms supported by the proposed operation are

                                                      16
fully consistent with IMF policy and technical advice. Moreover, efforts are made to ensure
complementarities between Fund and Bank supported reforms: first, the Fund takes the lead in
tax policy and administration, while reforms under the proposed operation focus on expenditure
management; second, Fund-led reforms aim at addressing structural issues critical to improving
fiscal policy outcomes, while Bank-led reforms aim at addressing foundational and systems
issues that underpin the authorities’ capacity to implement their NPRSP.

4.5     As recommended by the 2001 WDR, the proposed operation has benefitted from the
cooperation with other partners. As indicated above, the EU is funding a technical assistance
project for the reform of the public administration. The EU is supporting the authorities in
designing a comprehensive multi-year reform action plan to reform and modernize the public
administration and reduce its size. A project unit was put in place in 2008 and it is expected to be
completed in mid 2011. With regard to downsizing, the authorities have selected three ministries
to pilot the reforms – the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Civil Service and the Ministry of
Public Administration Reform. The project also has financed the bio-metric census of the civil
service, functional reviews of departments, and activities aimed at easing the reintegration of
retrenched workers in the private sector.

4.6    Engagement from donors is only slowly evolving towards a more harmonized
approach. The NPRSP has not been a key point of reference for government actions and
coordination of donors’ support. Guinea-Bissau still benefits from financial support from a range
of aid agencies with different, often uncoordinated instruments, given the complex political
environment and uneven macroeconomic performance. In 2009, seven budget support providers
including the AfDB, EU, France, IDA, IMF, Portugal and Spain established the Joint Framework
for Budget Support Coordination (Quadro Conjunto de Concertação para Apoio Orçamentário,
CCAB). The objectives of this mechanism are modest as it aims at enhancing exchange
information and coordination. The nature of this mechanism is primarily consultative and does
not create obligations to its members. An enhanced harmonization of donor support and a more
predictable flow of resources remain necessary conditions for a better implementation of the
NPRSP, notwithstanding an enhanced coordination role by the Ministry of Economy, Planning
and Regional Integration that, since mid-2009, has yielded some results.

4.7     The NPRSP has been supported through investment and budget support. In addition
to the EU, project specific and budget support has been provided by UN organizations, regi onal
economic organizations (WAEMU, the BCEAO), development banks (African Development
Bank, West African Development Bank) and bilateral donors, including Portugal, Brazil and
Spain. A framework agreement among donors, the Bank and IMF providing budget support has
been set up in 2009 to ensure better coordination and information sharing. The recently
completed PEMFAR, a joint undertaking with the African Development Bank and the EU office
in Bissau, has also provided an important opportunity for enhancing collaboration with other
donors aligning donor technical assistance on the country’s key PFM and public administration
reform priorities.

4.8     The proposed EGRG III grant builds on the previous EGRG I and II and
complements other Bank capacity building and investment operations. The PSD plank of
the proposed operation builds in its entirety on a multi-year program of analytical, policy and
technical assistance supported under the IDA Private Sector Rehabilitation and Development
Project (PSRDP); this project has been instrumental in advancing far-reaching legal and policy
reforms including the preparation of business laws consistent with the OHADA Acts, the
Investment Code and the proposed Law on PPP, privatization, and initiatives to improve the
business climate based on project-supported analytical work (including a 2007 update of a 2001
FIAS ―road map‖ study of administrative procedures for opening a business). The PFM policy
plank of the proposed operation complements capacity building activities funded under a past
US$1.2 million LICUS grant which closed in December 2008 and an ongoing US$1.7 million
SPF grant approved in December 2008. The operation also complements, in its development
objectives, a multi-sector infrastructure project, funding the restoration of a minimum of critical
investment requirements in transport and energy infrastructure. The proposed D PO focuses on
reforms that would leverage actions supported through technical and financial assistance
provided by these other instruments.

4.9     While the proposed operation does not provide direct support to the government
efforts in lessening infrastructure bottlenecks, it complements other Bank investment
lending operations supporting infrastructure sectors. In particular, improvements in
government budget predictability, expenditure management and procurement systems would
favor, in the medium term, a better execution of government infrastructure investment and
maintenance. In addition, it is expected that a more effective control of the payroll would
generate savings that could free up space to finance government infrastructure and social sector
investments. In this regard, the recent approval of the Emergency Electricity and Water
Rehabilitation Project (EEWRP) and its additional finance could be benefitted from the enhanced
predictability of government resources. The selection of the PSD plank actions, focused on
administrative and legal procedures and regulatory frameworks to foster private sector activities,


                                                18
has taken into account the fact that the Bank is already preparing an additional financing
proposal under the Multi-Sector Rehabilitation Project (P097975) aimed at addressing the crucial
electricity generation shortfall.

4.10 A number of analytical studies provide the basis for the design of the proposed
operation. They include core diagnostic assessments by the World Bank in collaboration with
the government and other donors as well as various studies conducted by the government with
donor support. The studies include: (i) a Public Expenditure Management and Financial
Accountability review (PEMFAR) completed in 2010, and drawing on an early 2009 EU -
supported Public Expenditure Financial Accountability (PEFA) Diagnostic Assessment which
provides an updated diagnostic analysis of the current strengths and weaknesses in the country’s
public financial management system and practices, including public procurement and a
considerable range of inputs for the design and preparation of the next phase of the PFM and
public procurement reform strategy; (ii) various FIAS studies and project documents and aide-
memoire of the IDA-financed private sector PSRD Project, which have provided analytical
background and specific recommendations on business environment reforms, the investment
code and other PSD reforms; (iii) a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) that also
highlighted red tape and related petty corruption as a barrier to private activity and investment.
In addition and (v) a recent Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) that provides the analytical
underpinnings for a stepped-up program that would be supported by the Bank, called as High
Impact Program (HIP), designed to achieve transformative change in key sectors of the economy
and a related institutional agenda focused on PFM and PSD reforms.

                                          D.       L ESSONS L EARNED

4.11 The design of the proposed operation has benefited from a number of lessons drawn
from the recent JSAN and HIPC Completion Point Document and the implementation of a
LICUS grant on PFM reforms, the PSRD project, the Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery
Credit, a quick disbursing credit of US$25 million that supported the implementation of Guinea-
Bissau’s National Reconciliation and Reconstruction Program and the EGRG I and II. Key
lessons are highlighted below:

   Focus and realism. There is a need for a realistic program design to avoid overloading the
    very limited institutional and implementation capacity of Guinea-Bissau. Thus, selectivity in
    objectives that are mutually enhancing and realism in targeted outcomes are important to
    keep the program focused on fundamentals of the reform agenda; 8
   Implementation. Fragile states may require more detailed implementation programs than
    usually seen in other development policy operations, particularly during periods of political
    transition. Detailed action planning and monitoring may be needed to help the government
    and program partners track progress, address bottlenecks and adjust to delays in program
    implementation.
   Follow up on government reforms and complementarities with other projects. Experience
    with the EGRG I and II indicates that after government or legislative adoption of laws and
    regulations, additional assistance is required to guarantee a full implementation of
    government policy reforms. On the positive side, the implementation of the PFM reforms has

    been successful due to the support provided by the SPF Economic Governance Support
    Grant. Similar conclusions can be found in regard to the state and civil service reforms where
    the EU PARAP project has provided resources to the implementation of reforms in this area.
    On the negative side, only limited support has been provided on private sector development
    plank since 2009 (when the PSRDP closed); and
   Technical Assistance. Related to the previous point, financing for policy reforms should not
    rely on the policy support alone to catalyze and implement reforms. Technical assistance and
    capacity building resources should accompany policy operations in order to ensure: (i) the
    strengthening of capacity of domestic counterparts; and (ii) support to specific reforms via
    specialized analytical work or reform-specific capacity building. Achieving the results
    targeted by the EGRG requires strengthening counterpart capacity, and IDA will remain
    closely involved in capacity building through technical advice.


                             5. THE PROPOSED OPERATION

                                   A. O PERATION D ESCRIPTION

5.1     The proposed operation, in the amount of SDR 4 million (US$6.4 million equivalent)
is a single-tranche development policy operation. The proposed EGRG III is designed to
sustain momentum in the implementation of the focused reform agenda supported by EGRG I
(approved in June 2009) and EGRG II (approved in June 2010). Accordingly, the operation
focuses on two of the four pillars of the NPRSP (i) strengthening governance, enhancing the
efficiency of public administration, and guaranteeing macroeconomic stability with focus on
public financial management (PFM) and state reorganization; and (ii) promoting economic
growth and job creation to foster more robust private sector development (PSD). The first of
these pillars—the agenda for governance, public administration, and macroeconomic stability—
aims at completing and consolidating the development and implementation of a modern legal
and organizational framework for PFM that is consistent with WAEMU standards, reorganizing
the government structure and strengthening human resource management. The second of these
pillars—promoting economic growth and job creation—focuses on improving the business
climate, adjusting previous regulatory reforms supported by the earlier EGRGs series, and
creating an environmental impact regulatory framework for investment.

5.2    The specific objectives of the reforms supported by the proposed grant are to: (i)
promote efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of public resources through
improved budget and public financial management; and (ii) improve specific aspects of the
investment climate, including streamlining procedures for business registration and licensing and
reforms of the existing legal framework for investment. The development objectives are
consistent with pillars 1 (good governance, macroeconomic stability, public administration
reform) and 2 (private sector-led growth) of the government’s national development program
outlined in its NPRSP.

5.3    The proposed EGRG III supports follow-up reform measures designed to
consolidate the improvements in PFM and PSD that have been obtained since 2008 and
that were supported by the first and second EGRGs. In addition, the proposed DPO will
support government actions in PFM, state reform, the rationalization of the government’s human



                                               20
resource management, and improved debt management, actions that are essential for the
successful implementation of fiscal adjustment.

5.4     Several principles underpin the design of the operation and the specific choice of policy
areas and measures that it supports:

      Drawing on Bank lessons for engagement in fragile states, the design of the policy
       program reflects first and foremost a high degree of selectivity, with a focus on a small
       number of measures that are technically ready, and feasible given the complex political
       context and the weak institutional capacity. In particular, the operation focuses on a
       select number of concrete reforms that (i) are backed by extensive analytical work; (ii)
       have been subject to repeated consultations with stakeholders; (iii) have benefitted from
       technical assistance; and/or (iv) are leveraging reforms supported by other Bank and
       donors instruments (such as the CFAA-CPAR and PEMFAR diagnostic reports, a SPF
       Economic Governance Support Grant, and the Private Sector Rehabilitation and
       Development Project).
      To avoid placing an excessive burden on the government’s limited capacity for policy
       formulation and implementation, while still ensuring that its overall program has no
       critical gaps, reforms supported by the operation are consistent and complementary with
       undertakings under the IMF Extended Credit Facility (ECF) program and with activities
       funded under the SPF Economic Governance Support Grant and the EU-supported Public
       Administration Reform Program (PARAP).

      The operation focuses on PFM, state organization and human resource management, and
       business law reforms that reflect the implementation of fundamental commitments
       towards regional integration that successive governments of Guinea-Bissau have made in
       the past decade. While the pace of implementation has been and may continue to be
       delayed by political instability their general direction has long been a matter of
       established policy and enjoys broad political support. PFM reforms follow this principle,
       as Guinea-Bissau has only recently started to implement its legal, economic and
       institutional commitments under WAEMU. Similarly, business law reforms rest on the
       country’s commitments under OHADA.

                                        B. POLICY A REAS

5.5      As described above, the proposed operation would support essential policy reforms
and institutional strengthening actions in two government NPRSP pillars: (i) strengthening
governance, enhancing efficiency in public administration, and securing macroeconomic
stability; and (ii) promoting economic growth and job creation. It encompasses five components
within these two pillars: public financial management, human resource management, debt
management, measures to improve the investment climate, and environmental regulations.

5.6      The results of the first and second EGRGs have been broadly satisfactory. The most
notable achievements of the EGRGs under the first pillar were the resumption of the process of
harmonizing public financial management with WAEMU rules through the approval of the new
institutional framework, the improvement in budgetary and financial management through the
introduction and development of a computerized system of Financial, Budget, and Accounting
Management (SIGFIP), the re-establishment of the single treasury account, the completion of the


                                               21
biometric census of the civil service staff, and the implementation of remedial measures to
eliminate the irregularities found by the census and the adoption of a institutional framework for
procurement. Major achievements under the second pillar included the approval of the new
investment code, the approval of a set of measures to streamline business regulations, the
establishment up of a ―one-stop shop‖ (guichet único) for business registration, and the approval
of the Law on Information and Communications Technology, which sets out a new regulatory
framework for the country’s telecommunications system.

macroeconomic stability

   a) Public Finance Management

5.7    Actions supported by the proposed EGRG III under the PFM component aim at
consolidating recent progress in: (i) extending the coverage of the SIGFIP to the accounting
management phase; and (ii) enhancing the transparency of the budget through more
comprehensive, timely and regular reporting.
5.8     The previous EGRG I and II supported the adoption of the legal framework for
PFM, which represented a very significant shift that has required sweeping change in the
organization of departments and administrative procedures, namely the Financial Control Office
(DAF), the Budget Office, and Treasury and Accounting (DGTCP). In addition, the EGRGs
supported the installation of the Integrated Public Financial Management System (SIGFIP). In
particular, the EGRG I and II supported the installation and functioning of the budget preparation
and execution modules.
5.9     Despite these encouraging measures to strengthen the country’s legal, institutional,
and administrative framework and to build its capacity for public financial management,
considerable progress remains to be made. The government’s recent efforts have been
directed at ensuring that all consolidated expenditures are processed through the computerized
financial management system and relate to specific approved budget appropriations. The lack of
computer equipment and applications for accounting management reduces auditing opportunities
for the departments receiving the appropriations, makes it impossible to obtain accounting
information quickly, results in the duplication of certain tasks, and makes it difficult to prepare
management accounts and the general account of the state, thereby preventing external and
independent auditing of compliance with budget authorization by the National People’s
Assembly.
5.10 This current situation facilitates various lapses, such as exceeding planned
appropriations for advances, extremely long timeframes for the preparation of statements of
accounts, the inability to track expenditures, the lack of frequent, prompt, and reliable reporting,
and the limited scope for conducting ex-post audits. Delays persist in the consolidation of
budgetary information, the production of comprehensive and regular in-year budget execution
reports and the preparation of financial statements.
5.11 Recognizing these limitations, in October 2010 the government completed the
implementation of SIGFIP, computerizing the accounting management process with a view of
ensuring adequate communication between the budget preparation and execution modules to
guarantee the accuracy of the reports. The installation and integration of the SIGFIP


                                                22
computerized accounting system is a prior action for the proposed EGRG III. As mentioned
above, this action complements the implementation of the SIGFIP budget preparation and
execution modules, which had been supported in the two preceding EGRGs (the 2009 budget
was presented using SIGFIP and the SIGFIP procedures manual) and completes the
computerization and integration of the budget cycle.
5.12 It is expected that future budgets will be prepared and presented using the SIGFIP
budget system, providing the following functionalities: it will ultimately integrate into a single
application (SIGFIP) all areas of public finance (budget execution and budget preparation,
treasury and accounting, etc.); it produces the budget documents required for dra fting budgetary
laws; it produces the various accounts (budget and accounting), expenditures and revenues for
both the state general budget and the Treasury’s special accounts; it reflects outstanding
payments to be made or outstanding sums to be collected; and it facilitates the preparation of all
end-of-fiscal year documents, linking the various agents handling expenditure and revenue
operations for both the state general budget and the Treasury’s special accounts.
5.13 Currently, the public has extremely limited access to budget information. There is
limited dissemination of the structure and execution of the state budget. However, with the
clarification of the budgetary and accounting framework, the computerization of the budget
system via SIGFIP and the creation of a website for the Ministry of Finance, the government is
undertaking important steps towards improving budget transparency. The 2010 Budget Law and
the budget laws for the three previous years are now available on the Ministry of Finance’s
website. In addition, the government has presented to Parliament and made available to the
general public the four quarterly budget execution reports for 2010 and the first quarter of 2011.
Furthermore, from the first time since independence the government’s general administrative
accounts for 2009 were submitted to the Court of Accounts in October 2010 (before the end of
the following year). The government also submitted the general administrative accounts for 2010
to the Court of Accounts in May, 2011. The submission to the Court of Accounts of the
government’s general accounts for 2009 and 2010 is the prior action for the proposed EGRG III.
5.14     The proposed prior actions under this component would include:
 (i)     The Recipient’s Minister of Finance has completed the computerization and integration of the
         Recipient’s budget cycle with the installation of the SIGFIP accounting module, as evidenced by
         a letter from the Recipient’s Minister of Finance dated May 4, 2011 ; and
(ii)     The Recipient’s Minister of Finance has submitted to the Recipient’s Court of Accounts the
         Recipient’s state general accounts for the Recipient’s Fiscal Years of 2009 and 2010, as
         evidenced by the Recipient’s Minister of Finance’s letters to the Recipient’s Court of Accounts,
         dated September 27, 2010 and April 21, 2011.

       b) Debt Management

5.15 Poor debt management has been another factor explaining the uncontrolled growth
of indebtedness experienced by the country in the past two decades. The lack of reliable debt
information, uncoordinated borrowing policies and the absence of debt strategies have
exacerbated the debt, contractual or not, generated by chronic fiscal disequilibria. Up to now
there has been no systematic electronic record of debt data. The Public Debt Office (PDO) staff
relies on billing from creditors to plan repayments in the short term. The software program for
debt management installed at the PDO is still not operational. Related to these problems, debt
reporting is irregular, and there is no official publication addressing debt issues.



                                                   23
5.16 In 2009, with the support of UNCTAD, the Integrated Debt Management System
(SIGADE) was installed. The operation of this system will guarantee reliable debt information
and will reduce risks related with the manual introduction of debt information into non -
integrated electronic spreadsheets. Debt information provided by creditors (e.g. billing
information and debt reports sent by creditors at their own initiative or upon request from MoF)
must be kept in electronic format –written documentation must be digitalized. Nevertheless, the
lack of technical capacity has thus far prevented the operation of the system.
5.17 Further efforts remain needed to strengthen capacity in debt management. In 2010, the
debt reconciliation exercises undertaken as part of the HIPC completion point process proved to
be difficult and made evident the precarious debt management system and the need for
improvements in this area. With the support of UNCTAD, UNDP and the Bank, the government
is taking important actions to strengthen the Public Debt Office (PDO). The EGRG III includes
as a prior action the adoption of the action plan for further reinforcing the PDO to improve debt
management, through the enhanced use of SIGADE. Among the key actions identified in the
action plan is the publication of SIGADE’s procedural manual, training activities, improvements
in the working conditions of the PDO and the full operation of the SIGADE system.
5.18    The prior action under this component would be:
(iii)   The Recipient’s Minister of Finance has adopted an action plan for the strengthening of its Public
        Debt Office, as evidenced by letter from the Recipient’s Minister of Finance, dated May 4, 2011 .

    c) Human Resource Management and State Reorganization

5.19 As mentioned above, the government has undertaken important steps toward
controlling personnel expenses and enhancing its human resource management. The
government’s strategy consists in two sequential sets of actions. The first is the improvement of
the currently unreliable information systems regulating staffing, individual remuneration and
overall payroll. More effective control over the management of government employees is
recognized as the most critical component for strengthening and improving PFM. The second set
of actions involves the strengthening of human resource management through the adoption of a
new civil service framework law and clear secondary regulations for recruitment, promotion,
deployment and dismissals, and HR functions such as workforce planning, career development
and training.

5.20 An additional factor related to the government’s human resource management is
the institutional structure of each ministry and agency. Currently, the haphazard organization
of government entities, the lack of clear definitions of their mandates and the services they
provide, the allocation of functions, overlapping task, roles and responsibilities all seriously
affect the effectiveness of the civil service. This is reflected in an excessive number of civil
servants, many with inadequate qualifications, the absence of proper management or oversight,
and the lack of clear and precise descriptions of professional duties.

5.21 In 2009 the government initiated a bold reform program for its human resource
management system. The completion of a biometric census of the civil service provided an
accurate count of public sector employees and identified a large number of ―double dippers‖
(officials holding multiple posts) and ―ghost workers‖ (individuals receiving unearned salaries).
The next step in this area was the installation of the human resource management IT system, the
Integrated System for the Human Resource Management of the Public Administration
(SIGRHAP) that will provide payroll processing security for active employees, pensioners and

                                                   24
survivors. In June 2010, the EGRG II supported the government’s decision to transfer to the
Minister of Public Administration (MoPA) the management of the payroll system and civil
service database to be included in the SIGRHAP and the selection of the IT platform for
SIGHRAP.

5.22 The authorities need to accelerate progress in this area. The government has faced
difficulties in transferring payroll system management to the MoPA, consolidating of the
database generated by the biometric census of civil servants and the database used by the MoF to
unify the payroll bill. In February 2011 the civil service’ payroll system was effectively
transferred from the Budget Department of the Ministry of Finance to the MoPA. Technical
difficulties in consolidating the databases and political resistance initially delayed the unification
of the payroll bill, but the technical problems have been overcome and the MoPA has been
processing the payroll bill since March 2011. The main challenge to the development of a fully
unified payroll is resistance by the Ministries of Defense and the Interior to integrate their staff
into the new payroll system. Therefore, the MoPA is currently processing a provisional payroll
system. Delays have been also experienced in the installation of the SIGRHAP. As a result, t he
integration of the unified payroll system and the database generated by the biometric census in
the SIGRHAP is expected to be completed by August 2011.

5.23 A further challenge to the development of the unified payroll is the large number of
temporary teachers currently employed by the Ministry of Education and the irregular
procedures for their recruitment. One of the major issues confronting the education sector is
the recruitment and management of teachers. A large number of teachers have been hired at the
regional level but have not been integrated into the formal civil service system. This practice has
led to the frequent generation of salary arrears in the sector and abuse of the payroll system by
regional directions of the Ministry of Education. Recognizing that the irregular recruitment of
teachers not only prevents the consolidation of the civil service database and unification of the
payroll, but also undermines the efforts in controlling the payroll bill, the government decided in
March to forbid the regional directors from any further recruiting or the singing of employment
contracts without Ministry authorization. The EGRG III includes as a prior action the enactment
of the Prime Minister resolution forbidding the recruitment of teachers by regional directors
without the prior authorization of such Ministry. More broadly, in response to the pressing need
to ensure appropriate mechanisms for good governance concerning the human resources of the
public administration the government, with the assistance of the EU-funded project PARAP, has
drafted a number of secondary regulations as executive acts of the civil service law for
recruitment, job re-classification, careers, disciplinary measures, conflicts of interests,
professional status, and the career tracks of senior civil service staff, all of which are expected to
be approved by the end of the year.

5.24 Greater progress has been made in the reorganization of the government structure.
In line with the objective of streamlining the public administration for viable, cost -effective,
client-oriented and transparent service delivery and management, the MoPA has initiated a
process of administrative rationalization and has submitted to the Council of Ministers the
Organic Law of the Government. The Organic Law of the Government is consolidating the
functions of the ministries according to thematic areas as a measure to increase efficiency and
contain public expenditures. The EGRG III supports the adoption by the Council of Ministers of
the Organic Law of the Government. A follow-up action in this area is the adoption of organic
laws for all the ministries and their staff charts, which is expected to be completed by the end of
the year.

                                                 25
5.25   The proposed prior actions under this component would include:

(iv)   The Recipient’s Prime Minister has issued a resolution (Despacho) dated May 3, 2011,
       regulating the recruitment and contracting of temporary teachers; and

(v)    The Recipient’s Council of Ministries has adopted the Government’s Organic Law (―Lei
       Orgânica do Governo‖), consolidating the functions of the Recipient’s ministries.

Pillar 2: Promoting economic growth and job creation

5.26 Despite recent reforms Guinea-Bissau scores very low on internationally recognized
measure of the ease of doing business. Based on the Doing Business report for 2011, Guinea-
Bissau is second from the bottom in the West Africa region and among the ten lowest (176th out
of 183 countries) in the world. At the broadest level, political instability and fiscal fragility have
undermined the rule of law. Coupled with the deep infrastructure deficits – energy, seaport
facilities and roads – and severe weaknesses in public administration capacity, private companies
face a very challenging environment in Guinea-Bissau.

5.27 At the micro-level, the legal and administrative environment for business remains
weak and unstable. Guinea-Bissau still needs to complete its transition from the legal and
institutional framework inherited from colonial times towards one that is both more adequate to
its current economic challenges and consistent with its regional commitments to integration.
Guinea-Bissau needs to promote investment, both domestic and international, and attract foreign
investors that will bring entrepreneurial skills and knowledge to domestic markets. Guinea-
Bissau is a small economy, with limited entrepreneurial capacities, a skeletal financial system,
and weak linkages with foreign markets. In this context it is especially important to be able to
attract foreign investors who possess these scarce skills and capitals.

5.28 Completing the legal transformation to a market-friendly regulatory environment is
expected to be a multi-year undertaking, going well beyond the timeframe of the proposed
operation. The transition to a modern and efficient legal and institutional regime will require not
only the adoption of the relevant legislation, but also the development of more regular,
predictable administrative and judicial structures and practices, as well as the routine and
widespread publication of information about legal reforms.

5.29 In addition to damage caused by protracted political instability and increasingly
dilapidated infrastructure, red tape remains another important impediment to private-
sector investment and growth. In a context of weak administrative capacity complex
regulations and opaque procedures, create opportunities for corruption, which in turn weakens
incentives to simplify the regulatory environment. The problems related to a poor investment
climate are not unique to Guinea-Bissau; however, these are particularly acute in an environment
where extremely limited institutional capacity enables poor governance and corruption as coping
mechanisms, which then reinforce the incentives to maintain the status quo.

5.30 This unnecessary administrative complexity and general lack of information
generate obstacles that are particularly adverse for international investors. A fundamental
obstacle for investors interested in exploring business opportunities is the near-total absence of
reliable information on investment and startup procedures. Compounding this lack of



                                                 26
information is the multiplicity of administrative processes and requirements based on ex-ante
control, a concept that generates onerous bureaucratic procedures.

5.31 The government views the improvement of the investment climate as a critical
prerequisite to boost economic growth and reduce poverty through private sector development.
Its private-sector growth agenda is reflected in the NPRSP and has been developed over several
years on the basis of diagnostic studies and consultations with stakeholders, benefitting from
technical support under the IDA-funded Private Sector Rehabilitation and Development Project.

5.32 Important progress has been achieved since 2008 with the adoption by the Council of
Ministers of draft laws based on the OHADA Acts, while a Commercial Tribunal has also been
established and judges been trained in commercial law procedures. The commitment of the
government to these reforms has been confirmed by the adoption by the Council of Minist ers in
March 2010 of a decree simplifying registration procedures and establishing a one-stop-shop for
business registration, called Center for Firm Registration (CFE) or Guichet-Unique. Finally, the
Telecom Law has been approved by Parliament and enacted by the president in May 2010,
formalizing the regulatory framework for telecommunications in support of a rapidly expanding
and employment-generating sector.

5.33 Substantial progress in developing a new legal and regulatory framework for
investment has been observed with the adoption of a new Investment Code in 2009.
Developed with the support of the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS), this Investment
Code was signed into law by the president on December 31, 2009. This code ensures that
investment incentives are automatic, removing the discretion that could be exercised by
government officials under the old law; there is no discrimination among projects on the basis of
size; the multiplicity of investment regimes is eliminated to remove confusion and reduce fraud
and evasion; and the opacity of rules regarding sanctions and the uncertainty with which they
were previously applied are ended. Fiscal risks related to tax incentives would also be mitigated
with the consolidation of incentives in an automatic and transparent system. Nonetheless,
administrative weaknesses and the lack of secondary regulatory framework have prevented the
implementation of the new investment code.

5.34 Since 2009, the EGRG I and II supported actions judged critical to advancing
reforms in private sector development, namely: (i) the adoption by the Council of Ministers of
nine OHADA acts on business law; (ii) the adoption by the Council of Ministers of the new
investment code; (iii) the adoption by the Council of Ministers, and more recently its
promulgation by the president, of the draft Law on Public-Private Partnerships, thus sending a
much-needed signal of the government’s commitment to fostering private sector-led growth; (iv)
the adoption by the Council of Ministers of a decree simplifying procedures for business
registration to promote formalization and provide a further indication of the government’s
commitment to simplifying administrative procedures for doing business; (v) the adoption by the
Council of Ministers of a decree establishing the formal constitution of a one-stop-shop for
business registration, reinforcing the ongoing legal reforms related to the investment climate; (vi)
and the enactment by the president of the Telecommunications Law.

5.35 The government’s reform efforts aimed at fostering the development of the private
sector have been maintained through early 2011. With the support of UNDP and the EU, the
CFE is expected to be inaugurated in mid May 2011. The government has also created a bulletin
to publish the registration of new businesses at the CFE that should contribute to increasing the


                                                27
transparency of business information. This improvement is aligned with the ongoing effort to
concentrate the procedures for starting a business at the CFE in order to simplify administrative
processes and reduce bureaucratic costs. The decree to simplify procedures to start a business,
issued in March 2010, already authorized the publication of new company registrations in
newspapers as permitted by Art. 257 of the OHADA Companies Law. That decree eliminated the
publication rights monopoly of the official gazette, but costs of publication in local ne wspapers
remain high (around CFAF 40,000) and are prohibitive for small companies. As a result, many
companies opt not to publish, undermining access to information about new companies. The
proposed action will authorize the one-stop shop to publish legal announcements in line with
OHADA and following the precedent of countries like Senegal and Burkina Faso. The notice of
publication can be done at the website of the one-stop shop at no cost. Due to limited
connectivity in Guinea-Bissau, the one-stop shop will also produce a printed version of the
bulletin. A minimum fee will be charged to cover the cost of printing the bulletin. The EGRG III
includes as prior action the Prime Minister resolution creating the bulletin for business
registration.

5.36 Solid progress has been also achieved in the simplification of license procedures.
Streamlining business licenses is necessary to meet the government’s goal of promoting
formalization, expanding the fiscal base and creating new job opportunities. Until now all new -
businesses required ex-ante authorization by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism.
Commerce, industry and tourism licenses are regulated by several decrees, some of which date
back to the colonial era (e.g. the Decree on Industrial Activities approved in 1950) and which are
clearly obsolete and no longer applied in practice. In addition, the licensing requirements
mandated in these decrees often do not meet a clear regulatory purpose, but rather serve as tools
to generate revenue. Good regulatory practices suggest using ex-ante authorizations, such as
licenses, only for those activities that pose a risk to public safety, health, the environment or
national security, or as means of safeguarding the public interest and regulating the access to
scarce resources (e.g. such as fossil fuels, forestry, etc.).

5.37 In this context the government has adopted a simplification decree that would apply
the principle that low risk activities do not require a license, which would be replaced by a
sworn declaration by the entrepreneur. The declaration would serve to notify the relevant
authorities, including the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Tourism, of the company’s
intention to undertake a certain activity. The compliance of the company with relevant laws
would be monitored through ex-post inspections. Another key principle in the simplification is
the non-duplication of information. One agency should not require entrepreneurs to provide
information that has already been sent to another. For example, information required for the
registration of companies at the Commercial Registry should not be part of the requirements to
request a license. The implementation of this principle will contribute to reducing costs for
entrepreneurs.

5.38 The decree would be one of the steps in a reform strategy to rationalize business
regulations and improve regulatory enforcement in Guinea-Bissau. In the medium term,
related reforms will include strengthening tax administration and expanding the tax base,
establishing a single classification system for business activities consistent with international
practice, modifying and updating regulations in key strategic sectors such as tourism, as well as
in sensitive areas such as food handling or the importation of medicines, and establishing bet ter
coordination and information-sharing between government agencies. The EGRG III includes as
a prior action the adoption of the decree simplifying the licensing of businesses.

                                               28
5.39 Implementation difficulties in reforming the legal and regulatory framework have
prevented the development of a level playing field for private investors. While the
Investment Code was promulgated at the end of 2009, the implementation process and the set of
reforms to transform and modernize the Investment Promotion Directorate of the Ministry of
Economy have not yet been initiated, leaving investors without a clear set of rules to follow. The
lack of capacity to manage a tax credit system, the lack of secondary regulation and the non-
exemption of customs rates and of the General Sales Tax (IGV) on imported capital goods
continue to impede new private capital investment in the country.

5.40 In this context, the government has decided to take advantage of the redefinition of
the implementing regulations for the investment code to make additional revisions. The
Council of Ministers created a special commission to review the investment code and propose
adjustments to it. With the support of the Bank, the special commission drafted a revised
investment code law that was adopted by the Council in May 2010.

5.41 The structure of the new draft code is similar to that of the current Investment Code
but several important changes were introduced. The revised Investment Code maintains the
principles of transparency, simplicity and non-discrimination enshrined in the 2009 Investment
Code and addresses three limitations that prevented its successful implementation. First, it
explicitly lists all possible fiscal incentives and duty concessions available for potential
investors. It eliminates the possibility of granting new incentives by other laws, which Art. 9.7 of
the 2009 investment code left open, which enhances transparency eliminates the possibility of
granting discriminatory fiscal benefits. Second, in line with other countries in the region it
reintroduces duty concessions and general sales tax exemptions for capital goods. Finally, given
Guinea-Bissau’s weak tax administration capacities the revised code introduces a set of
incentives that are easier to manage than the tax credit mechanism in the 2009 Investment Code.
Specifically, it introduces a gradually declining scale of deductions in the corporate income tax
(Industrial Contribution) for the first five years of the investment which are aligned with the draft
of the WAEMU investment code that is expected to be adopted by 2012. Furthermore, the
revised code re-introduces an incentive to encourage training and skill formation, a particularly
important issue for improving firm productivity.9 On the negative side, the new code restores the
role of the Investment Promotion Directorate of the Ministry of Economy in the process of
approval for projects, which is granted with the power to allocate tax incentives, but the new
Code also limits the Investment Promotion Directorate’s discretion and preserves the non
discrimination rules for investments by size, sector and region. In addition, the Investment
Promotion Directorate must decide in favor or against granting the incentives within 30 days
from the date the request is received. The decision must depend exclusively on verification
whether the requirements of the Code are satisfied. Economic unfeasibility of the proposal
cannot be alleged to refuse the request. Finally, the revised investment code also defines more
clearly the role of the Ministries of Economy and Finance in the administration of tax incentives.
The EGRG III supports the adoption of the revised investment code described above by the
Council of Ministers.

5.42 Finally, the government has made strong progress in improving environmental
regulations. In the second part of 2010 the government adopted the Law on the Environment

9
  This point is particularly important as the recent investment climate report found that Guinea -Bissau companies are
the ones that invest the least and less often in training – which obviously have important implications for
productivity


                                                         29
 (Lei Base de Ambiente), the Law on Protected Areas (Lei Quadro das Areas Protegidas) and the
 Law on Environmental Impacts (Lei de Avaliação Ambiental). In September 2010, the Council
 of Ministers adopted the Law on the Environment. This law provides the procedural framework
 for the concession of environmental licenses and establishes the requirements for private and
 public projects that use natural resources or activities that generate environmental externalities to
 submit an assessment of environmental impacts, mitigation measures and compensation
 mechanisms (if applicable). In addition, the law set out the criteria for projects that require
 environmental assessment as well as defining the role of the Center of Evaluation of
 Environmental Impacts (CAIA) in the approval of the terms of reference of the environmental
 studies and the final reports. Finally, the law establishes the fees to be collected by CAIA. The
 EGRG III includes as prior action the adoption by the National Assembly of the Law on
 Environmental Impacts for private and public investment projects.

 5.43    The proposed EGRG III would support the continuation of this agenda through:
 (vi)    The Recipient’s Prime Minster has issued a resolution authorizing the creation of a
         bulletin to be published by the Center of Business Registration (Centro de Formalizaçao
         de Empresas, CFE), to publish the notifications of new companies registration at
         minimum cost;
(vii)    The Recipient’s Council of Ministers has adopted a law decree streamlining business licensing by
         eliminating redundant and unnecessary licenses, simplifying requirements and reducing costs ;
(viii)   The Recipient’s Council of Ministers has approved ad referendum and submitted to the
         Recipient’s National Assembly a bill on the Recipient’s revised investment code, covering the
         key non-discrimination principles and promoting transparency and simplicity in its
         implementation, in accordance to WAEMU best practices; and
 (ix)    The Recipient’s National Assembly has adopted a law establishing the Recipient’s environmental
         impact assessment procedures.

                                      D. MONITORING FRAMEWORK

5.44 The government’s program matrix in Annex 3 contains baseline (2010) and target
values (expected to be reached in 2012) for performance monitoring indicators for the
EGRG III supported prior actions. There are 5 indicators on public financial management,
and 3 on private sector development, for a total of 8 indicators. The indicators on public financial
management consist mainly of measures of improved performance in budget execution,
reduction of arrears and reporting. In particular, the program will monitor progress in compliance
with defined calendars for budget formulation, approval, and reporting and the stock of arrears.
Improvements in budget execution that have been supported by the previous EGRGs and the
proposed EGRG III should reduce the probability of contingent liabilities and progressively
reduce the stock of arrears. In turn, the installation of the accounting module that will complete
the SIGFIP should enhance the reporting of fiscal accounts that now can be timely published.
The action plan to enhance the debt management office should pave the fully operation of the
SIGADE and guarantee a more effective debt management. Finally, the actions supported by the
EGRGs on the area of human resource management should allow a better control of personnel
expenditures with the unification of the payroll system and the elimination of irregular contracts
in the Education sector.

                        Box 5.1 : Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
The reform agenda underpinning the proposed operation is rooted in both the fundamental commitments of
successive governments towards regional integration (under the West African Economic and Monetary Union
and the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Laws in Africa) and on the country’s own PRSP which
was prepared through a highly participatory and consultative process. For the latter, stakeholder consultative
workshops and focus group discussions were held with representatives of the public and private sectors and
civil society, down to the level of local communities. The government is completing its second PRSP at the end
of May, 2011. A series of public consultations with major stakeholders and regions have been already
scheduled to discuss it previous to its adoption by the Council of Ministries.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework
There are only a limited number of financial partners involved in providing budget support, facilitating joint
understanding of areas of common and special interest (see paras. 5.3-5.5). A framework agreement among
donors providing budget support has been set up to ensure better coordination and information sharing. The
recently completed PEMFAR will also provide an important opportunity for enhancing collaboration with other
donors aligning donor technical assistance on the country’s key PFM reform priorities.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
The policy matrix was developed in close coordination with the government, thus ensuring that it reflects the
government’s expressed policy intentions and the country circumstances – including weak capacity for policy
formulation and implementation. The design of policy reforms has been backed by analytical work and
technical assistance in place. Most of the reforms are longstanding and ongoing government initiatives which
were prioritized in the PRSP. Donor coordination on the budget support has reduced transaction costs and the
expected timing of the IDA disbursement is aligned with the government’s domestic budgeting process.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
Prior actions for the proposed grant focus on a selected number of measures that are critical to achieving the
objectives of the government’s reform program as detailed in this Section.




                                                     32
Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to pred ictable and performance-based
financial support
The existing institutional structure for the PRSP process will be used to implement and monitor the policy
reforms supported by the proposed development policy operation. The limited number of active development
partners providing budget support allows for easy coordination and monitoring of actions and progress reviews
of the implementation of the policy matrix. After the disbursement of its single tranche, IDA plans to continue
working with the government and other participating development partners to monitor implementation and help
determine whether adjustments to the policy matrix need to be made to take into account the latest country
developments, stakeholder support and alternative options for realizing the intended development goals. The
disbursement of the proposed IDA grant is targeted towards mid CY11, in line with the domestic budgeting
process which is based on the calendar year. The disbursed funds are expecte d to be used in filling the CY11
budget financing gap provoked by the interruption of the budget support by the European Union.


5.45 The indicators on private sector development are measures of the depth of
administrative barriers to private investment, including the number of days, procedures and
costs to start a business and obtain business licenses, which would be easily monitored through
reviews of government procedures and surveys of business climate (as the Doing Business),. In
particular, the publication of new companies’ registration by the CFE is expected to reduce the
registrations costs calculated by the DB while the simplification of business licenses should be
reflected in the improvement of the dealing with construction permits indicators. Finally, the
number of environmental impact studies assessed by CAI will measure the effect of the
environmental regulations supported by the proposed EGRG III.


                              6. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                                    A. POVERTY AND S OCIAL IMPACTS

6.1    Quantitative measurement of the poverty impact of government interventions is
currently limited by the government’s weak statistical capacity, which prevents effective
monitoring and evaluation of government policies. Consequently, any assessment of trends in
poverty remains sharply limited by the lack of data. Since the first poverty assessment survey
(Inquêrito Ligeiro de Avaliação da Pobreza, ILAP I) in 2002, no new income or expenditure
data on poverty has been produced. The government’s Statistical Institute undertook a new
poverty survey (ILAP II) in July 2010, the results of which were issued as a draft by the end of
2010, and the final version of which should be published in the first half of 2011. The Bank will
support a priority statistical program focused on the country’s most urgent data needs, namely
economic data, poverty statistics and social indicators—including a household survey program—
designed to strengthen the country’s statistical development, with funding likely provided by the
Bank’s Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building (TFSCB). This program would allow for the
monitoring of poverty and other socioeconomic indicators as well as quantitative measurement
of government policies and reforms supported by the Bank.

6.2     From a funding perspective, the proposed operation is expected to have positive
direct impacts on poverty and social indicators. Given the shortfall in budget support flows,
the proposed operation would obviate the need for spending cuts that could place the provision
of basic social services at risk, and such cuts would disproportionately affect the poor, who
frequently depend on these services to a disproportionate degree. The measures supported by the
proposed EGRG II are also expected to have a positive indirect impact on poverty reduction,


                                                     33
mainly through increased overall growth and rising employment, though these growth effects
may be strongly tempered by the evolving sovereign debt problems in the Euro zone.

6.3      From a policy perspective, the indirect poverty and social impact of the reforms
supported by the operation are also expected to be positive. To the extent that these
initiatives will favor the broadening of the fiscal space for increasing public investment, as well
as enhancing efficiency in the use of public resources, the operation should have a positive
indirect impact on the government’s ability to increase the quality and accessibility of public
infrastructure and social services. The support to the human resource management in the
education sector has not only a fiscal effect (reduction of arrears to teachers) but al so an effect on
the own organization of the education sector. Incidence analysis shows that low-income groups
have lower rates of access to educational, health, energy, water and sanitation services, yet low -
income groups are the primary users of these services. Improvements in the coverage and quality
of public services would therefore disproportionately benefit the poor.

6.4     In the medium term, reducing poverty and improving income distribution
consistently will require raising the country’s economic performance and expanding the
coverage and quality of education and health services. To the extent that the policy reforms
supported by the proposed operation will enable Guinea-Bissau to resume fiscal sustainability
and improve its growth prospects, this operation is expected to have a positive impact on
poverty. The government’s ability to expand access to quality social and economic infrastructure,
along with more direct effects on growth and poverty reduction, will depend on its maintenance
of strong fiscal and macroeconomic fundamentals.

                                    B. ENVIRONMENTAL A SPECTS

6.5     The specific actions supported under the proposed EGRG III are likely to have
positive effects on the country's environment, forests, fisheries or other natural resources .
The first plank of this operation, governance, is not expected to have a meaningful effect on
Guinea-Bissau’s environment due to the primarily administrative nature of the reform program,
(public financial management, civil service reform and decentralization, monitoring and
evaluation systems, improved health care and social protection). The reforms under the second
plank, private sector development, expected to have positive effects on the environment. In
particular, the Law on Environmental Impact Evaluation in public and private inv estment
projects is a fundamental step in strengthening the country environmental regulations.
Furthermore, the recent adoption of the laws on environment (Lei de Base do Ambiente) and on
protected areas (Lei Quadro das Areas Protegidas) represent important improvements and their
implementation should guarantee a more effective government environmental protection.

                       C. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND E VALUATION

6.6    Since the preparation of the EGRG I, the IDA team has worked in close
collaboration with the government and its budget support partners to ensure adequate
monitoring and evaluation of the program as well as a high level of accountability for the
success of each of the previous DPOs. The government and the Budget Support Group have
agreed on a matrix of indicators that is reviewed biannually to assess progress in the different
policy areas.




                                                  34
6.7     The existing institutional structure for the NPRSP process will be used to implement
and monitor the policy reforms supported by the proposed development policy operation .
The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy will assume overall responsibility for
coordinating the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the policy matrix. They will be
ultimately responsible for reporting progress and coordinating actions among other concerned
Ministries and agencies. The Council of Ministers will provide overall guidance for the budget
support program. Periodic stakeholder consultations included in the implementation of the ISN
will serve to provide additional feedback on the impact of the proposed operation.

6.8     The limited number of cooperating partners currently providing budget support
will allow for easy coordination and monitoring of actions and for regular progress reviews
of the implementation of the policy matrix. After the disbursement of its single tranche, IDA
plans to continue working with the government and other cooperating partners to monitor
implementation and help determine whether adjustments to the policy matrix need to be made in
order to take into account the latest political and economic developments, stakeholder
perspectives, and alternative options for realizing the intended development goals.

                                     D. FIDUCIARY A SPECTS

6.9     While some important progress has been achieved in public financial management
over the last two years, and some key reforms are close to be implemented, the internal
control environment in Guinea-Bissau remains weak. Improving fiduciary standards is a
central objective of the public financial management component of the proposed operat ion. The
2006 CFAA and 2008 PEFA were key inputs in the preparation of the government’s PFM reform
program. Implementation of key reforms is closely monitored and included in the ongoing
dialogue between the government, the IMF, the Bank and other donors, with further technical
assistance provided by the cooperating partners. Lessons drawn from past diagnostics and
ongoing implementation experience are provided in the form of recommendations, and will be
incorporated in a revised multi-year reform agenda that the government is disseminating as part
of the recently completed PEMFAR in 2009.

6.10 The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is the common central bank of
francophone West African countries, including Guinea Bissau. The updated safeguards
assessment of BCEAO issued by the IMF in March 2010 revealed that the institution continues
to have controls in place at operational level. However, the IMF noted that the overall
governance framework should nonetheless be strengthened by the addition of an audit committee
to ensure that the Board of Directors exercises appropriate oversight over the control structure,
including the audit mechanism and financial statement. The upcoming implementation of the
institutional reform of the West African Monetary Union (WAMU) and the BCEAO should help
correct that situation. In addition, efforts to fully implement International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) should be pursued as adopted internationally by other central banks.

                                E. D ISBURSEMENT AND A UDITING

6.11 The proposed operation would consist of a single tranche grant of SDR 4 million
(US$6.4 million equivalent) to be available upon effectiveness and disbursed on the basis of
a withdrawal application. The grant will follow the Bank’s disbursement procedures for
development policy lending. Once the grant becomes effective, the Government of Guinea-
Bissau (Recipient) will submit a withdrawal application to IDA requesting that the grant


                                               35
proceeds be deposited in the BCEAO into a dedicated account that forms part of the country’s
official foreign exchange reserves. The Recipient shall ensure that upon the deposit of the grant
into said account an equivalent amount in CFAF is credited in the Recipient’s budget
management system in a manner acceptable to IDA. The Recipient will report to the World
Bank the amounts deposited in the foreign currency dedicated account and credited to the budget
management system. Disbursement would not be linked to specific purchases. If the grant
proceeds are used for the ineligible purposes, as defined in the Financing Agreement, IDA will
require the Recipient to refund an amount equal to the amount of said payment to IDA promptly
upon notice from IDA. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon request shall be cancelled.

6.12 Through the Ministry of Finance, the Recipient will: (i) report, within one week from
the date of receipt, the exact sum received into the dedicated account; (ii) ensure that all
withdrawals from the dedicated account are for budgeted public expenditures, excepting military
expenditures or other items on IDA’s proscribed list; and (iii) provide IDA with evidence that the
CFAF equivalent of the Credit proceeds were credited to the Consolidated Fund account and that
disbursements from that account were for budgeted public expenditures. Although an audit of the
deposit account will not be required, IDA reserves the right to require audits at any time.

                                   F. R ISKS AND R ISK MITIGATION

6.13 The proposed operation presents significant risks, but as in the recent past, an
active engagement in Guinea-Bissau is a high-risk and potentially high-gain enterprise. The
specific risks that could jeopardize the expected outcomes and benefits of the proposed grant
relate to political instability, macroeconomic policy performance, support from donors, and
capacity constraints. The greatest countervailing risk, however, remains the potential failure to
support the stabilization and recovery process, missing a window of opportunity for helping to
stabilize a fragile country in a challenging transition.

6.14    The following risks and risk mitigation strategies have been identified:

       (a) Shortfalls in budget support flows. Due in part to concerns over recent political
           developments, a significant overall shortfall in budget support and financial assistance
           of about CFAF 20 billion or 4 percent of GDP was observed in 2010. The shortfall
           prompted a dramatic adjustment in government investments and goods and service
           purchases. Further shortfalls would put the provision of key social services at risk and
           potentially cause the accumulation of arrears in the wage bill, which could interrupt the
           progress observed in the areas over the last two years. In 2011, the fiscal program
           supported by the IMF’s ECF anticipates a modest recovery in budget support flows of
           about CFAF 4 billion compared to 2010 levels and a residual financing gap of 1.5
           percent of GDP, which is expected to be filled by the first round of ECF disbursement
           in early 2011.
       (b) Other External shocks. The economy, being poorly diversified, is susceptible to
           external shocks. In particular, recent increases in food prices could have serious
           impacts on domestic inflation, government accounts and external balances. The scope
           for fiscal mitigation of external shocks from internal resources alone is sharply limited,
           and would require donor support. In addition, despite the significant improvement in
           the debt profile produced by Guinea-Bissau’s achievement of the HIPC completion
           point, the risk of external debt distress is still considerable and shocks to exports or


                                                 36
   GDP could make debt to breach threshold levels. The grant supports reforms in public
   financial management, debt management and related areas, that would help strengthen
   the country’s ability to attract external support to help cope with shocks.

(c) Political risks. Heightened political instability remains a persistent risk, particularly if
    tangible benefits from the reform program do not become apparent to the population, or
    if the costs of reform to influential constituencies become too high. To mitigate these
    risks continued support from the international community to the economic reform
    agenda will remain critical. The specific reforms supported by the proposed operation
    have been carefully selected from the government’s own NPRSP; they include
    measures that are technically ready (benefitting from extensive analytical work and
    supported by technical assistance) and politically achievable (produced through
    numerous consultations with stakeholders and internal governmental discussions).
    Most of these measures build on the government’s longstanding commitment towards
    regional integration in the context of WAEMU and OHADA, which mitigates the risk
    of reversibility.
(d) Implementation capacity. Guinea-Bissau’s technical and institutional capacity to
    implement the reforms supported by the EGRG III is low. To address this risk in the
    short term the Bank and other partners have made available a combination of capacity
    building and technical support. Coordination with other development partners,
    especially UNDP and the AfDB, on the provision of technical assistance will further
    alleviate implementation risks.

IMF Executive Board Completes First Review Under Extended Credit
Facility for Guinea-Bissau and Approves US$3.71 Million Disbursement
Press Release No. 10/492
December 14, 2010
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the first review of
Guinea-Bissau’s economic performance under its program supported by the Extended Credit
Facility (ECF) arrangement. Completion of the review, on December 13, 2010, enables the
immediate disbursement of SDR 2.414 million (about US$3.71 million), bringing total
disbursements under the arrangement to SDR 10.295 million (about US$15.83 million).
The Executive Board approved a three-year, SDR 22.365 million (about US$33.4 million) ECF
arrangement for Guinea-Bissau on May 7, 2010 (see Press Release No. 10/185). Guinea-Bissau
became a member of the IMF on March 24, 1977 and has a Fund quota of SDR 14.2 million.
The Executive Board also agreed, in principle, that Guinea-Bissau has taken the steps necessary
to reach its completion point under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative. This decision on the HIPC completion point is contingent upon the Executive Board of
the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA) reaching a similar decision at a
meeting scheduled for December 16, 2010, after which a joint press release will be issued.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion of Guinea-Bissau, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, said:
“The authorities’ commitment to sound policies has been crucial in maintaining macroeconomic
stability in Guinea-Bissau amid challenging political and financial circumstances. Performance
under the ECF-supported program has been satisfactory and substantial progress with structural
reforms has been achieved. Benefitting from a rebound in the price of cashew, g rowth is
expected to accelerate slightly in 2010, while inflation is projected to be within the West African
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) target.
“The government had to adjust its 2010 fiscal plans to make up for a shortfall in budget support.
The 2011 fiscal framework is realistic and consistent with available financing. The budget
contains strong revenue increasing and spending control measures. Continued discipline on
budget execution will be critical to achieving the authorities’ fiscal objective s.
“Fiscal reforms in 2011 will aim at mobilizing more revenues and strengthening public financial
management, including debt management. These reforms should help create more fiscal space
for priority spending to support economic growth and poverty reduct ion. To make decisive
progress toward the Millennium Developments Goals, further concerted efforts will be needed to
secure sufficient concessional financing in the coming years, including budget support from
development partners.
“Guinea-Bissau has qualified for debt relief, including topping up assistance, but its debt ratios
remain high, and the authorities are committed to meeting their external financing needs
through grants and highly concessional loans. Going forward, the authorities intend to build on
their recent efforts to normalize relations with all external creditors and to maintain their
commitment to the successful implementation of economic reforms.”

IMF Executive Board Completes Second Review Under the ECF Arrangement with Guinea-Bissau
and Approves US$3.85 Million Disbursement

Press Release No. 11/193
May 24, 2011

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the second review
of Guinea-Bissau’s economic performance under a three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
arrangement.1 The Board's decision, which was taken on a lapse-of-time basis,2 enables the
authorities to draw an additional SDR 2.414 million (about US$3.85 million), bringing total
disbursements under the arrangement to an amount equivalent to SDR 12.709 million (about
US$20.27 million).

Satisfactory policy implementation continues in the Fund-supported program under challenging
conditions. The authorities have met all performance criteria through end-December 2010 and all
structural reforms for the second review.

Sound macroeconomic policies, strengthened institutions, and debt relief have stabilized the
economy and supported confidence building. While medium-term growth prospects are bright,
huge developmental challenges remain. It is critical that the government maintain the reform
momentum and continue to build on the satisfactory performance under the ECF.

The three-year ECF arrangement for Guinea-Bissau was approved on May 7, 2010 (see Press
Release No. 10/185) in an amount equivalent to SDR 22.365 million (about US$33.3 million, or
157.5 percent of the country’s quota in the Fund). On December 16, 2010 the Executive Boards of
the IMF and the World Bank’s International Development Association decided to support US$1.2
billion in debt relief for Guinea-Bissau under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Enhanced
Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI—see Press Release No. 10/498).

 The Extended Credit Facility (ECF) has replaced the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
as the Fund’s main tool for medium-term financial support to low-income countries by providing a
higher level of access to financing, more concessional terms, enhanced flexibility in program
design features, and more focused streamlined conditionality. Financing under the ECF carries a
zero interest rate, with a grace period of 5½ years, and a final maturity of 10 years
(http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/ecf.htm). The Fund reviews the level of interest rates
for all concessional facilities every two years.

 The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse-of-time procedure when it is agreed by the
Board that a proposal can be considered without convening formal discussions.
