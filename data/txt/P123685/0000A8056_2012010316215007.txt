                         public and private investment projects.

                         Implementation Status Overview
Public Disclosure Copy




                         Implementation has been broadly satisfactory. Actions under the public finance management component have been completed as reflected in the formal adoption of a number of
                         legal regulations as well as the fully operation of the government's financial management system. progress on the unification of the payroll have been substantial, but the military staff
                         at the Ministry of defense is not in the unified payroll. On the private sector development block, the promulgation of the investment code by the President of the Republic and the
                         adoption decrees simplifying business licensing will need follow-up actions for its actual implementation.
