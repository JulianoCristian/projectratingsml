Several lessons\n            drawn from the project suggest: a) continuity, and top\n            quality of key personnel from both the Bank, and Borrower\n            are important factors, that ensured a successful project; b)\n            appropriate monitoring indicators are important to assess\n            project achievements: while these were provided in the staff\n            appraisal report, it is important that all base line data be\n            determined at appraisal, and agreed early on, otherwise the\n            project agencies may experience difficulty in properly\n            applying the indicators to monitor project outcome and\n            outputs; c) the high operational costs associated with\n            secondary wastewater treatment (as at Songjiang), and sludge\n            disposal, compared with preliminary or primary treatment,\n            are not always appreciated by government, and implementing\n            agencies; rather, for long-term sustainability of secondary\n            wastewater facilities, it is important that wastewater\n            tariffs adequately provide sufficient revenue to meet these\n            operational costs, and ensure sustainable operations. Costs\n            may also be reduced with further technical refinements, in\n            particular regarding energy efficiency; d) for political and\n            social reasons, governments are often reluctant to sanction\n            large increases in water and wastewater user charges,\n            preferring to raise charges by small increments. Executing\n            agencies remained in substantial non-compliance with\n            financial targets throughout the project, which highlights\n            the need for a different approach, such as the establishment\n            of a more independent regulatory authority with power to\n            review and approve tariffs. Further lessons recommend strong\n            institutional strengthening through technical assistance;\n            building arrangements for public-private partnerships;\n            identification, and monitoring of appropriate procurement\n            procedures; and, adequate project coordination, and skills\n            training provision."}, "docdt": "2003-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
