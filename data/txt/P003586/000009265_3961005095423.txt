MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRRCTORS
0 A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A SHANGHAI ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommen-
dation on a proposed loan to the People's Republic of China for the equivalent
of $160 million to help fianmce the Shanghai Environment Project. The loan
would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of
20 years, including 5 years of grace. The proceeds of the loan would be
onlent to the Shanghai Municipality (SM) for 15 years, including 5 years of
grace, at a rate equivalent to 90.63 percent of the rate payable to the Bank
by the Borrower with a commitment charge at the Bank's standard rate on the
outstanding balance. SN would bear the foreign exchange risk. SM would
onlend part of the proceeds to the implementing public utilities for 15 years
including 5 years of grace at the Bank's standard variable Interest rate, and
a cammitment charge at the Bank's standard rate, with the utilities bearing
the foreign exchange risk.
2.        IMkgrgUag. Shanghai is China's largest and most Industrialized
municipality, with an urban population of some 9 million and, including the
adjacent counties, a total population of about 14 million. The past emphasis
an limiting growth in urban areas has constrained the provision of essential
urban services, which are now inadequate for a city of such economic impor-
tace and size. Waterways In the environs of the city are heavily polluted,
the solid vaste disposal facilities are overburdened, and the nightsoil system
that serves some 4 million people daily is seriously at risk due to a lack of
disposal facilities. These problems directly affect the raw water supply for
Shanghait most of which is drawn from an intake in the city center on the
lower reaches of the Huangpu River. Inadequately treated discharges to the
Huangpu of industrial, ahip, and domestic wastes have resulted in water qual-
ity that fails to meet World Health OrgSaniation and Chinese standards, and is
deteriorating. Water passing into supply frequently contains toxic chemicals,
including known carcinogens, at levels causing taste, odor and health prob-
lems.
3.        These environmental hazards threaten the sustainabi34ty of the
accelerated and outward-oriented development supported by the bbsnghai Munici-
pal Government (SMG). Furthermore, an inadequate environmental service infra-
structure places Shanphai at a competitive disadvantage at a time when it is
trying to reestablish itself as the premier financial and commercial center on
the Chinese eastern seaboard. Accordingly, environmental protection has
become a high priority for SM6. The ongoing Bank-supported Shanghai Sewerage
Project (1779-CHA) began to address those problems through pollution reduc-
tion.- The proposed project would support further pollution reduction, water
quality improvement and environmental risk containment.
4.        Economic          To speed the evolution of the Shanghai economy,
SMW has adopted the Shanghai Economic Reform Action Plan (SERAP). This was



-2-
endorsed by the Bank in 1991, and adopted as a basis for the future Bank lend-
ing program in Shanghai. The Action Plan focuses on reform in four principal
categoriess Industry, Fiscal Systems, Urban Land and Infrastructure, and
Social Security. For six priority subsectors (State-Owned Enterprises, Muni-
cipal Finanee, Infrastructure, Social Security, Securities Markets, and Land
Management), action plans are being developed by SMG with UNDP and Bank assis-
tance. This proposed project assists SERAP implementation through infrastruc-
ture development and sector planning.
5.        Le6sons from Previous Bank/IDA Ooerations. *  he proposed project
draws and builds on the experience gained through the ongoing Shanghai Sewer-
age Project, which finances the collection and removal of wastewater from the
city, and strengthens institutional capacity for wastowater and water resource
management and from the preparation work for the Ship Waste Disposal Project
(2391-CRA), which addresses the problem of water pollution from maritime traf-
fic in the lower reaches of che Huangpu River. Our exporience from these and
other environmantal and urbaz% infrastructure investments in Shanghai and else-
where in China has demonstrated high implementation capacity, but stressed the
importance of early Implementatien of economically efficient cost recovery
policies, and the need to adopt long-term plans for the provision of essential
urban environmental services. Taking these lessons into account, a 45 percent
real increase in water tariffs was implemented prior to appraisal, and a fur-
ther increase is axpected before effectiveness. An Environmental Master Plan
for Shanghai, iuitiated during preparation, will, once completed, support the
city's longer-term environmental policies and programs.
6.        Rationale for Biik Involvement.  The Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy presented to the Board in August 1993 highlighted the need to support
economic reform while assisting infrastructure modernization in an environmen-
tally responsive manner. Project-finsuced investments specifically respond to
these needs. Our recent environmental sector work with the Government (Report
No. 9669-CRA, 1992) identified improving environmental protection in major
urban area as a national priority. The request to assist Shanghai in
addressing such problems was particularly attractive because of Shanghai's
role as a model for urban development efforts throughout China. Furthermore,
Shangbal's mix of environmental problems typifies those in larger Chinese
cities, and is one to which the Bank can bring considerable international expe-
rience, as well as our experience In recently approved environmental projects
in the adjacent Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces, and In Beijing. SMW origi-
nally conceived the project to comprise only water supply investments; Bank
involvement has, as result of our enviranmental dialogue with Chira, broadened
the scope and impact of the project to include solid and hazardous waste man-
agement, pollution abatement, and capacity building to assess and manage long-
term environmental risks.
7.        Objectives.  The principal project objective is to provide a sus-
tainable environment for the long-term economic and social development of
Shanghai. Specific objectives of the project are tot (a) provide sate drink-
ing water; (b) idents.fy and control sources of pollution; (c) expand water
quality monitoring; (d) improve municipal solid waste and nightsoil manage-
ment; (ei Improve municipal, environmental and utility management and
finances; and (f) support training, feasibility studies, and future investment
project preparation In the environment area.



-3-
8.        Iesgr2gtJon.  The Shanghai Evironment Project vould comprise an
investment program of environmentally oriented capital works and related
lnstitutional otrengthening to provide safe drinking water while improving
water quality in the Hugpu River, supported by financial and policy initia-
tives focusing out (a) improving operational efficiency of urban services;
(b) mobilizing resources through lcreased tariffs ,nd service chargest and
(a) streg thening long-term environmental planning and ivestment programming
capacity.
9.        The proposed investment program would comprise the following compo-
nontas  (a) Drinaki   Water Oualitv Protecton. The construction of a major
raw wator supply system for SM, including an Intake on the Ruangpu River at Da
Qiso (about 5.4 mlli$on amlday capacity), pumping stations, a 25 Ua multiple-
barrel low pressure supply main, surge protection, telemetry and controls,
solected improvements to the existing treatmett facilities aod distribution
network, and the strengthening of operational and financial procedurest
(b) Uonor HuaMu Catobbent Pollution C2=trol. The-construction of wastewater
onveyance system  for the Wujing and Minhang neighborhoods of Shanghai,
including secondary and tertiary connecting sewerst (c) Sonaiian WastZaer
Pg1lluti.Control.  The construetion of wastewater collection and treatment
facilities in Songj iang County including wastemter treatment plant upgrading;
(d) Pollution Sures and Vater Oialitv MonitorinM. A water quality monitor-
ing laboratory at the vew water supply intake, together with associated sam-
pling and analytical equipment to monitor water quality in the Upper Huangpu
catebment; (e) Municival Solid Waste and Nightsoil Menseament. The modernisa-
tion of solid wast and nightsoil management systems and assocfated invest-
ments in mechanical plant and civil work;t and (f) Technical Assistance ad
Progect Manaiement. Project management, training, financail management and
strengthening of utility operations, preparation of a Shanghai Water Supply
Master Plan, information .ystems development for urban planning and water
supply management, and feasibility studies and future project preparation.
Two key envirorAental studies currently underway, the Australian International
Development Assistance Bureau-funded Shanghai Environmental Master Plan and
the Norwegian Government-financed Shanghai Hazardous Waste Management Study,
would also be implemented in parallel.
10.       Imlementation. SEG has appointed a Leading Group headed by a Dep-
uty Mayor, with members from the concerned commissions, departments and
bureaus, to direct the preparation and execution of all major urban projects
in Shanghai; project management would be undertaken by the Shanghai Environ-
ment Project Office (SEPO), established in the Shanghai Environmental Protec-
tion Bureau (SEPB). Implementation would be by the Shanghai Municipal Vatee-
works Company (SMWC), the Shanghai Sewerage Company (SSC), the Songjiang
Wastewater Treatment Plant-(SWWTP), the Shanghai Environmental Monitoring
Center (SEEC), the Shanghai Environmental Sanitation Buteau (SESAB) and SEPI;
subproject offices have been established and fully staffed in these agencies.
SEPO would r2ceive direction from the Leading Group and provide direction to
and coordination of the subproject offices. The project would be carried out
over a period of six years. The total projoct coot is estimated to be $456.6
million, with a foreign exchange component of $195.3 million (43 pzrcent). A
breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts aud methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key. project processing



- 4-
events and the status of Bank Group operations in China are given In Schedules
C and D, respectively. A map (IBRD 25283) is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, Report No. 12386-CIA, dated February 8, 1994, is being dis-
tributed separately. To assist the early start expected to be made by SE on
some works, it is recommended that retroactive financing of up to $15.0 mil-
lion be provided for expenditures inurred from April 15, 1993, covering ini-
tial civil works, goods anJ services contracts.
11.       AQreed Act40ns.  During negotiations, agreement was reached regard-
ing onlending and project organizational requirements, and assurances obtained
that: (a) rosettlement would be carried out in a manner and according to a
schedule satisfactory to the Bank; (b) SMWC would generate revenues from its
water supply operations in fiscal year 1994, sufficient to cover its operating
and maintenance costa including depreciation, and commencing In fiscal year
1995, adjust its tariffs as necessary, In order to earn rates of raturn on
revalued fixed assets of not less than 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 percent in 1995,
1996, 1997, 1998, 199, sand 2000 and each year therQafter, respectively;
(c) S8C would, for each fiscal year, (i) produce revenues sufficient to cover
its total operating costs and the amount by which its debt service require-
ments exceed depreciation, (il' have a debt service coverage of at least 1.3;
(d) SWWV would, commencing in fiscal year 1996, (i) produce revenues suffi-
cient to cover its total operating costs and the amount by which its debt
service requirements exceed depreciation; (it) have a debt service caverage of
at least 1.3; (e) a time-bound Action Plan would be implemented by SWQ for
connecting existing septic tank and nightsoil facilities to the city and
county sewerage systems; and (f) the 33 most polluting industries in the Upper
Nuangpu catchment would complete process changes, or construct pretreatmant
facilities, within an agreed time-bound Action Plan, in order to meet relevant
discharge standards.
12.       The following are conditions of loan effectiveness  -(a) execution
of subsidiary loan agreements satisfactory to the Bank between SE and (i)
SEWC, (ii) SSC and (iii) SWWTP; (b) approval of the Loan Agreement by the
State Council of China; (C) effectiveness of the agreement between the
Shanghai Water Conservancy Bureau and the Taihu Basin Authority to operate and
finnmce the operational costs of the proposed Taihu Pumping Station in an
acceptable manner; and (d) an increase in SMWC's tariffs permitting it to meet
its covenanted 1994 financial targets.
13.       Invironmental Assessment. The proje4t has been categorized "B".
Comprehensive envirormental impact assessments have been undertaken and
acceptable Environmental Assessment (EA) Reports submitted to the Bank. No
major negative evironmental impacts are epected.  The upstream catcbment
protection measures, improvements to nightsoil and solid waste management
systems, and water quality monitoring Improvements would make significant
environmental improvements, protect the  ew  ivestments in safe water supply,
prevent the major environmental degradation that would occur in the medium
term without these investments, and significantly lessen the risks from cata-
strophic environmental accidents, and avoid pollution dmage being caused by
Shanghai to Hangzhou Bay, China's major fishing grounu.
14.       Project activities would require about 87 households (350 people) to    4
be resettled within their original villages. A detailed resettlemest plan



acceptable to the Bank has been prepared in accordance with Chinese regula-
tions, confirming that the resettled families could expect to maintain or
improve their living standards following resettlement. Land acquisition is
substantially complete and resettlement to date has been found satisfactory to
the Bank.
15.       Beneflts.  Project benefits include direct reduction of pollution in
Shanghai, the cost-effective prvvision of a safe potable water supply, and
policy changes that include phased implementation of economically rational
charges for water, wasteuater, nightsoil and sclid waste management services.
This benefit mix would lead to sustained improvements in public health and
living stanIdards in Shanghai, supportiag continued rapid economic gzowth of
the municipalityl, and increased capacity to manage and plan municipal urban
environmental uervices.
16.      Rlsks. Project risks include:  (a) possible reluctance by SMG or
Songjiang County gover:ment to approve snd maintain the tariffs ond service
charges needed for financially sound operationsl (b) possble unwillingness by
SMG to enforce the pollution control laws with respectt to financially weak
enterprises, resulting in continued increases in pollutant levels ir the
Huangpu River; (c) delays by SHG in implementing the institutional development
and training components; and (d) a serious toxic-ffluent spill that would
close the new water system intake for a period. The risks have been the sub-
ject of continuous dialogue during project preparation. A program of water
and wastewater tariff increaes, alread; under way before appraisal, would be
implemented under the project; project invqstments in pollution mouitoring sad
wastewater collection systems in the Upper Huangpu,and assurances by SM6
regarding in-plant pollution reduction would support industrial control mea-
sures, minisizing toxic spill risks; the focused institutional development and
training program, initiated during project preparation, would be completed
during iMplentation, enhanciAg SMG's envitronmental management capacity.
17.       The risk of a toxic spill would be reduced by the solid wast*,
nightso$l management, swerage, and industzial pollution abatement components
of the project, and related preparation of hazardous waste management strate-
gies. Should a toxic spill occur, the project-financed relocatioi of the
intake to a point far upstream of the indust-ial and shipping centers would
substantially decrease the danger to the drinking water supply. To provide
additional protection, the current intakes would rwmain available for stand-by
operation.
18.       Sustainabilitv.  Proposed revenue and service charge enhaUcements,
together with investments to Improve the quality of drinking water and reduce
the risks to Shanghai of toxic chemical spills in the Shanghai water supply,
would provide a reliable basis for economic growth and hence project sustaina-
bility. The costs of sustained system operations, asset maintenance and pro-
active environmental manaSgement would be provided through enhancing existing
revenue arrmagements as part of the project.

19.      Recommendstlon.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
