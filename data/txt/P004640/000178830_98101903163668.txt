INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRTJCTICN TAND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE SINGAPORE TELEPHONE BOARD
FOR A SECOND TELECCNMUNICATION PROJECT
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in various currencies equivalent to US$11 million to the Singapore
Telephone Board (STB), to be guaranteed by the Republic of Singapore.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.       The proposed loan would finance part of the foreign exchange
cost of the expansion of Singapore's local telephone services for the
four-year period 1970 through 1973. Loan 513-SI (US$3.0 million) of
September 15, 1967 covered part of the foreign exchange cost of the
1967-1969 phase of the program. The work for that phase will be com-
pleted early in 1970.
3.       The project was appraised in June/July 1969.  Negotiations
took place between November 17 and 20. Mr. Alan Yeo, Chairman of the
STB, represented the Singapore Government and the STB. The other
participants for the STB were Messrs. C.H. Yong, Deputy Chairman, and
Albert Loke, General Manager.
4.       The proposed loan would be the ninth to be made to Singapore;
one loan was guaranteed by the United Kingdom, when Singapore was still
a U.K. dependency and one by Malaysia, when Singapore was a part of
Malaysia. The following is a summary statement of Bank loans to Singa-
pore as at October 31, 1969.

5.       The execution of projects financed under Bank loans to Singapore
and the rate &f disbursement of these loans have been satisfactory, except
for Loan 462-SI (Port Expansion). In February 1968 the Executive Direc-
tors approved to change this project from a conventional port to a con-
tainer port project. Unforeseen difficulties with land reclamation works
have delayed construction of the container-ship berths and of the con-
tainer terminal. However, most of the container terminal is expected to
be opened to traffic by October 1971 as initially planned and the Borro-
wer does not plan to ask for another extension of the Closing Date for
the Loan, which is now December 31, 1971. Future Bank lending is contem-
plated for industry, technical education, transport and public utilities.
Plans for Bank lending in FY 1970 include loans for industrial development
and electric power generation.

6.       Singapore became a member of the IFC on September 4, 1968.   So
far no projects have been put fonrward to IFC.

PART III - THE FDOJECT
8.       A detailed description of thie project is given in the attached
Appraisal RB&rort ;ntitled "Al-m.raisal of tl,,e Telac kmui-,icati :ris Expansion
Program (15Y0-7j)'), Singapore Telephone Board, Sligapore" (PU-22a), dated
Novemnber 28, 1969.
9.       The Singapore Telephone Board (STB) was established in 1953 for
the purpose of taking over the loca-I public telephone system from the
Oriental Telephone and Electric Company. The Board consists at present
of a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman and five other members who are appointed
by the Minister of Communicationsj it is responsible for establishing
operational policies. The chief executive officer is the General Manager.
The present incumbent and most of the other 11 members of the staff at
the level of Departmental and Divisional Managers have held their posi-
tions since 1966. They are al' wel' qualified.    Total staff is currently
around 1,600. The STB is well organized and is managed efficiently.

10.      The Government's Department of Telecommunications is responsible
for all other aspects of telecommunications. There is close cooperation
between the STB and the Department. The Government expects eventually
to amalgamate them into one statutory board. The Government will keep
the Bank informed of any steps that are taken in this respect.
11.      STB operates a fully automatic telephone system consisting of
11 exchanges with a capacity total'ling 106,000 lines. At six telephones
per hundred population, Singapore has a telephone density greater than
most Asian cities, comparable to Taipei and Manila, but less than half
that of Hong Kong and Japanese cities. Demand for telephone services is
increasing rapidly, most recently because of the upsurge in industry and
tourism, from an average 8 percent per annum in 1961-66 to 12.2 percent
in 1967 and 14.3 percent in 1968. STB's 1970-73 expansion is based on
demand continuing to increase at about 14 percent, a rate which has been
determined by a review of the firm development plans of old and new
customers.
12.      The project to be financed under the proposed Bank loan is the
time slice of STB's expansion program covering the period from January
1970 to December 1973. During these four years, five new exchanges are
to be established, including one of 10,000 lines, already well advanced
for commissioning in early 1970 and financed from Loan 513-SI. The system
capacity will be expanded to about 200,000 lines by the progressive
installation of these new exchanges and regular 3-yearly extensions at
each of the existing exchanges. The junction cables and main subscriber
cables will be augmented as necessary to allow connection of about 70,000
additional subscribers bringing the total to about 164,000. The total
cost of the project, excluding interest during construction, is estimated
at US$37.1 million, of which US$22.7 million is foreign exchange.
13.      The proposed loan would finance the CIF cost of cables, switching
equipment and associated accessories, all procured after international
competitive bidding. Included would be payments for one trunk cable
(US$250,000) which has already been ordered for supply in early 1970,
and for switching equipment (US$2.3 million) ordered or soon to be ordered
for delivery in 1970 and 1971 under an equipment supply contract entered
into under Loan 513-SI. The price for this switching equipment compares
favorably with prices STB would have obtained by asking for new bids.
STB will finance with internally generated funds or Government loans the
switching equipment needed in 1972 and 1973, which it will obtain initially
at a negotiated price from its present supplier, the L.M. Ericsson Co.
of Sweden, and finally from a local subsidiary which it has agreed to form
with that company. The prices to STB are expected to be close to present
prices.
14.      The project is technically sound, well balanced and designed to
meet the economic needs of Singapore.



15.     The STB's present financial position is sound and forecasts show
that it would remain so throughout the period of execution of the project
and beyond. Present tariffs which have been in effect for the past five
years have enabled STB to maintain satisfactory earnings and to achieve
a rate of return on average net fixed assets in operation which has varied
between 12.5 percent and 14.8 percent. Forecasts on the basis of present
tariffs show that the rate of return for the next five years will vary
between 12.6 percent and 10.4 percent. Tariff adjustments now contemplated
by STB for implementation in 1971 should yield higher revenues than pre-
sently forecast. Debt service is well covered.
16.     The proposed financing plan for the project is satisfactory: the
STB is expected to contribute 61 percent towards total requirements; the
proposed Bank loan 29 percent; while Government loans plus the undisbursed
balance of Loan 513-SI will finance the rest. The incremental rate of
return of the project on the basis of present tariffs is calculated to be
11.5 percent, without taking into account its contribution to long distance
service.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
17.     The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Singapore
Telephone Board, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of
Singapore and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text
of a Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately. The draft Loan and Guarantee Agree-
ments conform substantially to the pattern of loan and guarantee agree-
ments used for projects of this kind.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
18.     A report (EAP-9a) in which the current economic position and
prospects are reviewed was distributed to the Executive Directors on
October 21 (R69-205).
19.     In 1968, Singapore's economy continued to grow rapidly. Compared
with an average rate of 7 percent during the first half of the sixties
and a 10 percent rate since 1965, GDP grew by 13 percent in 1968 and has
probably expanded at about the same rate in 1969. This rapid growth was
brought about by record foreign trade and shipping activity, a rapid ex-
pansion of industrial manufacturing and a large inflow of tourists. General
prosperity reinforced a strong propensity to save. Savings reached about
17 percent and investment, both public and private, about 16.7 percent of
GDP in 1968 compared with an average 13.9 percent in the preceding three
years. Investment prospects remain good.
20.     Due to the high merchandise and service exports, current account
deficits narrowed from roughly US$70 million in 1965 to US$35 million in



1967. In 1968 there was a small surplus. Large inflows of private long
term and short term capital - the former at#racted by the opportunities
for industrial investment and the latter by Singapore's political and
monetary stability - reinforced an already strong reserve position and
Singapore's external reserves increased to US$786 million by the end of
March this year. At this level they are equivalent to about 10 months of
retained imports.
21.     The most significant recent development is the breakthrough of
Singapore towards transforming an essentially merchant into an export-
oriented industrial society. The value of industrial output has doubled
between 1965 and 1968, of which about one third was exported. The newly
established metal-working, electrical, shipbuilding and ship-repairing
industries are producing largely for the markets of industrialized
countries and a sustained expansion in production and exports is expected.
22.     Prospects for industrial manufacturing have reduoed considerably
the threat of a serious setback to the economy as a result of the planned
withdrawal of the British forces. Thus a 5 percent GNP growth rate even
at the low point of the adjustment period now appears feasible. A small
rise in unemployment is expected to occur in 1971-72 and public finance
and balance of payments strains may occur in the early 1970's. It would
be highly desirable that public sector investment to provide infrastruc-
ture services required by rapid industrialization and urbanization increase
during this period even though the increase in tax receipts is signifi-
cantly reduced. In addition to the loss of foreign exchange from the
British withdrawal the value of entrepot trade may level off, while re-
tained imports mainly for industrial development will continue to grow
at about the present rate of 7 percent. For these reasons Singapore will
have to rely on external aid, including Bank loans, during the years
immediately ahead. Singapore is creditworthy for additional borrowing
from the Bank. The present debt service ratio in relation to domestic
and net entrepot exports is about 0.5 percent.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
23.     I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
24.     I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
