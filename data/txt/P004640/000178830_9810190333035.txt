SUMMARY AMN CONCLUSIOiNS
i.        The Singapore Telephone Board (STB) is currentlv expanding local
telephone service with the assistance of a Bank loan (513-SI, US$3 million,
1967).  The work is Droceeding as Dlanned and will be comDleted enrlv in
1970.  The standard of service being provided is good, but there are in-
creasine arrears in meeting new demands becanuse of an unnprecedented upsmrge
in industrial and other development.
ii.       The project appraised in this report is the four-year 1970-1973
expansion progrnm of the Board.   The rate of epr     ion4' is b    nncr
to keep up with the commercial and industrial demand and to fit in with the
roverment qs plans for the long dis+tnce service (which ithe responsib;it,--
of a Department of Government) and other infrastructure work in the Republic.
iii.      The cost of the project would be US$37.1 million equivalent

area, with a capacity of 120,000 lines.   The project is to add four further
exchanges and expand the existing excnanges to a total capacity of about
200,000 lines. About 70,000 new subscribers would be added during the period.
v.        The STB which would be the borrower is a Government-owned corpora-
tion. It has a good degree of autonomy, is we     organized and managed, and
operates efficiently in terms of staff utilization, level of tariffs, and
return on invested capital.
vi.       STB's financial position is sound and forecasts show it would
remain so throughout the project.
vii.      The program is technically sound, well balanced and designed to
meet the economic needs of the Republic. The incremental rate of return
of the project is calculated to be 11.5%. This is only on the local network
and does not include the benefits from the more profitable long distance
service which is under a Government Department.
viii.     During negotiation agreement was reached on the points listed
under Chapter 7. The project would be suitable for a loan of US$11 million
to be repaid over 20 years including a grace period of 4h1 years.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.01       Tne project covered by this appraisal is lane four-year
1970-73 construction program of the Singapore Telephone Board (STB).
Tne total cost is estimated at S$113.5 million i-u0'(.1 million
equivalent), of which US$22.7 million is foreign expenditure. The
proposed Bank loan would be for US$!! millicn. The balance of the
funds would come from STB's internal cash generation, borrowing from
the Goverrment, and the undisbursed balance of Loan 513-SI.
1.02       STB is currently expanding its facilities under a two-
year 1968-69 project costing S$30 million (US$10 million equivalent)
with the assistance of a US$3 million Bank loan (513-SI) towards the
foreign expenditure of US$7 million. This project is proceeding
according to plan; however, there has been a not unexpected upsurge
in the demand for telephone connections brought about by buoyant
conditions in trade and industry. Consequently, STB now faces a
bigger challenge than previously to increase its construction effoxts.
1.03       The Borrower would again be (as in Loan 513-SI) the
Singapore Telephone Board, a statutory corporation owned by the Govern-
ment, which would be the guarantor.
1.04       This report is based on information furnished by STB and
on the findings of Messrs. A. M. X4inton and J. M. Vance, who made
an appraisal visit to Singapore in July 1969.

2. BACKGROUND
2.01      The Republic of Singapore, with an area of 225 square miles,
consists of the island of Sinapnore (26 bv 1L miles) and about 40 adjacent
islets.  The island is separated from the southern tip of the Malay peninsula
(We.st MAlnayin) by th> .t+.ril-. rf .Thhra +.traversed by a          causeO-
way, and from Indonesia by the Singapore Strait.  The country has a population
of over two million  +wo-thiric of whom. lire in the port city of Singapore.
Since 1819, wihen the British set up a trading post at the site of a small
fishing ,rfl 1a -n g   -n t-             .hMs becme a m.ebtropolis and re-

a more secure long term source of foreign earnings than is provided by
entrepot trade and the  ritdish naval and air establishments, which are being
withdrawn. Public housing and urban renewal projects have been carried out
on a massive scaLe, providing additional employment and giving Singapore one
of the highest standards of living in Southeast Asia. In 1965, Singapore
separated from the other states making up the Federation of Malaysia two
years after joining it.
2.02      The local public telephone system in Singapore was started in 1882
by the Oriental Telephone and Electric Company Ltd. (OTEC). Under the
Telephone ordinance of 1953, the Government set up a statutory board, STB,
which in 1955 took over the assets and operations of the Company. The Board
is a corporation fully owned by the Government.  Its expansion can be gauged
from the fact that its assets have grown from S$13 million in 1955 to S$80
million in 1969.
2.03      The Government's Department of Telecommunications is responsible
for all other aspects of telecommunications, including telegraph and telex
services, the trunk service to Malaysia, intexational radio and cable services,
and services for shipping and civil aviation. This Department's activities
have also expanded greatly in recent years by the acquisition of the assets
of Cable and Wireless Ltd., and by the completion in 1967 of the Commonwealth-
owned 'Seacom' cable which links Singapore with high quality speech circuits
to Hong Kong, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. The Department will
soon establish a satellite earth station.
2.o4      There is a close relationship between the Department of Telecommu-
nications and STB.  STB leases circuits to the Department for telegraph,
telex and other services. and meters and renders bills on its behalf for
trunk calls to Malaysia dialled by subscribers.  For these services, STB
is reimbursed onlv for direct  ost   ii-. btdoes not+. qhynrp in t-he coniiArnh1l
profits made by the Department in operating the more remunerative of the
telecozmmunicati;onst senrvces.  lThis division of arevenues v.tu-m1A 1-or 1n  +1,e
satisfactory if it were not a fact that both entities are fully Goverrnment-
ow.n.ed, that STB's financrial resul+us a~e good an.d that the Uvern.t



expects eventually to amalgamate them under one statutory board. During nego-

steps that are taken.
2.05      STB operates a fully automatic telephone system consisting of 11

(June 30, 1969). Exchange equipment installed prior to 1967 is the step-
by--step type (post-war British manufacture) installed and maintained i1
close conformity with British Post Office practices.   Since 1967, 20,000
lines of Swedish Ericsson crossbar equipment have been used in new installa-
tions. Local calls are not metered; most trunk calls to Malaysia can be
dialled by the subscribers and are recorded on meters.   International calls
are handled by operators at the Department's trunk switchboard. Outside
plant practices are based on those of the British Post Office, modified
to suit Singapore's tropical conditions.   The standards of maintenance of
both equipment and outside plant being very good, STB is not faced with
appreciable reconstruction of existing plant as is sometimes necessary to
pave the way for expansion. Since it provides neither a rural nor a long
distance service, STB's operations are rather more straightforward than
is usually the case.

3.  THE PROJECT FOR BANK FINANCIG
3.01      STB has made forecasts of telephone demand through to 1975, and
has drawn up a program that would follow its current Bank-financed program
(Loan 513-SI) and enable it to connect new subscribers without incurring
too much delay.
3.02      The project for the proposed second telecommunications loan is
the time slice of STB's expansion plans covering the period from January
1970 to December 1973. During these four years, five new exchanges are to
be established, including one of 10,000 lines, already well advanced for
commissionimg in early 1970 and financed from Loan 513-ST.   The system
capacity will be expanded to about 200,000 by the progressive installation
of these new exchanges and regular 3-yearly extensions at each of the
existing exchanges. The exchange installation program is shown in Annex 1.
The junction cables and main subscriber cables will be augmented as necessary
to allow connection of about 70,000 additional subscribers, bringing the
total to about 16h,000.
3.03      The nonstru tion of new ecxhange buildings and associated duct
systems will be coordinated with other infrastructure work which the
Government plans in connection with new inHustrial nreas   nd satellite towns.
It is particularly desirable, in the interest of overall efficiency, that
this rather substar.tial forw.ard investment be made at. the right stage of
road and other formation work.

3.05      The loan will cover US$11 million of the foreign costs.   The items
financed will be exchange equipment estimated to cost US$2.5 million under
B above and cables and accessories estimated to cost US$8.5 million under
C above.
3.06      STB's normal procurement policy is to call international bids for
all items costing in excess of S$5,ooo. In the case of switching equipment,
the Board has followed a policy of standardization. This is sound in view



- 5 -
of the limited scale of its operations and the fact that all its exchanges
form a slngle metropolitan network. After calling international bids undcr
Loan 513-SI, the Board entered into a four-year supply contract with the
Swedish L.M. Ericsson Co. for some 50.000 lines of crossbar equipment for
new exchanges and major extensions. Loan 513-SI financed most of the C.I.F.
cost of the first 18.000 lines of eouinment ordered under this contract,
equipment now installed and mostly in service. A further 23,000 lines of
equinment is in the cowrse of mannufacturre for deliverv in 1970 and 1971.
The proposed loan will cover payments of US$1.3 million still to be made

form a jointly owned subsidiary in Singapore to assemble telephone equipmerlt
commencin- about 1973.  The price t+ STB is expected to be close to present
prices. An interim requirement of equipment for the project in 1972 will be
obtained by- negotiating an, exter.sior. of the preent contract.  Step-by-step

than US$250,000.
3.08      On items for which a local source of manufacture exists STB
would be required to pay a 40% customs tariff.  Two cable factories enjoy
this protection on the limited range of small size plastic insulated and
sheathed cables which they produce, amounting to about 3% by value of SrB's
cable purchases. STB will finance this local procurement.
3.09      Disbursement would be made for the CIF cost of imported cables
and equipment.
3.10      The project is part of an on-going expansion of services.  Should
there be overall savings in expenditure for the various items proposed for
Bank financing the savings may be utilized to finance other similar items
in the project.

4. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
4.01      Traditionally, a major justification for Singapore to have a
good telephone service has been the entrepot trade. The coordination
necessary for the expeditious movement of goods and quick ship turn-around
in this fourth largest port in the world is very dependent upon an efficient
telecommunications system. At six telephones per hundred population,
Singapore has a telephone density greater than most Asian cities, comparable
with Taipei, Manila, but less than half that of Hong Kong and Japanese
cities. In respect of telephone density to GDP and in respect of invest-
ment proeram to GDP it is in a median position.
L.02      Thp econnmic importance of the servinp tn the unsrq is indicated
by the continuing demand for this service which covers its operating costs
and shnws a rat.e nf retuin, of 12% on the invtr ea.t -n locanl seice and
of about 50% on the investment in long distance service.   Long distance
revenues, all from calls to           o
largely for business purposes, already exceed local service revenues
and are  vected to increase m      , ral d  ing +h   e p bsf
the advent of an earth satellite station.
4.03      The incremental rate of return on the investment as shown in
Ann.ex h is 1l. f% without accou,nting for its contribution to the long
distance service. If the two services were considered together, the
in--^ental ratLe of re"urn co--" excee' 20o

.V4 r.       LI epou iUCraue coni-lnues co increase, Ib LI ul UUlL-  b e is
an upsurge in industry and tourism to be catered for.   In 1968 Singapore
entered a phase of accelerated growth in private investment, naif oI it
in manufacturing. A number of Hong Kong entrepreneurs and Japanese manu-
faeturers have establisned subsidiaries, while large u.S. corporations
have opened regional distribution centers and manufacturing and assembly
plants.  Several petroleum companies are increasing storage facilities
and in one case setting up a refinery; aerospace and shipping industries
are planned for establishment on soon to be vacated British air and naval
bases. The number of visitors, both directly for business purposes and
othenrise, has increased 2½ times between 1966 and 1969, and this has
inspired a boom in hotel building. Compared with an average growth of 7%
per annum between 1960 and 1965, GDP increased an average 10% per annum
from 1965 and 13% in 1968. One third of the increase was from entrepot
trade, the balance from manufacturing, tourism and domestic trade.
4.o5      The effect of this recent economic expansion on the demand for
telephones has been considerable. Demand increased from an average 8% per annum
increase between 1961 and 1966 to 12.2% in 1967, 14.3% in 1968 and 16%
for the first half of 1969. In 1966, STB had planned for a continuation
of the 8% per annum growth then being experienced for its 1968-1969
expansion program. It was appreciated that a higher growth was a real
possibility, but there were offsetting uncertainties, such as the impending
British forces withdrawal, which at that time made it prudent to be
conservative. As it takes two to three years from the time an exchange

or an extension is ordered until it is brought into service, the present
upsurge in de.mand is resulting in an increase in the backlog nf applicants=

1969 4+ was '0     even though  tiing +.hs +.tw an na  hal f' year nSTR had

full year following project completion net benefits (cash flow) will equal
10% of project investments, indicative that forward provision of outside
plant also is not excessive.

5. THE BORROWER
5.01      Under the 1953 Ordinance the Board is made up of seven members,
who are appointed from time to tine by the Minister of Communications.
They are selected from among responsible officials in public service and
5.02      The organnization is shownm in Annex 5.  The chief exeiutivp offic.er
is the General Manager. The present incumbent has a commercial background.
STB is org. ^ ed so that the G-eeral Manager controls the activities of
three non-technical departments--personnel, stores, and accounts.   Two
engir.Leers OrL s-",milar age anr.d experience 1"ill  epsto  fDi.sora
Manager, each also controlling three departments embracing, respectively,
the aspectus ofL Zxtuernlal r'ant ar,d UI,terna'l 4EQui-|Fs,ert. E"ach of t~he D^ar
nine departments is further subdivided into from two to five sections.
Organization and lines of responsibility are clearly defined and well nder-
stood by all concerned. The General Manager and most of the other 11 mem-
bers of the staff at the level of Department Manager and Divisional Manager
have held their positions since 1966, when the Bank first began dealings
with the Board. They are well qualified and trained, and are managing the
entity effectively.
5.03      Adequate steps are taken to recruit and train at all staff levels
for future needs. Overseas experience is given to professional and tech-
nical staff as necessary in order to prepare them for broader responsibil-
ities or new techniques.
5.04      Total staff is currently about 1,600.   Only one member of manage-
ment is an expatriate. The number has increased at a slower rate than have
telephones, staff per 1,000 telephones having fallen steadily from 14.8
in January 1965 to 13.2 in January 1969. This indicates a good overall
efficiency in staff utilization under STB's circumstances.
Tariffs
5.05      The Telephone Ordinance of 1953 permits STB to determine and set
its own tariffs. No definitive tariff policy is laid down in the Ordinance
except that total revenues should cover total expenses. As shown in Annex
6, charges are on a flat rate rental basis. These tariffs have been in
effect for the past five years without any substantive changes.
5.06      Tariffs for service to points in Malaysia are set by the Director,
Telecommunications Department, in agreement with the Malaysian authorities.
Revenue from the Malaysian service, which is billed and collected by STB,
is remitted to the Department after deducting estimated costs of handling
the traffic, including working expenses, depreciation on plant utilized,
and interest charges of 8yk on capital invested.
5.07      Just nrior to negotiations the Board decided to proceed with a
tariff adjustment which would convert the flat rate rental charge for
bu.siness connections into an arrangement where anmy clls in excess of a



- 9
certain number each month would be charged at a specific rate per call
(untimed local call metering). The present plan would be to proceed with
further studies on the subject during 1970 and introduce the system in 1971.
Available statisticAl data are not fullv adequate to assess the average
calling rate per consumer group and to make a reliable computation of the
e~ffecsr1t s nf t h han-es; a roug h estimate Tn nicates however that the new
tariff should actually yield higher revenues than presently forecast.
5.08      The Loan Agreement 513-SI includes a rate covenant stipulating
+ha+ tarif   will be maintained +to "td   en a minuimim -retum.,n nf inl on

between 12.6% and 10.4%. Considering the tariff adjustment mentioned in
the previous paragraph, the return ig-ures wo'uld most likely be higher ater
1971.
Accounting and Audit
5.09      STB's senior accounting staff is well qualified.   The accounting
system is well organized and is oriented to provide management with timely
information. STB intends to further organize its accounting system by
computeriz ing the whole of the Accounts Department by 1971; at present
only the billing operation is mechanized.
5.10      Under the first Bank Loan (513-SI), STB engaged a local auditing
firm of chartered accountants, Goh and Associates, to perform the annual
audit and certify the financial statements. Also, as agreed upon with the
Bank, certified copies of the statements are sent to the Bank not later
than six months after close of the fiscal year and unaudited financial
statements not later than four months after fiscal year close. This is a
satisfactory arrangement and will be continued under the proposed loan.
Insurance
5.11      STB's insurance practices are satisfactcry.   Adequate coverage
against losses and liability is maintained.
Present Financial Position
5.12      Balance sheets as of December 31 for fiscal years 1965-1969 are
shown in Annex 7. A summary of the estimated 1969 balance sheet is given
below.

5.13      In 1955, assets valued at S$12.6 million (US$4.1 million) were
acquired from the Oriental Telephone and Electric Company Ltd. All sub-
sequent plant additions have been recorded at historical cost. Deprecia-
tion is charged on a straight-line basis at a composite rate of about 5%,
awhich is satisfactory. The asset values are realistic, since there has
been a high degree of price stability in Singapore in the past 10 years.
STB investments consist of S$1,000.000 in a fund for emnlovee housing
loans and S$500,000 in Government securities. The ratio of current assets
to current liabilities is 1.17 to 1, a satisfactorv cuirrent positior for
STB.

to the Government and maxe the final payment in   9 9.
Past Earnings
5.o       Operating statements for the five fiscal years 1965 througn 1969
are shown in Annex 8. As a result of substantial expansion of the network
during this period, net operating income increased from S6b.b mllion at
end of 1964 to an estimated S$10.6 million in 1969. The rate of return
on average net fixed assets during the period varied between 12.5% and
14.8,o and the operating ratio between 52% and 59%.   The drop in the return
in 1966 resulted from a change in the method of accounting for overhead
expenise by charging overhead against revenue rather than capitalizing it.
The return rose to l14% in 1968 as a result of a large number of ne;w sub-
scribers being connected to the expanded network. STB s past earnings
record is particularly good considorLng the fact that its operations do not
include the more profitable long distance and telex services. In the past
dividends have been paid at a rate of 16% of net earnings.
5.17      As shown in the following figures, past earnings have contributed
substantially to the financing of expansion since, as mentioned above,
STB is permitted to utilize its internal sources for such purpose..

Financing 72% of the expansion from internal sources during the past five
years was made possible in part by the small amount of debt serviced and
conservative dividend payments. Nonetheless, this is a very high propor-
tion in view of the fact that the value of STB's Dlant has increased by
about 75% during this period.
5.18      The collection performance is generally satisfactory.    There is
some ronm for imnprovemePn+t, however, as is reaized by the chief financial
officer.  He is taking steps to tighten up the collection procedures.
Tax

6.02      internal cash generation after meeting debt service and dividend
payments would finance 59% of total requirements while the remaining 41%
would come from borrowings as follows:
(i)  the undisbursed balance of Bank Loan 513-SI;
(ii)  the proposed Bank loan of US$11 million equivalent which
has been assumed at an interest rate of 7% for a term of
20 years including a   4'½-year grace period;
(iii)  loans from the Government of Singapore totalling US$3.8
million equivalent in 1971, 1972, 1973 each at an assumed
interest rate of 7% for a term of 15 years (no grace period).
The forecasts assume a loan for future construction works to begin in 1974,
on similar terms to present Bank loans.



6.03      In regard to the proposed Government loans (see (iii) above) the
Sinwanore rGovernment has given assurances that these funds will be made
available at the terms indicated if and when required.   To the extent that
the tariff adjustment mentioned rn paragraph 5 07 will nrntThuee higher
revenues this will reduce the need for such Government loans.

expansion and improvement of the existing network under the proposed cons-
truction program, net operating income is forecast to increase from S$L0.6
million in 1969 to S$19.7 million in 1975. Total operating revenues over
the six-year period show an average annual rate of growtn of about i2%.
Operating expenses, not including depreciation, provide for an average
annual increase of about 11%; this is considered reasonable to cover the
additional staff and other expenses in connection with the expanded
facilities.
6.o6      In 1968, STB signed an eight-year contract with the General
Telephone Directory Company, an American firm, granting exclusive right to
the Company to compile, print and sell advertising in its directories.   STB
will receive a percentage of the advertising revenue as well as payment for
billing the advertising. This has been taken into account in the forecasts.
6.07      The rate of return on average net fixed assets is shown to decline
during the four-year expansion program from 12.6% in 1970 to 10.4% in 1973
(last year of the program), and to rise to 10.9% beginning in 1975. The
operating ratio remains at 56%-58%. A decline in the rate of return durir;
the period of large expansion is normal, and results from the time-lag
between putting new plant into service and connecting new subscribers.   An
additional factor in the decline is the greater-than-usual proportion of
the construction program being devoted to long term provision in duct lines
and buildings. These operating results are very satisfactory and might
improve further if a tariff adjustment is introduced in 1971 (see paragrapri
5.07).
6.08      Under tho last Loan Agreement (513-SI) dividend payments for the
period 1967 to 1969 were restricted to a snecific amount or a Dercentage
of net earnings whichever was lesser in order to assure a satisfactory
financing' plan.  In view of the sizeable cash renu rements under the present
expansion program it was agreed during negotiations to continue to limit
dividend payments tn the snovernment to A maxniynim pay out tmrtino of 30% of net
earnings for the period of the project (1970 to 1973) and to 40% thereafter.
For the four years 1970 to 1973 diriden.ds totallneg S$13.8 million are
expected to be declared, amounting to slightly less than 30% of net earnings

the latter from time to time through capitalization of general reserve and

Pay- out limitation-after the project might, however, have to be revised in
the light of the new circumstances.
Future Financial Position
6.og      Forecast balance-sheets (Annex 7) as of December 31, 1970, through
19   show--that the value of net plant is fmpected to increase from S$85.1
mlillion at the- beginning of 1970 to S$187.5 million at the end of 1975. The
debt/equity ratio would be 18/84 in 1970, rising to 32/68 in 1973 and
thereafter declining to- 29/71 by 1975. These ratios reflect a financing
pattern idhereby it is-expected that STh would use a substantial portion of
its earnings to finance its expansion. The current position would-remain
satisfactory.
6.10      Internal cash- generation is estimated to increase-from S$17.3
-milli,n in 1969 to S$33A4 million in 1975, and would (after debt service
and dividend payments) finance 68% of-total requirements during the six-year
period. This is a substantial contribution when one considers that the
entity's total net fixed assets would more than dcLuble.
6.11      Due to the low debt capitalization of STB, coverage of interest
and debt service in the first few vears of the forenAst is verv hiph And
is therefore not very meaningful.  In the latter part- of the forecast peri,,'.

7. RECOMMEIDATIO1NS
7.01      During loan negotiations agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(i!  STB will maintain tariffs at a level to produce a rate of
return of not less than 10% on average net fixed assets
properly valued (para. 5.08):
(ii)  pres-t audit arrangements will be continued (para. 5.10);
(iii)  dividend payments to Goverrnment will not exceed certain
limits (para. 6.08);
(iv) as and when necessary Government will extend term loans to
STB for the project (para. 6.03);
(v)   STB will limit debt incurrence (para. 6.12).
7.02      The program would be suitable for a Bank loan of TTS ll million
with a term of 20 years including a grace period of 43½ years.

The following table presents the cash flow of the investment
for 20 years. .LL1'e increas~e in rt~evenue IA) L,Le eighth yI yar comes dUrec"ly
from additional subscribers connected to the exchanges installed under
the project. Fr;om the ninth to the 20th year, the increase is an l es-
ment of the contribution to the revenue from later expansion made by the
Iorward provision of cables, duct lines and buiidings included in the
project. The incremental rate of return is calculated to be 11.5%. Not
included are benefits from the more profitable long distance service
which is the responsibility of a Government department.

Notes andssumptions on Balance sheet
Telecommunications Plant
Telecommunications plant, other than that acquired in 1955
from' the Oriental Telephone and Electric Company Ltd. for S$12.6
million (US$4.1 million), has been included in the balance sheet at
cost. In determining such cost, items recovered and reinstalled
have been brought in at their estimated depreciated values.
Also included in telecommunications plant is that amount of plant
which normally is under construction. No interest is capitalized.
ine composite rate of depreciation on average plant is about 5%, which
is reasonable.
Cash
Cash includes trunk call collections not yet paid the Tele-
communications Department; the corresponding entry is shown as a
current liability. The forecasts assume that the 15% aovernment tax
is remitted as it is collected.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable include trunk billings on behalf of the
Telecommunications Department; the corresnondinct entry is shg-   s
current liability. Accounts receivable do not include rental billings
made in advance of the due date and therefore the ammonv. is relatively,,
small consisting more of trunk revenue uncollected. This is explained
by STB billine all subscribers in advance, thus at the end of any
calendar quarter, the advance billings for that quarter would have been
paid and the new advance billings unilud not yet be due.
In the Dast. Government has som.etim.es pressed SE to rem4it
trunk revenue before collection was made.  As a counter measure, STB
would assume that there would be an abnormally large amount of bad
debts from trunk and net the amount of trunk accounts receivable with
a large Drovision for bad debs+.  Conrsequently, th.e yea     1966 and 1967
show an even smaller amount of accounts receivable than usual. Receiva-
bles were higher in 1968 due to billings beng held up pending a de-
cision on the handling of the 15 government tax.
Forecasts are based on billed revenue for rentals and trunk
caiTh annd also take into account the lo government tax to be collected.
It is assumed that trunk call collections will improve over the next
five a' 's

Materials and Supplies
Forecasts assume materials and supplies to increase propor-
tionately to the increase in gross telecormiunications plant.
Current Liabilities
Current liabilities do not include current maturities of
long-term debt. "Other current liabilities" include accrued expenses,
such as interest on debt, directory advertising collected and not yet
remitted to General Telephone Directorv Comnany, and tender deposits.
