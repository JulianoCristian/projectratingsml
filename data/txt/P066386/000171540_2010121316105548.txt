Honorable Minister, 
 
We refer to the letter of agreement dated November 14, 2007, between the Republic of 
Rwanda (
“Recipient”) and the International Development Association (“World Bank”), acting as 
administrator of grant funds provided under the Multi Donor Trust Fund for support to the Rwanda 
Public Financial Management Program (“Agreement”), as amended.  We would like to inform 
you that we have received additional contribution from MDTF Donors and accordingly we 
propose to amend the Agreement as follows: 
 
1. 
The attachment to the Agreement is deleted and replaced by the Attachment I to this letter. 
 
2. 
The table in Section 3.01 of the Annex to the Agreement is deleted and is replaced with the 
table set forth in Attachment II to this amendment letter. 
 
Please confirm the Recipient’s agreement to the foregoing by having an authorized 
official of the Recipient sign and date the enclosed copy of this letter of amendment 
(“Amendment”) and returning it to the World Bank.  Upon receipt by the World Bank of this 
countersigned copy, this Amendment shall become effective as of the date of the 
countersignature.   
 
Very truly yours,
