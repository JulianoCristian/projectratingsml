 Revised project development objective/outcomes

 Revised PDO:

 Public sector institutions supported by the project achieve increased capacity for efficient and
 accountable use ofpublic resources.

 Revised outcome indicators:
    Efficient use:
         Proportion o f value o f public procurement contracts tendered competitively or, if not
         tendered competitively, non-competitive tendering adequately justified;
    Accountable use:
         Proportion o f audited public budget agencies receiving unqualified audit opinions;
         Proportion o f selected public sector institutions achieving satisfactory ratings during
         an external quality assurance review o f their integrated pay and personnel information
         systems, including with regard to compliance with public service management policy
         guidelines.
 Rationale: The proposed restructured project would maintain i t s focus o n strengthening
 capacity for core public sector functions but narrow i t s scope o n financial and human
 resources.
 Does the restructured project trigger any new safeguard policies ? No.

Introductory Statement

1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval o f the Executive Directors to introduce the
following changes to the Rwanda Public Sector Capacity Building Project (PSCBP)
PO66386 (Cr. 3955) and any accompanying amendments to the project's legal
documents. The proposed restructuring responds to concerns o f a l o w disbursement rate
and a changed institutional environment for project implementation, notably the
restructuring o f a number o f public institutions including the coordinating agency. It
follows the recommendations from the midterm review and the PAD review exercise'.
The proposed changes reflect a maturing o f key institutions which are n o w capable o f
implementing their o w n capacity building initiatives as well as a grown recognition in-
country that a clearer focus will enhance implementation o f reforms.

2.     K e y components o f the original projects include Coordination o f the Multi-Sector
Capacity Building Program (MSCBP), Strategic Human Resource Development, Cross-
cutting Public Sector Reforms, Enhancing Agency Performance, and Information and
Communication Technology. A summary table i s provided in Annex 1 to indicate the
original and proposed changes in components.

3.      The major changes proposed in this paper are: (i)        changes in the project's
development objectives and results monitoring framework by reducing the scope o f the
Project Development Objective (PDO) and streamlining the number o f key performance
indicators used in the project; (ii)change in project components and re-allocation o f
credit proceeds across components to ensure efficient utilization o f project resources and
to reflect the changing priorities o f government; ( i ) i i changes in implementation
arrangements to adapt the project to the new institutional structures created by the
govenunent; (iv) alignment with the new country financing parameters; (v) transiting to
new procurement guidelines for IBRD loans and IDA credits published in M a y 2004 and
revised on October 1, 2006; and (vi) extension o f project closing date for two years from
December 31,2009 to December 3 1,201 1.

4.      The proposed changes in the project are expected to lead to an increase in the
capacity o f the project's beneficiaries to use their financial and human resources in a
manner that i s efficient and accountable. This will be achieved by: (i)supporting budget
agencies to produce financial reports in a timely manner; (ii)    helping the Ministry o f
Finance and Economic Planning (MINECOFIN) achieve i t s reform outputs based on the
Public Financial Management (PFM) reform strategy; ( i )     i i building the capacity o f
ministries to prepare and submit their implementation progress reports as required by
the Economic Development and Poverty reduction Strategy (EDPRS); (iv) helping the
Ministry o f Public Service and Labor (MIFOTRA) take the lead in the development and
disseminating o f a c i v i l service management policy; (v) supporting central and local


  By the time o f the PAD review exercise, restructuring o f the project had already been initiated (see
Government request letter received September 25, 2008, requesting to add a l l central ministries, the
President's Office and the Rwanda Governance Advisory Council as project beneficiaries). However, the
latest restructuring mission, April 13 - 30,2009, agreed on a simplification o f the project, thus reducing the
number o f beneficiary institutions.

government institutions to publish service delivery directories; (vi) building MIFOTRA's
capacity to manage the restructuring process, which aims to provide clear missions,
functions, structures and appropriate staffing levels to public agencies; (vii) helping
MIFOTRA achieve i t s civil service reform (CSR) outputs; and, (viii) providing support to
the newly created Public Sector Capacity Building Secretariat (PSCBS) to prepare an
annual report on the state o f capacity building in Rwanda.

Project Background

5.      The PSCBP was approved by the Board on July 8,2004, and became effective on
March 30, 2005. The original Project Development Objective (PDO) was aimed at
building the capacity o f public sector entities for a more efficient, effective, transparent
and accountable performance in their newly redefined roles and functions. This was
aimed at contributing significantly to the implementation o f the Rwanda Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the achievement o f the Government's strategic
objectives. The project has supported the coordination o f capacity building interventions
under the Government's Multi Sector Capacity Building Program, the establishment o f
the Human Resources and Institutional Capacity Development Agency (HIDA)2,human
resource development, civil service reform, P F M reform, the establishment o f a national
M&E system, demand-driven support to public sector entities and parliament and the
effective use o f Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the public sector.
The original credit amount was SDR 13.7 (US$20 million equivalent) o f which US$9.16
million or 45% has been disbursed.

6.      Implementation progress was rated moderately satisfactory in all Implementation
Status and Results (ISR) reports until end 2008 and downgraded to moderately
unsatisfactory following the April 2009 supervision mission. Progress towards achieving
the PDO was initially rated satisfactory but was downgraded to moderately satisfactory in
the December 2008 ISR report. Implementation progress has been uneven, with
significant progress in public financial management and procurement reforms and a rapid
uptake by sector ministries o f coaching support through Rapid Results Initiatives. The
Midterm Review concludes that "Overall, the project has been successful in laying
important foundations for public sector reforms and capacity building in the country and
has made progress in cross-cutting areas o f reform, especially in Public Financial
Management and, to a certain degree, also C i v i l Service Reform. However, not much
tangible results were achieved in supporting sector ministries."


Reasons f o r project restructuring

7.      The project has been making good progress towards achieving i t s development
objectives. However, the pace o f project implementation has remained below
expectation. During the Midterm Review in December 2007, Government and World
Bank teams jointly concluded that the slow pace o f project implementation i s due to: (i)

'In the DCA denoted as "Human Resources and Capacity Building Agency (HRCBA)", the name o f the
agency during Project preparation.

                                                4
complex institutional set-up, whereby the coordinating agency manages project funds and
ministries implement; and (ii)   lack o f effective policy coordination to support the
MSCBP in its functions, which could be done through a public sector reform steering
committee.

8.      At the same time, the demand for public sector capacity building i s strong.
Government and World Bank teams joined forces during the April 2009 restructuring
mission. The teams, considering the history o f project implementation and the
recommendations from the Midterm Review, proposed to simplify and focus the project
in those areas that have a strong track record o f performance and are o f high importance
within the ambit o f Government's public sector reforms. PFM, CSR as well as national
M&E emerged as the key reform areas. In addition, human resource development,
although a weak component under the project to date, was considered to be vital and
would be maintained within the overall reform areas, albeit ceasing to be a self-standing
component. Innovative approaches will be tried such as supporting professional
organizations to enhance impact o f skills development and Rapid Results Initiatives. In
the area o f PFM, development partner coordination as well as policy dialogue with
government i s well established and serves as a model for improved coordination and
dialogue on CSR. The Bank i s the lead donor for both reform areas and development
partners have established a tradition o f carrying-out joint supervision missions. The
Bank i s thus playing to i t s strengths, also in focusing its implementation resources.

Implementation Arrangements

9.       The Government in September 2008 dissolved HIDA, t~getherwith six other
public agencies, into the newly established Rwanda Development Board. The public
sector capacity building part o f HIDA's mandate was subsequently transferred to the
MSCBP. During the restructuring mission, the Government presented its draft
institutional framework for the PSCBS, consisting o f an inter-ministerial Technical
Steering Committee at Permanent Secretary level and a support office headed by an
executive secretary. The Government further informed the mission o f i t s intent to set up
a policy coordinating mechanism for public sector reforms at the ministerial level. Under
the restructured project, the PSCBS would resolve implementation differences, generate
and exchange information and monitor public sector capacity building activities and
reforms. Implementation responsibility for P F M and national M&E would be transferred
to MINECOFIN and for CSR to MIFOTRA. The decentralization o f implementation
responsibility i s expected to increase ownership, institutionalize support, thus enhance
sustainability o f interventions and accelerate project implementation. MINECOFIN i s
already the sole implementing agency for the Multi Donor Trust Fund for the P F M
reforms, associated with the PSCBP, following the amendment o f i t s grant agreement
effective January 2009.

PAD Compliance Review

 10.    As stated in the P A D Compliance Review3, all activities financed fall within the
description and strategic direction o f the project. There are two activities that are not
clearly identified in the PAD, but fall within the scope o f the project. These are: (i)  the
expansion o f the Rwandan Expertise Scheme to the President's Office; and (ii)        Rapid
Results Initiatives financed under the agency performance fund under component 4, as
requested by participating ministries. Following the Midterm Review, additional public
sector institutions have been added to benefit from support to strategic planning under
component 4 (ORINFOR, the Rwanda Information Office, and MINAFFET, the Ministry
o f Foreign Affairs and Cooperation). These expansions were recorded in Aide Memoirs,
the Midterm Review Report and were to be reflected in the restructuring o f the project.
However, given that the restructuring i s seeking a narrowing o f focus o f the project, this
will no longer be possible or necessary.

Proposed Changes

    (i)    Revision o f Project Development Objective and Results Monitoring
           Framework: Revising the Project Development Objective and results
           indicators by narrowing the scope o f the project to strengthening capacity o f
           government entities for the management o f financial and human resources,
           national monitoring and evaluation and coordination o f public sector reforms
           (and accordingly, reallocating funds across components and adjusting
           expenditure categories), as well as simplifying results indicators by reducing
           the number o f indicators from 22 to 8 and by removing indicators that proved
           not to be measurable. The proposed changes seek to narrow the scope o f the
           project while keeping the same overall intent o f the project. The current PDO
           "Public sector entities have the capacity for more efficient, effective,
           transparent and accountable performance in their redefined roles and functions
           and for achievement o f their strategic objectives contributing to the
           implementation o f the PRSP", would be revised to read "Public sector
           institutions supported by the project achieve increased capacity for
           efficient and accountable use o f public resources" (Public resources include
           both human and financial; Supported by the Project = directly benefit from
           project resources). See proposed Results Framework in annex 1. It i s
           expected that the simplification o f the project will enhance i t s clarity, make it
           easier to implement and for the Bank, enable a more targeted implementation
           within fixed resource constraints. A summary table indicating the original and
           proposed changes in the performance indicators i s provided in Annex 1.

   (ii) Transferring implementation responsibilities'for P F M Reforms and national
        Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) to M I N E C O F I N and for CSR to MIFOTRA,
          to increase ownership for implementation o f reforms;

                                               6
     (iii)Following the dissolution o f the current coordinating agency HIDA, removing
          this agency as coordinating agency in the Development Credit Agreement
          (DCA). Instead, it i s requested that the PSCBS be added as implementing entity,
          albeit with a reduced mandate.

     (iv) Changes in Implementation Arrangement: Adding MINECOFIN, MIFOTRA as
          well as the PSCBS as implementing agencies (the phasing in o f public entities
          as implementing entities had been envisioned in the PAD, and reflects an
          increase in key institutions' capacity); removing HRCBA from the project as it
          no longer exists (the DCA would stipulate that the HRCBA gets replaced by the
          PSCBS); changing project components and re-allocating credit proceeds across
          components as in annex 3;          and consequently reducing the number o f
          participating institutions to the Ministry o f Public Service and Labor
          (MIFOTM); Ministry o f Finance and Economic Planning (MINECOFIN); the
          newly established Public Sector Capacity Building Secretariat (PSCBS)
          (replacing the former coordinating agency, the Human Resources and
          Institutional Capacity Development Agency - HIDA); local training institutions
          related to Public Financial Management (PFM) and Civil Service Reform (CSR)
          such as the Rwanda Institute o f Administration and Management (RIAM) and
          the School o f Finance and Banking (SFB) and supporting establishment o f two
          to four professional institutions/associations. Local governments (provincial,
          district and sector) will be included in nation-wide trainings. Support to
          existing entities will be phased out, allowing contracts to continue to
          completion.

     (v)     Adjusting counterpart financing parameters to new country financing
             parameters allowing 100% financing for all expenditure categories4;

     (vi) Moving to the new "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA
          Credits" published in May 2004 revised in October lSt and "Guidelines:
                                                                    2006;
          Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers"

              allow the completion o f activities required to achieve the PDO. A one year
              extension would not be sufficient to achieve the project objectives and allow
              for the new implementing institutions to fully absorb their new mandate and
              develop capacity for efficient implementation. The team believes that the
              changes proposed during the restructuring, both in terms o f narrowing the

           scope o f the project and transferring implementation responsibility to
           ministries will have a highly beneficial impact on the implementation progress
           o f the project. The revised project description i s attached in annex 2.

Transition Arrangements

11.     T o ensure a smooth transition from the existing to the restructured project, the
Government and World Bank teams agreed that ongoing contracts would be continued.
This i s a reflection o f the fact that ongoing activities are valuable and that a narrower
focus be phased in over time. Contracts o f existing staff at HIDA (and i t s successor, the
PSCBS) will continue until December 3 1, 2009 and consulting contracts until their
completion. For clarity, a complete l i s t o f ongoing contracts i s provided in the agreed
action plan and budget and the procurement plan.

12.     On PFM, the Government has requested all development partners to contribute to
a basket fund to be effective starting January 2010. To comply with the Government's
request, the P F M component o f the restructured project may be set up as a contribution to
the basket fund. Implementation arrangements and activities are in line with the
Government's P F M Reform action plan which would also form the basis for the basket
fund. It i s expected that once the institutional arrangements for the basket fund have been
defined, AFTFM and AFTPC would carry out assessments o f the proposed structures.
Management approval would be sought on any resulting changes to the project.

Summary o f fiduciary capacity assessments for the restructured project

13. Both the procurement and financial management capacity assessments revealed weak
human, institutional and organizational capacity constraints, translating into substantial
overall risks in both areas. They also identified mitigating factors and action plan which
if implemented adequately would leave a moderate risk to the project. See Annexes 5 and
6. GoR has started implementing most o f the action points recommended here to ensure
they are addressed before approval o f the restructured project.

Analysis

14.     None o f the proposed changes will have a major effect on the original economic,
financial, technical, or social aspects o f the project as appraised; nor will they raise the
environmental category o f the project or trigger new safeguard policies. A re-appraisal
will therefore not be needed. Finally, the proposed changes will involve no exceptions to
Bank policies.

 15.    The proposed restructuring does impact the institutional set up o f the project by
altering the implementation arrangements. This i s done to reduce the complexity o f
project implementation, ensure direct accountability for project activities by
implementing institutions and therefore enhance project implementation. Detailed
implementation arrangements are summarized in annex 3.



                                             8
Expected Outcomes

16.     The proposed changes to the PDO and results framework will help to simplify and
focus the project, enhancing i t s clarity and making it more manageable. This
simplification represents an evolution in the policy dialogue as well as a maturing o f key
reforms such as P F M and CSR within Government. The proposed results framework
reduces the number o f indicators from 22 to 8 that reflect the new focus o f the project but
also because some indicators proved difficult to measure and were removed.

Benefits and Risks

17.     Benefits: The benefits o f the proposed changes are that government ownership
will be increased, implementation capacity with implementing institutions will be
strengthened and implementation speed will pick up.

18.    R i s k s : A number o f risks identified in the initial project design did not materialize
or were successfully mitigated: GoR commitment to the MSCBP and associated reform
agenda remained strong; there was no resistance to reform from ministries, departments
and agencies and contributions through other development partners (notably the Belgian
Technical Cooperation, the United Kingdom's Department for International Development
(DfID) and the European Commission, in addition to the Afiican Capacity Building
Foundation which prepared their support in parallel to the PSCBP) meant adequate
financing was available.

 19.    The one risk that did materialize would be addressed through the restructuring:
"lack o f capacity to implement the agency performance fund, loss o f focus through ad-
hoc requests as well as weak program coordination". It turned out that the issue was not
so much a lack o f skills but the implementing arrangements which diffused the
accountability between the ministries to benefit from capacity building support and the
coordinating agency. Hence the restructured project would be implemented directly by
ministries while the PSCBS would help resolve policy implementation differences across
the different aspects o f public sector reform, aggregate annual reports and carry-out
periodic assessments o f public sector capacity building in the country.

20.    The following table presents the new risks facing the restructured project:

                                               CSR.

Implementation Support Strategy

2 1. Considering that the project has disbursed only 45% o f i t s total allocation over a five
year period and that i t s overall implementation progress was rated moderately
unsatisfactory, the team i s taking the approach o f a very close implementation support. At
least two implementation support missions will be carried each year, jointly with other
development partners active in the areas o f PFM and CSR. To help maximize the impact,
the implementation support missions will be organized to coincide with, or slightly
before the bi-annual joint GoR-DPs budget support reviews held around April and

                                              10
September each year. More targeted and regular implementation support missions will be
carried out, taking advantage o f the fact that the Country Office based team i s now able
to cover major PFM and CSR areas. Support will also be provided by Head Quarters
based colleagues on areas requiring specialist skills such as IFMIS, and depending on
issues to be addressed, these resources will be sought whether during the general
April/September reviews or during targeted implementation support missions. To help lift
the project from a problem project status to a project that achieves its PDO, the team will
make a case for adequate implementation support budget commensurate with problems at
hand.

                   Annex 2: Revised Detailed Project Description
                PUBLIC SECTOR CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT

Project Description

 1.      The PSCBP i s designed to support key government reforms in public financial
management, national monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and civil service reform and
contributes to public sector reform coordination. Capacity building as understood under
the project targets three spheres o f intervention, namely individuals, organizations and
institutions, understood as rules o f the game.

2.       The implementing entities will be MINECOFIN (Ministry o f Finance and
Economic Planning), M I F O T R A (Ministry o f Public Service and Labor) and the Public
Sector Capacity Building Secretariat (PSCBS). As part o f implementation o f reforms, all
central government institutions, provinces, districts and sectors as well as local training
institutions in these reform areas will benefit from project interventions.

Components Description

3.     The PSCBP will contribute to capacity building o f the public sector in four
important ways:

Component I : Public Financial Management (US$ 6.61 million)

4.      Component 1 seeks to contribute to improved capacity o f budget agencies to
manage public finances and reporting. To this end, it will support the implementation o f
Rwanda's Integrated Financial Management Information System SmartFMS in all
ministries and some local governments, build capacity o f government accountants and
auditors through the Rwanda Expertise Scheme for Accountants and Internal Auditors
and through support to the creation o f Rwandan/East African professional associations o f
public sector accountants/internal auditors/ budget managerdfinance officers etc. and
strengthen the capacity o f local training institutions to deliver high quality P F M related
training. Similarly, the project will train government procurement officers, support the
establishment o f a professional institute for procurement professionals, support the
Rwanda Public Procurement Authority to transition from prior reviews to purely
regulatory functions and strengthen the capacity o f local training institutions to deliver
high quality training in public procurement. The Bank will consider transforming
component 1 into a basket funding arrangement once the Government and development
partners have agreed upon institutional arrangements and content.

Component 2: National Monitoring and Evaluation (US$ 0.69 million)

5.     This component will support the implementation o f the Government's national
M&E system that monitors progress in achieving Economic Development and Poverty
Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) indicators. It would finance training and capacity building
events o f government M&E officers, support review o f the current Management


                                             23
Information System at sector levels and develop or customize single software that can be
mainstreamed in all sectors to help them in timely reporting.

Component 3: Civil Service Reform (US$4.31 million)

6.       Component 3 seeks to contribute to improved capacity o f public sector
institutions to manage and develop civil servants. To this end, it will support the
implementation o f the draft c i v i l service management policy, including amending legal
texts impacted by the new policy and dissemination and training in the new policy. It
will support the finalization and operationalization o f the Integrated Pay and Personnel
Information System (IPPIS) through provision o f technical assistance, equipment and
workshops. The project i s supporting functional reviews in 37 public agencies and will
also support the implementation o f findings from these reviews and the dissemination o f
service delivery directories, providing citizens with the information they need to access

                                                                              I




effectively implement and coordinate civil service reforms across government and ensure
linkages with related public sector reforms, including training, technical assistance and
rapid results initiatives.

Component 4: Public Sector Reform Coordination (US$1.32 million)

8.      Coordination o f capacity building and reform efforts are vital to the effectiveness
o f public sector reforms. The project will therefore support fiduciary staff and an M&E
specialist at the PSCBS which Government has put in place to ensure technical
coordination o f public sector reforms. The PSCBS will also be supported to issue an
"Annual Report on the State o f Capacity Building" in the country. In addition,
government has expressed interest in establishing an inter-ministerial public sector
reform coordination committee. If and once that mechanism i s established the project will
finance a public sector reform coordinator to facilitate the establishment, functioning and
strategic direction o f such mechanism.

9.     Support provided under the PSCBP will take the form o f training, workshops,
technical assistance and related equipment.

       The proposed implementation arrangements comprise three implementing entities.
          The Ministry o f Finance and Economic Planning (MINECOFIN) will be in
          charge o f component 1 on Public Financial Management Reforms and
          component 2 on national Monitoring and Evaluation. The Bank will consider
          transforming component 1 into a basket funding arrangement once the
          Government and development partners have agreed upon institutional

       .  arrangements and content;
          The Ministry o f Public Service and Labor (MIFOTRA) would be in charge o f

       .  component 3 on C i v i l Service Reforms;
          The Public Sector Capacity Building Secretariat would be in charge o f
          component 4, public sector reform coordination.

2.      Each implementing institution would be fully accountable to IDA for the funds
allocated to them, including:

           Implementation (including drafting TOR, managing consultants, applying
           outputs towards reforms)
           Carrying out procurement (including preparing procurement plans and
           submitting them to IDA for no objection)
           Ensuring financial management (maintaining their separate account;
           submitting FMRs directly to IDA)
           Preparing annual work plans and submit to IDA for no objection
           Preparing annual reports and monitoring the results indicators related to their

        SUMMARY

1.     This report i s a record o f the results o f the assessment o f the financial
management (FM) arrangements o f the restructured Rwanda Public Sector Capacity
Building Project (PSCBP) PO66386 (Cr. 3955) in response to concerns o f a low
disbursement rate and a changed institutional environment for project implementation.

2.       The objective o f the assessment i s to determine whether: (a) the financial
management u n i t s o f the implementing institutions have adequate financial management
arrangements to ensure funds will be used for purposes intended in an efficient and
economical way; (b) the implementing institutions financial reports will be prepared in
an accurate, reliable and timely manner; (c) arrangements exist for an independent audit
o f the sources and uses o f funds; and (d) that the implementing institutions' assets funded
with the PSCBP funding will be safeguarded.

3.     The FM assessment was carried out for MINECOFIN and MIFOTRA in
accordance with the Financial Management Practices Manual issued by the Financial
Management Sector Board on April, 2009.

4.       The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) prepared in 2005
documented the evaluation o f the Public Financial Management (PFM) environment in
Rwanda. It revealed that despite continuing weaknesses in the P F M system, the
Government has made tremendous strides towards improving accountability. The
adoption o f the Organic Budget L a w (OBL) and o f accompanying financial instructions
and continuing efforts to adapt Government's institutional arrangements are some o f the
tokens o f government resolve to strengthen P F M in the country. There i s evidence o f
government action to address issues identified in previous reports. The budget
preparation process has been strengthened with the introduction o f the MTEF. The
process is much more structured, with increased levels o f stakeholder participation,
particularly o f civil society and development partners. The achievements culminated in
the preparation o f the first set o f consolidated financial statements for the year ended
2006 and subsequently those o f 2007 which lead to a comprehensive review by the Office
o f the Auditor General o f the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 2006
and those o f 2007 presented to parliament in February 2009. Inadequate support o f
expenditure, non compliance with the reporting requirement o f the OBL and poor
preparation o f financial reports s t i l l remained the significant shortcomings in most
entities audited and hence the underlying weaknesses in PFM.

5.     Notwithstanding the recent progress, continuing weaknesses in the financial
accounting and auditing systems pose a major fiduciary risk. The biggest challenge
facing Government i s the severe human resource capacity constraint. The ability to attract


                                            30
and retain technically trained and qualified financial management personnel i s central to
the sustainability o f P F M reforms.

6.       The Government has adopted a number o f measures to address the shortcomings
indicated above. These mainly center on the creation o f suitable capacity to implement
the provisions o f the new legal and regulatory framework, ensuring the availability o f
sufficient guidance to P F M personnel, and commencing the regular preparation o f
financial statements. The Government has taken measures to enhance the procedures for
budget preparation (strengthening the alignment o f budgets with strategies) and the
control over i t s treasury resources. The Government carried out a needs assessment that
identified the financial management skills required in government, including accountants
and internal auditors. The Government has embarked o n a recruitment exercise to fill the
vacancies in this area. Workshops have been conducted for the existing personnel and
programs for annual refresher courses have been suggested in the P F M reforms. The roles
o f the audit institutions have been clarified to remove previously existing redundancies.
The Government has adopted International Public Sector Accounting Standards for
accounting and financial reporting.

INSTITUTIONAL AND IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS


9.       The proposed implementation arrangements comprise three implementing entities.
M I F O T R A would be in charge o f CSR; MINECOFIN o f P F M and national M&E
reforms; and the Public Sector Capacity Building Secretariat in charge o f coordination.
Each implementing institution would be fully accountable to IDA for the funds allocated
to them and will have implementation and financial reporting responsibilities.

BUDGETINGARRANGEMENTS

 10.    The budgeting arrangements are documented in the financial instructions
developed alongside the Organic Budget L a w issued by M I N E C O F I N in 2007. Budget
analysis will be conducted to ensure budget variances are addressed in an adequate and
timely manner.

ACCOUNTINGARRANGEMENTS

Books o f Accounts

11.     Adequate books o f accounts which shall include ledgers, journals and the various
registers will be maintained by the FM Specialist dedicated to PSCBS. The accounting

                                                      38
system documented in the financial instructions developed alongside the Organic Budget
L a w issued by M I N E C O F I N in 2007 will be used to track, record, analyze and
summarize the financial transactions o f all implementing institutions. The implementing
institutions' accounts will be prepared o n a cash basis in accordance with International
Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), the amended credit agreement, and the
laws and regulations in Rwanda. The accounting systems will allow for the proper
recording o f project's financial transactions, including the allocation o f expenditures in
accordance with i t s components, disbursement categories, and sources o f funds.
Appropriate controls over the preparation and approval o f transactions should be put in
place to ensure that all transactions are correctly made, recorded, and reported upon.

Staffing arrangements

12.      The financial management units (directorates) will be strengthened by recruiting
an accountant for M I N E C O F I N and M I F O T R A while the PSCBS will fill the vacant post
o f FM Specialist who will also provide coaching support to accountants at M I N E C O F I N
and MIFOTRA. They will report to the respective steering committees within the
institutions. The Director o f Finance o f each implementing agency will maintain the
responsibility for the preparation and submission o f the un-audited Interim Financial
Reports (IFR) to the World Bank within 45 days from the end o f the quarter in the
formats prescribed by the World Bank.

13.     The key staff members identified to support the implementation arrangement that
will account for the Credit funds will include:-

   0  The executive secretary o f the PSCBS assisted by i t s Technical Steering
Committee,
  0   The Finance Director o f the Implementing institutions
  0   The accountants

Information systems

Both implementing institutions will continue to use SAGE PASTEL software to maintain
i t s books o f accounts. The software has been successfully implemented by GOR as a
stop gap measure before the implementation o f the Integrated Financial Management
Information System while the Secretariat will continue to use Tompro-accounting
systems.

        MONITORING REPORTING
FINANCIAL       AND

Accounting and Reportinghnterim Financial Reports:

 14.    To enhance financial reporting, each implementing institution will be responsible
for the preparation o f quarterly un-audited Interim Financial Reports (IFR) submitted to
the World Bank within 45 days from the end quarter being reported. This i s a departure
from the previous reporting arrangement where PSCBP was responsible for the

                                              39
consolidated reporting o f the credit and where weakness attributed to high staff turnover
had hampered adequate reporting arrangements. All the implementing institutions have
agreed o n the formats, content, and frequency prescribed by the World Bank.

AUDIT ARRANGEMENTS

 15.    Human Resources and Institutional Capacity Development Agency (HIDA) has
maintained to date a satisfactory Audit Reporting compliance in accordance with the
provision o f section 4.01 (b) (ii) f the financial covenants o f the D C A . However,
                                      o
following i t s dissolution and subsequent removal as the coordinating agency in the
Development Credit Agreement (DCA); and the transfer implementation responsibilities
for P F M Reforms and national Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) to MINECOFIN and
for CSR to MIFOTRA, to increase ownership for implementation o f reforms; each
implementing institutions will be responsible for the audit arrangements o f IDA funds.
They shall separately obtain a consent letter o f audit from the Office o f the Auditor
General to conduct the audit or appoint other satisfactory external auditors for audits o f
the Project financial statements within a month o f effectiveness. An annual audit report
including a management report will be submitted to the IDA within six months following
the end o f each financial year. The Auditor General will provide a single opinion o n the
implementing institutions designated accounts and statements o f expenditures. The AG
will be required to carry out a comprehensive review o f the implementing institutions
internal control procedures and provide a management report outlining any
recommendations for their improvement. Terms o f Reference containing the audit scope
to ensure the efficient use o f funds for intended purpose and state whether the audit has
been conducted in accordance with International Standards in Auditing has been agreed
with the implementing institutions.

INTERNAL CONTROL A D INTERNAL AUDIT
                  N

Internal Controls

16.     The implementing institutions internal controls are documented in the financial
instructions developed alongside the Organic Budget L a w issued by M I N E C O F I N in
2007. These constitute basic principles designed to ensure that the accounting records are
complete, relevant and reliable and that accounting practices are followed consistently.
They will be used by: (i) to assess the acceptability o f the accounting, reporting and
                          IDA
Internal Control Systems under the implementing institutions; (ii)    staff as a reference
manual; and (iii) the auditors to assess their accounting systems and controls and in
                  by
designing specific audit procedures.

17.     Specific aspects to be covered in the Financial Management manual include: (i)
flow o f funds; (ii)                                     i i accounting system (including
                    financial and accounting policies; ( i )
centers for maintenance o f accounting records, Chart o f Accounts, formats o f books and
records, accounting and financial procedures); (iv) procedures for authorization o f
transactions, budgeting, and financial forecasting; (v) financial reporting (including



                                            40
formats o f reports, linkages with Chart o f Accounts and procedures for reviewing
financial information); (vi) auditing arrangements; and (vii) aspects o f human resources.

Internal Auditor

 18.    Internal auditors, staff o f the Chief Internal Audit office participating in capacity
building activities outlined in the PFM strategy will conduct reviews which will include
ex post verification o f expenditure eligibility, as well as physical inspection o f works and
goods acquired by the implementing institutions. The findings and recommendations of
the Internal Auditors will be used to improve its implementation in areas related to
financial management and procurement. Internal audits will be carried out in accordance
with the Internal Audit Charter published in June 2008, which lays down internationally
accepted audit standards. Audits are performed on the basis o f an agreed six months
action plan.

Funds Flow:

Disbursements arrangements and methods

 19.     Following the dissolution and subsequent removal o f HIDA as the coordinating
agency in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA), and the transfer o f implementation
responsibilities for PFM Reforms and national Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) to
MINECOFIN and for CSR to MIFOTRA, to increase ownership for implementation of
reforms, each implementing institution will its own DA, thus the restructuring would
increase the number o f DAs from one to three. Each implementing institution will
receive disbursements from PSCBP Funds on the basis o f incurred eligible expenditures
(transaction-based disbursements). Upon effectiveness o f the amended Credit agreement,
an initial advance ("Advance" method) will be disbursed from the proceeds o f the Credit
and will be deposited into Designated Accounts (DA) operated by each implementing
institution departing from the single designated account held under HIDA to expedite
project implementation. Actual expenditures will be reimbursed ("Reimbursement"
method) through submission o f Withdrawal Applications (at least monthly) supported by
Statements o f Expenditures (SOE). The implementing institutions will also be allowed to
use the Direct Payment method, whereby payments may be made directly to third parties
(e.g. a supplier, contractor, and consultant) at the Recipient's request. They may also use
as a disbursement method for withdrawing proceeds o f the Credit the Special
Commitment method. Under this method, payments may be made to third parties for
eligible expenditures under special commitment entered into, in writing, at the
implementing institutions' request and on terms and conditions agreed with IDA.

Types o Supporting Documentation
       f

20.    Disbursements will be supported with: (i)        Statement o f Expenditures (SOE)
summarizing eligible expenditures paid during a stated period for amounts below the
SOE documentation threshold specified in the Disbursement Letter; and (ii)           records
evidencing eligible expenditures (e.g., copies o f receipts, supplier invoices) for all other


                                             41
amounts. In all cases, the implementing institutions will be responsible for retaining the
original documents evidencing eligible expenditures and making them available for audit
or inspection.

21.    The Designated Account (DA) ceiling will be established by the Project
Disbursement Letter assuring enough cash-flow to permit normal Project operation

22.      The accounts signatories will be documented in the disbursement letter.
Authorized signatories for withdrawal applications will be designated by the
M I N E C O F I N in an Authorized Signatory Letter.

CONCLUSION OF THE ASSESSMENT

23.     The Financial Management arrangement above indicates that they satisfy the
Bank's minimum requirements under O P B P 10.02. The implementing institutions will
ensure the FM action plan i s implemented by the dates stipulated in this annex as part o f
strengthening their financial arrangements to provide reasonable assurance that the funds
will be used for the intended purpose.

IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT PLAN

24.     Implementation support missions will be conducted every year in line with the
risk rating for each implementing institutions and based o n the mitigation factors in the
design o f the revised Financial Management Assessment (FMA). The objective o f the
Implementation support missions will be to ensure that strong financial management

                                            42
systems are maintained for the Implementing Institutions. Reviews will be carried out
regularly to ensure that expenditures incurred by them remain eligible. The
Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR) for the implementing Institutions will
include a Financial Management rating for the FM component and will be arrived at by
the Financial Management Specialist after an appropriate review.

                  Annex 6: Revised Procurement Arrangements
               PUBLIC SECTOR CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT

Procurement Environment

1.      A Country Procurement Issues Paper (CPIP) was prepared for Rwanda in June
2004. The main recommendations made in the CPIP were incorporated in an action plan
for procurement reform, which was discussed with and adopted by the Government o f
Rwanda (GOR). Although GOR has followed acceptable procurement practices under the
National Tender Board (NTB), the legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks need to
be modernized to bring the national procurement system up to international standards as
developed by OECD-DAC. Some actions that have already been undertaken to this end
include the following: (a) a new procurement code was adopted in April 2007; (b) the
legal text establishing the Rwanda Public Procurement Authority (RPPA) has been
adopted and was published in March 2008; and (c) templates for standard bidding
documents were adopted and published on RPPA website. However, other actions are
either ongoing or not yet completed such as: (a) the implementation o f the procurement
code which i s not yet complete; (b) some institutions that were created under the
procurement code have not yet been established; (c) audit for better control o f the
procurement system has not yet been implemented; (d) members o f appeals mechanisms
have been appointed but not yet trained in procurement; and (e) procurement guides and
manuals have not yet been developed and disseminated. Since there are a number o f
outstanding actions to be undertaken, the procurement risk i s rated substantial.

Procurement Procedures

2.      The restructured project will follow procurement procedures in accordance with
the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits"
published in May 2004 revised in October 1'` 2006; and "Guidelines: Selection and
Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" published in M a y 2004 revised
in October 1'` 2006, and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The general
description o f various items under different expenditure categories are described below.
The procurement plan will describe the procurement methods or consultant selection
methods to be used, the need for prequalification, estimated costs, prior review
requirements, and time frame o f the various steps as agreed between GOR and the Bank.
The Procurement Plan will be updated at least semi-annually or as required to reflect the
actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity.

3.     Procurement o Goods: Goods procured under the restructured project would
                       f
include office equipment/furniture, computing equipment and software. Goods will be
procured using the following procurement methods: (a) international competitive bidding
for contracts estimated to cost more than US$300,000 equivalent; (b) national
competitive bidding for contracts o f valued at more than US$30,000 equivalent but less
than US$300,000 equivalent; and (c) shopping for contracts estimated to cost less than
US$30,000 equivalent. In situations and circumstances that are in compliance with the
provisions o f paragraph 3.6 o f the Guidelines for procurement, direct contracting may be
used with Bank prior review.

                                           44
4.     Procurement o non-consulting services. Non-consulting services such as
                     f
production and dissemination o f information through radio, print and television will
follow procurement procedures acceptable to IDA. These activities will be described in
the Operations Manual as reviewed and found acceptable by IDA.

5.      Selection o consultants.
                     f                 Consulting services to be procured under the
restructured project include consultancies for: (a) improvement o f the capacity o f budget
agencies in managing public finances and reporting; (b) development and establishment
o f a national monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system; (c) improvement o f the capacity
o f public sector institutions to manage and develop civil servants; and (d) support to the
coordination functions o f the Public Sector Capacity Building Secretariat (PSCBS).

6.     Contracts for consulting assignments estimated to cost US$200,000 equivalent or
more would be procured through Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS). However,
contracts for services estimated to cost less than US$ 100,000 equivalent per contract
may be procured under contracts based on Consultants Qualifications (CQS) in
accordance with the provisions o f paragraphs 3.1 and 3.7 o f the Consultant Guidelines.

7.     Financial and technical audits estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent
may be procured under Least Cost Selection (LCS) in accordance with the provisions o f
3.1 and 3.6 o f the Consultant Guidelines. Consultant for services meeting the
requirements o f Section V o f the Consultant Guidelines may be selected under the
provisions for the Selection o f Individual Consultants (IC).

8.      Single source selection may be used exceptionally in accordance with paragraph
3.9 to 3.12 o f the Consultant Guidelines.

9.      To ensure that priority i s given to the identification o f suitable and qualified
national consultants, short-lists for contracts estimated under US$ 100,000 equivalent
may be comprised entirely o f national consultants (in accordance with the provisions o f
paragraph 2.7 o f the Consultant Guidelines), provided that a sufficient number o f
qualified f i r m s (at least six) are available at competitive costs.

10.     Training, workshops, conference attendance and study tours would be carried out
on the basis o f an approved annual work program that would identify the general
framework o f training or similar activities for the year, including the nature o f
traininghtudy tours/workshops, number o f participants, and estimated cost.

11.     Operating costs. Operating costs to be funded under the restructured project
include the non-consulting services plus per diem, implementation support cost, and
salaries o f locally recruited consultants. These costs shall exclude salaries, bonuses, and
fees for government civil servants. These expenses would be procured using procedures
acceptable to IDA and would be described in the Operations Manual.

12.    Advertising. Procedures for placing advertisements will follow the Guidelines
Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers described in
paragraph. 2.5 and the Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits.

With regard to Direct Contracting and NCB, publication o f contract awards may be done
in aggregate form on a quarterly basis. All consultants competing for the assignment
involving the submission o f separate technical and financial proposals, irrespective o f the
estimated contract value, should be informed o f the result o f the technical evaluation
(number o f points that each firm received) before the opening o f the financial proposals.
GOR will be required to offer debriefings to unsuccessful bidders and consultants, should
such a debriefing be requested.

14.     Fraud and corruption. The procuring entity as well as bidders, suppliers, and
contractors shall observe the highest standard o f ethics during the procurement and
execution o f contracts financed under the restructured project, in accordance with
paragraphs 1.14 and 1.15 o f the Procurement Guidelines; paragraphs 1.22 and 1.23 o f the
Consultants' Guidelines and with the Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud and
Corruption in,Projects Financed by IBRD loans and IDA credits and Grants dated
October 15,2006.

15.    Procurement implementation arrangement. The roles and responsibilities for
implementation o f procurement activities will be described in detail in the revised
procurement annex o f the Program Operations Manual (POM).                  The roles and
responsibilities in the procurement o f the institutions to be involved in coordination and
implementation o f the restructured project are described below:

16.    The Public Sector Capacity Building Secretariat (PSCBS) will be responsible for:
(i)ensuring that the implementation described in the O M are revised and approved by the
Public Sector Capacity Building Technical Steering Committee; (ii)     ensuring that the
implementation guidelines are fully disseminated and understood by ministries, agencies
and commissions (MACs) receiving project funds through skills strengthening and
acquisition o f required systems; (iii) gathering and consolidating approved annual
procurement plans o f approved action plans, (iv) preparing the GPN and its annual
updates and (v) ensuring that independent technical audits o f the program, including
procurement reviews, are conducted on a regular basis.

17.     Implementing entities will be responsible in managing procurement o f contracts
for activities in the annual program that have been approved by their respective Steering
Committees. Participating MACs will be responsible for: (i)   preparing and updating their
annual procurement plans and transmitting the same for clearance to IDA; (ii)      drafting
and publishing Specific Procurement Notices (SPNs); ( i ) i i drafting bidding documents;
(iv) issuing and evaluating bids and proposals; (v) requesting RPPA "no objection" when
required; (vi) requesting IDA "no objection" when required (PSCBS will review at least
during the first year o f implementation); (vii) drafting contracts and ensuring that
contracts are managed properly; (viii) keeping proper filing systems; (ix) facilitating the

                                            46
execution o f independent financial and technical audits and post reviews that are
conducted by the RPPA, Office o f the Auditor General and IDA.

18.    Public Sector Capacity Building Secretariat (PSCBS). The PSCBP will
continue to finance one Procurement Management Specialist at the PSCBS - the
Specialist who i s currently managing procurement activities at HIDA. She has
substantive experience and i s familiar with the agreed procurement procedures to be
followed under the restructured project. The Procurement Management Specialist will be
charged with handling procurement activities at the PSCBS but more importantly, with
coaching and mentoring procurement staff at MIFOTRA and MINECOFIN.

19.    A procurement capacity assessment was conducted for MINECOFIN and
MIFOTRA. The findings o f the procurement capacity assessment that was conducted
around the end o f calendar year 2008 for MINECOFIN are described below:

          Although the technical secretariat has been established, the existing structure
          o f MINECOFIN does not allow for an efficient procurement process to evolve
          particularly with respect to procedures related to selection o f consulting firms.
          The procurement unit handles many different tasks and the existing staff are
          not very experienced. The unit handles mostly simple procurement activities
          such as shopping. Furthermore, according to the letter issued by the Minister
          o f Public Service and Labor, the post o f procurement officer should be added
          to the organizational charter o f each Public Service. However, the current
          assessment revealed that this has not yet been implemented by MINECOFIN.
          The implication i s that the procurement function experiences a number o f
          limitations as described above.

          The procurement officer to be housed at MINECOFIN for the project i s under
          recruitment. Although existing personnel have attended a logistics course at
          RIAM, it will take time before they can use the knowledge acquired. As such,
          it i s important to finalize the recruitment o f the procurement officer as soon as
          possible;

          The required record-keeping and filing system and adequate expertise to
          manage it are not yet in place;

          The existing capacity to meet the Bank's procurement reporting requirements
          and adequate procurement planning practices and monitoring control systems
          are limited; and

20.    The procurement capacity o f MINECOFIN will be re-assessed as soon as the
additional procurement officer i s o n board and fully functional.

21.  The findings o f the procurement capacity assessment that was conducted on
November 28,2008 for MIFOTRA are described below:



                                            47
      (i)       The C i v i l Service Reform Steering Committee i s not yet in place;

      (ii) The procurement officer at MIFOTRA to be assigned to the restructured
           project has limited capacity in handling relatively complex procurement
           packages such as those in the restructured project. The procurement officer
           handles simple procurement activities (i.e. shopping) such as arranging venues
           o f workshops and seminars, hiring I T maintenance companies, buying office
           stationery, arranging transports, etc. Furthermore, the procurement unit
                undertakes too many ad hoc tasks. The other procurement personnel also
                lacks the required experience to handle relatively complex procurement such
                as the selection o f f i r m s or procurement o f large quantities o f goods that
                require international competition;

      ( i ) Although existing personnel have attended a logistics course at RIAM, it will
       ii
                take time before they can use the knowledge acquired;

      (iv)      The record-keeping and filing system is fairly adequate and could be
                effectively utilized with some adjustments;

      (v)       The procurement planning and monitoring control systems at M I F O T R A need
                some improvement. For example, it was noted that the executed contracts
                were not in accordance with plans. This could affect their ability in managing
                procurement activities in the restructured project. In addition, administrative
                and technical staffs are not fully sensitized o n the importance o f acceptable
                procurement practices especially with respect to understanding the importance
                o f advance planning and conducting a transparent procurement process.

22.     Since the existing structure o f M I F O T R A i s not completely adequate the capacity
will be re-assessed after a procurement officer and procurement assistant have been
recruited.

23.          The overall procurement risk assessment rating i s "substantial".

24.          The table below summarizes the actions that need to be taken by GOR:

      Contracts related to recurrent activities (Le. hiring venue and
      seminars facilities, maintenance for I T equipment, office stationery
      etc.) at MIFOTRA, MINECOFIN and the PSCBS should be                     MIFOTRA         continuous
      organized as a batch. This would allow effective competition and
      also reduce transaction costs.
