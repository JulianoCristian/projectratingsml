The project consists of: (a)\n            the development of 38 ha of land,construction of buildings\n            and auxiliary infrastructure for industry; (b) construction\n            of a power distribution line to the project site; (c)\n            technical assistance for international promotion; (d)\n            rehabilitation and widening of a road from the project site\n            to the port connecting highway; (e) construction of a water\n            transmission main from an existing treatment plant; and (f)\n            construction and equipping of a small training center.\n            Achievement of project benefits is dependent upon adequate\n            demand by industries for space in the proposed export\n            processing zone (EPZ). Cartagena's comparative\n            advantages should ensure that even with reduced\n            international demand for space in EPZs, a substantial\n            portion of project benefits would be achieved."}, "docdt": "1978-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
