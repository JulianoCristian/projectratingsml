       Bank (UCB), of: about 20 coffee factories, 12 cotton\n            ginneries; smallholder tea leaf collection facilities for\n            the Uganda Tea Growers' Corporation (UTGC); tobacco\n            curing barns; and processing facilities of non-traditional\n            exports; (b) provision of imports, in line with the\n            Government's Recovery Program 1982-84, required to\n            sustain and increase the production of agricultural exports\n            and livestock; (c) strengthening of the Government's\n            pricing and resource allocation mechanisms by establishing\n            and staffing an Agricultural Secretariat; and (d) improving\n            marketing for coffee, cotton, and non-traditional export\n            crops, including livestock, through detailed studies of\n            their instutional framework and policy prerequisites."}, "docdt": "1983-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
