1. Prior Review Threshold:
         Selection Method                                    Prior Review Threshold   Comments
1.       Competitive Methods (firms)                         >US$100,000              If contract affects downstream consultancy work being financed by
                                                                                      the World Bank, selection of the firm will be subject to prior

2. Shortlist comprising entirely of national consultant firms for contracts value less than US$100,000 per contract: None is expected.

3. There may be some procurement packages eligible for retroactive financing (if requested by Government ).
The Package Reference Numbers # 3, 5 and 14 under Section II, and the recruitment of a few project management individual consultants under
Section III, e.g. Implementation Advisor, Finance Officer, procurement and construction staff, and translators.


IV. Implementing Agency Capacity Building Activities with Time Schedule

Capacity is adequate in MoEYS for implementing IDA-financed projects. This Project is built on the model of FERP and EQIP in terms of school construction and
procurement of furniture using NCB, quotation and community participation as well as procuring of goods and hiring of consultant services. The only exception is
the three educational/instructional materials packages using ICB procedures, which may be unfamiliar to MoEYS staff. A basic procurement training highlighting
revised policies of the new Guidelines dated May 2004 for both goods and works and consultant services was conducted during the project Pre-Appraisal mission.
Specific procurement training for the Project, including ICB procedures, will be conducted by the World Bank procurement team during Project Negotiations and
Project Launch missions. A Project Implementation Plan (PIP) agreed by the Bank, with details of each procurement method's steps and the provision of various
model bidding documents, will serve as the project procurement manual along with the Community Contracting Operational Manual and the Scholarship Scheme
Operational Manual.

V. Certification Requirement of Selection Committee Members for All Procurement Activities

In order to avoid conflict of interest and to conduct procurement selection fairly, all Selection Committee members should sign a certification confirming that they
are not associated with any of the bidders and that they have carried out their responsibilities during the procurement process to the best of their professional ability
without any regard to external factors or influences.
