Abstract


         Increasing the schooling attainment of girls is a challenge in much of the developing world. In

this paper we evaluate the impact of a program that gives scholarships to girls making the transition

between the last year of primary school and the first year of secondary school in Cambodia. We show

that the scholarship program had a large, positive effect on the school enrollment and attendance of girls.

Our preferred set of estimates suggest program effects on enrollment and attendance at program schools

of 30 to 43 percentage points; scholarship recipients were also more likely to be enrolled at any school

(not just program schools) by a margin of 22 to 33 percentage points. The impact of the JFPR program

appears to have been largest among girls with the lowest socioeconomic status at baseline. The results we

present are robust to a variety of controls for observable differences between scholarship recipients and

non-recipients, to unobserved heterogeneity across girls, and to selective attrition out of the sample.

1.       Introduction


         Increasing the schooling attainment of girls is a challenge in much of the developing world. In a

large number of countries, especially in the Middle East and parts of Asia and Africa, overall education

for girls is low, and lags significantly behind that of boys. Nonetheless, over 180 governments have

adopted universal primary education and gender parity in schooling as Millennium Development Goals.

These commitments notwithstanding, there is surprisingly little evidence on policies and programs that

effectively raise school attainment, including for girls (see the reviews by Glewwe 2002; Case 2004).


         In this paper we evaluate the impact of a program designed to increase the enrollment of girls in

secondary school in Cambodia. Cambodia is recovering from many years of internal and external strife.

The Khmer Rouge regime of the 1970s and Vietnamese occupation in the 1980s had severe repercussions

for all aspects of the economy and society, including the education sector (see De Walque 2004). Most

Cambodian children attend some schooling, but a large share complete only very few grades. According

to the 2000 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), 85 percent of 15 to 19 year olds had completed

grade 1 while only 27 percent had completed grade 7, the first year of lower secondary. These

percentages are lower for rural areas, 83 and 21 respectively, and lower yet for rural girls, 78 and 17

respectively (Filmer 2005). To address these problems, the Cambodian government has initiated a series

of reforms in the education sector, including scholarship programs for students from disadvantaged

backgrounds.


         The program we evaluate is the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) scholarship program.

This program selected 93 lower secondary schools and, within each of these schools, approximately 45
girls who were beginning 7th grade were awarded scholarships of USD45 each. The value of the

scholarship is large--in 2002, mean per capita GDP in Cambodia was approximately USD300 (World

Bank 2005). Once a girl is selected for a JFPR scholarship, she is automatically eligible to continue

receiving a scholarship for the three years of the lower secondary cycle. The JFPR program therefore

attempts to increase the fraction of girls who make the transition from primary school to lower secondary

school, and to encourage girls to complete the lower secondary school cycle. In 2003/04, there were 698

lower secondary schools in Cambodia, so the JFPR scholarship program covered approximately 15

percent of lower secondary schools in the country.

        Although the JFPR program is known as a "scholarship" program, it does not directly subsidize

the fees paid by parents for the education of their daughters; rather, families receive cash transfers

provided their daughter is enrolled in school, maintains a passing grade, and is absent without "good
reason" fewer than 10 days in a year.1 The JFPR program therefore functions much like a "conditional

cash transfer" (CCT) program of the sort that has been implemented in many Latin American countries.

CCT programs in Latin America have been carefully analyzed--see for example, Schultz (2004) and

Behrman, Sengupta and Todd (2005) on the PROGRESA program (now re-named Oportunidades) in

Mexico, Bourguignon, Ferreira and Leite (2003) on the Bolsa Escola program (now re-named Bolsa

Familia) in Brazil, and the reviews by Rawlings and Rubio (2005) and Das, Do, and Ozler (2005). In this

paper we assess the impact of a similar program in a context with much lower income, lower enrollment

rates, and weaker institutions.


        As we show below, the JFPR scholarship program had a large, positive effect on the school

enrollment and attendance of girls in Cambodia. Our preferred set of estimates suggest program effects

on enrollment and attendance at program schools of 30 to 43 percentage points; scholarship recipients

were also more likely to be enrolled at any school (not just program schools) by a margin of 22 to 33

percentage points. The impact of the JFPR program appears to have been largest among girls with the

lowest socioeconomic status at baseline. The results we present are robust to a variety of controls for

observable differences between scholarship recipients and non-recipients, to unobserved heterogeneity

across girls, and to selective attrition out of the sample.


2.      Data, Variables, and Program Selection Rules


        The main sources of data for the analysis in this paper are two: Application forms to the

scholarship program and data on school enrollment and attendance from an unannounced school visit.

The application form contains 28 questions about parental education, demographic composition of the

household, ownership of various assets, housing materials, and distance to the nearest secondary school;

applicants were also asked to specify the name of the secondary school they would like to attend, with the

understanding that this should be one of the 93 schools that were eligible for the scholarship program.

These forms were completed by a girl in class or at home; some provisions were made for teachers to

verify that the data provided was accurate.



1Scholarship recipients agree to use funds towards education, but no attempt was made to enforce this agreement.


                                                        2

         We use the information on the application forms to correct for observable differences across girls.

Two things are worth noting here. First, application forms were handed out at the primary "feeder

schools" to the 93 secondary schools included in the scholarship program. In practice, selection of the

feeder schools, and selection of the girls who were encouraged to fill out application forms by the primary

school teachers appears to have been somewhat ad hoc. Second, almost 30 percent of the application

forms were not filled out completely. Because we use the characteristics on the application form to

correct for differences across girls, the sample for our analysis is limited to girls whose applications were

complete. Appendix One suggests that the differences between the full sample of girls and the sample of

girls with completed applications are generally small. Nevertheless, the fact that our data are not from a
random sample of 6th grade girls in the primary feeder schools to the JFPR secondary schools, or even of

all girls who filled out applications, should be kept in mind when interpreting the results in this paper.


         Once application forms had been filled out, they were forwarded from the primary school to the

Local Management Committee (LMC) of the relevant JFPR secondary school. The LMCs were then

tasked with identifying the 45 girls who were most needy and awarding them scholarships. To assist in

this process, LMCs were given a set of weights that were to be given to each question, and a formula to

aggregate responses into a final score. According to program administrators, these weights were

developed somewhat arbitrarily. For example, applicants who had between 3 and 5 brothers received 1

extra point, those with more than 5 brothers 2 extra points; applicants with 1 to 3 sisters received 1 extra

point, those with 4 or 5 sisters received 2 extra points, and those with 6 or more sisters 3 extra points.

(More points were meant to increase the probability of receiving a scholarship.) A number of

characteristics, including having at least one parent who had completed at least primary school were

meant to disqualify applicants from scholarships. However, the LMCs were given considerable discretion

over the specifics of how to apply the selection rules--the Programme Implementation Manual states that

"LMCs will have flexibility to adapt this process as they see fit." Once LMCs had chosen the girls who

would be awarded scholarships, all applicants were notified whether they had been selected.


         As we show below, it is useful for the analysis in this paper to have a measure of socioeconomic

status (SES) that is close to that used by the LMCs to select scholarship recipients. We compare two

ways of aggregating the information in the application form. First, we use the weights provided by the

program administrators, and rank girls applying to a school by their score. By this measure, 75 percent of

the girls are among the 45 girls with the lowest score and are scholarship recipients; the remaining 25

percent are either girls who did not receive a scholarship despite the fact that they were among the 45

girls with the lowest score, or they were girls who received a scholarship despite the fact that they had



                                                       3

relatively high scores or characteristics that were meant to disqualify them from scholarships. Second, we

aggregate all of the responses to questions in the application form by principal components, and give each

girl a score based on the value of the first principal component (see Filmer and Pritchett 2001). By this

measure, 84 percent of the girls are ranked among the 45 poorest girls and are scholarship recipients.

This evidence is consistent with the LMCs having successfully identified girls with the lowest SES on the

basis of the responses to the application form without strictly following the weights assigned to each

individual question. Because it better predicts scholarship receipt, we use the first principal component as

our preferred measure of SES. In the discussion below, we refer to this as an applicant's "score".


          The second source of data for this evaluation is based on an unannounced school visit to each one

of the 93 program schools. These visits were carried out by an independent firm, hired specifically for

this purpose. Enumerators were given a list of applicants to each JFPR school, without information on
their scholarship status. Note that girls applied for the scholarship in 6th grade, during the 2002/2003

school year, scholarships were first awarded during the 2003/04 school year, and school visits took place
during the course of the 2004/05 school year. During the school visit, enumerators checked 8th grade
enrollment rosters and physically verified whether or not a girl was attending an 8th grade class on the day

of the visit.


          On the basis of the school visits, we construct three measures of enrollment and attendance. The
first is a dummy variable that takes on the value of one if the girl in question was enrolled in 8th grade at

the JFPR school she had applied to. Note that a girl would only figure as enrolled by this measure if she

enrolled in the school she applied to in two consecutive years, and did not repeat a grade. The second

measure is physically verified attendance, a dummy variable that takes on the value of one if a girl was
present in an 8th grade class at the time of the visit by the enumerators. This variable depends on

enrollment; attendance, conditional on enrollment; and adequate grade progress in a JFPR school. The

third variable is a dummy variable that takes on the value of one if a girl is enrolled at any school,

regardless whether this is a JFPR school or not. To construct this third variable, we proceeded as follows.
When an applicant to a given JFPR school did not appear on the 8th grade enrollment rosters, enumerators
asked other 8th grade students in that school whether they knew the missing girl. If someone knew the girl

in question, they were asked whether they knew she was definitely enrolled elsewhere; definitely not

enrolled; or whether respondents were not certain about the enrollment status of the missing girl. On the
basis of the enrollment registers and the questions asked of 8th grade girls during the school visits, we

were able to establish the enrollment status of 95.2 percent of all of the girls who had completed

scholarship applications. One way to think of the girls whose enrollment status could not be established



                                                        4

is as attritors out of the sample. The attrition rate, 4.8 percent, is low--as a point of comparison, attrition

in a recent evaluation of school voucher scheme in Colombia was almost 50 percent (Angrist et al. 2002).

Nevertheless, we carefully consider the extent to which selective attrition could bias our estimates of

program impact.


         Table 1 compares enrollment, attendance, and the characteristics of girls who were awarded

scholarships and those who were not. The table shows that, on average, scholarship recipients had

significantly lower socioeconomic status than non-recipients: Recipients had parents with lower education

levels; they were more likely to live in a hut or a house with an earthen floor, and less likely to have

houses made of high-grade materials like cement, brick, tiles, metal or fiber; recipients were also less

likely to own any one of a number of means of transportation, less likely to own more than a hectare of

land, less likely to regularly lend money, and more likely to have debts. These results confirm that the

LMCs were successful at targeting scholarships to girls with lower socioeconomic status. Table 1 also

shows that 86.7 percent of recipients, but only 64.6 percent of non-recipients were enrolled in a JFPR

program school; 80.2 percent of recipients, but only 57.9 percent of non-recipients were attending a JFPR

school on the day of the visit; for those whose enrollment status could be established, 89.5 percent of

scholarship recipients but only 76.5 percent of non-recipients were enrolled in any school, JFPR or
otherwise.2 Table 1 is consistent with a large program effect on school enrollment and attendance.


         We next focus on comparisons of outcomes for girls with different levels of socioeconomic

status, as measured by their score. In our sample, girls ranked 45 or lower by the score were 4.3

percentage points more likely to be enrolled at a JFPR school than girls ranked 46 or higher (p-value:

0.04); 3.9 percentage points more likely to be present on the day of the school visit (p-value: 0.08); and

2.0 percentage points more likely to be enrolled at any school, JFPR or otherwise (p-value: 0.29). Note

that we would expect that, in the absence of a program, girls with lower SES would be less likely to be

enrolled and attending school. These comparisons, which abstract from any possible endogeneity of

scholarship receipt, therefore provide further evidence of a JFPR program effect.




2Comparisons for the full sample of girls, not just those with completed applications; also suggest that scholarship
recipients were more likely to be enrolled and attending school. In the full sample, the difference in the probability
of enrollment at a JFPR school is 22.1 percentage points; the difference in the probability of attending is 21.9
percentages; and the difference in the probability of enrollment at any school, not just a JFPR school, is 12.1
percentage points. All these differences are significant at the 1 percent level or better.

recipients and non-recipients, by deciles of the score. These results are presented in Figure 1. The lines

corresponding to girls who were turned down for scholarships show that, among these girls, there are

clear socioeconomic gradients in enrollment and attendance. Figure 2 presents a similar figure based on
the 2000 Demographic and Health Survey; here too there is a clear schooling gradient.3 Figure 1 shows,

however, that the gradient in enrollment and attendance has essentially disappeared among scholarship

recipients. This is consistent with larger program effects among girls with the lowest SES, a point we

examine more carefully below.

3The exact list of socioeconomic variables in the DHS is not identical to that on the JFPR application form. We
derive the index of socioeconomic status in the DHS from variables describing: the ownership of a bicycle, cart,
boat, motorbike, car, truck, radio, television; the conditions of the dwelling such as hard roofing and finished
flooring; the availability of electric lighting; the main source of drinking water; the type of toilet facilities; and the
main type of cooking fuel used.

3.       Empirical strategy


         The empirical strategy in this paper is based on comparisons between scholarship recipients (the

"treatment" group) and non-recipients (the "control" group). The analysis begins with OLS regressions

of a dummy variable that takes on the value of one if girl i is enrolled in school at the time of the follow-

up survey (in the enrollment regressions) or attending school (in the attendance regressions), Yit, on a set

of school-level fixed effects, c, a vector of baseline characteristics from the application form, Xit-1, and a

dummy variable that takes on the value of one if a girl was a scholarship recipient, Si:


(1)      Yit = c + Xit-1 + Si + it,

The parameter  is a measure of the difference in the probability of enrollment or attendance between

girls who received a scholarship and those who did not. Linear probability models are used to estimate

(1); estimation by probit yielded very similar results.


         As an alternative to OLS, we use propensity score matching to estimate program impact

(Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983; Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd 1997). As a first step this involves a

regression of a dummy variable that takes on a value of one if a girl received a scholarship:




                                                                                             8

(2)     Si = c + Xi + i,

This regression is then used to predict the probability that each girl in the sample was awarded a

scholarship, i, also known as the propensity score. The second step involves nearest-neighbor matching

on the basis of the propensity score. Prior to matching, observations for which there is no "common

support" are discarded. These are scholarship recipients who, because of their observable characteristics,

had a probability of being awarded a scholarship that was so high that there are essentially no comparable

girls who did not receive a scholarship, as well as girls who did not receive a scholarship who, because of

their observable characteristics, had a probability of being awarded a scholarship that was so low that

there are essentially no comparable girls who received a scholarship. Once observations have been

matched, the estimated program impact is given by the mean difference in enrollment or attendance

between the matched pairs of recipients and non-recipients. Matching is a nonparametric alternative to

OLS, and is often believed to be less subject to mis-specification biases.


        We do not believe that selection on unobservables is an important concern for our analysis.

Students were enrolled in primary school at the time they applied for scholarships, while the selection of

beneficiaries was done by the LMC of a JFPR secondary school. In general, members of the LMC would

not know the girls in question, many of whom would live in different villages or urban areas; LMC

members would therefore have little information (if any) on the academic ability or socioeconomic status

of a given applicant above and beyond the information provided on the application form.


        Although selection on unobservables seems unlikely, we use regression discontinuity (RD) to

estimate treatment effects that are arguably robust to unobserved differences between treatment and

control groups. The basic logic of RD exploits a discontinuous jump in the probability of receiving an

intervention for observations above and below an eligibility threshold. If the control function used to

capture the relationship between the covariate that determines eligibility and outcomes is correctly

specified, and if there is no discreet jump in unobservables at the threshold, RD can provide estimates of

local program effects that are as good as those derived from a randomized experiment (see Hahn, Todd,

and van der Klaauw 2001, and Lee 2005). In the literature on schooling outcomes, RD approaches have

recently been used to estimate the impact of class size on test scores in Israel (Angrist and Lavy 1999)

and Bolivia (Urquiola 2006), financial aid on college enrollment in the United States (van der Klaauw

2002), financial incentives for schools on test score outcomes in Chile (Chay, McEwan, and Urquiola

2005), and pension income on enrollment in South Africa (Edmonds 2005).

                                                   The JFPR scholarship program established a cut-off in the maximum number of scholarships

awarded per school at 45. In general, the school LMCs successfully identified girls with lower SES and

awarded them scholarships. Figure 3 shows that the probability of receiving a scholarship for the 40

applicants with the lowest score was very high: 0.87. Conversely, the probability of receiving a

scholarship for girls ranked 50 or higher by their score was very low: 0.13. Between these ranks--that is,

roughly corresponding to the threshold established by the fact that 45 scholarships could be awarded per

school--there is a sharp drop in the probability of receiving a scholarship. The RD estimates of program

impact exploit this discontinuity around the threshold given by the fixed number of scholarships within a

school.

                                        Note: The score is given by aggregating applicant characteristics by principal component analysis, as

described in the text. These scores are ranked within schools.



                                        Because the relationship between the rank of an application and scholarship receipt is not

deterministic, this is a case of "fuzzy" (rather than "sharp") RD (Hahn, Todd, and van der Klaauw 2001).

In a spirit similar to other applications of fuzzy RD, we estimate the following equation:




                                                                                           10

(3)      Yit = c + f(SESi) + Si + it,

where SES is the value of the first principal component of the composite measure of socioeconomic

status, and the function f(SES) is a flexible parametrization, such as a cubic. Equation (3) is then

estimated by two-stage least squares, with Si instrumented with a dummy variable that takes on the value

of one if a girl is ranked below 45 by the composite measure of SES. We also verify that the results we

report are not sensitive to the exact parametrization used for the function f (SES), or to the choice of

threshold within the 41-49 range for the SES rank within a school.


         Finally, the paper presents evidence of heterogeneity in the JFPR program effects. For this

purpose, we construct three dummy variables for girls who are below the median of the principal

components measure of SES, girls for whom neither parent has completed primary school, and girls who

lived more than 4 kilometers from the JFPR secondary school at the time they completed the application.

We then run separate regressions which include one of these dummies Di, the dummy variable for

whether a girl received a scholarship Si, and the interaction term (Di*Si):


(4)      Yit = c + Xit-1 + Di + Si1 + (Di*Si)2 +eit,

         Interpretation of the coefficients on these variables is straightforward: For example, in the

specification that tests for heterogeneity of treatment effects by socioeconomic status, the coefficient  is

an estimate of the difference in enrollment (or attendance) between girls of "low" and "high" socio-

economic status; the scholarship effect for high-SES girls is given by the coefficient 1; the corresponding

effect for low-SES girls is given by the sum of the coefficients 1 and 2. If 2 is statistically significant,

there is evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effects.


4.       Results


A.       Main results of program impact

         The main results of program impact are presented in Table 2. We present estimates of program

effects with three dependent variables: Enrollment at the JFPR school that a girl applied to, school

attendance at this school on the day of the unannounced school visit, and enrollment at any school.

The first three columns correspond to OLS regressions of enrollment or attendance. Column 1 presents

the raw difference between scholarship recipients and non-recipients; this corresponds to the differences

in means in Table 1, and is included for completeness. Column 2 is based on regressions that include all

of the characteristics on the application form; column 3 supplements these controls with school fixed

effects. The fourth column reports program effects based on propensity score matching; the matching


                                                      11

equation includes all of the controls and school fixed effects. The last two columns correspond to the

regression-discontinuity estimates of program impact. Both sets of RD results include the cubic in

socioeconomic status and school fixed effects. Column 5 corresponds to a reduced-form model; in this

specification, the dummy variable that takes on the value of one if a girl had a score that placed her

among the 45 girls with the lowest SES in her school enters directly in the regression. Column 6

corresponds to the instrumental variables specification; in this specification, the dummy variable for

scholarship recipients is instrumented with the dummy variable for girls ranked below 45 by the

composite measure of SES.


         Table 2 suggests that the JFPR scholarship program had a large, positive effect on school

enrollment and attendance. Controlling for observable differences between scholarship recipients and

non-recipients, scholarships had an impact on enrollment at a JFPR school or attendance on the day of the

school visit of between 29 and 43 percentage points; the estimates based on propensity score matching
tend to be somewhat larger.4 The regression discontinuity results in the last column suggest a program

impact of 30 percentage points on enrollment, and 43.6 percentage points on attendance, although the

standard errors of these estimates tend to be much larger. If the identifying assumptions hold, these

estimates should be purged of possible biases introduced by any correlation between the measure of
scholarship receipt Si and the regression error term.5


         The final row of the table presents estimates of the impact of the JFPR program on enrollment in

any school, regardless whether this is a JFPR school or not. These estimates of program impact drop

observations from the sample whose enrollment status is unknown; below, we return to calculations that

bound the effects of selective attrition. The estimated program effects on enrollment at any school are

generally smaller than those for enrollment at a JFPR school. The smaller program effects when the

dependent variable is enrollment at any school, not just a JFPR school, is not entirely unexpected: JFPR



4These estimates are not sensitive to how, exactly, we match scholarship recipients and non-recipients. For
example, we experimented with various ways of trimming observations from the samples of recipients and non-
recipients to ensure common support, as well as with specifications that did not include the school fixed effects;
neither of these alternative specifications for the matching equation had an appreciable effect on our estimates of
program impact.
5To test the robustness of our results, we also experimented with other parametrizations, including formulations that
included a quadratic and a log term, or a quartic in SES; the estimated program effects are always positive, and are
reasonably close to those reported in Table 2. The estimated program effect on enrollment in a JFPR school in the
specification with a quadratic and a log term in SES is 0.255, with a standard error of 0.121 that in the specification
with a quartic in SES is 0.291, with a standard error of 0.249. Similarly, the results are not sensitive to the choice of
threshold between 41 and 49. For example, the estimated program effect on enrollment in a JFPR school in the
cubic specification with a threshold at 42 is 0.340 (with a standard error of 0.155); when the threshold is 48, the
estimated program effect is 0.361 (with a standard error of 0.255).

scholarships were not portable--students who were awarded scholarships could only receive them if they

enrolled in the school they applied to. Girls who were selected for JFPR scholarships would therefore be

very likely to enroll in a JFPR school if they were to enroll anywhere; similar incentives did not exist for

girls who were turned down for scholarships. Nevertheless, the results in Table 2 suggest substantial and

significant program effects of the scholarship program on enrollment at any school, not just at JFPR

schools.

B.       Bounding the effects of selective attrition

         We next turn to a discussion of how selective attrition could bias our estimates of program effects

on the measure of enrollment at any school. It is difficult to correct for selective attrition in the absence

of a credible instrument--a variable that predicts the probability of attrition, but is not correlated with the

error term in the enrollment regressions (Fitzgerald, Gottschalk and Moffitt 1998). Since no such variable

was apparent in our data, we calculated program effects under alternative assumptions about the

enrollment behavior of girls whose enrollment status could not be established. Note that the enrollment

rate among scholarship recipients is given by the following identity:


(5)      Et = otEot + atEat

where Et is the proportion of girls who are enrolled in any school. The subscript t corresponds to

"treated" girls, and the subscripts o and a correspond to girls who are observed (not attrited) and not

observed (attrited), respectively; ot is the proportion of scholarship recipients who have not attrited; Eot is



                                                            13

the enrollment rate in this group. at is the proportion of scholarship recipients who have attrited; Eat is

the enrollment rate in this group. ot, Eot, and at, but not Eat, can be calculated from the data; Et can then

be estimated under alternative values for Eat. Similarly, for girls who were not awarded scholarships:


(5')     Ec = ocEoc + acEac

where the subscript c corresponds to girls in the "control" group. Here too oc, Eoc, and ac, and

assumptions have to be made regarding Eac. Following Smith and Welch (1989), we present values for
(Et-Ec) for values for Eat and Eac ranging from 0 to 1.6 This corresponds to estimates of program impact

on enrollment under alternative assumptions for the enrollment status of girls who had attrited out of the

sample.


         The results from these calculations are presented in Table 3. Consider first a scenario in which

none of the missing girls are enrolled; under this assumption, total enrollment among recipients is 0.675,

total enrollment among non-recipients is 0.879, and the estimated JFPR program effect on enrollment is

20.4 percentage points. The corresponding scenario in which all of the missing girls are assumed to be

enrolled suggests program effects of 10.4 percentage points. Following Manski (1989), it is also possible

to calculate upper and lower bounds on the treatment effects. The upper bound corresponds to a scenario

in which all the missing girls who are scholarship recipients are enrolled, while all missing girls who did

not receive scholarships are unenrolled (program effect: 0.897-0.675 = 22.2 percentage points); the lower

bound corresponds to a scenario in which all the missing scholarship recipients are unenrolled, while all

missing girls who did not receive scholarships are enrolled (program effect: 0.879-0.793 = 8.6 percentage

points). The bounds do not include zero, which suggests that selective attrition on its own cannot account

for the fact that the estimated program effects on enrollment are positive.




6Smith and Welch parametrize this as the enrollment ratio between attritors and non-attritors. We report this ratio
in columns 2 and 5 of Table 3.

         Is it possible to make a plausible guess about where the program effects fall within these bounds?

Recall that, by definition, attritors are not enrolled in a JFPR school. Arguably, the probability of

enrollment for attritors who did not receive a scholarship could be approximated by the enrollment

probability of other girls who were turned down for scholarships and did not enroll in a JFPR school, but

whose enrollment status could be established on the basis of the answers provided during the school

visits; this probability is 0.123. Similarly, the probability of enrollment for attritors who received a

scholarship could be approximated by the probability of enrollment of other girls who received

scholarships and did not enroll in a JFPR school, but whose enrollment status could be established; this

probability is 0.101. Calculating the difference in total enrollment rates (Et-Ec) under these values for

enrollment of attrited recipient and non-recipient girls, the estimated JFPR program effect is 0.191. Note,

finally, that these calculations of bounds do not adjust for observable or unobservable differences between

girls who received JFPR scholarships and other girls--they correspond to the raw difference in

enrollment in Table 2. Given that scholarship recipients had lower socioeconomic status, on average,

than non-recipients, the results presented in Table 3 are therefore likely to be downward-biased estimates

of the true JFPR program effects under different assumptions about the enrollment behavior of attrited

girls.




                                                        15

C.       Heterogeneity of treatment effects

         We next turn to estimates of heterogeneity of program effects by the aggregate measure of

socioeconomic status, by parental education, and by distance to school. These results are presented in

Table 4. They correspond to OLS specifications that include all of the controls from the application form

and the school fixed effects (Table 2, column 3).


         The first panel in the table shows that the impact of the program is larger among girls from poorer

households; for example, the first row in this panel suggests that the JFPR program increased enrollment

at JFPR schools by 24.3 percentage points for girls with above-median SES, and by 43.9 percentage

points for girls with below-median SES. The second panel of the table suggests that there is also

heterogeneity of treatment effects by the level of parental education; the first row in this panel suggests

enrollment effects of 24.2 percentage points for girls who have at least one parent who had completed at

least primary school, compared to enrollment effects of 32.3 percentage points for girls where neither

parent had completed primary school. The last panel suggests that enrollment effects are larger among

girls who live at least four kilometers from the JFPR secondary school they applied to; the first row in this

panel suggests enrollment effects of 25.4 percentage points for girls who live less than four kilometers

from the school, and 37.2 percentage points for girls who live further away. Note that LMC members of

the JFPR secondary school should be less likely to know girls who live far away, which minimizes the

potential for selection on unobservables for this group. The fact that there are significant program effects

among girls who live far from the school they applied to provide further reassurance that the estimated

program effects are not driven by selection on unobservables.


         The coefficients on the dummy variables for low SES, low levels of parental education, and girls

living in more remote areas all suggest that, in the absence of the scholarship program, girls in these

households were less likely to be enrolled in and attending school, as one would expect. However, the

difference in enrollment and attendance by SES, parental education and distance to school is dampened or

disappears entirely among girls who receive the JFPR scholarships. For example, the first column

suggests that, in the absence of the scholarship, there is a difference of 24.3 percentage points in

enrollment between girls with high and low SES; however, among girls who receive the scholarship, there

is no difference in enrollment between girls with high and low SES. Put differently, because program

effects are larger among girls with lower SES, the scholarship program eliminated the gradient between

SES and school enrollment. The regression results in Table 4 therefore confirm the patterns observed in

Figure 2. The scholarship program also reduced the gradient by parental education, although the




                                                      16

compensatory effect of the program is not large enough to bring girls with low levels of parental

5.       Conclusion


         Raising the schooling levels of girls is often regarded as an important priority for developing

countries (World Bank 2001, Schultz 2002). In many developing countries the Mincerian rate of return to

schooling for women is at least as large as that for men (for examples, see Deolalikar 1993 for Indonesia;

Schultz 1993 for Thailand, Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana). There is also a large literature documenting

associations between female education and a variety of social outcomes, including lower fertility,

decreases in child mortality, improvements in child health and nutrition, and better education and child

cognitive development (see reviews in Strauss and Thomas 1995; World Bank 2001).

         In this paper we estimate the impact of a scholarship program for girls on school enrollment and

attendance in Cambodia. OLS estimates of program impact indicate that the program increased

enrollment and attendance at eligible schools by approximately 30 percentage points, and enrollment at

any school by about 22 percentage points; estimates of program effects based on propensity score

matching are larger. The program effects we estimate are robust to a variety of concerns: Regression-

discontinuity specifications suggest that our estimates are not driven by unobservable differences between

scholarship recipients and non-recipients, and an application of bounds shows that selective attrition

cannot account for the pattern of program effects we observe. Moreover, we find that program impacts

are largest among girls who come from poorer households, have parents with less education, and live

farther away from a secondary school. As a result, the JFPR program appears to have dramatically

reduced socioeconomic gradients in enrollment and attendance.


         Much of the existing evidence on the impact of demand-side incentives on schooling outcomes is

based on evaluations in middle-income countries (for example Schultz 2004 and Behrman, Sengupta, and

Todd 2005 on PROGRESA Mexico; Angrist et al. 2002 on a voucher program in Colombia; an exception

is Ravallion and Wodon 2000 on the Food-for-Education program Bangladesh, a low income country).

Our results suggest that even in one of the world's lowest income countries, with weak public sector

institutions and relatively low quality schooling, demand-side incentives can effectively increase the

school enrollment and attendance of girls. Indeed, the program effects we estimate are large compared

with those found in wealthier countries: As a point of comparison, Schultz (2004) estimates that
PROGRESA transfers increase the transition from 6th grade, the last grade in primary school, to 7th grade,

the first year of secondary school, by 11.1 percentage points. Because enrollment rates in low-income

countries like Cambodia tend to be much lower than those in middle-income countries like Mexico, the

scope for improvements, and for potential program impact, may be larger in the poorest countries.


         Our estimates of program impact leave some important questions unanswered. Chief among

them is the effect of the scholarship on other schooling outcomes, including repetition rates, and measures

of performance like test scores. Moreover, in the absence of empirical evidence on the effectiveness of

other interventions to improve schooling outcomes in Cambodia, we cannot draw up convincing cost-

effectiveness comparisons, or estimate whether the scholarship amount set by the JFPR program was "too

large" or "too small" to induce a given change in girl enrollment. Nevertheless, given the paucity of

evidence from low income countries, these estimates of large program impacts may be cause for

optimism.
