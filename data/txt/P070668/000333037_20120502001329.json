for Cambodia were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: ensuring quality at entry during project\n            preparation is a determinant for a good physical and\n            financial implementation progress as shown by the ESSP.\n            Complementing this lesson, the implementation completion and\n            results report (ICR) is of the view that key sector issues\n            should guide the project's design attuned to the\n            project development objectives (PDOs) ensuring as best as\n            possible, that the Bank's country management unit\n            pipeline agenda existing at the time of preparation does not\n            significantly alter the approved concept design as was the\n            case with the hasty inclusion at appraisal of a largely\n            disconnected component three. Ensure capacity buildup within\n            the mainstream institutions to implement project activities\n            as it was the case, for example, with the scholarship scheme\n            and the learning assessment currently fully managed and\n            financed by Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MoEYS),\n            avoiding parallel units whose built capacity tends to\n            disappear at the closing of a project, like the ESSP lower\n            secondary (LS) leadership scheme. Ensuring good management\n            governance complements this lesson."}, "docdt": "2012-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
