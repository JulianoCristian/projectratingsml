 Reallocation of Proceeds and Extension of Closing Date
       CAMBODIA -- EDUCATION SECTOR SUPPORT PROJECT (P070668) ­
            CREDIT NUMBER 4055-KH; GRANT NUMBER H161-KH


1.    The closing date for the Cambodia Education Sector Support Project (Cr. No.
4055-KH and Grant No. H161-KH), will be extended from December 31, 2010 until
September 30, 2011.

2.      The Project continues to make positive implementation progress, remains fully in
line with the original project development objective, and compliant with the legal
covenants. The Scholarship Program supported by the Project continues to progress well
and has thus far supported 10,377 students. The education quality improvement
component continues to demonstrate outstanding outcomes, and the coordination between
the Accreditation Committee of Cambodia and the Department of Higher Education has
produced two accreditation systems, one for Foundation Year Programmes and another
for higher education institutions. The project development objectives continue to remain
achievable.

3.      The proposed extension is necessary to finance the reconstruction of seven
schools that were destroyed by the Ketsana typhoon and also complete the construction
of the Library extension at the Royal University of Phnom Penh. The construction of the
library wing has encountered delays because of the sinking of the original foundation of
the library extension. The Borrower has in place an action plan to complete the project by
September 2011.

4.      To complete the extension of the library, proceeds for Cambodia Education
Sector Support (Cr. No. 4055-KH and Grant No. H161-KH) P070668 are to be
reallocated as follows:

FY2009 was acceptable to the Bank.
