IV. Implementing Agency Capacity Building Activities with Time Schedule

Capacity is adequate in MoEYS for implementing IDA-financed projects. This Project is built on the model of FERP and EQIP in terms of school
construction and procurement of furniture using NCB, quotation and community participation as well as procuring of goods and hiring of consultant
services. The only exception is the three educational/instructional materials packages using ICB procedures, which may be unfamiliar to MoEYS staff.
A basic procurement training highlighting revised policies of the new Guidelines dated May 2004 for both goods and works and consultant services
was conducted during the project Pre-Appraisal mission. Specific procurement training for the Project, including ICB procedures, will be conducted
by the World Bank procurement team during Project Negotiations and Project Launch missions. A Project Implementation Plan (PIP) agreed by the
Bank, with details of each procurement method's steps and the provision of various model bidding documents, will serve as the project procurement
manual along with the Community Contracting Operational Manual and the Scholarship Scheme Operational Manual.

V. Certification Requirement of Selection Committee Members for All Procurement Activities

In order to avoid conflict of interest and to conduct procurement selection fairly, all Selection Committee members should sign a certification
confirming that they are not associated with any of the bidders and that they have carried out their responsibilities during the procurement process to
the best of their professional ability without any regard to external factors or influences.
