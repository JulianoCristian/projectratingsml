Beneficiaries are expected to\n            be mostly small- and medium-scale firms (SMI), which offer\n            the greatest potential of generating employment at a\n            relatively low investment cost per job. To further increase\n            the employment impact of the project, one-third of the Bank\n            loan is earmarked for SSI investments, which are generally\n            more labor-intensive than larger firms, with fixed assets\n            after completion of the investment less than $350,000 if\n            new, or $500,000 if for expansion. The project also\n            envisages the provision of technical assistance, through the\n            services of Turkish industrial consultants, to SYKB's\n            sub-borrowers, with SYKB bearing 80 percent of the costs out\n            of the Technical Assistance Fund. It will support\n            sub-projects primarily in 23 priority urban centers, which\n            account for over 75 percent of urban unemployment in Turkey."}, "docdt": "1981-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
