                         The project is expected to yield significant benefits in relieving congestion on the railway lines to/from Mersin port so that more of the port traffic may be handled by rail rather than
                         road. This supports the Government's goal to shift traffic from road to rail, reducing road congestion, demand for additional road infrastructure and GHG emissions. The project will
                         benefit the railway financially by attracting freight traffic and improving network density. This project will support the transformation of TCDD into a commercial and market oriented
                         railway. Over time, this will improve the railway's delivery of both passenger and freight services. It should also reduce the subsidy needs of the railway, freeing public funds for other

                         A restructuring of the project to address the triggering of the Bank safeguards on involuntary resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) and physical cultural resources (OP/BP 4.11) was approved
                         by the World Bank Executive Directors on July 13, 2011. TCDD now has in place a Resettlement Action Plan to guide land acquisition and has modified its Environmental
                         Management Plan to address physical cultural resources.

                         The project has experienced significant delays in implementation, however, works are now underway for the signaling and station loop investment, some trainings have been
                         conducted, and key reform studies are completed. The studies and pilots supporting reforms (on public service contract and infrastructure charging) prepare TCDD to manage
                         reforms, but they can only be meaningfully implemented after revised Railway and TCDD laws are passed.
