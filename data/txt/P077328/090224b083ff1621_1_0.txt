F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
To support the Borrower's implementation of the Program over the four (4) year period
2005-2009, to improve effectiveness of railway operations and to assist TCDD in reaching
a financially sustainable situation and reduce the fiscal burden TCDD represents for the
Borrower.



                                                ii
Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
To (a) improve the effectiveness of railway operations on the Mersin-Toprakkale and
Yenice-Bogazkopru lines by increasing capacity and improving service quality, and (b) lay
the groundwork for restructuring TCDD by developing experience with financially viable
contract arrangements for loss making public services and access pricing of infrastructure.
These contractual arrangements and infrastructure pricing are key components of future
reform to be implemented under the new railway framework law.

1.         Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.       In summary, four main features characterize project implementation: (i) the project was
restructured three times, in 2009, 2011 and 2012, (ii) in the 2009 restructuring, the PDO was
changed to focus the project on the reforms and achievements that could be realized by the project
within Turkey’s existing legal framework for railways, (iii) while initially structured as a two-part
APL program the Bank did not proceed to APL-2, and (iv) despite significant achievements the
signaling contract remained incomplete at the time of the project closing on December 31, 2013.

1.1        Context at Appraisal

2.      At the start of project preparation, Turkey was recovering from the economic crisis of 2001
and was exercising strong fiscal discipline and carrying out extensive structural reforms. The
government had already made substantial progress in restructuring State Owned Enterprises. The
government’s priorities at appraisal included the continuation of restructuring and partial or full
privatization of public utilities coupled with sector reform. The policy dialogue between the
government, Turkish Railways (TCDD) and the Bank, was ongoing from 2001, in particular
through economic and sector work (ESW).1
3.      The European Union (EU) formally agreed to start accession negotiations with Turkey
from October 3, 2005, so the government planned to restructure the railway sector in accordance
with the EU “acquis communautaire”. In this context, the government requested the assistance of
the Bank as an independent advisor and as a financier to restructure the railway sector, which
remained one of the few sectors which had not undergone reforms. The government considered the
Bank to be well positioned to provide appropriate advice and to work in close cooperation with the
EU to help TCDD reducing its financial losses and in meeting the EU accession requirements.
1.2        Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

4.      The overall objective of the APL program was to improve the financial viability,
productivity and effectiveness of railway operations.

5.       The PDO of the APL-1 as appraised was to support the Borrower's implementation of the
Program over the four year period 2005-2009, to improve effectiveness of railway operations and
to assist TCDD in reaching a financially sustainable situation and reduce the fiscal burden TCDD
represents for the Borrower.

6.         The key project indicators at appraisal were:

       -   Institutional reform: A new legal and regulatory framework of the sector - compliant with
           the EU “acquis communautaire” is in place by end of 2006.
       -   Competitiveness of rail operations: (i) TCDD operating annual revenues increase by at
           least 10 percent per year during the period 2005-2009; and (ii) freight traffic increases from
           9.6 billion ton-km in 2004 to 11.6 billion ton-km by 2009.

                                                     1
      -   Productivity and effectiveness of rail operations: TCDD operating losses would be
          significantly reduced, and the working ratio without subsidy would improve from 366
          percent in 2004 to 200 percent or less by 2009;
      -   Staff adjustment: TCDD railway staff would be reduced significantly in a socially
          acceptable way;
      -   Reduction of fiscal burden: TCDD’s dependence on public finance to cover rail deficit
          and investment would decrease from 0.4 percent of GDP in 2004 to less than 0.2 percent
          of GDP in 2009.

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

7.       The project expected a new legal and regulatory framework to be implemented in the early
years of the project. Each year, TCDD, the State Planning Organization2, and Ministry of Transport
and Communications (MoT) indicated that the new railway law would be passed. TCDD submitted
the draft General Law on Railways and TCDD law to the MoT at the end of 2006. TCDD and the
MoT created a working group and action plan to progress the railways laws during 2008 and the
secondary legislation in 2009. In July 2007, the working group prepared and submitted a report
identifying the issues that must be decided by high level officials in TCDD and MoT, before any
further steps concerning the laws could be taken. The Bank’s missions requested that decisions be
taken in a timely fashion.3

8.       When this failed to materialize, the project was restructured in mid-2009 to focus it on the
reforms and achievements that could be realistically realized by the project within Turkey’s existing
legal framework for railways. The project development objective and the results indicators were
changed during a Level 1 restructuring approved by Board on July 6, 2009.

9.        The revised PDO was:

          To (a) improve the effectiveness of railway operations on the Mersin-Toprakkale and
          Yenice-Bogazköprü lines by increasing capacity and improving service quality, and (b) lay
          the groundwork for restructuring TCDD by developing experience with financially viable
          contract arrangements for loss making public services and access pricing of infrastructure.

10.       The indicators for the revised objectives were4:
      -   Increased traffic on Mersin-Toprakkale and Yenice-Bogazköprü lines, measured by
          increase in passenger-km of 15 percent and freight ton-km by 4 percent between 2008 and
          2012;
      -   Increased service quality on Mersin-Toprakkale and Yenice-Bogazköprü lines, measured
          by increase in average commercial freight train speed by 28 percent and 40 percent
          respectively between 2008 and 2012 ;
      -   Increase in share of traffic to/from Mersin carried by rail from 5.9 percent to 6.5 percent
          by 2012;

      -   Readiness to implement Public Service Obligations (PSO) (progress towards preparation
          of PSO for each year of the planned implementation);
      -   Readiness to implement Infrastructure Access charging (towards the network statement
          issuance);

1.4       Main Beneficiaries

11.      As originally conceived, the project was to benefit rail users generally and reduce the fiscal
burden on government. As revised, the main beneficiaries were rail users of the two lines, who
would benefit from enhanced lines capacity, and increased service quality (measured by speed).
Passenger users, which primarily belong to the poorer segments of the population, would also
benefit from increased level of service particularly on the line from Mersin to Toprakkale via Adana
through safer, more secure and more reliable train services.

1.5       Original Components

12.       The APL-1 original components were as follows:

Part A: Freight Lines Capacity Increase

1.6     Revised Components

13.       The following table shows the changes in project components and indicators between the
original and the revised Loan Agreements. Component A was changed at the request of the client
to drop: (i) the installation of mechanical ventilation of two long tunnels and of optic fiber cables,
(ii) the improvement of railway interface at both the container terminal and the free zone within the
port of Mersin, and (iii) the rehabilitation of the oil charging facility. Component B remained
unchanged. The rail border crossing under Component C was dropped due to the focus on domestic
lines along Mersin-Toprakkale and Yenice- Bogazkopru. A governance and business skills activity
was added to Component D to address project management issues.

1.7     Other significant changes

Project restructuring:

14.     The project was restructured three times in 2009, 2011 and 2012.

15.       The purpose of the first restructuring of Level 1 was to amend the project development
objective and results framework to align them more closely with project activities and realistic
outcomes. The project was restructured to focus it on the reforms and achievements that could be
realized by the project within Turkey’s existing legal framework for railways. In addition, the staff
reduction component’s amount was reduced and funds were transferred to the freight lines capacity
increase component. The project development objective and the results indicators were changed in
this restructuring. The project closing date was extended from September 30, 2009 to June 12, 2012
to correspond to the completion date of the contract for supply and installation of the signaling.
The first restructuring was approved on July 6, 2009.




                                                 5
16.     The project was restructured again in 2011 to address land acquisition and building
renovation activities that triggered Bank policies on involuntary resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) and
physical cultural resources (OP/BP 4.11). The restructuring was approved on July 13, 2011.

17.      In 2012, the project was restructured to extend its implementation period in order to allow
TCDD to complete the main investment component, a signaling system on the Mersin-Toprakkale
and Yenice-Bogazkopru lines. The extension also aimed to channel technical assistance support to
the railway sector reform as the law on liberalization of railway transportation in Turkey had been
circulated early 2012. The extension included revised target dates for PDO level and intermediate
results indicators to reflect the longer implementation period. The third and last restructuring was
approved on June 27, 2012.

Change in Disbursement Percentage:

18.      In the 2009 restructuring, the disbursement percentage of the works component was
changed from 85 percent to 71 percent because the cost of the works contract for signaling was
greater than was originally estimated, and thus, the World Bank loan amount represented a smaller
share of total cost than originally expected.

2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1      Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19.      Lessons learned from previous projects. Previous lessons learned recommended to devote
more effort in persuading the Turkish Government to address the root causes of TCDD’s poor
efficiency, which were previously identified as its regional based organization, inadequate
institutional arrangements, and staffing. The enactment of the railway laws were considered as
prerequisites to ensure the sustainability of the project. The policy dialogue between the
Government, TCDD and the Bank had been taking place since 2001, in particular through ESW
(TCDD – Options for reform – June 2002). The project design reflected the recommendations of
this work. However, the project scope and objectives were a posteriori ambitious considering its
implementation arrangements, timing and resources.

20.      The Bank designed its support to the railway sector as a two-part Adaptable Program Loan
(APL), whose objective was to improve the financial viability, productivity, and effectiveness of
railway operations. The APL was centered on reform legislation that would change the structure of
the railway industry. APL-1 was designed to support implementation of the new railway law.
Passage of the law, expected early in the implementation of APL-1, was a key trigger for APL-2.
Given the impressive pace of reform implementation that the government followed in other
infrastructure sectors, delay in the enactment of the law was considered as improbable and unlikely
to compromise the outcomes expected from APL-1. However, the law was not passed until May
2013, well after the original project closing date.

21.      Project readiness. The project was approved in May 2005 and became effective in June
2006. Implementation readiness was not fully completed particularly for the signaling component..
TCDD considered staff reduction figures to be sensitive and requested that such figures be taken
out of the publically available PAD. The staff reduction component lacked specific targets5. With


5 However, in the minutes of negotiation dated May 5, 2005 Attachment VI, the trigger for APL2 indicated however a

reduction of 3000 staff by July 1, 2007.


                                                        6
more time to carry out the project preparation, TCDD could have had more extensive consultations
with local authorities about the level crossings in the design. This would have put TCDD in a more
comfortable position to challenge subsequent requests from those local authorities for additional
level crossings.

22.      Assessment of risks: The identification of project risks at preparation was for the most part
adequate. The risks were identified and discussed in the PAD as follows: (a) insufficient political
will to reform (moderate); (b) institutional weakness (substantial); (c) social resistance to change
(high); (d) insufficient financing for maintenance of the infrastructure or for the Public Services
Obligation (PSO) (substantial); and, (e) important delay in the shift from current “regional” to
“lines of business” organization (high).

23.      The risks of ‘social resistance to change’ and ‘insufficient financing for maintenance of the
infrastructure and for the PSO’, did not materialize. Other risks did materialize during the project
implementation, but at different levels than the ones assessed during appraisal. In particular, the
insufficient political will to reform, which was assessed as moderate, proved to be high during
implementation. Item (b) institutional weakness was intended to be fully mitigated through EU
technical assistance, hence placing these risks outside of the project’s set of mitigation measures.
At appraisal there was a lot of interest in converging with EU regulations which was found not to
be sufficient to carry on the reforms. A lot more due diligence of the completion of the reform law
approved and secondary legislation should have preceded the appraisal completion process.
Further technical assistance supported by the Bank became necessary to address other institutional
issues and complement the EU support.

24.       In addition, the following risks should have also been identified during preparation and
partly mitigated during implementation: (a) the resistance to implement the railway reform
appeared as a more critical issue than social resistance to change, partly due to the political
affiliation of the labor unions within TCDD; and (b) poor capacity of local subcontractors.


2.2       Implementation

      a) Factors outside the control of government or implementing agencies

25.      Contractor’s capacity: The signaling contract was the contractor’s first signaling contract
in Turkey, and their bid was priced aggressively to try to get into the market. The contractor was
mostly familiar with project design and implementation in Western European countries, where they
were used to sub-contract a majority of construction work to highly skilled contractors. In Turkey
however, they found that the quality of subcontractor work was problematic and this required much
more supervision than had been anticipated, raising costs and generating delays. In parallel, TCDD
introduced many changes into the design, which created rework and in some cases became sources
of dispute, contributing to delays. In this context, consideration was given to terminating or
restructuring the contract at several times during implementation, but it was feared this would cause
much more rework of the design and additional delays. The signaling contractor’s performance has
been below expectations. The contractor’s capacity and willingness to deliver the project outputs
has been a concern throughout the entire project implementation period.6

6 The client considered terminating the contractor’s contract after design was completed and about two third of the work
completed. However, given the contractor successfully carried out the design of the signaling systems with specific
equipment already in place, the client rejected this option in view of the potential associated time and cost for bringing a
new contractor up to speed, the delays deriving from possible equipment replacement and the possible reputation risks
to terminate a large contract. During the second half of 2013 the Bank supported the implementing agency to hire a claims
specialist in the PIU to help resolve the many claims that contributed to slow implementation of the investment.
                                                             7
26.     Theft and vandalism. The railway signaling component was hampered and seriously
delayed by theft and vandalism particularly in the region of Adana. After commissioning MS-9
(Mersin-Tashkent-Termil stations), all the track circuits were stolen, rendering the system
inoperable. Such a magnitude of theft and vandalism remained unprecedented for TCDD. TCDD
approved a security action plan at a later stage in the project implementation cycle (i.e. in November
2013). The plan included fencing, lighting, security cameras, increased security patrols, making
signaling components less readily accessed (e.g., sealing with concrete, filling cable ducts with
sand), and community education/outreach. Meanwhile, the safety situation worsened by the major
Syrian refugee crisis affecting border areas and where the project is located.

      b) Factors generally subject to government control

27.      The original project design relied heavily on successful implementation of the railway
reform as a core dimension guiding some of the APL triggers. The risk for the Law to not
materialize was originally considered low given the overall reform program targeting
infrastructure, favorable momentum for SOE restructuring, and commitment from highest
authorities within the government. The railway reforms were being discussed as part of the
negotiations for entering the EU; when the prospects for this diminished, the enthusiasm for the
railway reform diminished as well.

      c) Factors generally subject to implementing agency control

28.     TCDD had previously relied on the General Directorate for Construction of Railways, Ports
and Airports (DLH in Turkish) to manage railway construction projects, so TCDD’s internal
experience with design, international procurement and management of large international contracts
was limited. TCDD had to develop its capacity during the course of the project implementation.
This constituted a major factor affecting project implementation performance which has been fully
acknowledged by the management appointed in TCDD in early 2015.

29.     The management structure for the signaling contract was awkward. The Project Manager
was the deputy head of TCDD’s Installations Department and responsible for many activities in
addition to the signaling investment. The on-site manager, based in Adana, did not have authority
to take quick decisions about managing the contract. The PIU, which managed the procurement,
financial management and liaison with the Bank, was in Ankara. Responsibility for land acquisition
was likewise split between Ankara and Adana. This bifurcation of responsibility and authority
hindered the ability to take decisions and to produce timely responses to critical project issues.

30.      Moreover, TCDD’s internal procedures were cumbersome, often requiring the PIU to
circulate the contractor’s outputs to various technical departments for lengthy review. This situation
was worsened by the poor coordination between the technical departments of TCDD such as
between the departments in charge of track maintenance, signaling and electrification. This
generated substantial delays and suspended the work of the contractor on site.

31.     Frequent change orders by TCDD created opportunities for cost escalation, disputes/delays
and risks for mismanagement. One of the things agreed with TCDD in the “settlement” that allowed
the project to be extended until December 2013 was that it would a stop all change orders.

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

32.    The monitoring and evaluation system was straightforward in its concept and
implementation. The indicators for measuring the ‘before’ and ‘after’ performance were objective

                                                  8
and are standard operating statistics collected by TCDD Statistical Bureau on a routine basis. The
Bank is confident that they also will allow continued monitoring of longer-term increase in these
flows over the coming years. In addition, the construction supervision consultant was requested to
produce a methodology and a spreadsheet to monitor the progress of the signaling activities. The
Bank team is confident that this methodology will continue to be used by TCDD. Other indicators
indicated progress in preparing the railway liberalization, i.e. whether or not the key activities were
implemented.

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

33.      During the course of project implementation, the need for land acquisition arose at passing
loops and near Yenice Logistic Village (which was not financed by the Bank but adjacent to the
project). This issue was addressed during the second project restructuring. The Bank requested
TCDD to prepare a Resettlement Action Plan, including procedures and framework for purchase
of land and settlement and a socio-economic assessment of the Project Affected People particularly
at Yenice Logistic Village. After the restructuring the safeguard reviews have raised fairly minor
issues, which the implementing agency cooperated to address effectively.

34.    An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was prepared for the signaling Project and
Yenice Logistics Center-Mersin-Toprakkale (43 km of double track between Mersin - Adana, 100
km of single track between Adana -Toprakkale) line sections. The EMP was satisfactorily
implemented and included inter alia noise, dust and air pollution mitigation measures, and
avoidance of archaeological sites.

35.     Financial management under the project was satisfactory. TCDD has implemented
adequate financial and accounting systems. Project accounting was adequate. Audit reports were
acceptable to the Bank but generally submitted with delays, even though the timing of submission
increasingly improved between 2008 and 2012. The Financial Management supervision missions
rated a majority of fiduciary assessments as Moderately Satisfactory but noted regular
improvements until reaching a satisfactory level. The implementation of the Enterprise Resource
Planning (ERP) was required as per loan covenants with due date of December 31, 2007 and was
implemented, but only in 2012, although TCDD staff faces difficulty with implementation, which
shows a need for additional training.

36.     Compliance with the World Bank procurement guidelines was satisfactory. The Bank
provided non-objection to all the requests for variation orders and extensions. The Bank advised
the borrower to hire a claim specialist under the project, which provided useful support. In addition,
the borrower hired a procurement specialist who was effective.


2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

37.      Major legislative reform approved. In 2013, the Turkish Parliament approved major
legislation that reformed the structure of the railway industry in Turkey (Law on Liberalization of
Railway Transportation of Turkey, effective May 1, 2013) which was a key original objective. This
law generally aligned the legal framework with the EU “acquis communautaire”. Regulations are
also being issued to implement the law and are in various stages of approval, drafting and review.
Actions for implementing the law include: the preparation of an (i) Infrastructure Access legislation
and (ii) a Rolling Stock Registry legislation, which were approved respectively in 2014 and 2015,
while (iii) legislations on Safety and (iv) licensing have been prepared, endorsed by the
Government but not published yet, due to delays in 2015 related to electoral uncertainties. The
above four legislations are necessary to allow private entities to operate in the network. The above

                                                  9
reform and the accompanying secondary legislation confirm a major enhancement in the sector
outlook and is generally understood to be a significant change addressing key sustainability
concerns. The government’s transport strategy by 2023 primarily focuses on railway transport.

38.      Signaling investment. TCDD has assumed responsibility for paying the remainder of the
Supply and Installation contract. TCDD's project management team remains in place, and TCDD
has taken over financial responsibility for the contract of the supervision consultant, to ensure that
the project will continue to be supervised. TCDD has adopted a security program to address the
security issues that have caused project delays. At closing, TCDD, the Consultant and the contractor
are making progress in testing and operating the signaling investments.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

39.     Since the signaling investment had not been finished at the time of the loan closing in
December 2013, Bank management approved postponing the ICR completion until December 31,
2015 to allow the completion of the signaling and station loop extension investments to be
reassessed and a full implementation completion report prepared.

40.      As of December 2015 when this ICR is finalized, all track extensions in key stations have
been completed for a total of 13 km of tracks all of which are operational. The physical completion
of the signaling investment along the Bogazkopru-Yenice line has been completed or almost
completed, depending of the sections reviewed: i.e., the interlocking system, an automatized real
time traffic management system, is completed and/or operational on the majority of sections along
the Bogazkopru-Yenice line, which allows trains to run faster and more safely along the single
track lines as well as accommodate additional capacity; the Computerized Traffic Centers (CTC)
in Adana and Kayseri are completed; and some remaining works include testing activities for
telecommunication and balise systems (i.e., to allow on board signaling systems, which provides
additional comfort to locomotive drivers) on a majority of sections. These are standard systems and
do not involve major technical challenges. Installation of signaling systems along two sections out
of 12, specifically between Mersin and Sehitlik is incomplete due to cable thefts. Some delays
occurred since the loan closing in 2013 and are for the most part attributable to an ongoing
electrification project along the Bogazkopru-Yenice line.

41.      The efficiency of operations along the line is increased due to the full completion of track
extensions and the partial completion of the signaling component. The track extensions allows
longer trains to operate, from 400 m at the time of appraisal to 600 m. This is particularly critical
for container trains connecting with maritime ports. The signaling component already generates
major benefits in terms of traffic management safety i.e. more reliable rail operations. The technical
parameters of the line will allow an increase by 20 percent of trains in operations. Upon completion
of the electrification project, electric locomotives will be able to haul heavier loads, hence
supporting a more diverse and robust increase in traffic. As with any transport project, the economic
benefits deriving from the project investments materialize over the course of years after the project
completion. The signaling works along two sections out of four in the Southern line (Mersin-
Toprakkale) are on hold, due in part to the cable thefts. The reassessment of the signaling works
considers that all other remaining works will be completed by the end of 2016.

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

42.     Both the reform and investment aspects of the project are highly significant and continue
to have high relevance for Turkey.



                                                 10
           Turkey’s 10th Development Plan (2014-18) makes particular reference to investment in
            railway signaling in the context of Turkey’s desire to become a "regional logistics base"
            and with the further aim of reducing the cost of logistics.

           In 2013, the Turkish Parliament passed legislation to reform the structure of the railway
            industry in Turkey (Law on Liberalization of Railway Transportation of Turkey, effective
            May 1, 2013) and since 2014 has been gradually passing secondary legislation packages.
            Because of the project activities on PSO and Network Statement, TCDD and the
            Government of Turkey are prepared to implement important aspects of this law.

43.      The sustained relevance of the project objectives is further demonstrated by the progress
made with reform, also captured in the Sustaining Shared Growth Development Policy Loan (DPL)
approved by the Board in July 2014 which has been successfully implemented. A key action also
captured in the DPL was the promulgation of the Liberalization of the Turkish Railway
Transportation Law No. 6461 in the Official Gazette No. 28634 on May 1, 2013, which permits
qualified train operators to be licensed to operate in Turkey and to have non-discriminatory access
to use the railway infrastructure in Turkey. Progress is also being made on secondary legislation
for implementation of the law; as of November 2015, half of the secondary legislations have been
approved and the remaining ones have been drafted and are awaiting final Government approval.
Based on these various points, the relevance of the objectives is rated as High.

44.      The project’s components and results framework, as revised through the project
restructurings, were appropriate to concentrate efforts on achievable results at the investment level
whilst building the sector capacity throughout technical assistance support. Therefore, as per the
Bank’s Guidelines for the ICR preparation 7 , since the project/program design reflected proper
diagnosis of a development priority that remains relevant, the relevance of design is rated High.

3.2         Achievement of Project Development Objectives

45.      Original PDO: At the time of the first project restructuring in June 2009, by which time
US$44.75 m. had been disbursed (24.2 percent of the original loan and 30.2 percent of the eventual
actual total disbursed by the end of the project), performance against the original PDO indicators
was Moderately Unsatisfactory. As shown in Table 2, the target for revenue growth had been
exceeded in 2008 (and was nearly met—98 percent in 2009), but the working ratio was significantly
higher than the target.

46.     By mid-2009, the project had financed the end-of-employment, lump sum payments for
voluntary retirement of 1,596 TCDD staff (5 percent of the 2007 railway employment). This saved
TCDD an estimated US$35 million per year in staff costs [Estimate from the staff costs in the
income statement] and contributed to the PDO objectives of TCDD’s financial viability.




7   Implementation Completion and Results Report Guidelines, OPCS, August 2006, last updated July 2, 2014.


                                                         11
                               Table 2. Original PDO indicators




47.      Revised PDO: The revised PDO as of June 2009 has two parts, one related to the signaling
investment, i.e. "improve the effectiveness of railway operations on the Mersin-Toprakkale and
Yenice-Bogazkopru lines by increasing capacity and improving service quality", and the other
related to preparing to implement reforms, i.e. "lay the groundwork for restructuring TCDD by
developing experience with financially viable contract arrangements for loss making public
services and access pricing of infrastructure."

48.       Increasing capacity and improving service quality. Regarding the first set of revised PDO
outcomes—increasing capacity and improving service quality—the project’s performance by the
final closing date was mixed. On the one hand, the project surpassed its targets for increased annual
traffic volume on the Mersin-Toprakkale and Yenice-Bogazkopru lines by 151 percent for
passenger traffic and 104 percent for freight traffic. On the other hand, the project failed to reach
its targets for improved average speeds on either line, with actual achievements of 78 percent and
71 percent of targets respectively. In addition, the target for the increased share of traffic to/from
Mersin Port carried by rail was not reached and the actual value at end-of-project is actually lower
than the baseline (5.0 percent vs. 5.9 percent). The intermediate indicator target for increased
freight traffic on the most productive part of the freight network (11.6 bn. Tons/km) was not
achieved. Because of traffic interruptions along the lines due to an electrification project ongoing
since 2014, the recent traffic data did not increase. Nevertheless, the completion of track extensions
in stations and the signaling interlocking systems substantially enhances traffic safety (from manual
to automatized systems) and increases or are about to increase the lines capacity by at least 20
percent on both lines, except between Mersin and Adana, where cable thefts occurred. The increase
in traffic reliability, which is critical for freight transportation directly derives from the completion
of the signaling systems. The achievement of the physical investments is modest.

49.      Preparing to Implement Reforms. The reform part of the PDO concerns preparing TCDD
for restructuring by developing experience with public service obligation (PSO) contracts and
access pricing of infrastructure. In 2009, the project initiated a PSO pilot with TCDD and Treasury
in which they established an agreement that specified the service requirements and compensation
for a limited number of trains. This agreement was successful and expanded to cover additional
trains. A technical assistance (TA) financed by the project helped TCDD and Treasury optimize
the passenger train service offering and prepared a more sophisticated draft PSO contract covering
all passenger services. Thus, the project has fully achieved its target related to developing
experience with public service contracts, which is the form of contract that is expected to be used
in the future.



                                                   12
50.      In 2009, the project initiated a pilot in which TCDD prepared its first Network Statement
in the format required by the EU (The Network Statement is the document in which railways in the
EU define the terms under which competing railway undertakings can have access to the railway
infrastructure. It includes the access pricing methodology). The project was to finance further
elaboration of the Network Statement, but TCDD obtained grant funds from the EU for this
purpose. With this support, TCDD further elaborated and refined the network statement. Thus the
project, in cooperation with EU, fully achieved its target related to developing experience with
access pricing.

51.     The project also contributed to greater transparency and accountability of TCDD by (a)
requiring and financing the first external audits of TCDD according to International Financial
Reporting Standards, (b) financing an Internal Financial Controls Risk Assessment of TCDD, and
(c) monitoring the implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning Program, the
implementation of which was a legal covenant. The project-financed TA on Freight Marketing
raised TCDD’s awareness of what it would need to do to compete with other train operators in an
open access environment, also preparing it for reforms. TCDD is gradually implementing the
project-financed TA on Maintenance Practices (also a legal covenant), improving the cost
efficiency of its maintenance practices. The stakeholder surveys conducted under the project
penetrated TCDD management complacency by giving them an unfiltered perspective on how
customers, employees and other stakeholders view their performance. Finally, the project greatly
surpassed its intermediate target for TCDD staff trained (2,500 vs. 362 trained directly plus 12,788
trained by staff who received training of trainers instruction). The achievement of the reform
component is assessed as substantial.

3.3     Efficiency

52.      Original analysis: At appraisal, the economic analysis of component A was performed
using a stylized model that considered the actual and forecast freight traffic on the line sections,
and the impact of the proposed investments on available line capacity in a defined ‘do-nothing’
scenario and a defined ‘do-something’ scenario. The economic benefits were defined as the
additional revenue that would be realized from additional traffic that could be carried on these line
sections, following the increase in capacity, in the defined ‘do-something’ scenario. The analysis
showed that component A would be economically viable, returning a positive NPV of YTL 44.6
million. The Economic Internal Rate of Return was 15 percent, and the estimated benefit-cost ratio
1.29. The original financial benefits of the project were derived from: (i) the additional revenue to
be realized from additional freight traffic that can be carried as a result of investments for capacity
improvements and (ii) the reduction in labor cost as a result of a significant staff reduction during
the period 2005-2010. The original financial analysis indicated that the project would be financially
viable, returning a very high net present value (NPV) of US$405 million at a discount rate of 12
percent, following an investment of US$129 million for capacity improvements on the line sections,
US$93 million for compensation incentives offered to TCDD staff for voluntary departures, as well
as US$238 million for structural cost of retirement benefits, which was an accrued liability. The
financial internal rate of return was estimated to about 50 percent. It was expected that the
investments planned for the railways under the project would lead to substantial improvements in
the overall financial position of TCDD. The railway deficit was expected to decrease by about 30
percent in 6 years from US$548 million in 2004 to US$380 million in 2010. Railway revenues were
expected to grow annually by about 10 percent during this same six year period as a result of the
combination of (i) an estimated traffic growth of 6 percent per annum driven by modernization and
rehabilitation of infrastructure financed under the project, the ongoing Ankara-Istanbul
rehabilitation project financed by the Spanish bilateral fund, and a new commuter rail system in
Izmir and (ii) a more commercially oriented tariff policy.


                                                  13
53.      A reassessment of the economic return of the project was undertaken after project closing
and is summarized in Annex 3. The main economic benefits derive from the retrenchment program
and the physical components. The severance payment component has an economic internal rate of
return (EIRR) of 95 percent. This is typical for such projects as a proportion of those taking the
payments immediately become productive and in any case TCDD immediately saves the annual
cost of supervising the staff, providing them with uniforms, offices and supplies. The physical
component of the project is expected to generate an EIRR of 9 percent (assuming completion by
end-2016), which is typical for a signaling project and is largely attributable to the increased
capacity it provides at a time of increasing traffic and to the external benefits that it generates by
being able to accommodate traffic otherwise travelling by road. This EIRR for the physical
component increases to 13 percent if an allowance is made for the potential reduction in the
economic transport operating cost by rail compared to road.

54.     The two components combined give an EIRR of 21 percent and up to 25 percent if the
transport operating cost reductions eventuate. Thus efficiency is rated Substantial under the
scenario of project completion by 2016.


3.4.    Justification of the Overall Outcome Rating

55.     Original PDO: Progress toward the original PDO is rated as MU, and is given a weight of
31 percent, based on disbursement at the time the PDO was revised.

56.      Revised PDO: Progress toward the revised PDO is given a weight of 69 percent based on
disbursement at the time the PDO was revised. The assessment of the revised PDO gives equal
weight to the two parts, improved service related to signaling and preparation for reforms. While
improved services (signaling) represent the lion's share of the disbursement, preparing to
implement reforms is highly relevant in light of the Turkey's passage of the Law on Liberalization
of Railway Transportation of Turkey in 2013. The part of the PDO related to improved service
(signaling) is rated as follows: relevance is high, but efficiency is modest and achievement of
objectives is modest, giving an overall rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory for the physical
improvements part of the PDO.

57.     The part of the PDO related to preparation for reforms has high relevance, Substantial
efficiency and Substantial achievement for an overall rating of Satisfactory.

58.     Combining these elements, weighting the original PDO rating MU and the revised PDO
rating MU for service improvement (signaling) and S for preparation for reforms by their
disbursement amounts yields an overall rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory.
(0.31*3)+(0.69*[0.5*2+0.5*5])=3.34.

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

59.     In 2013, the Turkish Parliament passed legislation to reform the structure of the railway
industry in Turkey (Law on Liberalization of Railway Transportation of Turkey, effective May 1,
2013). The law splits TCDD into an infrastructure provider and a train operating company and
authorizes private train operators to compete using access to the national railway infrastructure
managed by TCDD. This law, together with the Decree Law on the Organization and Duties of the
Ministry of Transportation of Turkey (November 1, 2011), substantially aligns the structure of the
Turkish railway sector with key elements of the EU Railway Legislation. Four legislations are
necessary to allow private entities to operate in the network: (i) the Infrastructure Access legislation
and (ii) the Rolling Stock Registry legislation, and (iii) Safety legislation were approved

                                                  14
respectively in 2014 and 2015, while (iv) legislation on licensing has been prepared, endorsed by
the Government but not published yet, due to delays in 2015 related to electoral uncertainties.

60.     Under the new railway law, railway passenger services will be financed through a PSO
contract with the Ministry of Transport and funded through its budget. The Railway Regulation
Department of MoT has indicated that the draft PSO contact prepared under the project will be a
model for the contract they negotiate with TCDD Trains. Likewise, under the new railway law,
access to the railway infrastructure will be allowed starting in 2014, and this will require TCDD to
issue the Network Statement. Because of the project activities on PSO and Network Statement,
TCDD and the Government of Turkey are prepared to take these important reform steps.

4.          Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

61.     The risk to the development outcome of the signaling component is rated significant. The
signaling investment implementation continues to be delayed due to limited project management
capacity, suspension of contractor’s activities, and/or continued problems with theft and vandalism.

62.     The risk to the development outcome of the reform component is rated moderate. Under
the new railway law, railway passenger services will be financed through a PSO contract with the
Ministry of Transport and funded through its budget, likely in 2015. Likewise, under the new
railway law, access to the railway infrastructure requires TCDD to issue the Network Statement.
Because of the project activities on PSO and Network Statement, TCDD and the Government of
Turkey were prepared to take these important reform steps. Both activities were completed within
the time frame of the project, and before the passage of the new railway law.

5.          Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1         Bank Performance

(a)         Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

63.      Bank performance at Project Entry is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory because (a) the
project design reflected excessive optimism about reform timing and what could be accomplished
without legislation; (b) inadequate implementation arrangements due to other-reliance on PIU’s
capacity 8 ; (c) insufficient risk analysis and mitigation measures at the outset; (d) the bidding
documents were not ready by appraisal; (e) due diligence in readying TCDD organization had not
been fully carried out; (f) the staff retrenchment component of the program was not fully developed
at the time of appraisal and was lacking targets; and (g) no land acquisition and resettlement
framework had been prepared at appraisal. The latter required an assessment of the Affected People
to be done during the course of the project implementation in order to deal with land acquisition
and resettlement associated with the construction of the passing loops and the creation of a logistic
center at Yenice station. The logistics park at Yenice had not been proposed during project
preparation; however, there should have been a LARF in case land acquisition for station loops
became necessary.

(b)         Quality of Supervision

64.     The Bank restructured the project three times and in a timely fashion to adapt to delayed
reforms and other issues affecting the project performance. Both the Bank’s sector specialists and

8   See Section 2.2 c.


                                                 15
local staff extended large efforts to (i) address inadequacies in Quality at Entry, and (ii) facilitate
the project implementation. While the Bank at an early stage identified deficiencies during
implementation, the proposed remedies remained insufficient vis-à-vis the lack of capacity on the
Borrower side. Consistent with these efforts, the Bank strengthened its project supervision by
mobilizing additional specialized staff. First, a senior international staff overseeing the
infrastructure portfolio including transport projects was hired in the Country Management Unit in
October 2012. Second, during the period 2011-13, the Bank recruited a railway signaling expert,
requested in-house support from seasoned project implementation specialists during review
missions, and convinced TCDD to hire a Claim Specialist and to retain the construction supervision
consultants after project closing. The Bank supervision took adequate steps in dealing with
resettlement, by (i) requesting the implementing agency to survey affected people, (ii) supporting
the preparation of a RAP, and (iii) restructuring the project to create obligations to implement the
RAP. The Borrower expressed deep appreciation for the Bank’s support (see Annex 5, Borrower
Report). Highly relevant technical support was extended during the project, targeting strategic,
technical and project management medium and long term needs. The Bank formulated adequate
recommendations to TCDD dealing with contractors, construction supervision. There were 16
Bank missions/ISRs during the life of the project, an average of more than two per year. The
quality of supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory, as the Bank could have taken earlier actions
to respond in a timely manner to the emergence of significant project risks by restructuring the
project sooner.

(c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

65.    The Bank’s performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory, considering on one side the
shortcomings of the project preparation and on the other side, the substantial efforts extended by
the Bank to mitigate the major risks towards achievement of the PDO.

5.2      Borrower Performance

Government Performance

66.      Under the original PDO, the government prepared the necessary legislation, though it did
not introduce it. Under the revised PDO, Treasury followed up on the reform on a regular basis
with TCDD at the urging of the Bank and actively participated in the pilot PSO activities. The
Ministry of Transport, through the establishment of a dedicated and capable Railway General
Directorate, was committed to the implementation of the new law which ultimately passed at the
time when the legislature was ready to consider and approved it. The overall government’s
performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory considering the delays in implementing the reform.

Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

67.     Overall, the implementing agency was committed and took ownership in delivering the
technical assistance program, carrying out the necessary social and environmental activities and
extending the construction supervision contract beyond loan closing date. The signaling investment
component was not completed by the project closing date largely because of TCDD’s internal
capacity and a lack of leadership and coordination at government level. The Bank proposed that
TCDD should change the project manager designated in the contract with the signaling contractor,
from someone in TCDD Headquarters responsible for all signaling activities to either a qualified
and dedicated TCDD staff or delegated to the supervision consultant 9 . TCDD argued that the

9 The Aide Memoire dated February 20, 2010 p.3 requested two changes in management of the project to accelerate

implementation: (i) the supervision consultant would be named as “project manager” for purposes of the TCDD contract
with the signaling contractor; (ii) TCDD management would appoint a Project Director to carry out TCDD’s duties as
                                                        16
structure had to remain intact but agreed to involve HQ managers more in project supervision. The
limited capacity of the Project Implementation Unit to deal with large scale contracts under
international competitive bidding was apparent. Multiple capital expenditures supervised by TCDD
resulted in thin capacities, for instance, delaying internal processes of the PIU, which delayed
resolving core project implementation issues. Multiple internal reviews resulted in long delays
which at times hindered progress of the contractor. Despite these shortcomings the implementation
agency performance is overall rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

69.     Taking into consideration that both Government and implementing agency ratings are
Moderately Satisfactory the combined rating is also Moderately Satisfactory, despite TCDD’s
project management shortcomings.

6.        Lessons Learned

70.      The use of adaptable program lending instrument involving investment components may
not leave the Bank’s supervision team with enough leverage to link the progress of physical
components with the reform milestones. In this particular case, the project frontloaded the railway
reform as a precondition for further project implementation. Because the reform itself was delayed,
the entire project implementation was delayed, putting at risk the achievement of the original PDO.
While this risk was highlighted during project preparation, the project’s processing records indicate
that the submission of the railway laws to the Parliament was seen as crucial to ensure the
sustainability of the project. Instead, recent Bank’s interventions in other Middle Income Countries
indicate that a sustained sector dialogue in parallel to project implementation can sometimes be
more influential than the use of formal triggers within an investment project. The project
development objective should be realistically achievable through the project and not depend on the
passage of legislation, which the Borrower may not be able to pass. If no mitigation measure can
be taken to address some of the political risks, the project design should be revised accordingly

71.      Railway reform remains a complex, ambitious and time consuming activity. During the
course of the project, TCDD and MoT needed more studies and internal consultations to finalize
the reform agenda. As for any sector reform, it is advisable to carry out comprehensive due
diligence of the IA’s organization to absorb and adapt to the structural changes, and to implement
timely and realistic objectives, with thorough risk assessment and mitigation measures. In house
capacity, strategic and advisory support to strengthen the railway historical organization’s ability
to restructure itself is suitable. Establishing a Railway Sector Working Group at the outset of the
project would have been an important institutional feature to coincide with the reform process.
Given that the financing for TCDD was coming from funds lent to Treasury and then on-granted
to TCDD, it stands to reason that higher level policy institutions, such as Treasury, would have a
more active role in overseeing the reforms and implementation throughout the course of the
project. In future engagements of this kind, a Working Group should be maintained through project
implementation and should be convened regularly with minutes of meetings to document project
implementation progress and achievement of development objectives. The PIU could have featured
a dedicated technical team member to document this process continuously in order for the process
to remain on track or to ensure that corrective action was taken in a timely manner.




“employer” in TCDD’s contract with the signaling contractor. This person would (a) be fully responsible for the signaling
and station loop extension project, (b) have the authority delegated from the General Director of TCDD to take all
decisions related to the signaling and station loop extension project, and (c) be dedicated full time to the signaling and
station loop extension project.
                                                           17
72.     Railway sector reform in Turkey followed a similar pattern to energy sector reform (e.g.
privatization of electric distribution companies). In both cases, the Bank teams anticipated policy
reforms well before they materialized and the respective operations designed in both sectors to
coincide with the reform process, indeed being dependent on such reforms, were unable to fully
meet their development objectives by project completion. Having noted this, the Government
has in both cases proceeded with the necessary legal/regulatory reforms, but well after when they
were originally anticipated.

73.     Implementation structure of the client should be well assessed at the time of project
preparation. The project suffered from decentralized review process outside the PIU itself, as well
as from complexity within the PIU to formulate decisions. TCDD management that took over early
2015 recognized the need for reform and committed to and even sought Bank assistance in
addressing managerial and financial weaknesses. It is suggested in the future to strengthen project
management by implementing a dedicated program management team with decision making staff
being closer to project site and populated by staff with adequate skills covering the entire technical
spectrum of the project. Such program management units have been successfully deployed under
other Bank financed projects in other sectors in Turkey.

74.      When the implementing agency has limited experience with procurement of technically
complex investments such as signaling, greater Bank provision of technical support and training
for the preparation of the bidding documents and the management/supervision of such contracts is
advisable. Such investment in high quality bidding documents can save considerable time and
resources at project implementation.

75.      When land acquisition is not planned within a project but is a possibility, the preparation
of a land acquisition and resettlement plan and reference to that document in the loan agreement,
will facilitate addressing land acquisition, should it arise in the execution of the project.

76.     Coordination with other development partners remains essential. The EU technical
assistance was considered sufficient at the time of the project preparation to address most of the
capacity building and institutional strengthening issues. TCDD developed its capacity during
implementation, with support from the Bank, but the due diligence of TCDD’s large scale project
management and signaling project management capacity had not been fully carried out upfront and
addressed during preparation, including for procurement and contract management.

77.     To ensure that the procurement process excludes firms that routinely underbid and make
up the financial gap through change orders, bidder qualifications may include demonstration of
successful implementation of comparable projects within the originally bid amount.

78.      Staff retrenchment remains a difficult and sensitive activity to be undertaken as part of
railway restructuring programs due to the associated social safeguards and necessary political
coordination with labor unions. In this respect, the government’s ability to drive this process
constitutes a key vector towards successful implementation. In view of the tremendous time and
efforts that are necessary to negotiate with social partners and eventually achieve results, there is a
risk that retrenchment programs could divert government’s attention from other core operational
restructuring steps.

79.      Signaling projects can potentially be implemented in an effective manner due to their
relative simplicity and their limited environmental and social impacts. However, the procurement
of signaling systems remains challenging, particularly when associating both design and
implementation into one contract. The replacement of the contractor was not an option partly
because the design of the signaling components were tailored to the project, and dedicated
equipment was implemented and adapted specifically to the lines operations, hence creating major
                                                  18
difficulty in the event of the contractor’s replacement. There are also risks of lock-in for the future
maintenance of the equipment to be installed. Two recommendations can be formulated. First, it is
advisable to mitigate the risks inherent to the procurement of signaling by strengthening the
technical capacity of the IA and providing strong analytical support to ensure that the proposed
options are correct. Second, the Bank, which currently relies on external independent expertise to
review the technical specifications may also consider developing technical capacity in that area.

7.      Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)     Borrower/implementing agencies

80.     TCDD formulated in its Borrower Report (see Annex 7) a number of constructive
comments. First regarding project procurement, TCDD highlighted the need for the bidding
documents to be reviewed thoroughly at a legal level, in order to mitigate and frame potential
disputes during the course of the project. Enhanced communication with interested bidders should
also be promoted, and communication efforts to raise public awareness shall also be extended.
TCDD also formulated comments regarding the project design vis-à-vis political willingness to
implement the project or some of the project’s components. At a project management level, TCDD
acknowledges the need to turn the PIU into a more efficient and professional organization,
simplifying internal reporting mechanisms and procedures. Finally TCDD is ready to concentrate
more efforts towards the implementation of enhanced project performance monitoring and
evaluation.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

BACKGROUND

1.       The project has two components that are included in the economic evaluation:
        Severance payments to accelerate the retirement of TCDD staff that were surplus to
         operational requirements;
        The upgrade of signaling systems, lengthening of passing loops and the installation of
         improved tunnel ventilation systems on four sections of line: Bogazkopru – Ulukisla,
         Ulukisla – Yenice and Mersin – Toprakkale via Yenice and Adana.
2.        Of these, the Ulukisla – Yenice link, which is the main north-south link serving Mersin
port, is close to capacity and the project will eliminate this bottleneck and, together with the upgrade
works on the other lines, approximately double the capacity of this line in terms of net tons.
3.      The project became effective in 2006 and severance payments for the voluntary early
retirement of 1,596 TCDD staff were completed in 2009. The physical works began in 2009 but
have not yet been completed. It is currently expected that these will now be completed sometime
in 2016; however, in view of past delays this is not guaranteed and the revised evaluation therefore
assumes that the project is not completed until 2017.
4.      Freight traffic on the TCDD network has steadily increased at 1.8% p.a. over the last 10
years. This period has included the 2008 financial crisis, when freight traffic throughout most
European adjoining countries reduced sharply, as well as the difficulties created by the wars in Iraq
and Syria. There seems no reason to suppose this growth will slow significantly and this has been
adopted for the duration of the evaluation period.
5.       Since the IBRD capacity component of the project began, TCDD have also decided to
electrify the sections between Bogazkopru and Yenice. This work is taking place simultaneously
with the final stages of the IBRD project and will generate benefits over and above those due to the
IBRD project alone. For the purposes of evaluation, the electrification has not been considered and
the capacity component evaluation is instead based on what could be expected to be the benefits of
the IBRD project alone based on the current project assessment.


IDENTIFICATION OF COSTS
6.       The estimated economic cost of the project (i.e. excluding VAT) is taken as $124 million.

IDENTIFICATION OF BENEFITS

7.       From an economic perspective, the project has three main potential benefits:
        The severance payments allow surplus labor resources to be at least partially redeployed to
         other areas of the economy;
        The installation of CTC reduces sectional running times and hence increases line capacity
         in terms of trains;
        The lengthening of passing loops from the present 450 meters to 750 meters allows train
         lengths to be increased by 65 percent, thus increasing the net tons per train possible on this
         section.

Severance payments

8.     This section evaluates the benefits of the labor severance payments, which enabled
redundant staff to be redeployed to more productive activities. These staff were fully employed by
                                                  22
the railways, although not undertaking any productive work and the railways thus saved the full
cost of the salary and social benefit contributions.
9.       At the time of the PAD in 2005, the normal retirement payment was about US$25,000 for
blue color workers with 25-30 years of service, and US$15,000, based on the number of years of
service (at annual rates of US$1,000 for blue color and US$500 for white color). The minimum
number of years of service to be eligible for retirement was 25 years for men and 20 years for
women, with a mandatory retirement age is 65 for both men and women. The pension payment
averaged about 40 percent of salary for blue color and 70 percent for white color. The annual gross
salary at that time averaged about US$19,000 for blue color and US$12,000 for white color. By
2008, the average over all employees had increased to nearly US$25,000, about 30 percent more
than in 2005.
10.     In practice, the total payment made under this component of the project was US$19.942
million or US$12,495 per employee. This indicates that most of the staff who took the payment
were white-collar staff who had worked for TCDD for around 10-15 years and who likely would
be able to find another job. If they had not taken the severance payment, they would presumably
have remained at TCDD until another round of severance payments induced them to quit. For the
purposes of the re-evaluation, this has been assumed as five years but in practice they could remain
at TCDD for many more years.
11.      The economic benefits of labor severance are a direct function of whether retrenched staff
will be re-employed. Past experience shows a proportion never work again, either from their own
wishes or through lack of opportunity; the economic benefit in their case is thus only the labor-
related supervision and service costs (estimated at about 30 percent of labor costs or US$5000 p.a.
for those accepted the payments) that were saved by TCDD together with the benefit (or cost)
people experience through no longer working; this latter element has been ignored in the evaluation.
Those staff who are re-employed productively, possibly after an interval, will, however, make a
contribution to the economy which can be assumed equal to their employment cost.
12.     Taking into account the likely age structure and skills of those who were retrenched, the
economic evaluation conservatively assumes 25 percent of those retrenched never worked again,
and that a further 25 percent only did so after a delay of one year.


Reduced sectional times
13.      The installation of CTC will reduce sectional running times because of the faster
transaction time of CTC-based control compared to manual control at individual stations. It also
reduces delays by enabling a more strategic approach to real-time train priorities. These
improvements will vary for each situation as it depends on the ratio of the transaction time to the
existing running time but would typically be 20-30 percent, thus increasing capacity by around that
amount.
14.     The potential capacity benefits are discussed in the next section, as they are essentially a
function of network capacity rather than sectional capacity but the reductions in sectional running
times apply regardless (to a first approximation) of what is happening elsewhere on the network.
15.      In 2012, the lines on which the improvements are being undertaken had a combined total
of 2.058 million passenger train-km and 1.701 million freight train-km (1.105 million between
Yenice and Bogazkopru and 0.596 million between Mersin and Toprakkale). In mixed traffic,
passenger trains have priority over freight trains and no benefits have been included for any change
in their commercial speed. However, freight trains typically incur significant delays when capacity
is limited. The 2012 project restructuring estimated commercial freight train speeds of 25 km/hr
between Yenice and Bogazkopru and 35 km/hr on the Mersin – Toprakkale section, which were


                                                23
expected to increase to 35 km/hr and 45 km/hr respectively. This suggests that when CTC is
introduced, freight trains will save about 16,400 train-hours per annum over the project lines.
16.      An hour of time saved for a typical freight train in the project area will save one
locomotive-hour, one train-crew hour and 20 wagon-hours. This will create savings in train-crew
and locomotive maintenance costs (of about US$80 per hour), in locomotive capital (of about
US$70 per hour for the type used on these sections) and wagon capital (about US$1 per wagon-
hour); the total cost is thus about US$170 per train-hour, or US$2.8 million per annum. This will
increase over time if the project were not done, as the without-project commercial speeds of 25
km/hr and 35 km/hr would continue to reduce. The potential savings have been increased at 2.5
percent per annum to allow for this.
Increased network capacity
17.       The Yenice – Ulukisla section of the network carried 3.8 million net tons in 2012, some 15
percent of the total traffic carried on TCDD, and has been close to capacity for several years. It is
thus effectively a bottleneck which restricts traffic to and from Mersin port. Increasing the capacity
of this link will therefore free up rail traffic to and from the Yenice/Mersin region, improving rail’s
competitiveness compared to road.
18.      In the absence of the project, rail traffic transiting this link has been assumed to be
constrained at its current level from 2015 onwards. The project not only increases the number of
train paths but also, by lengthening passing loops allows freight trains of up to 33 wagons, a 65
percent increase on what is currently possible and sufficient for the foreseeable future.
19.     The potential reductions in economic transport costs of such an increase in rail traffic are
probably positive but not likely to be significantly so. Average revenue in 2012 was TL 0.046/ntkm,
around US$0.023, which should cover above-rail costs but do little to contribute to infrastructure.
The base evaluation has therefore erred on the conservative side and omitted any such benefits.
Average truck tariffs in Turkey are typically about US$0.08/ntkm in the forward direction and
about US$ 0.04/ntkm in the backloaded direction. Depending on the balance of these flows, rail
could show savings in economic costs of up to US$0.02/ntkm. Sensitivity tests have been
undertaken to show the impact of assuming such savings to be either $US0.01/ntkm or
$US0.02/ntkm.
20.     Regardless of any savings in transport costs themselves, traffic which diverts to rail from
road will generate significant reductions in external costs, such as road accidents, emissions, etc.
The most comprehensive study of these was undertaken in 201110 and estimated the differential
external costs of road compared to diesel railway for freight traffic for each EU country. Using an
average of the figures for Croatia and Slovakia as a proxy for Turkey, this study gave a differential
external cost of US$0.015c/ntk (US$2008) in favour of rail and this has been used in the evaluation
as the benefit from the diverted traffic.
21.     These benefits accrue throughout the entire distance of the freight journey; this has been
taken as 460 km, the average for TCDD. As this benefit is closely linked to real increases in income
through the value of human life, value of travel time etc., these benefits have been increased at 2
percent p.a.

23.       The severance payment component has an EIRR of 95 percent. This is typical for such
projects as a proportion of those taking the payments immediately become productive and in any
case TCDD immediately saves the annual cost, over and above the direct wages cost, of supervising
the staff, providing them with uniforms, offices and supplies.
24.      The physical component of the project is expected to generate (assuming completion by
end-2016) an EIRR of 9 percent, largely attributable to the increased capacity it provides at a time
of increasing traffic and to the external benefits that it generates by being able to accommodate
traffic otherwise travelling by road.
25.     The two components combined give an EIRR of 21 percent (but note that the original PAD
did not appear to evaluate the severance component).
26.     When potential benefits from reduced transport costs by rail are included (para 17), the
EIRR of the physical component increases to 11 percent and 13 percent respectively with
corresponding increases in the overall EIRR for both the severance component and capacity
enhancement component to 23 percent and 25 percent.

27.       The severance payment component has an EIRR of 95 percent. This is typical for such
projects as a proportion of those taking the payments immediately become productive and in any
case TCDD immediately saves the annual cost, over and above the direct wages cost, of supervising
the staff, providing them with uniforms, offices and supplies.
28.      The physical component of the project is expected to generate (assuming completion by
end-2016) an EIRR of 9 percent, largely attributable to the increased capacity it provides at a time
of increasing traffic and to the external benefits that it generates by being able to accommodate
traffic otherwise travelling by road.
29.     The two components combined give an EIRR of 21 percent (but note that the original PAD
did not appear to evaluate the severance component).
30.     When potential benefits from reduced transport costs by rail are included (para 17), the
EIRR of the physical component increases to 11 percent and 13 percent respectively with
corresponding increases in the overall EIRR for both the severance component and capacity
enhancement component to 23 percent and 25 percent.

    A. INTRODUCTION
    1. Turkey's geopolitical position - as a link between Europe and Asia - makes the transport
       sector crucial for the economic development of the region. Turkey is a major player both
       as a transit country and as an origin and destination of freight. The political developments
       with regard to the EU accession process and the growing role of Turkey in trade between
       Central Asia and the South Caucasus with an enlarged European market make the focus on
       transport even more important.

    2. The Government requested the assistance of the World Bank in both roles as an
       independent advisor and as a financier. With its experiences all around the world in
       restructuring railway national companies, the Bank is certainly in a unique position to
       provide appropriate advice and to work in close cooperation with the EU to help TCDD to
       reduce its financial losses and in meeting the EU accession requirements. Financing would
       be required to support consultancy services, staff retrenchment, and some financially sound
       rehabilitation of infrastructure and operating assets.

    3. The Turkey Railways Restructuring Project (Loan No. 4787 TU) was approved on June 9,
       2005 and is originally scheduled to close on June 30, 2012. The closure date has then
       extended to 31st of December 2013. The amount of World Bank loan for this project is
       Euro 143,7 million.

Statement of Objectives
    4. The overall objective of the program was to improve the financial viability, productivity,
       and effectiveness of railways operations.

    5. The objectives of the project were revised on 05 June 2009 dated loan agreement and the
       revised objectives became as follows;
           a. Improve the effectiveness of railway operations on the Mersin-Toprakkale and
               Yenice-Boğazköprü lines by increasing capacity and improving service quality,
               and



                                                32
            b. Lay the groundwork for restructuring TCDD by developing experience with
               financially viable contract arrangements for loss making public services and access
               pricing of infrastructure.

Project Components:

    6. The project is based on 6 components which are as follows;

            Component A. Line Capacity Increase
            Component B. Staff Adjustment and Social Plan

The Assessment of this Component is Highly Satisfactory as all intended trainings have been
provided with success.


Component E: TCDD Public Communication and Periodic Surveys
Three user surveys were conducted between 2009 and 2012. The last survey in 2012 found an
overall improvement in stakeholder perceptions of TCDD and its services. In particular, the overall
perception of passengers of TCDD’s reputation, management and institutional image increased by
12 -15%, as compared with the same survey in 2009.


The Assessment of Component E is highly satisfactory.




                                                35
Fiduciary Assessment: In line with the loan agreement, TCDD has set related financial systems
and independent auditing mechanism for the project.
The Borrower through TCDD, at appraisal, developed a procurement plan for project
implementation, which provides the basis for the procurement methods. The procurement plan has
been implemented in accordance to the World Bank Guidelines and rules.
The Allocation of Loan for Railways Restructuring Project Activities is as Follows:

C- ASSESSMENT OF THE BANK’S ROLE AND THE BORROWER’S PERFORMANCE

The Bank responded quickly and comprehensively to the request of borrower and supported
the components well. Staff spent considerable time assisting the PIU with procedural issues
such as hiring design and supervision consultants and the preparation of bidding documents,
and Bank procedures. Importantly, World Bank Resident Mission staff played a large and
critical role in the smooth operation of the project.

Bank performance is rated as highly satisfactory.

The Borrower performance is rated satisfactory. The PIU’s performance as satisfactory because,
though it faced a number of challenges from the beginning, it managed to successfully needed to
work well with a multitude of agencies, and developed the capacity to effectively coordinate the
project activities. The government was in full support of the construction and infrastructure
components.


        D- IMPACT ASSESSMENT

Objective 1: Improve the effectiveness of railway operations on the Mersin-Toprakkale and
Yenice-Boğazköprü lines by increasing capacity and improving service quality,

The physical progress as of 31st of December 2013 is 74 % and the rate of this objective (a) is
Moderately Unsatisfactory, as the line is not operational and the related objective has not been met.




                                                 36
Objective 2: Lay the groundwork for restructuring TCDD by developing experience with
financially viable contract arrangements for loss making public services and access pricing of
infrastructure.

To achieve objective (b); TCDD has been involved in an array of activities which contains;

             a. A new Prime Minister’s decree has been issued to provide subsidies to 40
                uneconomical passenger trains. The decree would be valid until the establishment
                of TCDD Transportation Company.

             b. TCDD started a study for Rationalization and Preparing a Passenger Service
                Obligation (PSO) Contract for Passenger Services at March 2010. The
                Consultant has prepared a draft PSO Contract for the use of TCDD and
                rationalized passenger trains.

             c. TCDD obtained a grant from EU for Turkish Railway Reform Project. The study
                of “Strengthening Capacity of Prospective Infrastructure Manager at New TCDD
                on Infrastructure Allocation and Charging” was done within the scope of this EU
                project. Related staff was trained and increased capacity.

             d. Furthermore, MoT and TCDD are actively implementing the Law on
                Liberalization of Railway Transportation of Turkey (effective May 1, 2013) and
                the Decree Law on the Organization and Duties of the Ministry of Transportation,
                Maritime Affairs and Communications (November 1, 2011). This Law requires
                TCDD (rail Infrastructure Company) and TCDD Transport (train operating
                company to register separately and to separate their respective staff and assets. The
                Railway Regulation Department of MoT prepared a secondary legislation on
                safety, registration and licensing, and access which was begun to be put in force
                starting from 2014.

The rate of this objective (b) is satisfactory.


        E- OVERALL ASSESSMENT

The assessment of the project component by component is provided below. In order to have the
overall assessment the following issues are considered in addition:
     The enactment of the Liberalization Law was too late that prevented to get full
         benefits/impact of the projects designed at 2004.
     The capacity of the TCDD has improved significantly in line with modernization and
         liberalization objectives of the institution. In that regard, the project provided TCDD many
         tools, guidelines as well as vision to accomplish the objectives.
     On the other hand, being the main and the major component of the Project, the failure to
         accomplish the Component A- the Boğazköprü- Yenice, Mersin – Toprakkale
         Signalization project, has caused both not to meet one of the main objective of the project
         but also had negative impact on meeting TCDD’s financial and operational improvement
         targets. This has also adversely affected the reputation of the institution.


                                                  37
Under these facts, the overall assessment of this project is moderately unsatisfactory currently, yet
is very close to be moderately satisfactory if the physical achievements can be met with component
A as soon as possible.

Lessons Learned;

            e. Conditions of Contract need to be reviewed by an experienced engineer and a
               lawyer before entering the tendering stage. It would be wise to make sure any
               clauses which may lead to disputes be revised accordingly
            f. Prior to Contract Award, it would be wise to conduct a Debriefing Meeting with
               the potential successful bidders as to make sure they have understood the project,
               the contract and their responsibilities and liabilities before signing the contract.
            g. It would be wise to conduct an effective PR (public relations) in order to enhance
               the Public Awareness for the proposed project.
            h. If the project, or the component of a project, has links to a political decision, it
               needs to be staged or formulated to be implemented after the political decision is
               taken.
            i. The overall project management should be organized by only one unit and the
               related responsibilities and authority should not be divided to separate
               departments.
            j. Internal Monitoring and Evaluation of the projects needs to be improved.
