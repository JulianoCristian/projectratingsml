           Project focuses on three objectives: 1) re-enforcing the\n            social safety net to protect Indonesia's poor and\n            preserve human assets during the difficult times; 2)\n            supporting efforts to stabilize the economy by helping\n            restore banks and businesses to financial health, maintain\n            physical assets, and resume growth; and 3) strengthening\n            institutions to support sustainable growth. It will deepen\n            and build policy reforms that have been undertaken since the\n            initial Policy Reform Support Loan in July, 1998. The\n            project will contribute to economic stabilization,\n            subsequent recovery, and renewed poverty-reducing growth.\n            The financial resources provided under this loan will help\n            Indonesia avoid an even larger transitional decline in\n            consumption and investment. The stimulus provided by a\n            temporarily large budget deficit, financed in part by this\n            loan, will help sustain aggregate demand. Most of the risks\n            identified can be mitigated by the Bank. Nevertheless,\n            political uncertainties remain paramount in determining the\n            magnitude of the risks. With the open election scheduled for\n            June. 1999, it is unclear which political coalition will\n            emerge to form the new leadership. The credibility of the\n            next government will depend on the public's perception\n            of fairness in the election process."}, "docdt": "1999-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
