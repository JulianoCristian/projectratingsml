REP UBLIC OF INDONESIA - SECOND POLICY REFORM SUPPORT LOAN
REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
SECOND POLICY REFORM SUPPORT LOAN
LOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
Borrower       Republic of Indonesia
Amount         US$ 500 million
Terms          Single currency loan(SCL) in US dollars, with standard amortization terms, grace
period and interest rate for fixed-rate US dollar single currency loan with an
expected disbursement period of 0-3 years.
Description    The proposed loan would provide balance of payments and budgetary assistance to
the Republic of Indonesia to support policy reforms designed to:
* Rebuild an efficient banking sector and get potentially productive assets
back to work by dealing with bad debt, reestablishing effective financial
services and restructuring corporations; and
* Help build a foundation for renewed growth, by implementing actions that
reduce corruption and increase the transparency and efficiency of public
and private sector activities.
It deepens and builds on policy reforms that have been undertaken during the past
eighteen months (i.e. since the ongoing crisis began) and which the Bank initially
supported with a US$1 billion Policy Reform Support Loan in July, 1998.
Benefits       This operation will contribute to economic stabilization, subsequent recovery and
renewed poverty-reducing growth. The financial resources provided under this
loan will help Indonesia avoid an even larger transitional decline in consumption
and investment (including investments in human resources).  The stimulus
provided by a temporarily large budget deficit, financed in part by this loan, will
help sustain aggregate demand.
Risks           * Uncertainty associated with political transition.
* The possibility of govemment paralysis on reform as political pressures and
campaign pressures interfere with decision making.
* Continued fragility of the banking system and pressure for rising government
expenditures possibly undermining the commitment to prudent fiscal
management.
* The possibility of social unrest due to rising unemployment, increasing prices
and falling real incomes.
* Limitations in administrative capacity, coupled with opposition from vested
interests.

REPUBLIC OFINDONESIA -SECOND POLICYREFORMSUPPORTLOAN
The Bank cannot fully insulate this operation from these risks. But steps have
been taken to reduce these risks. First, the Bank has engaged in an extensive
consultative process with civil society in an effort to ensure that there is substantial
public support and commitment to special actions prior to this operation being
finalized. Second, the possibility of government paralysis on reforms is being
reduced by having a clear agreed program of actions in advance and by having key
reforms implemented prior to Board presentation. As many of the actions are in
reality limited to important first steps (e.g. closing banks, nationalizing banks, and
designating selected banks as eligible for recapitalization; establishing the Jakarta
Initiative; enacting anti corruption legislation; and enacting a competition law),
though, the risk remains that these reforms may not be adequately implemented
over time. Third, the effective implementation of social programs will be critical
in containing the risk of social unrest. The Bank's proposed parallel Social Safety
Net Adjustment Loan (SSNAL) to Indonesia is designed to support this effort.
Fourth, the risk of inadequate administrative capacity is being mitigated through
the provision of extensive technical assistance and by basing the loan on actions
already implemented, rather than actions promised.  Nevertheless, political
uncertainties remain paramount in determining the magnitude of these risks. With
open elections scheduled for June 7, 1999, it is unclear which political coalition
will emerge to form the country's new leadership. The credibility of the next
government will depend on the public's perception of fairness in the election
process.

instructed to prepare anti-corruption strategies and to review existing contracts. As a result more than 100 contracts
(worth about Rp. 10 trillion) were cancelled. Second, the Attorney General brought charges in 102 cases where total
losses to government are estimated at Rp. 2.4 trillion. Third, a public information campaign encouraging citizens to
report corruption brought many allegations ranged from embezzlement to land fraud into the open. Fourth, the

Box 5. SUMMARY OF RECENT CONSULTATION PROCESS
Extensive public consultations were held as part of the preparation of the assistance program and the adjustment
operations. This has been particularly important given political and economic uncertainty in Indonesia and the
potentially divisive nature of many policy issues. The goal is to seek civil society engagement on, and then buy-in for
and help with, short-term poverty relief programs and longer-term economic and institutional reforms.

ANNEX 1
STATEMENT OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY
I. BACKGROUND
1.    For the past year Indonesia has been dealing with the largest economic and social crisis it
has faced in recent history. After thirty years of sustained rapid growth and successful poverty
alleviation efforts, GDP has fallen sharply and poverty increased. Social unrest has become a
frequent occurrence in many parts of the country. Calls for the need for improved governance
and transparency are being championed in several quarters, both within Indonesia and abroad.
Massive capital outflows that began at the inception of the crisis has yet to show signs of
returning.
2.   In this context, the Government's ongoing reform effort that has been supported by
donors and the international financial institution must continue. In my Government's letter to
you dated June 24, 1998 we re-affirmed our commitment to continued reforms. I now wish to
inform you of progress and on-going plans with respect to our four-pronged approach to policy
and institutional reforms for economic stabilization and recovery. This involves: (a) continued
prudence in the conduct of monetary policy in combination with our expansionaryfiscal policy
designed in consultation with the IMF; (b)financial and corporate sector restructuring to deal
with bad debts, restore effective banking services and get productive assets back to work; (c)
structural and institutional reforms to regain confidence through improved governance and
increased transparency and to build foundations for sustainable future growth; and (d) protection
for the poor and preservation of human assets. The policy measures that have been undertaken,
for the first three of these areas and others that will be implemented by our Government in the
coming months, are delineated in the sections below. Actions to protect to poor and shield
human assets will be described in a separate letter to be issued in conjunction with the proposed
social safety net adjustment loan.
II. FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICIES
3.    Since July 1998, our macroeconomic policy stance has involved three key elements.
First, a restrictive monetary policy has been used to stabilize the currency and suppress inflation.
Second, an expansionary fiscal policy was employed to stimulate domestic demand, with special
emphasis being given to social safety net expenditures. And finally, a substantial increase in our
foreign borrowing, mainly to finance the large projected fiscal deficit, under the auspices of our
July, 1998 Consultative Group for Indonesia (CGI). At the July, 1998 CGI, the international
donor community significantly increased project and program assistance to support a budget that
emphasized poverty alleviation and social safety net programs.
25



4.    In the near term, our Government will continue to pursue the flexible implementation of
macroeconomic policies to achieve continued low inflation and a stable rupiah, to allow for a
steady reduction in interest rates that, in turn, would stimulate investment and production in the
economy. Although we are putting in place a new reporting system to cover large foreign
exchange transactions through the banking system, a flexible exchange rate regime and an open
capital account will remain cornerstones of our strategy. Similarly, to stimulate demand, the
overall budget deficit has been targeted at about 6 percent of GDP in FY1999/2000. This
assumes that the exchange rate averages Rp 7,500 per dollar and depends on realizing
privatization proceeds of Rp 13 trillion. The budget includes gross interest costs of financing the
bank restructuring and recapitalization program, estimated to be about 3 percent of GDP, as well
as receipts from asset recoveries (of Rp 17 trillion) from the sale of impaired loans and the
settlements reached with former bank owners on their connected lending obligations.
5.    Development expenditures will amount to 5 percent of GDP, with priority once again
being given to social sector expenditures and social safety net programs. Care has been taken to
exclude large capital-intensive and import-intensive public investment. We have ensured
adequate funding for the most successful and cost-effective programs, including stay-in-school,
supplementary school feeding, non-formal education and primary health care centers. A five-
point program is being finalized to improve the design, implementation and monitoring of the
social safety net by (i) adjusting the geographic targeting of expenditure in light of new
information on the differing regional effects of the crisis; (ii) transferring responsibility for most
key safety net programs to local communities; (iii) ensuring the cost effectiveness of programs;
(iv) launching adequately funded monitoring campaigns for all key programs; and (v)
strengthening high-level, independent monitoring and implementation involving representatives
of civil society.
6.    We are committed to maintaining a balanced and integrated pattern of social safety net
expenditures. This include support to programs for food security, education, health, and
employment creation in our "core" social safety net programs. In order to encourage
employment creation, the government has allocated Rp. 1,000 billion to public works type
employment creation schemes in the FY1 999/2000 budget. Included within this overall
allocation will be a budget of between Rp. 100 and 200 billion devoted to an activity which has
the goal of addressing the under representation of women in the traditional employment
programs. A second mode in which we plan to promote employment and people's empowerment
is through "community fund" schemes which provide block grants directly to local community
organizations (PDM-DKE, PPK, P2KP). The allocation for the crisis program, PDM-DKE, is
Rp. 800 billion. This program will be targeted to areas hit by the crisis and will be implemented
in coordination with PPK and P2KP.
III. BANK AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING
7.    Despite enormous challenges and differing perspectives on a range of issues, our
Government has developed a strategy to address the key problems in the financial sector. We are
in the process of eliminating the core causes of the past misallocation of credit; containing
further losses in the banking sector while minimizing the fiscal costs of resolving troubled banks;
and building a safe and sound financial system capable of allocating financial resources to
productive enterprises. The strategy encompasses four key elements: (a) restoring market
26



confidence; (b) resolving and/or restructuring troubled banks; (c) reviving a core of "better "
banks that are able to identify and lead the restructuring of viable customers and provide those
customers with both credit and non-credit services; and (d) planningfor longer-term financial
sector development, by strengthening the regulatory, supervisory and legal framework, and
developing capital markets.
8.    After a careful and exhaustive review of private domestic banks with capital-adequacy
ratio of less then 4 percent, the Government, on March 13, 1999, closed 38 banks, took over 7,
and identified 9 as eligible for recapitalization. Thus, since the onset of the crisis, we have
closed 64 banks and taken over 11. We are committed to the subsequent divestiture of the
Government's stake in all banks. On the institutional side, we have established the Indonesian
Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA) and an Asset Management Unit (AMU) within it to assume
responsibility for restructuring or recovering non-performing loans and other assets from failing
and recapitalized banks. We recognize the need to accelerate our efforts to ensure that IBRA and
its AMU are effective and are adequately isolated from political pressures. In this context,
IBRA's Independent Review Committee (IRC) is playing an important role, by providing the
necessary oversight of IBRA and AMU, ensuring transparency in their operations, and helping to
build institutional capacity. Equally, the Government recognizes the importance of ensuring that
IBRA's budget is fully funded at all times. This has been provided through a combination of
direct budget support, proceeds from the repayment of loans and from the sale of assets. The
commercial banking law, which was approved on October 16, 1998, marks an important step
forward in ensuring proper powers for IBRA and AMU; subsequently, implementing regulations
for this law have been issued. The Asset Management Unit (AMU) is in the process of taking
control, ownership action (directly or through servicing contracts) and management over all
loans to borrowers with credits rated Group 5 (i.e. 'loss' category) from the recapitalized banks,
all assets from the closed banks, the Class 5 loans from the BTO banks, and the Group 5 loans
with a face value in excess of Rp. 5 billion from Bank Mandiri and the other state banks.
9.    Future reform efforts will focus on the resolution of all IBRA banks. Assets from banks
that are frozen or closed are being transferred to IBRA's AMU, together with the non-performing
loans from the BTO (taken-over) banks and state banks. The owners of BTO banks have been
removed and appropriate resolution strategies (including mergers) for all nationalized banks are
being developed. Meanwhile, IBRA is engaged in discussions with the former owners of the
private banks that were either closed or taken over by government (BTO) in March, 1999, with a
view towards reaching an appropriate financial settlement involving the recovery of liquidity
support from Bank Indonesia.
10.   On September 28, 1998 we announced the formal merger of four state banks and the
corporate business of a fifth state bank into the newly established Bank Mandiri. Bank Mandiri
was established on October 2, 1998, as holder of 100 percent of the shares of the component
banks. The operational restructuring plan for Bank Mandiri was announced on December 4, 1998
and a framework finalized. Loss loans with a face value in excess of 5 billion rupiah from the 4
banks have been transferred to the AMU. Restructuring plans for Bank Mandiri, include phased
capitalization, will begin in May 1999 and be completed no later than March 2000.
11.   We are also in the process of restructuring the remaining state banks. Our strategic
objective is to complete the restructuring of the banks by September 30, 1999. An inter-
27



departmental planning committee has been established to develop comprehensive restructuring
plans for BNI, BRI, and BTN. Recapitalization will be phased, and only take place in
conjunction with implementation of the agreed restructuring programs. Debt recovery efforts are
being intensified. In particular, each state bank (including banks and assets controlled by IBRA)
has targeted its 20 largest delinquent corporate borrowers for loan recovery, restructuring, or
bankruptcy filing. This effort will be facilitated by the earliest transfer of loss loans to IBRA's
AMU, and this transfer was completed by March 31, 1999 for the four component banks of Bank
Mandiri. Bankruptcy filings will take place by April 30, 1999 against recalcitrant debtors. The
process of debt recovery will be carried out with full transparency.
12.   The revival of a core of "better" banks is being undertaken on the basis of a program of
"joint recapitalization" (by the Government and the former owners of the banks) that we
announced in September, 1998. On March 13, 1999, we announced the names of 9 banks that
are eligible to participate in the recapitalization plan. We are currently finalizing the details of
the Investment and Regulatory Contracts that will govern the rights, responsibilities, and
financial obligations of the banks' owners and the government (as a result of the government
bonds that will be issued to finance the government's share of the recapitalization). All
necessary audits and investments contracts for these 9 banks will be completed by mid May,
1999. We intend to conclude the recapitalization and issue the sovereign bonds necessary to
resolve these banks by end-June, 1999.
13.   We have identified 73 category A banks (i.e. with a capital adequacy ratio above 4
percent). These banks are being subjected to a review of their capital adequacy and business
plans, and a fit and proper test, by April 21, 1999. Thereafter, there will be six monthly review
to ensure and confirm continued compliance with prudential standards.
14.   Loan classification and provisioning rules are now based on risk assessment rather than
solely on delinquency. Further revised regulations on loan classification, loan loss provisions,
and debt restructuring operations were announced on November 30, 1998. Two new regulations
on connected lending and capital adequacy ratio were issued in end-December 1998. The
passage of the Commercial Banking Law and Bankruptcy Law mark important steps as well.
The new Central Bank Law was enacted by Parliament on April 16, 1999. With a view to
strengthening the supervisory capabilities of Bank Indonesia over the next two years, we are
engaged in discussions with the World Bank, IMF, and ADB on providing us with their
experiences with international best practices and technical support on bank examination
techniques.
15.   Corporate restructuring is crucial in helping Indonesia to resume private sector led
growth, preserve and expand employment, and increase the standard of living for all its citizens.
Our objectives under the corporate restructuring program are to help restore the ability of
corporations to borrow and service their debts, and improve corporate governance by increasing
transparency in financial reporting; and introduction of new shareholders, including via debt-
equity swaps. At the same time, strengthening corporations will in turn help support ongoing
reforms in the banking and financial sectors. To this end, the strategy of our Government is
facilitating corporate restructuring through an integrated program which includes; (a) the Jakarta
Initiative; (b) bankruptcy procedures; (c) the Indonesia Debt Restructuring Agency; and (d)
eliminating obstacles to corporate restructuring.
28



16.   The Jakarta Initiative - a framework to facilitate voluntary out-of court debt restructuring
negotiations which applies equally to domestic and foreign creditors in a non-discriminatory
manner - was announced on September 9, 1998. A Jakarta Initiative Task Force (JITF) has been
created to: collect financial and other information on companies to be restructured; help design
restructuring action plans; facilitate negotiations; and speed regulatory approvals for
restructurings. The JITF is authorized to recommend that the Public Prosecution file bankruptcy
proceedings against recalcitrant debtors, but it will not dictate the terms of any restructuring plan.
As of April 15, 1999, 156 companies had applied to work through the JITF representing a
combined external debt of over US$ 20 billion.
17.   Bankruptcy procedures. With extensive technical assistance from our key development
partners, including the World Bank, a revised bankruptcy law, together with a special
commercial court became effective on August 20, 1998. Important changes from earlier practice
include procedural rules to improve the speed and transparency of out-of-court settlements, as
well as the filing of pre-packaged bankruptcies. The first bankruptcy case under the new law was
heard in the Special Comrnercial Court on September 30, 1998. The Government has recently
initiated a review of early experience with the Commercial Court, appointed ad hoc judges as
provided for in the Bankruptcy Law, and adopted a transparent court fee system for the
Commercial Court. On February 27, 1999, the Government issues Keppres 71/M/1999
appointing four ad hoc judges to the Commercial Court.
18.   The Indonesian Debt Restructuring Agency (INDRA). INDRA was created as part of the
Frankfurt Agreement of June 4, 1998. Under the Agreement, debtors and creditors who
voluntarily agree to restructure external debt can, subject to some important conditions, use
INDRA's facilities to eliminate foreign exchange risk on future debt service payments. Debtors
wishing to participate in the program enter INDRA only with the agreement of both debtor and
creditor. A prerequisite for participation is that the restructuring agreement must provide for a
minimum 3 years grace period for capital repayments and an 8 year period for total payments.
Recently we extended the INDRA program to December 31, 1999 and created greater flexibility
to make participation available to more firms.
19.   Eliminating obstacles to corporate restructuring. A program of actions to remove legal
and regulatory impediments to corporate restructuring started in early 1998 and has made
significant progress. Some tax disincentives to restructuring have been eliminated. Mergers are
now recognized as tax neutral events. In addition, a recent decree provides for limited incentives
in favor of debt equity swaps in certain insolvency situations. A regulation that improves
existing law and ensures tax neutrality in practice was issued on March 19, 1999. Time-
consuming procedures for obtaining necessary approvals has been simplified with the
establishment of a one stop regulatory facilitation unit (The Decree of the chairman of the
Indonesia Debt Restructuring Agency No. 002/KEPTIM-THSI/III/99 on the agreement
establishing the facilitator group for corporate restructuring under the Jakarta Initiative).
Preparation is also under way for legal changes to clarify the registration of security interests.
IV GOVERNANCE AND STRUCTURAL REFORMS
20.   One of the key objectives of our ongoing reform effort is to address the need for
increased transparency and anti-corruption measures in Indonesia. We would like to signal a
29



fundamental change in the way business will be done in Indonesia from now on by moving
towards a more transparent market-oriented system. The policy measures to be undertaken in
this area will cover: (a) institutional reforns to reduce corruption; (b) privatization; (c)
investment, corporate governance and competition policy; (d) trade and marketing; (h) energy (i)
forestry; and (j) environment.
21.   Institutional reforms to reduce corruption. Achieving the desired improvement in
governance will engage nearly every major segment of Indonesian society-the Government,
civil service, NGOs, academics, media, private sector and the international donor community at
large. We are currently in the midst of active public discussions on collusion, corruption and
nepotism (known by its acronym, KKN) among all walks of life in Indonesia. We have launched
our anti-corruption effort by asking Pertamina, the state oil and gas company, to create an
inventory of suspect deals. As a result, more than 150 contracts and agreements have already
been canceled, including those with two oil-trading companies. A special efficiency and
corruption audit of the company is now in progress, and the Government is firmly committed to
making available its findings and acting on them any re-emergence of corrupt practices. Similar
initiatives are also underway for PLN, Bulog and the Reforestation Fund. In view of the
magnitude of the domestic fuel subsidy, we have asked the World Bank to review the costs of the
supplying fuels to the domestic market as part of the 1999 Public Expenditure Review and will
ensure that it has full access to relevant data.
22.   To strengthen the institutional foundations for reducing corruption, we have submitted to
Parliament two anti-corruption laws (The Law about the Eradication of Corruption Criminal
Acts, and the Law Regarding State Administrators who are free from Corruption, Collusion and
Nepotism), and fiscal and administrative decentralization laws, in March, 1999. The Law
Regarding State Administrators who are free from Corruption, Collusion and Nepotism,
provides, inter alia, for the establishment of a permanent committee to investigate corruption by
senior public officials and the judiciary. It includes provisions for the disclosure of wealth and
potential conflicts of interest by public officials, with due regard to civil and legal rights. In
addition, we have prepared implementing guidelines establishing improved public sector
procurement procedures.
23.   On public expenditures in general, the vast majority of the recommendations of the
Public Expenditure Review that the World Bank completed in 1998 at our request were reflected
in the revised budget that was approved by Parliament in July, 1998. The Government
recognized the necessity of making significant shifts in expenditure priorities and did so in the
revised fiscal year 1998/1999 and 1999/2000 budgets. Some of the priority shifts are directed at
mitigating the immediate effects of the crisis. Others represent a reallocation toward longer term
priorities, such as improving quality and access to health and education services, especially for
the poor.
24.   The Government is committed to improving the policy, regulatory and institutional
framework for infrastructure development and operation, including in relation to private sector
participation. Reforms are proceeding at both cross-sectoral and sector-specific levels. At the
cross-sectoral level, we issued Keppres 7 of 1998. This established cross-sectoral rules
governing, inter alia, the selection of projects for private participation and the procedures by
which bids are solicited and evaluated. A Ministerial Decree was issued in October. 1998 to
30



clarify the scope of application and elaborate the provisions of this Keppres. Consideration is
now being given to further refining this in a new infrastructure law. In the meantime, the
Government will ensure that its key provisions are appropriately reflected in new sectoral laws
and regulations, including those now under preparation for the electric power, oil and gas and
telecommunications sectors. We are also embarking on broader and deeper reforms in this area,
including through: further clarifying the respective roles of sector Ministries, the Ministry of
Finance and the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises in relation to infrastructure policy and
administration; separating more effectively the State's roles as owner, policymaker, and regulator
of infrastructure; and improving the transparency and targeting of subsidies for infrastructure
services.
25.   Privatization. In our ongoing privatization efforts, we are stressing the need to improve
the competitiveness of all companies and to secure efficient delivery of goods and services. The
overall objectives are to promote efficiency and growth and to improve public finances. We
envisage that, over the long term, only a few SOEs will remain in State hands. In conformity
with this, we have published and are widely disseminating a comprehensive Master Plan for the
Reform of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). This sets out the objectives and policies, methods
and procedures for restructuring and privatization, together with a medium-term implementation
program and action plans for all SOEs.
26.   We initially identified a first group of 12 of the largest SOEs for restructuring and partial
privatization during FY1998/1999, including firms in the telecommunications, mining, cement,
air and sea ports, toll roads, steel and plantation sectors. Moving beyond past practices, these
divestments will be to strategic partners, and will involve sale of majority shares or the granting
of management control. Bearish market conditions and--for the infrastructure enterprises---the
complexity of industry structure and regulatory issues prevented us from completing 12
transactions by end-March, 1999 as originally planned. The first transaction was completed in
October, 1998 with the sale of a minority share in PT Semen Gresik (a large cement company) to
one of the leading international cement manufacturers for a total of around $122 million. On
March 31, 1999 PT. Pelindo II sold 51 percent of the Jakarta International Container Terminal
(PT JICT) to Grosbeak Pte. Ltd. (Hutchinson Group) for US$ 243 million. In addition, the
Government has also sold its minority holding in publicly listed PT Indofood, a major food
manufacturer that was not among the 12 companies referenced above.
27.   In line with our continuing commitment to rapid privatization, we expect to complete the
transaction of PT. Pelindo III on April 23, 1999 by selling 49 percent shares of the Terrninal
Petikemas Surabaya (PT. TPS) to P & 0 Australia. We also have identified another group of
large SOE's in the trading, construction, air and sea ports, plantations and fertilizer sectors for
restructuring and privatization during FYI 999/2000. The privatization of PT. Indosat is
expected to be completed in July, 1999, pending the finalization of a clear regulatory framework.
We intend to complete the privatization of PT. Aneka Tambang Tbk. by August, 1999 since the
company is restructuring by setting up its subsidiaries. PT. Angkasa Pura II is expected to be
completed at the end of May, 1999. In addition, the Government will also initiate the
privatization of a number of small companies. The SOE reform program is flexible, and the
Government will take stock of progress each year, modify policies as required and publish
revised action plans periodically.
31



28.   Trade and Marketing Reforms. Recent policy changes for BULOG have created an
environment in which there will be genuine competition in the importation of all commodities
other than rice. On September 2, 1998 subsidies on imports of wheat, sugar and soybeans were
endedl. This is, in our view, a better option than the original commitment to provide private
sector importers with access to foreign currency at the same exchange rate as BULOG. BULOG
is progressively confining its activities to rice alone, and in so doing, is encouraging the private
sector to play a greater role in the other basic-staple commodity markets. The Government will
not restore import monopoly rights to BULOG or to any other government agency. BULOG will
continue to help to guarantee food security, mainly by providing targeted food assistance to
vulnerable groups, rather than through retail rice price stabilization or through the build-up of
large, costly public rice stocks. BULOG will be encouraged to use new financial instruments
(such as options) to reduce import price risks and to help stabilize the domestic rice market. As
BULOG's food security role evolves, we would expect that the Agency would be restructured to
reflect this new role.
29.   Other import policy reforms also strengthen competition and demonstrate the
Government's continued commitment to open markets. First the programmed 1999 import tariff
reductions of 5 percentage points will be implemented in the middle of 1999. Second, import tax
exemptions will be reduced. This will simplify the investment approvals process and customs
administration. Third, a program of policy reforms for passenger motor vehicles, including tariff
reductions and excise tax increased, is being finalized.
30.   Export taxes on logs, sawn timber, rattan and minerals were reduced to a maximum of 20
percent in March, 1999. The forestry resource royalty rate is being reviewed to ensure that it
continues to capture at least 60% of the economic rent. The maximum export tax on palm oil
and related products was reduced from 60 percent to 40 percent on January 28, 1999.
31.   Domestic trade deregulation has continued with the abolition of livestock quotas between
the provinces. But much still remains to be done to review and revise regulations limiting
domestic competition, currently being implemented by various layers of government. To address
this problem, the Ministry of Industry and Trade strengthened its deregulation team and initiated
a review of domestic trade regulation in early 1999.
32.  Investment, corporate governance and competition policies. To reduce costs and
increase efficiency, the Government issued a revised and shortened list of activities reserved for
domestic firms (Keppres 96 and Keppres 99 of 1998). Also, restrictions on foreign investment in
wholesale and retail trade were removed in October, 1998 (PP No. 15 and 16, 1998). This
strengthens competition and facilitates the linkage of potential exporters with foreign firms.
33.   We are also promoting the development of small scale enterprises in a manner that
promotes economic efficiency and growth, and respects existing property rights. An inter-
ministerial task force is being created with representation from all the relevant ministries to
coordinate government programs and policies. We are (i) reviewing commercial lending
practices to the sector and its financing needs with the support of the Asia Development Bank
(ADB) and the World Bank; (ii) transforming BRI into a specialized bank with a mandate to lend
Prior to these latest reforms BULOG had held its first open tenders for wheat, sugar, rice and soybeans in July,
1998.
32



on commercial terms, and (iii) simplifying directed credit schemes to cooperatives and small-
and medium-size enterprises and ensuring that lending rates are positive in real terms. In view of
the potential significance of the measures being considered under this initiative, we will consult
with a wide range of interested parties. We will create a firm, PT Madani, which will initially
provide venture capital funds, in consultation with the ADB, JEXIM and the World Bank. The
role of PT Madani may later be expanded to other activities designed to increase economic
opportunities, especially for small and medium enterprises.
34.   The Govermnent recognizes that restructuring in the corporate sector must address
internal mechanisms of governance as well as financial obligations. Important elements of
corporate governance will focus on improving disclosure and transparency of financial
information, strengthening shareholder protections, and developing effective oversight of
management. In order to improve the disclosure of corporate information, the Government will
make information from the Registrar of Companies more readily accessible to the public.
35.   The law prohibiting monopoly practices and unhealthy competition has been passed by
Parliament. It is designed to preserve the public interest and increase efficiency by prohibiting
anti-competitive business practices with regard to the control of production and the marketing of
goods and services. This includes price fixing cartels and agreements between companies to
reduce competition by dividing product ranges and marketing territories. In doing this, the law
focuses on the actual behavior of businesses, rather than on existing market structures. Particular
attention is given to the governance structure and judicial process to enforce the law. It will be
administered by an independent commission, which will report directly to the President and have
the authority to impose penalties. Work is already under way with the help of bilateral donors
and the World Bank, and a draft Keppres has already been prepared to establish the
Comrnission.
36.   Energy Sector. On August 25, 1998, the Government launched its adopted Power Sector
Restructuring Policy, which was prepared in close consultation with the World Bank and the
Asian Development Bank. Subsequently, we have established, by Keppres 139 of 1998, a
Minister-level team to oversee the corporate and financial restructuring of PLN, including the
rationalization of the private power (IPP) program. In parallel, the Minister of Mines and Energy
has established a team to oversee the implementation of the needed legal and regulatory reforms,
including the drafting of a new Electricity Law and implementing Government Regulation. The
Government is committed to working closely with the World Bank and the Asian Development
Bank to ensure the timely and effective implementation of the needed reforms. We are looking
to the World Bank to take the lead role in providing guidance and support for PLN's corporate
and financial restructuring, and to the Asian Development Bank to take the lead on the legal and
regulatory reforms and related capacity-building.
37.   The Government is also firmly committed to a comprehensive program of reform in the
critically important oil and gas sector. In addition to the actions already initiated to eliminate
corruption and improve efficiency in Pertamina, a new Oil and Natural Gas Law has been drafted
and is now being deliberated by the DPR. This draft Law, which would replace the 1960 Law on
Oil and Natural Gas and the 1971 Law on Pertamina, is designed to attract increased private
investment in exploration and production activity, to promote accelerated domestic use of natural
gas in place of liquid fuels, and to improve the efficiency of petroleum refining and
33



transportation operations. The draft Law, together with the implementing Government
regulations now under preparation, provides for a carefully phased transition to a new industry
structure in which Pertamina will be one or more state enterprises, its governance functions will
be transferred back to Government, effective competition in fuel supply will be established, and
key infrastructure will be subject to regulation designed to ensure non-discriminatory open
access.
38.   Forestry sector. The Government is committed to improving the efficiency and
environmental sustainability of the forestry sector. To this end, a new forestry regulation (PP6 of
1999) was signed by the President on January 27, 1999. This regulation authorizes the transfer
of forestry concessions by sale and eliminates the requirement that concessions can only be
awarded to those who own or commit to develop a wood-processing facility. It also lengthens
the concession period and establishes a framework for forest concession performance bonds to
act as major new instruments of compliance with concession management regulations. As part
of a strong commitment to increased consultation with stakeholders prior to the enactment of
further forestry reforms, we have circulated draft implementing regulations for the performance
bonds to interested parties for comments. We are also reviewing the current resource royalty rate
and will adjust it to ensure that it continues to capture at least 60 percent of the economic rent.
39.   We are mapping the remaining natural forest, using 1996 or later imagery, and classifying
it into permanent production, protection and conservation categories. A transparent rules-based
procedure for future conversion of forest land to other uses is being established prior to the
approval of any further conversion of forest land to other uses.
40.   Strong measures will also be taken to identify community groupings, living in and around
forest areas, who have legitimate cause to claim some share of the benefits of forest use and
management: this will be done in a consultative manner. The Ministry of Forestry and Estate
Crops has established a consultative group as a means of obtaining public recommendations for
solving problems in forestry, including social forestry and broad community participation. The
Government will encourage local communities to get involved in the management, stewardship
and use of the forest resource. In addition, we wish to ensure that the forest resource under
production is managed sustainably, generating maximum economic rents and benefits for the
nation as a whole, with due regard to the protection and conservation of biodiversity and
ecological services of the forests.
41.   Environmental Management. To strengthen overall environmental management, the
Government has issued two of the implementation regulations for the Environmental
Management Law (UU 23/1997). These are, Hazardous Wastes Management (PP18/1999), and
Marine Pollution Control (PP19/1999). At least four more will be issued by June 30, 1999, and
the remainder as soon as possible thereafter. It is the intention of the Government to initiate
measures to improve urban air quality. To this end, we are establishing a Inter-Agency
Committee at the Ministerial level to develop a short term action plan for reducing air pollution
from petroleum fuels and oversee implementation of the plan.
42.   In the case of water resources management, in October, 1998 we formally appointed an
intergovernmental/NGO task force in conjunction with preparation of the Water Sector
Adjustment Loan (WATSAL), to develop and monitor a policy reform agenda for the water
sector. We furthermore established an apex inter-ministerial team for water resources policy
34



formation, guidance, strategies policy, inter agency coordination, and for developing a sustained
corporate framework for the management of strategic river basins. Consultation on the
implementing regulations for water pollution control are being undertaken as part of
implementation of this WATSAL. We also plan to develop and implement an effective
monitoring, control and surveillance system (MCS) for fishing activities in order to avoid over-
fishing of coastal fish stocks and to control illegal fishing in Indonesian waters.
V. Administration and Monitoring
43.   Overall responsibility for implementing and monitoring our reform program rests with
the Financial and Economic Resilience Council which is comprised of senior advisors, key
economic Ministers and private sector representatives. This Council is Chaired by the President.
The Coordinating Minister for the Economic, Finance and Industry is the Executive Chairman.
The Minister of Planning, as its Secretary General, has overall responsibility for implementation
and monitoring of the program. The Government will work closely with the World Bank in
monitoring and implementing the reform program described above. To facilitate monitoring of
progress on the reforms, we will provide the World Bank relevant and timely information on the
implementation of policies in all areas covered by the reform program as detailed in the Matrix
of Policy Actions. In key areas, which include corporate restructuring, financial restructuring
and public expenditures, we will provide information in accordance with frequency and format
agreed with the World Bank. We re-affirm our commitment with respect to transparency of
fiscal accounting.
44.  In order to promote public awareness of our reform program, we will make full disclosure
to the public of the program agreed with the World Bank, including making public the full text of
this letter and the attached Matrix of Policy Actions.

least 50 percent of this area).
Make these maps publicly available (e.g. on public display at the MOFEC) as they are completed.
L,ocate on the above maps as they become available, the 80 priority conservation forest areas identified in the Biodiversity Action Plan and all
other conservation areas. Also locate the boundaries of protection forest (hutan lindung) and production forest.
Provide an acceptable workplan and time frame for completing designation and gazetting of these areas.
Until the maps referred to above are in place, implement and maintain a moratorium on:
(i) conversion of state forest areas; and
(ii) alteration of main land use patterns within state forest areas.
Any future conversion or change in land use status is to be reviewed through a transparent and consultative process which involves both non-
government stakeholders and inter-departmental dialogue within Government. To avoid unduly penalizing those with conversion applications
presently in process, the Government will publish a list of all such applications and subject them to public review prior to final approval.
Implement a mechanism for
rationalizing state forest boundaries,
taking into account existing forest
cover.
Revise concession boundaries in
accordance with the new permanent
production forest boundaries and
regulatory requirements.
