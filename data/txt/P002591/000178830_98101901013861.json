reducing the cost of transport of agricultural\n            and industrial inputs and products by improving road\n            maintenance. In particular, the Project would support\n            improvements in: (a) maintaining the existing road network;\n            (b) transport planning and intermodal coordination; and (c)\n            management, planning and operations in the road sector. The\n            project would, over a period of four years, strengthen RBPC\n            through: (a) technical assistance and training in management\n            and organization, planning and execution of road\n            maintenance; (b) provision of equipment, spares, limited\n            supplies of fuel and bitumen; and (c) consultancy services\n            for a highway organization and investment study and\n            financing for two ferries for the Nile Crossing at Ed Dueim.\n            The main benefits from improved road maintenance would be\n            lower vehicle operating costs resulting from a reduction in\n            the rate of deterioration of all roads. The institutional\n            aspects of the project would result in improved transport\n            planning and increased efficiency of RBPC. The two ferries\n            would result in savings in operating costs of vehicles which\n            would otherwise have to travel a larger distance over sandy tracks."}, "docdt": "1984-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
