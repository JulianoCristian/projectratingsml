THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:         Democratic Republic of the Sudan
Beneficiary:      Roads and Bridges Public Corporation (RBPC)
Amount:           SDR 15.5 million
Terms:            Standard
Onlending Terms: Not applicable
Project
Description:    The proposed Project would, over a period of
four years, strengthen RBPC through: (a)
Technical assistance and training in: management
and organization, planning and execution of road
maintenance; (b) Provision of equipment, spares,
limited supplies of fuel and bitumen; and (c)
Consultancy services for a highway organization
and investment study and finance two ferries for
the Nile crossing at Ed Dueim. The main
benefits from improved road maintenance would be
lower vehicle operating costs resulting from a
reduction in the rate of degradation of all
roads. The institutional aspects of the project
would result in improved transport planning and
increased efficiency of RBPC. The two ferries
would result in savings in operating costs of
vehicles which would otherwise have to travel a
longer distance over sandy tracks. Risk
affecting achievement of the project objectives
would be failure to fully achieve institutional
objectives, due to difficulties in recruiting
and retaining qualified technical assistance
staff. Problems encountered in these aspects
under the ongoing Highway Projects are being
overcome and experience gained should result in
a more expeditious implementation of technical
assistance components under the proposed
Project. A comprehensive implementation
schedule, including the timing of steps to
initiate project execution, terms of reference
and composition of technical assistance teams
and their counterparts has been agreed upon.

I. THE TRANSPOR1 SECTOR
A. Economic Background
1.01      Sudan, with an area of 2.5 million square kilometers, is the largest
country on the African continent. It is essentially an enormous plain, with a
large uninhabited desert in the northern third of the country and tropical
forests and savannahs in the South. It is traversed from South to North by the
Nile River system (see Map), close to which lives a large part of the country's
18.5 million population which is growing at a rate of 2.7°o p.a.   Per capita GNP
is estimated at about US$380.
1.02      Agriculture dominates the economy, accounting for over 40% of GOP
and almost all export earnings. Economic activity is largely concentrated
within the fertile and well-irrigated 400 km stretch south and east of
Khartoum. More than half the population depends for its livelihood
directly on agriculture, and a substantial amount of farm production is
exported through Port Sudan, the only deep-water port. The main transport
demand is associated with movements of exports/imports between Port Sudan
and Khartoum, of agricultural and consumer products within the
Khartoum/Kosti/Sennar triangle and, to a lesser extent, of trade between
Khartoum and the south and west.
1.03      The recent economic performance has not been good.  Various
factors are responsible for this, including inadequate product prices,
limited absorbtive capacity and inadequate infrastructure support. This
has resulted in agricultural exports stagnating and, with increasing
petroleum import costs, contributed to a sharp widening of the balance of
payments deficit. To arrest the nation's economic deterioration and to put
the country back onto a path of sustained growth, the Government prepared a
three-year development program FY1979-81 which concentrated on the
completion of ongoing projects and investments emphasizing rapid growth of
export revenues.  This thrust has been continued in the second program and
a third (Three Year Public Investment Program, FY 1984-86) on which broad
agreement has been reached with the Association.
1.04      One encouraging feature has been the recent discovery of petroleum in
commercial quantities near Bentiu (south-western Sudan). Exploration is
accelerating in that part of the country, and in the Sudanese waters of the Red
Sea. Domestic production of petroleum might before long meet a substantial
proportion of the country's requirements. This could help improve the
balance-of-payments situation and overall economic prospects.



B. The Transport Syst em
General
1.05       Sudan's transport network is inadequate for even the existing
level of demand. This is due to the declining operational efficiency of
the railways and the high costs of providing an adequate road system. Ihe
modal allocations by 1982 had shifted significantly in favor of road
transport which now accounts for over 70% of total freight movement,
chiefly to and from Port Sudan. The sparse rail and road systems, which
must cross hot, arid deserts in the north, northeast and central zones and
skirt the swamps in the south, are oriented for imports and exports through
Port Sudan. The Nile contributes very little to transport; in the north it
is repeatedly interrupted by unnavigable rapids, while in the south the
White Nile meanders through the Sudd, a vast swamp with continually
shifting channels.
1.06      The main focus of investment in recent years has been in
railways, highways and ports. This has been reflected in the Bank Group's
transport sector operations. Four railway projects, two highway projects and
two port projects have addressed pressing needs in these sub-sectors. An
unsuccessful attempt has been made to come to grips with the aviation
subsector. Attention is now also being focussed on identifying the appropriate
role and investment requirements for river transport, particularly between the
south and Khartoum. The various pre-investment and investment studies have been
largely ad hoc in nature examining the needs of the individual sub-sector rather
than those of the sector as a whole. However, a reasonable degree of
consistency in the subsectoral approach has been achieved through the Ministry
of Finance and Economic Planning (MFEP) (paras 1.20-1.24).
Railways
1.07      Although the railway system of about 4,800 km of 3ft.6 in gauge,
single line track is quite extensive, it fails to meet the demands put upon it.
Freight traffic has declined in recent years from a peak of 2.8 billion ton-km
(3.2 million tons) in 1971 to 1.5 billion ton-km (1.6 million tons) in 1982,
while passenger traffic has fluctuated between 1.0 and 1.3 billion passenger-km
(2.4-3.4 million passengers). The principal role of the Sudan Railways
Corporation (SRC) is to transport agricultural products including cotton to Port
Sudan for export, and to move imports, increasingly capital goods and
construction materials, from Port Sudan to Khartoum and other parts of the
country. The Corporation handles about one third of total import and export
traffic. SRC's role in internal freight movemenis has been relatively minor at
about 9%O of the 1980 total. Freight and passenger rates are subject to approval
by the Government but SRC has no obligation to carry any traffic at other than
commercial rates.
1.08      Although the availability of light locomotives has increased from 50 %
in 1977 to 63.8%oo in 1983, the availability of heavy locomotives decreased from
72.5%O to 58%O during the same period.  Utilization rates for both heavy and light
locomotives declined significantly at the same time (from 65%°o and 57%0
respectively in 1977 to 43%O and 55%/O in 1983).  The capacity of SRC to handle
freight traffic has also been affected by increasing wagon turnaround time which
rose from 18 days in 1977 to 22 days in 1982. This is partly due to an
imbalance of traffic as between imports and exports resulting in wagons either
returning empty to Port Sudan or waiting inland f'or a back-haul. SRC's



management and staff were also unprepared for the sudden emergence of trucking
as a serious competitive force. Thus, the SRC's operations have been
deteriorating and are now at a low level of efficiency, whether measured in
terms of locomotive utilization, annual traffic per wagon, wagon utilization or
staff productivity. This is reflected in SRC's financial situation with a
working ratio in excess of 100 from 1979 to 1981 and a net operating deficit
over L.S 8 million in FY 1981. SRC is conscious of the need to adjust to
changing circumstances and the basis of its strategy is to concentrate primarily
on providing an improved service between Port Sudan and Khartoum and secondarily
on feeding into it from the west. This means that SRC may eventually phase out
operations on the south-eastern line.
Highways and Road Transport
1.09      These sub-sectors are discussed in Chapter II.
Ports and Inland Waterways
1.10      Sudan has one major seaport: Port Sudan.  It comprises 15 berths,
of which 11 are general cargo (located on the north side) and 4 are
specialized (located on the south side). These specialized berths handle
grain, to the adjacent silo, container and roll-on, roll-off traffic and
petroleum products import and export traffic. Ihe available draft ranges
from 8.7 meters to 10.2 meters at LWOST. Traffic increased from 1976 to 1983,
from 3.5 million tons to 4e3 million tons. Imports have grown rapidly, from 2.2
million tons to 3.2 million tons for the same period while exports have been
stagnant at 1.1 million to 1.2 million tons (0.9 million tons to 1.0 million
tons excluding petroleum).
1.11      Operational efficiency is reasonable, has improved significantly
under the First Port Project and is expected to improve further under the
second, which primarily provides for specialized container facilities and
improved grain handling. The port is administered by a parastatal, the
Sea Ports Corporation (SPC). The SPC's financial situation is very sound, with
a working ratio dropping from 59%O in 1978 to 30%,' in 1983. Port Sudan's capacity
is adequate until at least 1990 and the Government has deferred the construction
of a new port at Suakin.
1.12      River transport is used on the Kosti-Malakal-Juba (1,450 km) and
the Karima-Dongola (290 km) sections of the Nile system and currently
accounts for only 1-2%o of total freight traffic.  The Kosti-Juba section is
by far the most important, accounting for about 70%O of river traffic, and
serves as the major surface transport link between southern and central
Sudan. Even so, it falls a long way short of meeting the south's freight
transport requirements. Use of river transport is constrained by adverse
physical conditions, such as shallow water during the 3-4 low-water months,
a huge swamp in the south, water hyacinth encroachment, inadequate berthing
and cargo handling facilities and by the inefficient services of the River
Transport Corporation (RTC) for traffic other than oil products and food
which receive priority. RIC's fleet has been expanded in recent years with
assistance from Norway and the Federal Republic of Germany. Low fleet



- 4-
utilization, attributable to poor maintenance, iLs compounded by low load
factors which are largely the result of the directional imbalance of
traffic and the necessity to underload on shallow river sections. For many
years RTC had a monopoly of river transport, and though this was rescinded
in 1981, no significant rival transport operator has yet materialized.
This may be due to the alternative investment opportunities in the trucking
sector.
Civil Aviation
1.13      Of Sudan's 20 airports, only Khartoum is genuinely all-weather.
Strengthening of the runway and taxiways and ancillary works to take wide
body aircraft are currently in progress and a program for the upgrading of
electronic landing aids and installation of navigational aids and
telecommunications equipment for major regional routes is expected to be
completed shortly. The Government has long rancle plans to construct a new
international airport at Khartoum, new airports at Malakal, Wau and Nyala and
upgrade facilities at El Obeid. Air traffic control and navigational
communications within Sudan are the responsibility of the Civil Aviation
Department (CAD) which, although part of the Ministry of Defence, functions as a
civil government department.
1.14      Air traffic in Sudan has grown relatively rapidly over the past
four years despite seriously constrained domestic services. The number of
domestic air passengers has more than doubled since 1972 but traffic growth
during the last five years has been small and erratic and showed a decline
in 1981 due mainly to fuel shortage. The principal routes are between
Khartoum and Port Sudan, Malakal, El Obeid and Juba. Sudan Airways
Corporation services exclusively all 20 domestic airports, with Khartoum as
the hub, and also provides international services to neighboring African
countries, the Middle Fast and Europe. Passenger traffic in these
international services has about tripled in the last five years.
Petroleum Transport
1.15           Diesel is primarily transported between Port Sudan and Khartoum
by pipeline opened in 1977.  Other product movements, and diesel movement other
than between these two cities, is by road, rail and river. In 1982, rail
accounted for 38o, pipeline 32o, road 28%o and river 2%°o of total tonnage moved.
1.16           The main bottlenecks are (i) the pipeline is presently operating
at under 50%O of design capacity; this is being addressed through additional
pumping stations now under construction; (ii) rail and river transport are
unreliable and the more expensive road transport is increasingly resorted to.
These are aspects of the general problems affecting these two subsectors.
C. Transport Policy, Planning anl Coordination
Policy
1.17      Sudan has long been considered as having considerable potential
for agricultural development. While the pace at which the increase
envisaged in production and export will materialize is uncertain, traffic



- 5 -
in agricultural and other exports can be expected to recover from recent
low levels and imports of consumer and capital goods can be expected to
continue to increase, though more slowly than in recent years. This will
require increased reliability, operational efficiency and capacity in the
transport system, particularly in certain key corridors (Port Sudan -
Atbara - Khartoum, Port Sudan - Kassala - Wad Medani and Khartoum -
Southern Region). In addition, the establishment of a policy of
regionalization of administration has necessitated the improvement of
transport links between the regional capitals and Khartoum.
1.18      The important role of transport is recognized in the Government's
Three Year Public Investment Program (FY 1984-86). Of the total L.S. 1650
million, L.S. 343 million (21°) is devoted to transport and communications. Of
this more than half will be for completion of ongoing projects and the general
aim is to improve efficiency and rehabilitate existing facilities. In the past,
performance in the transport sector has fallen short of expectations (67% of
planned expenditures between FY1978 and FY1981), but it is expected to be better
under the new plan which is much more realistic, particularly by deferring
construction of a port at Suakin and a new airport at Khartoum, neither of which
can be considered high priority. While the general orientation is correct, and
in surface transport a clear pattern of development is beginning to emerge, two
problems remain to be addressed, the best means of improving south-north
communications and the means by which the emerging need for inter-modal
coordination can be achieved.
1.19      The south/north communications problem is how to achieve
efficient transport over a vast distance at reasonable cost. Although
river transport is the lowest cost form of transport as measured in fuel
and equipment costs, it is very slow, taking several weeks to cover the
1,450 km from Juba to Kosti. Even without paved roads, trucks handle most
of the traffic, even such low value commodities as firewood being
transported by road. The Government has embarked on a program to extend
the highway system to the south, and the Association is supporting this
through the Second Highway Project which, inter alia, is financing the
construction of the Jebel Aulia to Ed Dueim road (158 km). However,
completion of the system will take many years and the Government has shown
realism by commencing a joint project with the Government of Kenya to
improve road access to the Kenyan Port of Mombasa from Juba. The
construction of a bitumen road between Juba and Lodwar in Kenya, a distance
of 575 km, is expected to be completed in 1988. A first stage, consisting
of construction of bridges and culverts and a gravel road, has started with
the assistance of the Norwegian Government, USAID and EEC. A situation
whereby the south is poorly integrated with the north, physically as well
as politically, may have to be tolerated for some considerable time. The
inter-modal coordination problem is discussed below (paras 1.20-1.24).
Planning and Coordination
1.20      The Ministry of Transport and Communications (MIC) has in
practice only nominal responsibility for planning and coordination within
the transport sector. The ministry appears to have little direct
authority, only a small budget and no direct access to the main public
sector corporations (SPC, SRC, RTC and Telecommunications). These
organizations report directly to the Minister who has only a small staff
and it is unclear how the ministry could be expected to undertake
inter-modal planning and coordination effectively, particularly since it



- 6 -
has no authority over the Roads and Bridges Putblic Corporation (RBPC) which
was recently transferred to the Ministry of Conistruction and Public Works
(MCPW) and the CAD.
1.21      By contrast, the MFEP has established a capable and enthusiastic
locally staffed transport and communications unit, with assistance from a
planning team under a continuing UNDP financed project, executed by the Bank.
This unit has arisen from the need of MFEP, which is directly or indirectly
involved in evaluating all investment proposals by the various transport
agencies, to have a capability to understand the ramifications of these
proposals and make judgements on their relative merits.
1.22      The main weakness of the present arrangement is however that because
the individual agencies have varying degrees of planning capability, MFEP is in
some cases undertaking sub-sectoral planning and feasibility study functions
which should preferably be undertaken within the agencies themselves.
1.23      Among the agencies, SPC has adequate planning capability.  RBPC
will be assisted in this respect under the project with financing for the
services of a senior transport economist (para. 3.16). Similarly, the
Association is separately discussing with the Government the preparation of an
Action Program for the railways. This program is being prepared with the
assistance of consultants and should be completed during FY1984. It will, inter
alia, address the issue of the railway planning capability and formulate
appropriate recommendations. In the Association's view, the above framework, in
which the main transport agencies have their internal planning capability
re-inforced and are thus able to inter-act with the transport and communications
unit in MFEP, which is able to take both a transport sectoral and macro-economic
view point, is the most suited to Sudanese conditions.
1.24      Inter-modal co-ordination was unimportant in the early 1970's
when SRC was still the prime surface transport mode and the road between
Port Sudan and Khartoum was an earth track. However, since then the
completion of a paved road between these two cities, via Kassala and Wad
Medani has given possibly excessive impetus to highway development. Sudan
is now in danger of substituting road for rail even in regions such as
towards El Obeid and the West, where with an established rail system rail
should have a clear economic advantage. In the immediate future this issue
should be addressed through a coordinated approach to investment in
highways and rail, taking into consideration inter alia the above-mentioned
action program and the proposed highway organization and investment study
(para. 3.17). Accordingly, agreement has been reached with the Government that
it would adopt a plan for coordinated road and rail investment covering the
three years FY1987 through FY1989, satisfactory to the Association, not later
than June 30, 1986. Strengthening of economic planning capability with the
necessary technical expertise should enable such investment coordination and
avoidance of mis-allocation of resources to be achieved in the longer term.
D. Past Bank Group Transport Sector Operations
1.25      The Bank Group has been assisting in the development of all
modern transportation modes in Sudan as well as in slowly improving
transport planning, since the First Railway Loan in 1958. In general,
physical implementation of projects in the transport sector has been



satisfactory, although there have been considerable delays due to (a)
complicated procurement, bid evaluation and contract award procedures; (b)
cost increases which have necessitated revisions in project scope; and (c)
insufficient response to some invitations to bid. The First Domestic
Aviation Project has suffered from the above problems to the extent that
the IDA-financed portion of the project was cancelled. Part of the
project, the works at the airports of Port Sudan and Juba, are expected to
be carried out as planned and financed by the Saudi Fund and the EEC. The
general lessons to be learned are that project implementation takes longer
than expected in Sudan, benefits are generally slow to materialize, and
prediction of costs is difficult, particularly in more remote areas.
1.26      The proposed project will be the Bank Group's third lending
operation in highways. The First Highway Project (Credit 331-SU, US$7.0
million), approved in 1971, was completed satisfactorily in 1980, about
four years behind schedule mainly due to delays in equipment procurement for the
road betterment and maintenance  programs and lack of sufficient local funds.
However, a re-evaluation of the project showed that the investment was sound
(Project Completion Report of June 30, 1981). The Second Highway Project
approved in 1979 (Credit 882-SU, US$41.0 million) included institutional
improvements and road design and construction. The road design and construction
components have been completed with considerable cost overruns and progress on
institutional improvements in the south is progressing slowly after initial
start-up problems which resulted in substantial delay.
1.27      There have been other Bank Group financed transport operations in
Sudan. The First Port Project (Credit 781-SU, US$22.0 million, 1978), the
Second Port Project (Credit 1233-SU, US$25.0 million, 1982) and three previous
railway projects (Loan 202-SU, US$39.0 million, 1958; Loan 440-SU, US$31.0
million, 1964; and Credit 457-SU, US$ 24.0 million, 1974) included provisions
for the modernization and improvement of transport facilities adapted to
changing traffic and operational patterns. A Technical Assistance Credit,
approved in 1976 (Credit 614-SU, US$4.0 million), included pre-investment work
in transportation; while the Fourth Railway Project approved in 1977 (Credit
727-SU and Loan 1467-T-SU, US$8.0 million and 12.0 million respectively)
concentrated on upgrading the level of efficiency of SRC operations and
provision of motive power and rolling stock.
1.28      The Bank Group's experience in the transport sector has been
mixed. The involvement with SRC has not been successful - successive
projects being bedevilled with problems concerning equipment suitability,
spare parts shortage, weak management and staff training and morale. In
the ports subsector, the first project is nearing completion with only
minor problems. While the first project in highways, which concentrated on
financing road maintenance equipment and consulting services, was
implemented successfully, the achievement of institutional objectives has
been difficult and the problems are being addressed under the ongoing
second project which focusses on strengthening the highway administration in the
former Southern Region which was divided on July 1, 1983 into three regions
(Bahr-el-Ghazal, Upper Nile and Equatoria). In July 1983, USAID signed an
agreement with the Government to provide US$19.7 million to continue efforts to
rehabilitate and improve road maintenance in the south when the Association's
ongoing project comes to a close at the end of 1984. The proposed project will
redirect similar efforts to improving RBPC's road maintenance capability. lhe



Bank Group is also involved in improving farm roads under the New Halfa
Irrigation Project (Credit 1022-SU, US$40.0 million, 1980) and secondary roads
cofinanced by the British ODA under the Southern Region Agricultural Project
(Credit 904-SU, 1979). Progress is slow mainly clue to management and staff
problems which are now in the process of being resolved.

II. The Highway Subsector
A. The Network
2.01      The development of a highway network in Sudan is of recent origin
with 70%' of the paved roads constructed in the last decade.  Even now, road
classification is not uniform over the whole country. There is no official
record of the classification and length of the highway network but from the
information obtainea From the RBPC and the former Southern Regional Ministry of
Communications, Transport and Roads (SRMCIR) a total of 15,359 km forms the
country's basic highway system. Ihe classification of roads in the three
regions in the south is different from that prevailing in the rest of the
country (lable 2.1).
Table 2.1: Ihe Highway Network (1982)

a/ Either Gravel or Earth
Source: RBPC and former SRMCIR
2.02            In addition to the above basic highway systems, there are several
thousands of kilometers of agricultural roads in the five major irrigation
schemes, which are the responsibility of the public corporations established to
manage these schemes. The length of the road network is not adequate to cover
all parts of the country and its condition is very unsatisfactory. Except for
the paved roads and gravel roads constructed and improved with financial
assistance from bilateral and multilateral aid agencies, most of the roads are
mere tracks which are not maintainable and are impassable during the rainy
season. The highway organization and investment study to be financed under the
project would include the preparation of programs to expand the highway network
of the country and recommend, inter alia, a rational classification system to be
adopted (para 3.17).
B. Road Transport Characteristics
Vehicle Fleet
2.03       The vehicle fleet increased by 160% from 1969 to 1979 (Table
2.2) and is believed to have increased somewhat more slowly since, though
recent data is preliminary. The main factor has been the construction of a
paved road between Port Sudan and Khartoum, the last section of which was
completed in 1980. The growth has been surprisingly balanced between the



- 10 -
main categories, but the truck fleet has increased slightly more rapidly
than the average and within that category, heavy trucks and trailers have
almost certainly increased their share of total trucking capacity.

a/  Ihese figures understate the actual number of vehicles on the
road. A sample check by traffic police in Khartoum revealed that
221% of cars are unlicensed and thus not included in these
figures.
Source: MFEP, Transport Statistical Bulletin, 1981
2.04.     Despite the rapid growth, the average vehicle density of 7 per
thousand inhabitants is well below the average of about 11 for Africa. Also the
density is uneven with most vehicles concentrated in the Khartoum, Wad Medani,
Port Sudan triangle, and the density in the southern region, for example, is
only about a sixth of that of the remainder of the country.
Traffic
2.05      Traffic volumes have been established countrywide under two
surveys, the 1974 Berger study (financed under the First Highway Project)
and the 1979 Norconsult/EIU feeder road study. These surveys showed that
vehicle flows were quite high with at least 200 vehicles per day being
recorded on half the roads surveyed. This impression is confirmed by
vehicle traffic counts on 15 major road sections (for late 1978) which
showed counts ranging from over 3,000 vpd down to 40 vpd, with an average
of over 600 vpd. The traditional light to medium truck, used for passenger
and freight carriage, dominates outside the main population centers.
2.06      Trucks are rapidly increasing their share of total freight
traffic. In 1969/70 trucks carried an estimated 25% of 3.7 billion ton-km
total traffic; by 1980 they accounted for approximately 5.2 billion ton-km,
over 70° of 7.2 billion ton-km total.  This has been at the expense of rail
and is to some extent an inevitable consequence of the increased relative
importance of imports in Sudan's international traffic.



- 11 -
Trucking Industry
2.07      Trucking operations are largely concentrated in an area bounded
by Khartoum, Kosti, Ed Damazin and Port Sudan. Important operations also
occur between Kosti and Malakal, around El Obeid, and between the Southern
Regional capital of Juba and the rail terminal of Wau. Other areas are poorly
served and in the west and south, in particular, there are serious capacity
shortages.  Government policy has been to encourage truc<ing through various
measures: (i) no entry control, (ii) reasonably low customs duties, presently
aggregating to 42 1/2%o on c.i.f. value, and (iii) low fuel excise tax rates.
which contribute to making Sudanese fuel prices (both diesel and gasoline) among
the lowest in Africa.
2.08      The industry is competitive, being dominated by owner-drivers, with
freight rates determined by market forces. The traditional Sudanese vehicle has
been of 6 tons capacity, often of the Bedford type, with a locally constructed
body. This was well suited to the mixture of earth and gravel roads
prevailing. With the rapid expansion of the paved network, heavier trucks with
trailers became optimal for the longer hauls, and on the Port Sudan - Khartoum
road they now predominate. These truck combinations are technically the most
suitable for existing conditions. As container movements become more important
tractor/trailer combinations will become more appropriate. The private truckers
can be expected to adapt their fleets accordingly. The intermediaries between
the customer and the trucker are freight forwarding agents, of which about 500
locally based, and a number of international operators, presently operate an
effective service.
2.09      The trucking industry and ancillary activities such as the provision
of service facilities and establishment of local component manufacture is
privately financed. This requires access to substantial foreign exchange
resources: the recorded c.i.f. value of imported vehicles and spares was L.S. 84
million in 1979 (18%O of total imports). This is believed to be underestimated,
and does not include raw materials for the local tire industry, etc. Between
1975 and 1979 these imports were facilitated by the application of the "nil
value licencing system" which effectively allowed anyone with foreign exchange
outside Sudan to pay for imports, without the source (or the purchase) being
subject to Government scrutiny. Since 1979, a licence has had to be obtained
and is issued if the importer can show the necessary foreign exchange funds in a
local bank account. It seems doubtful if this has made any practical difference
to the ease with which vehicles can be imported.
Passenger Services
2.10      Road passenger services are provided almost exclusively by private
operators, employing buses of various sizes, but normally standard single deck
of about 60-70 passenger capacity, and modified trucks. The bus fleet increased
by about 4,200 vehicles during 1969-79, to 6,300, and probably carries about 7
billion passenger km per year, well in excess of the 1 billion passenger-km per
year carried by SRC. It also carries appreciably greater traffic than private
cars which number about 70,000 and a very rough estimate suggests that public
road transport accounts for two thirds of passenger movements. The public
transport operators are licenced, but as far as can be judged the Government
does not control tariffs or routing. They are subject to the same financial
conditions as described under trucking.



- 12 -
Fuel Consumption and Prices
2.11      Fuel consumption in the highway sector has increased significantly in
recent years but the increase has been less rapid than that of the vehicle
fleet. Table 2.3 shows that consumption of both diesel and gasoline
approximately doubled between 1970 and 1981, and that in the latter year road
transport accounted for 41% of total diesel, and 100% of gasoline consumption.
By contrast, fuel consumption by river and rail transport has declined,
reflecting the decreasing volume of transport by these transport modes. Due to
balance of payments difficulties, Sudan is unable to import sufficient crude
(for refining at Port Sudan) or petroleum products to satisfy demand. As a
result shortages develop, and a rationing system f3r gasoline is now in force.

2.12      Before the recent devaluation fuel prices stood at levels which were
among the lowest in Africa, and the taxation element was also low, at about 13%
for gasoline and 5%0 for diesel.  Since then retail prices in local currency have
increased sharply in Khartoum to L.S. 4.50 (US$2.98) and L.S. 2.10 (Us$1.39) per
imperial gallon, for regular gasoline and diesel respectively.
2.13      At these levels two main features stand out: (i) the retail price of
diesel is below and that of gasoline above the corresponding costs (import costs
plus inland transport and distribution costs); (ii) there is still scope for an
increase in fuel prices which would enhance government revenues, and less
certainly slow the rate of growth of fuel imports and thus have a beneficial
balance of payments effect. A rough calculation indicates that fuel prices
could be increased by one-third on average and this would generate at least
about L.S. 30 million in additional government revenues. In this context, the
Government has agreed to undertake a Transportation Cost Review to be completed
not later than December 31, 1984 in accordance with terms of reference shown in
Annex 1, to discuss the findings with the Association and thereafter, to
maintain appropriate fuel prices.



- 13 -
Vehicle Regulations
2.14      Vehicle safety and traffic regulations are satisfactory, but
vehicle dimensions and axle load limits appear to be restrictive compared
to the demrnd for larger trucks which may be particularly economical
because of the long travel distances involved. In 1981, the Parliament
passed legislation to raise the legal axle load limit from 9.2 mt to 10 mt
but it lapsed before it reached the President for signature. A technical
committee was recently formed to draft regulations to govern dimensions and
specifications of vehicle imports in order to stop import of vehicles not
in accordance with assumptions made in road design. Efforts under earlier
projects to enforce legal axle loads on the roads have failed because of
lack of coordination between RBPC and Police as well as lack of funds for
enforcement facilities such as vehicles. The highway organization and
investment study in the project will, inter alia, review the current laws
and regulations pertaining to control of vehicle dimensions and weights and
those governing vehicle imports and recommend amendments thereto as
necessary including enforcement procedures and measures (para 3.17). The
Government has agreed that following the above study, it would adopt a plan
satisfactory to the Association for the adoption and enforcement of vehicle
dimensions and axle load regulations, including regulations of vehicle
import specifications and, not later than January 1, 1987, would commence
enforcement of such plan.
C. Administration
2.15      The RBPC is responsible for construction of all main roads in the
country but maintains only the paved roads and bridges1/. The maintenance
of earth and gravel roads is the responsibility of the7regional governments
with technical assistance provided by the local RBPC regional manager. The
RBPC was established in August 1973 as a public corporation which was later
reorganized following a study by consultants, financed by the First Highway
Project. Since then, RBPC has lost virtually all its autonomy and
functions like any other government department. In 1982, responsibility for
the corporation was transferred from the MIC to the MCPW. In the south
where most of the main gravel roads are located, the regional highway
administrations are being strengthened by technical assistance and
equipment financed by bilateral aid from West Germany, Norway, the
Netherlands, the U.S. and the Association's ongoing project.
2.16      RBPC is headquartered at Khartoum and has regional managers
located in the provinces. It operates a central workshop in Khartoum, two
construction workshops (Sennar, Dilling) and five road maintenance
workshops (Derdeb, Sirikat, Geriba, Aroma and Kosti). Other workshops
are being planned and under construction in the three new regions in the
south at Juba, Wau, Malakal, Maridi and Rumbek, where existing facilities
are minimal, under the ongoing project and with aid from bilateral
agencies. The RBPC organization (Chart 1) has deteriorated with expansion
of its staff in that there are now far too many layers of management, the
1/   From July 1, 1983 responsibility for the construction of the main
roads in the south passed from the former SRMCTR to RBPC. However,
RBPC will act through the new regional authorities.



- 14 -
maintenance division is not adequately staffed relative to other divisions
in RBPC and there is wastage in the deployment of experienced staff. The
highway organization and investment study in the project will review the
existing role and organization of RBPC, define its future role and
functions and recommend improvements to its organization taking into
account available staff at various levels (para 3.17). The Government has
agreed that, following the above study, it would adopt a plan satisfactory
to the Association to reorganize RBPC and that it would complete
implementation of such plan not later than June 30, 1987.
D. Staff and Iraining
2.17      The RBPC has an authorized establishment of 187 engineers, 92
technicians, 981 skilled labor in civil and mechanical trades and 409
unskilled labor. There are no vacancies but a few engineers and many
technicians are not qualified for their positions. Turnover of staff is
high with experienced engineers and technicians moving to the private
sector or going abroad where salaries are much more attractive. However,
staffing is excessive and training is needed . Training of mechanics, road
superintendents and road foremen, equipment operators and vehicle drivers,
is undertaken in RBPC in a perfunctory fashion. Newly recruited graduates
are trained with consultants and contractors working on road projects but
training is not structured and is difficult to monitor. The most serious
deficiencies appear to be at the technicians level as few qualified
technicians join RBPC because of poor salaries and little prestige to
boot. The training program to be financed under the project has been
designed to overcome these deficiencies particularly with a view to
strengthening RBPC road maintenance capability. Iraining will be mainly
done on the job and will include the training of ten technicians annually
at the Khartoum Polytechnic (paras 3.09 - 3.13).
E. Planning and Financing
Planning
2.18      Highway investment planning is primarily the responsibility of
RBPC but it deals only with the highway network outside the three regions
in the south except for the international links. RBPC planning proposals
are based upon a series of pre-feasibility and feasibility studies executed
by international consultants. The most important of these are the Sudan
Transport Study (1974), the Road Maintenance study (1979) and the Feeder
Road Master Plan (1979) which, because of its countrywide scope, identified
highway developments which went beyond the narrow definition of feeder
roads. These studies, and the analyses accornpanying detailed engineering
of roads chosen for construction, have resulted in the production of a
comprehensive and on the whole soundly conceived program for development.
2.19      The main weakness of the present system is that planning is
fragmented and carried out by foreign consultants and participation by RBPC
which is largely staffed by engineers is limited. RBPC has not even
developed its own capability to update road feasibility studies, which
tends to lead to projects being retained as high priority based on obsolete
feasibility studies. The project includes provision for an experienced
transport economist in RBPC to strengthen RBF'C's Planning Division (para
3.16).



- 15 -
2.20      The Government has agreed that, starting in 1984, it will prepare
each year a highway investment program for the following three years and
each year by October 31 review and agree upon the program's implementation
with the Association.
Financing
2.21      Highway expenditures, both construction and maintenance, are
financed from three sources (i) government general revenues, (ii) foreign
aid and (iii) highway toll revenues. The level of general revenues
generated by road user charges averaged L.S. 66 million annually in 1979-81
(Table 2.4). It was thus well in excess of total annual expenditures on
highways during this period (Table 2.5). However, since most of the
construction expenditures are financed by bilateral and multilateral aid
agencies, the bulk of road user revenues is used at the present time for
general purposes. Tolls were introduced in late 1980 on the Port Sudan -
Khartoum road, as an outcome of a study undertaken by MFEP Transportation
Section in 1978. The revenue in 1981 totalled L.S. 935,000 from the six
collection points. The tolls do not seem to have any noticeable effect on
traffic volumes, averaging only about L.S. 4 per vehicle for the 1190 km
road. The administration expenses are not separately identifiable in RBPC
accounts, but implicitly amount to not more than 10% of revenue.

2.22      RBPC expenditures have been fairly stable in recent years,
averaging L.S. 32 million annually in FY1978-82 (Table 2.5). These do not
include expenditures on roads serving the major irrigation schemes. While
as yet there is no evidence of uneconomic highway projects being executed

in the Sudan, once the high priority requirements are met the danger of
such misallocation of resources increases. The proportion devoted to
maintenance and administration has increased, largely as a result of the
rapid increase in the length of paved road under RBPC. Available records
of expenditures on roads in the regions show that such expenditures are
substantially lower but will increase rapidly as more of the earth and
gravel roads being rehabilitated by bilateral aid agencies are handed over
to the regions for maintenance.

F. Design and Construction
2.23      RBPC has a design section in its projects directorate but only
minor road improvements and bridges are designed in-house. Detailed
engineering of major works is carried out by foreign consulting firms and
the main function of the RBPC design staff is to supervise their work.
There are 9 foreign consulting firms operating in the country. RBPC allows
the consultants to select their own design standards but by and large the
geometric design of newly constructed roads has been uniform because of the
flat terrain over most of the northern parts of the country. RBPC is
considering consolidation of the consultants' work into national standards
and will be assisted in this by the highway organization and investment
study in the project (para 3.17).
2.24      Construction works are carried out either by RBPC or foreign
contractors. Apart from RBPC which was set up as a corporation to work as
a contractor there is no domestic road contractor. However, transport of
materials is subcontracted out to local transporters. A study by a UNIDO
Co-operative Program mission in 1981 on the :Local construction industry
addressed both building and road construction industries but its specific
recommendations are aimed at developing the building of construction
industry in preference to the road construct:Lon industry. The study does
not hold out promise of a major participation in the near future by local
contractors in road construction.



- 17 -
2.25      The major construction works are financed by bilateral and
multilateral aid agencies and are mostly executed by international
contractors. Where RBPC has constructed the works as in the case of the
Sennar-Kosti road (11Okm) it was assisted by a management team provided by
consultants, Construction contracts are unit price contracts awarded after
competitive bidding by prequalified contractors according to the respective
aid agencies procurement procedures. Opening of bids is in public and bid
evaluation is made by RBPC with the assistance of consultants. The
Government is fairly liberal in its treatment of contractors on the
Association financed projects under the normally restrictive import and
customs regulations. The contractor is permitted to import directly all
his requirements including fuel, and custom duties are waived in respect of
re-exported equipment. Construction costs tend to be high in some areas of
the country because of poor subgrade conditions, lack of conveniently
located pavement materials and harsh physical conditions (high
temperatures, intense rainfall or lack of water).
2.26      Equipment is freely used in all road construction and
rehabilitation works and the Government has no policy to encourage civil
works to be done by labor intensive methods. The road agencies and
contractors find it much more convenient to use as much equipment as
possible mainly because of insufficient supervisory staff and unreliability
in the supply of labor in many parts of a country of great size and
scattered population. An assessment made by the technical assistance team
in the south also showed that the very difficult climate, small potential
labor living along the road and resistance to laboring are deterrents to
organizing effective labor intensive works. However, labor can be used
economically for routine road maintenance and efforts will be made by the
technical assistance in the project to adopt labor intensive methods for
this purpose.
G. Maintenance
2.27      The RBPC maintains the paved roads and bridges through regional
managers. Each region is divided into two or more districts supervised by
district engineers. The present maintenance organization is satisfactory
and is based on recommendations made by consultants, Louis Berger Inc.
(USA) in 1979 in a study financed under the First Highway Project but road
maintenance has suffered through lack of adequately trained staff and low
availability of equipment. The Association under the same project financed
equipment and spares for road maintenance. The RBPC has also benefited
from a Japanese Credit for purchase of equipment spares, British ODA
assistance for workshop improvements and equipment left over from
construction projects. Many equipment items have become scrap due to lack
of proper maintenance and equipment availability is low because of ill
trained mechanics, poor workshop organization and management and
insufficient spare parts. The project provides for technical assistance to
improve workshop operations including training, the procurement of spare
parts and components for equipment rehabilitation and the implementation of
training and road maintenance programs agreed with the Association (paras.
3.05-3.13). Funding for road maintenance has been satisfactory during the
past few years but it is difficult to segregate road maintenance
expenditures from pavement strengthening work and rehabilitation.



- 18 -
2.28      There is a clear need to establish a realistic level of
maintenance expenditure and to achieve this, the cost accounting system in
the RBPC will have to be improved. The technical assistance financed by
the project will include a cost accountant to institute such a system in
RBPC. Further, to enable Government to earmark funds for road maintenance
expenditures and ensure that such funds are so spent, agreement has been
reached with the Government that it would, not later than July 1, 1986,
revise the format of annual estimates of RBPC expenditures to show clearly
the road maintenance works to be executed and corresponding allocations of
funds.

III The Project
A. Objectives
3.01      The project objectives are to support specific goals in Sudan's
Three-Year Public Investment Program (FY 1984-86), namely to:
(a) initiate improved planning and execution of road maintenance
works; and
(b) carry out further studies of high priority main and feeder
roads.
The project will also improve transport planning and coordination and
reorganize highway administration.
B. Description
3.02      The project comprises:
(a) assistance to RBPC consisting of:
(i)  technical assistance to improve workshop
organization and management, spare parts management
and equipment rehabilitation, strengthen planning
and road maintenance capability, and implement the
road maintenance programs of the respective
agencies;
(ii)   training;
(iii)  procurement of workshop tools and equipment, road
maintenance equipment and spares and limited
provisions for fuel and bitumen;
(b) procurement of two ferries for the Nile crossing at Ed
Dueim; and
(c) other consulting services for a highway organization and
investment study including the establishment and
training of an RBPC pavement evaluation unit.
Workshop Organization and Management and Equipment Rehabilitation
3.03      The existing RBPC equipment fleet (including vehicles) consists
of 932 items of which 304 (33%) are in working order, 317 (34%0) under
repair and 311 (33%0) are scrap. The project will finance 216 man months of
technical assistance to reorganize the central RBPC workshop at Khartoum,
improve its management, determine and assist in disposal of the equipment
to be scrapped and repair and rehabilitate the remainder, and train
mechanics on the shop floor.
3.04      The composition of the technical assistance teams to work in the
RBPC together with outlines of their respective terms of reference are



- 20 -
given in Annex 2. The Association agrees with RBPC that efforts should be
made in the first instance to obtain the services for RBPC from an
international contractor rather than from consultants. Many contractors
are interested in establishing or continuing their presence in the country
and may be willing to submit proposals. The technical assistance services
will include reorganization of the existing RBPC mechanical stores,
and developing systems and procedures to purchase and stock spare parts as
needed. The technical assistance will be aimed at improving equipment
fleet availability and utilization to 80°o at the end of 1988. The
Government has agreed that it will monitor annually the equipment
availability and utilization rates of RBPC and compare with the above norm.
Road Maintenance Program (FY 1986-88)
3.05      The project will provide for technical assistance consisting of
one road maintenance engineer and one cost accountant for a total of 36
man-months to help RBPC to initiate its recently established maintenance
directorate. The project will enable RBPC to implement a road maintenance
program, details of which are given in Annex 3. lhe Government has agreed
that the RBPC road maintenance budget shall be in the amounts equal, at
least, to the estimates made in the agency's road maintenance program
(Annex 3) subject to agreement with the Association annually, based on
agreed physical targets for that year. The Government shall (i) submit in
October of each year, beginning in 1984, for the Association's approval
annual budget requirements and detailed physical targets for the following
financial year and (ii) release funds to RBPC in line with the budget
requirements and program agreed with the Association.
Road Maintenance Equipment, Spare Parts and Fuel
3.06      Equipment.  Provisions have been made in the project to procure
essential items of road maintenance equipment and vehicles, which are not
available in the RBPC fleet and are urgently needed (Annex 4) and to meet
the requirements of the Training Production Unit (TPU) (para 3.13) to be
established in the RBPC. The RBPC's existing fleet together with the
addition of the equipment and vehicle to be procured under the project is
adequate to carry out maintenance of its road portfolio. The IPU
requirements in the RBPC were based on a reviiew by the Association of the
existing fleet and determination of the additional items needed to equip
the TPU (Annex 5).
3.07      Spare Parts.  The project will also provide for procurement of
spare parts for equipment rehabilitation and 3verhaul and fast moving
spares for preventive maintenance and operation of existing and new
equipment.
3.08      Fuel and Bitumen.  lhe establishment of the Training Production
Units (TPU) in RBPC will result in additional expenditure on fuel and
provisions have been made in the project for financing the TPU fuel
requirements of RBPC (Annex 6). The project will also provide financial
assistance for purchasing an initial stock of 1,200 tons of bitumen for
RBPC particularly to operate the TPU for three years.



- 21 -
Iraining
3.09      The proposed training program would aim at improving (i)
equipment repair and servicing and (ii) the standard of highway maintenance
through the 'raining, retraining and upgrading of some 360 RBPC workshop
and road maintenance personnel. The program would:
(i)      strengthen the RBPC training directorate;
(ii)     establish a mobile Training Production Unit (TPU) in
RBPC;
(iii)    procure laboratory and survey equipment for technicians
training at the Khartoum Polytechnic (KP);
(iv)     institute a three-year apprenticeship scheme in the RBPC
workshop to train master mechanics and master
electricians; and
(v)      organize seminars for mid level and professional staff
in RBPC.
Details of the training program are as follows:
Ci) Workshop Personnel
3.10      Training for workshop personnel will consist primarily of the
establishment of a three-year structured apprenticeship scheme to produce
master mechanics and electricians. Four local mechanics and electricians
would be selected as apprentices by each master mechanic and electrician in
the technical assistance team, who would take responsibility for training
and testing them. At the end of the project it is expected that RBPC would
have trained eight master mechanics, four master quarry mechanics and four
master electricians. The local mechanics and electricians would in turn at
the end of their own training, train four other mechanics and electricians
each to continue the apprenticeship training program after project
closing. Tne compounding effect of this scheme would result in the
training of sufficient mechanics and electricians within a six-year
period. In order to provide an incentive to the trainees, agreement has
been reached with the Government on appropriate certification of those
successfully completing the apprenticeship program and graduating as master
mechanics and electricians.
(ii) Road Maintenance Personnel
3.11      Ihe objective would be to select and retain for road maintenance
the best available manpower resources of RBPC. As there are few qualified
technicians in the RBPC 10 scholarships per year to follow the three-year
highway technicians course at the Khartoum Polytechnic (KP) have been
included in the project. To enable KP to expand its classes to take in the
additional students from RBPC the project will finance survey and
laboratory equipment as listed in Annex 7. Agreement has been reached with
the Government that this equipment will be given to KP and the Government
will cause KP to offer places in its Three-Year Hlghway Technicians Course



- 22 -
for ten students annually from RBPC. The RBPC Iraining Program aims at
strengthening the existing RBPC Training Division and increasing the
productivity of 26 engineers, 14 technicians, 37 road foremen, 82 artisans,
283 equipment operators and 252 vehicle drivers, a total of 694.
3.12      Training of road supervisors, foremen, equipment operators and
vehicle drivers would be carried out mostly in the field by adopting a
system of training through production. A Iraining Production Unit (IPU)
will be established in the RBPC to train staff of the two agencies while at
the same time carry out maintenance operations of specific road sections
within the agency's road maintenance program. The trainees assigned to the
TPU would thus be trained under actual working conditions. A feature of
the engineers' training, in addition to receiving practical training with
the TPU, will be the organization of seminars to be conducted by staff from
consultants and contractors operating in the country. The Government has
agreed that, not later than July 1, 1985, it will establish and equip the
TPU and thereafter staff and operate it to the satisfaction of the
Association.
3.13      Training equipment varying from heavy items such as a motor
grader, a front end loader to an asphalt kettle and spot mixer would be
provided through the proposed credit (Annex 4). Instructors required for
training would also be provided under the project.Right from the start,
Sudanese counterpart instructors would work closely with the expatriate
instructors. It is expected that they would take over the program after
three years and carry it through to completicn. Technical Assistance to
RBPC (120 man months) for training would alsc include a training specialist
who will assist in the planning, coordination and monitoring of all RBPC's
training activities. The composition of the technical assistance team
together with an outline of their respective terms of reference are given
in Annex 2.
Ferries
3.14      The ongoing project included provisions for the procurement of
two ferries for motor vehicles, to service the Nile crossing at Ed Dueim on
the Jebel Aulia - Ed Dueim road. The financing of substantial cost
over-runs on the construction of the road, also under the ongoing project,
has resulted in insufficient funds being available for the purchase of the
two ferries. The Government has requested financing to be included in the
new project.
3.15      The ferries are intended to replace two existing ferries
operating between Ed Dueim on the west bank of the White Nile and the Jebel
Aulia -Ed Dueim - Rabak road on the east bank of the river. The ferries
provide a feeder access to the road and the existing ferries can be
operated satisfactorily for only one more year. Accordingly, US$2.3
million has been earmarked in the project for the fabrication, delivery and
start-up of two new ferries.



- 23 -
Strengthening of Planning (30 man-months)
3.16      Highway planning is hampered by the absence of professional
economic and planning staff in RBPC. The project woulc provide funds for
the appointment of a transport economist/planner to RBPC for two and a half
years.   His terms of reference are given in Annex 8.
Highway Organization and Investment Study (69 man-montns)
3.17      The study will cover the area of the country outside the three
regions in the south. It will recommend the agency or agencies to plan,
construct and maintain highways and the most appropriate organization of
these agencies.The study will recommend modus operandi to develop a
coordinated strategy for the highway sector and include a detailed
investment program for highways based on social and econumic priorities of
specific projects for a five year period (FY19B8-92) arnd a long range
program for the period through FY 1997 based on probable future
developments. Consultants for the study will be required to organize and
train a pavement evaluation unit in the RBPC and prepare a pavement
strengthening program as part of the highway investment program. The
outline Terms of Reference of the study are given in Annex 9.
C. Cost Estimates
3.18      Ihe total project cost including physical and price contingencies
is US$ 17.1 million with a foreign exchange component of US$16.0 million or
93°o (lable 3.2).  The base cost estimate is in October 1983 prices.  Price
escalation based on rates shown below has been included in the project cost
estimates.
FY1984 FY1985 FY1986 FY1987 FY1988
Local Costs             25.0%o  20.0%°o  17.0%o  15.0%°o  15.0%°o
Foreign Costs            7.8°,o   7.2%o   6.5%o   6.0%O   6.0%/o
The rates for local costs have been based on discussions with MFEP.  The
rates for foreign costs reflect inflation in the international market.  The
above rates have also been compared with those adopted in recent Bank Group
appraisals in the Sudan and found to be almost the same.

3.19      Equipment and fuel costs were based on recent quotations CIF Port
Sudan. Spare parts costs are notional only. Actual requirements will be
determined by the technical assistance consultants who will use any balance
remaining on expanding the stock of fast moving spares. Consulting
services included in the project will total 471 man-months at an average
base man month cost of US$8,900 including salary costs, fees, international
travel and local subsistence. All the above costs compare favorably with
current costs in the country.
D. Financing
3.20      The project cost is US$17.1 million equivalent.  The Association
will finance all the foreign exchange costs estimated at US$16.0 million.
Local costs amounting to US$1.1 million equivalent will be borne by the
Government.
E. Implementation and Procurement
3.21      The RBPC will be responsible for the execution of the proiect
other than the Highway Organization and Investment Study which will be
executed by the PPU of the MFEP. The two agencies will be assisted by
consultants. Ihe timing of the execution of project components (Table 3.3)
is based on the implementation of the project over a four-year period
beginning July 1984 and agreed with Government. Steps to be taken to
initiate project execution are detailed in Annex 11 and have also been
agreed with the Government.

3.23      Contracts for the supply of Road Maintenance Equipment and spares
for RBPC including the TPU (US$4.59 million) will be awarded after
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with Guidelines for
Procurement under World Bank Loans and Credits. Nine manufacturers have
bid for the two ferries (US$2.31 million) under the ongoing project
following ICB in early 1983. They will be invited to present new bids.



- 28 -
Spares and components for rehabilitation of existing RBPC equipment
(US$3.08 million) will be procured through limited international bidding or
from the original supplier. Training Aids and Equipment (US$0.16 million),
workshop tools and equipment (US$0.29 million), fuel (US$0.23 million) and
bitumen (US$0.75 million) will be procured through limited international
bidding by inviting less than three suppliers from three different
countries to bid. Domestic manufacturers and suppliers will receive a
preference in bid evaluation of 15% or the import tariff whichever is the
lower. Miscellaneous items in packages of less than US$50,000 within a
cieling of US$0.5 million may be procured under local procurement procedure
which are satisfactory to the Association. All Association financed
contracts for bidding packages for goods over US$200,000 will be subject to
prior review of bid notices, documents and evaluation, which will cover
about 80%°o of the estimated value of goods. Other contracts will be subject
to selective post-award reviews. The contracts for technical assistance
services and other consulting services estimates to total about US$5.53
million will be awarded in accordance with Bank Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants. Price will not be used as a factor in evaluating consultants'
proposals. Assurances to this effect have been obtained from Government.
F. Disbursement
3.24      The credit will be disbursed on the following basis:
(a) 100%°o of foreign expenditures for ferries, workshop tools
and equipment, road maintenance equipment, training
aids and equipment, spare parts and fuel and bitumen if
imported directly, 100%°o of local costs (ex-factory), if
manufactured locally and 60%o of local costs, if procured
locally; and
(b) 100/%0 of foreign expenditures for consulting services.
All disbursements will be fully documented to the satisfaction of the
Association. Disbursements are expected to be completed by December 31,
1988.
3.25      The estimated schedule of disbursements of the Credit is given in
Table 3.5. It has been based on anticipated progress in project execution
and disbursement profiles for transportation projects financed by the
Association in the Sudan. The bulk of the disbursements is expected to be
made during a four year period.

G. Accounting, Auditing and Reporting Requirements
3.26      Project Accounts will be maintained by RBPC with separate
accounts for each component.  RBPC's accounting system and staff are
adequate to maintain satisfactory project accounts. Auditing of the RBPC
is the responsibility of the Auditor General and accounts have been audited
up to FY1981. However, it is not clear if the audits are detailed. Ihe
Government has agreed that an independent auditor would be appointed to
audit the project accounts as required and not later than nine months after
close of each financial year, he would furnish the Association certified
copies of the project financial statements for such year and a report of
such scope and in such detail as the Association shall have requested.
3.27      Responsibility for project reporting would be shared between
RBPC and consultants as follows:
(i)  inception, progress and final report on technical
assistance by consultants providing these services in
accordance with their terms of reference;
(ii)  inception, progress and final reports on studies by
consultants undertaking the studies in accordance with
their terms of reference; and
(iii) quarterly progress reports and completion report by
RBPC.
ihe Government has agreed on the quarterly progress reporting requirements
and the submission of project completion report by RBPC in a form
satisfactory to the Association not later than six months after the project
closing date (Annex 12).
H. Environmental Impact
3.28      The net environmental impact of the project is favorable.  The
improved maintenance of the gravel roads will reduce the need of
reconstruction of these roads and hence the demand for quarry material
which in many areas of the Sudan is scarce. The improved maintenance of
the paved roads will benefit the environment through reduced fuel
consumption of the vehicles using the roads and hence a reduced production
of noxious fumes resulting in improved air quality.



- 31 -
IV. Project Justification
A. General
4.01      The main economic objective of the proposed project is to ensure
that the recently expanded paved road network, for which RBPC is
responsible will be properly maintained. In addition, the provision of two
ferries at Ed Dueim under the project should ensure the optimal use of the
newly constructed Jebel Aulia-Ed Dueim road. On the institutional side,
the project will provide for technical assistance and training to improve
planning, workshop organization and management and road maintenance
operations.
4.02      The paved network expanded from about 300 km in 1970 to over 2200
km in 1982, with the main growth in traffic over the system having occurred
in the past five or six years. Thus the system is relatively new and except
on some of the older stretches the need for maintenance is not yet
obvious. However, it is conservatively estimated that unless a planned and
systematic maintenance program is introduced the conditions of the system
will deteriorate to the extent that on average the surface roughnessl/
would double within seven years, with consequently significantly increased
vehicle operating costs.
B. Economic Evaluation and Sensitivity Analysis
4.03      Road Maintenance. Calculations have been made of savings in
vehicle operating costs (VOC) from avoidance of doubling of surface
roughness of paved roads over a period of seven years. VOC, by road type
and vehicle type, are shown below.
Table 4.1: Vehicle Operating Costs
(L.S./100 vehicle km)
Type of Road      Car   Light Vehicle   Medium Truck   Truck Trailer   Bus
Paved             8.1       18.2              23.1            67.1        23.2
Note:   Costs are net of taxes and duties.
Source: Consultants and Mission Estimates, mid-1982 prices.
4.04      Ihe VOC savings were then related to the estimated current and
future traffic volumes, and translated into economic benefit streams which
in turn were compared with the aggregate costs of maintenance (including
costs financed under the project) for the system under the RBPC which
maintains paved roads only. These costs equal the aggregate project
assistance to RBPC excluding price contingencies and studies, plus the
budgetted maintenance expenditure of the organization. The costs and
benefits were
1/   A measurement which takes into consideration such features as
potholes, cracks, broken pavement edges etc.



- 32 -
established on the ba.i-s of data obtained before the November 1982
devaluation and consequently were determined on the basis of an exchange
rate of US$1.00 = L.S. 0.88 and a standard conversion factor of 0.6.
Adaptation of the analysis to the post devaluation rates is unlikely to
significantly alter the results. Details of calculations are given in
Annex 13.
4.05      Ihe economic rate of return (ERR) oni the aggregate maintenance
investment is 154%o. Sensitivity analysis assuming costs increased by 25%
and benefits reduced by 50% show an ERR over '0%0.  The beneficiaries will
in the first instance be freight vehicle operators (about 55%) and bus and
light vehicle, including car, operators (45%).  In the competitive
environment existing in Sudan, the savings are expected to be passed on to
consumers.
4.06      Two Ferries at Ed Duelm.  Provision of two ferries at Ed Dueim
will provide access of the economically import;ant area across the Nile to
the paved road from Jebel Aulia to Rabak presently under construction. The
section from Jebel Aulia-Ed Dueim was completed recently under the ongoing
project. The section from Ed Dueim to Rabak 'Ls being financed by the West
German Government. The total cost of these two ferries is about US$2.3
million (October 1983 prices). A recent consultant study 2/ estimates that
one ferry would handle 290 vehicles per day which in the ibsence of the
ferry would be forced to travel 158 km over sandy tracks through the desert
on the east bank of the Nile river rather than using the Jebel Aulia-Ed
Dueim road over the same distance on the west bank. The savings in vehicle
operating costs per year because of the ferry are estimated at L.S. 13
million3/. In other words, the investment cost of the ferry would be
recoupez in a few months only indicating an EF'R of over 100%.
4.07       The potential traffic at the Ed Dueim ferry crossing in 1985 is
estimated at 417 vehicles per day. As one ferry only has a capacity of 290
vehicles per day a second ferry is thus required and economically
justified. Given a projected traffic growth rate of 10% per year, the two
ferries together should be able to cope with the traffic demand till the
late 1980's.
C. Risks
4.08      Ihe project may not fully achieve its institutional objectives.
The difficult living and working conditions particularly in the field, in
the Sudan may hamper the efforts of the technical assistance staff provided
under the project. Besides, their effectiveness in training local staff
will depend on the motivation of local staff and their leadership.

1984.
3/   158 (km) x L.S. 0.89 (VOC savings/km for a 6 ton truck comparing sandy
track conditions with paved road conditionis) x 290 (vehicles per day)
x 365 (days per year) = L.S. 13.4 million.

THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
SIaff Appraisal Report
Transportation Cost Review
Terms of Reference
Review Objectives
1.        Freight transport has grown rapidly zin Sudan in recent years,
with trucking displacing rail as the main transport mode. In 1971/72, the
traffic (in billion ton kilometers) carried by rail and road was 2.7 and
0.9 respectively; by 1981/82, rail had declined to 1.5 and trucking
increased to 3.9. The Government of Sudan therefore considers it timely to
review the economic consequences of these developments.
2.        The objectives of the review would be to determine:
(i)    the current cost of transportation for the two major
transport modes--road and rail--in terms of;
a) financial costs, and
b) economic costs:
(ii)   the impact of the structural change in freight
transport--from rail to road--on the transport costs for
major exports (see para 3);
(iii)  the fiscal consequences of the change in intermodal--road
versus rail--traffic distribution, and
(iv)   the capacity of the two major traffic modes to handle the
projected export growth, and the likely impact on Sudan's
export of a possible move towards:
a) elimination of product specific fiscal subsidies on
fuels,
b) pricing of transport services according to economic
opportunity costs; and
c) a change in the rates of license fees, road taxes and
other related road user charges.
3.        The review will focus on two major export products for which
reasonably continuous and systematic transport flow patterns can be
identified. These are:
(i)    cotton from the Gezira Scheme and,
(ii)   groundnuts from the Western Sudan.

SAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Outline Terms of l;e,erence of the Highway Organization and Investment Study
1.        The Gover ment wishes to commission a study of highway
administration out.s-de the southern region with a view to establishing the
most appropriate iastitutional framework to plan, develop and maintain an
optimum road network. The study should form the basis to formulate highway
policy and prepare a detailed highway investment plan for the period
FY1989-93, as well as an indicative phase for the period FY1994-98. it
will take into account the fundings of other inter-related transport
studies such as that. to be undertaken on railway operation and investment.
2.        The study comes at stage when the main paved road network is
expanding repidly and attention is being directed towards improving the
main gravel roads and secondary and feeder roads, particularly in the five
major irrigation schemes.
3.        The objectives of the study are to:
(a)     make recommendations for the improvement of highway
administration;
(b)     review and recommend on specific improvements to
transport planning and coordination;
(c)     review and recommend on specific improvements to
government highway policy, especially vehicle
regulations, tariff and user charge policies to ensure
optimum utilization of existing assets and efficient
operation of highway agencies and
(d)     make a detailed program of highway investment for FY
1989-93 and an indicative program for FY1994-98.
4.        The study should, inter alia, cover the following specific areas
of interest and concern:
(a)     road classification and design standards;
(b)     establishment of policies relating to fuel pricing and
consumption aimed at reducing wasteful fuel consumption;
(c)     improvement needed in organization of existing agencies,
such as the RBPC and/or formation of new agencies to
perform highway development and maintenance functions;
(d)     existing legislation regarding the control of motor
vehicle weights and dimensions (including axle loads),
motor vehicle imports, taxation, highway traffic and
operations of the road transport industry and of its
enforcement.

5.        An important part of the study would be the preparation of a
pavement strengthening program as part of the highway investment program,
which would:
(a)     evaluate the strength and residual life of existing
pavements;
(b)     prepare a program to strengthen sections of pavements;
and
(c)     train a team from the RBF'C in pavement testing and
evaluation techniques. The consultants would recommend
the most suitable pavement testing equipment and procure
such equipment which shall become the property of RPBC.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Project Progress and Reporting Requirements
A.   Project Progress Reports
1.        Progress Reports should be submitted quarterly in triplicate, no
later than one calendar month after the end of the quarter. The first Report
should cover the quarter ending September 30, 1984.
2.        The Report shall contain the following information:
(a) General Information: this section should refer to Project Monitoring
indices and Tentative Indicators (Atl:achment) in reporting the
following:
i)     the physical progress accomplished to date of report and
during the reporting period;
ii)    the progress made in achieving training objectives;
iii)   actual or expected deviations from the project implementation
schedule;
iv)    actual or expected difficulties or delays and their effects
on the implementaton schedule, and the steps planned or taken
to overcome the difficulties aind avoid further delay;
v)     expected changes in the completion date of the project;
vi)    key personnel changes in the staffs of RBPC, SRMCTR,
consuitants or contractor;
vii)   matters which may affect the cost of the project; and
viii) any development activity likely to affect the economic
viability of project components.
(b) A bar-type progress chart, based on the project implementation
schedule, should show the progress in each project component.
(c)  A financial statement should be set out in tabular form and indicate
for each project component:
i)     original estimated cost;
il)    revised cost, if appropriate;
ili)   actual expenditure;
iv)    projected expenditure; and



- 55 -                        Annex 12
Page 2 of 2
(d) Finally, the Report should state the status of action on each
covenant of the Credit Agreement.
B.   Project Completion Report
3.        The Borrower will prepare a Project Completion Report (PCR), to
be submitted to the Association not later than six (6) months after the
Closing Date.
4.        The primary objective of the PCR is to reinforce self-evaluation by
the Borrower and the Association's operating departments and to facilitate
dissemination of lessons learned through the project:
(a) the performance by the Borrower and the Association of their
respective obligations under the Credit Agreement and whether the
Association could have been more helpful;
(b) the results that can be expected from the project, as compared with
expectations at appraisal, and whether the original expectations
were realistic; and
(c) whether in retrospect the project was worth doing or could have been
done better.
5.        For those components of the project for which a rate of return was
estimated during appraisal, the PCR should contain a new estimate of the
return the project is now likely to yield and analyze the reasons for physical
or economic deviations.  However, the new rate of return calculation should be
as simple as possible under the circumstances and should absorb only a minor
portion of the time devoted to the preparation of the PCR. An annex with the
relevant information supporting this analysis should be included.
6.        The basic documents to be referred to are:
(a) Credit Application;
(b) Appraisal Report;
(c) Credit Agreement Documents, Supplementary Letters, etc.;
(d) Supervision Reports;
(e)  Quarterly Progress Reports;
(f) Project Correspondence Files; and
(g) Miscellaneous Evaluation Reports.
7.         The Transportation Division 2, Eastern Africa Projects Department,
will review and comment on the PCR in consultation with the Programs
Department. After approval by the Division Chief, the PCR is sent to the
Association.

Assess!f>!;nt of Benefits from Road Maintenance Program
The following assumptions were made in calculating the ERR on the
road maintenance program:
(1)     Total road freight traffic which was estimated
at 5.24 billion tons km in 1980, will continue
to grow at 5°,' p.a.
(2)     The above traffic translates into 600-650
million freight vehicle km takiLng account of
the approximate 100:13 ratio of medium to heavy
trucks in the Sudan.
(3)     Approximately 75 million gallons of gasoline
were consumed in Sudan in 1981, in the
transport sector and presumably largely by
passenger vehicles.  This can be translated
into a minimum 2,000 million passenger vehicle
km per annum. This is also assumed to grow at
5%' p.a.
(4)     The main benefit on paved roads - essentially
the network under RBPC control is the avoidance
of an approximate doubling of surface roughness
due to potholes, broken pavement edges etc from
2,000 to 4,000 over about seven years, the
project benefit being proportional in the ratio
4/7.
(5)     The average vehicle operating cost (voc)
savings from avoidance of paved road
deterioration is 24%O for passenger vehicles,
and 47%o for freight vehicles.
(6)     Ihe voc savings are applied to the voc
presented in para 4.04.
(7)    Ihe proportion of ultimate deterioration
experienced in years 1 through 4 is assumed to
be 25, 50, 75 and 1000% respectively.
