in the\n            northern savanna zone of Ghana, and the environment through\n            the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources\n            including medicinal plants. There are four main project\n            components. The first assists responsible ministries and\n            agencies in defining and institutionalizing effective and\n            long-term resource policies, strategies, and harvesting\n            guidelines by funding consultant services and staff\n            training. The second component finances capacity building\n            and awareness raising for national, regional, and local\n            government agencies; establishes a herbarium in Tamale;\n            develops a GIS-based biodiversity management information\n            system; strengthens the traditional and alternative\n            medicines directorate of the health ministry; gives support\n            to traditional healers associations, traditional birth\n            attendants, and the Ghana Association of Traditional and\n            Alternative Medicines (GHATRAM); and capacity building and\n            awareness raising for civil society and communities. The\n            third component develops biodiversity management and\n            conservation systems for protected area; improves land\n            management and restores degraded lands in six pilots areas;\n            sustains biodiversity in the development of wildlife\n            corridors; sustains medical plant resources; and funds\n            in-situ and ex-situ germplasm.
