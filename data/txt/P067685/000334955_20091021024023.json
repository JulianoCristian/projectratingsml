environment\n            outcome was substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: the institutional set-up for\n            this project, i.e. an institution (the Savannah Resource\n            Management Center) where staff from various governmental\n            agencies (Ministry of Lands Forestry and Mines (MLFM),\n            Forestry Commission/Wildlife Division, Ministry of Food and\n            Agriculture (MOFA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA))\n            were seconded, proved to be an effective framework for\n            inter-institutional cooperation, and provided a model that\n            could be replicated for the implementation of other\n            multi-sectoral projects/programs. The fact that the Project\n            Coordination Unit (PCU) was located in Tamale, in the\n            Northern region, limited the capacity of the project team to\n            effectively exert political influence and lobby for its\n            interests. As a result, the component on the establishment\n            of a policy framework was the one that had more difficulties\n            in being implemented. One of the achievements of the project\n            is the establishment of two biological corridors between\n            Ghana and Burkina Faso to connect the two ecological blocks\n            of the two countries and allow free movement of wildlife\n            between these blocks. The creation of the corridors also\n            resulted in the signature of a memorandum of understanding\n            (MoU) between the two countries on the management of\n            transfrontier resources."}, "docdt": "2009-09-23T00:00:00Z"}
