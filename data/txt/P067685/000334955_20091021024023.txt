     1. PROJECT CONTEXT, GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN
1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Sector background. At the time of project design, about 60% of the total
population in Ghana was rural. Poverty was highly concentrated in rural areas,
particularly in the savanna zones. To ensure that growth in Ghana benefits the poor, the
Government strategy focused on improving performance in agriculture by increasing
food crops production and expanding opportunities in commercial crops. Such initiatives
however placed pressure on the environment. The key natural resource management
issues in Ghana were land degradation and deforestation, and the loss of biodiversity
associated with unsustainable harvesting levels in the savanna, compounded by
inappropriate farming practices and annual wildfires. The major causes of loss of
biodiversity and natural resource degradation in the savanna zones were related to
tremendous pressure from growing human and livestock populations, agricultural
expansion, inappropriate farming practices, deforestation, annual bush fires, and
introduction of crop varieties that were replacing indigenous varieties.
2.       Government strategy. The above challenges were recognized in the key
Government policies and strategies, i.e. the Forest and Wildlife Policy (1994), and the
Forest Development Master Plan (1996). To address these challenges, the Government of
Ghana was implementing a ten-year country-wide Adaptable Program Loan (APL): the
Natural Resources Management Program (NRMP). The Program was divided in three
phases of two, four, and four years respectively. The objective of the NRMP was to
protect, rehabilitate and sustainably manage national land, forest and wildlife resources
and to sustainably increase the income of rural communities who own these resources.
The full program was designed to address issues of conservation, enhancement and
sustainable utilization of Ghana's land, forest, savanna woodland and wildlife resources
in full and active collaboration and consultation with rural communities and other rural
institutions.
3.      Project's fit into Government' strategy. A six-year GEF biodiversity
component (US$ 8.6. million), the High Forest Biodiversity Conservation Project, was
linked to the NRMP I and II to specifically support the NRMP in the Southern High
Forest. The Northern Savanna Biodiversity Conservation Project (NSBCP) (GEF US$ 7.6
million) was designed to complement and support the implementation of the NRMP in
the northern savanna region of Ghana. The project was `partially blended' to the NRMP,
and baseline activities for this project were expected to be covered under the NRMP II.
4.     Project's fit into Bank's assistance strategy. One of the key objectives of the
Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) at the time of project design and approval
was to improve the performance of agriculture to reduce poverty while ensuring the
sustainability of natural resources. The Bank's main instrument to support the
government's efforts in ensuring sustainable utilization of natural resources was the
above mentioned Natural Resources Management Program (NRMP) APL. This project,
the Northern Savanna Biodiversity Conservation Project (NSBCP), was designed to
incrementally complement the NRMP in the northern savanna region of Ghana.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators

5.      The Project Development Objective (PDO) of the project was "to improve the
livelihoods and health of communities in the northern savanna zone and the environment
through the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources, including medicinal
plants". The Global Environment Objective (GEO) of the project was "to identify,
monitor and conserve key components of the biodiversity of the northern savanna zone".
6.       The Grant Agreement refers only to the PDO.
7.     Key performance indicators. The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) reports
two different set of performance indicators.

8.     Implementation Supervision Reports (ISRs) referred to the indicators reported in
Section A.2 of the PAD.

9.     In addition, although not defined `key performance indicators', Annex 12 of the
PAD (Monitoring and Evaluation) includes another different set of (quite comprehensive)
outcome indicators (over 30), as well as datasets, methods and frequency for measuring
them. No indicators were reported in the Legal Agreement.


1.3 Revised GEO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

10.      There were no revisions in the PDO and GEO.
11.     At Mid-Term Review (MTR), key indicators for the PDO and GEO were revised
as follows:
  Key performance indicators at project entry                          Revised Indicators at MTR

12.    In addition, 5 new outcome indicators were added to measure progress at
component level. 11 new intermediate outcome indicators were defined to measure
progress towards the PDO/GEO.
13.       The new indicators were included in the amended Grant Agreement.
14.     Reasons for revising the key indicators. During MTR, the supervision team
assessed that the existing set of indicators did not allow an adequate monitoring and
evaluation for two reasons: (i) there were too many indicators, thus scattering the focus of
what was more important to measure, and (ii) most of the chosen indicators were not
`impact' indicators. In consultation with QK, it was then decided to streamline the result
framework by (i) reducing the number of indicators (from 8 to 5), and (ii) define a new
set of indicators against which to measure the progress and achievements of the project.
The revision of the indicators was one of the actions taken in the restructuring proposed
at MTR, and approved by the Vice President (VP) of the Africa Region (ref. par. 22).
Revised indicators were included in the amended Grant Agreement.


1.4 Main Beneficiaries

15.     According to the PAD, the project was expected to benefit people at three
different levels:
      -   People at local/community level, who would benefit from improved biodiversity
          management and from sustainability of threatened natural and agro-biological
          resources. The project worked with over 76 forest fringe communities, providing
          training and support to develop alternative livelihood activities;
      -   People at regional and national level, who would benefit from the improved use of
          savanna resources and their direct or indirect contribution to the national economy.
          Specifically the project worked with Ministry of Lands Forestry and Mines
          (MLFM), Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA), Ministry of Health (MOH),
          Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (MLGRD), Ministry of
          Environment and Science (MES), and District Assemblies. These institutions
          benefited from capacity building support, in the form of trainings and equipment.
          In addition, three international and several national NGOs (e.g. IUCN, Tree Aid)
          were able to expand their programs thanks to partnership arrangements for the
          implementation of the project. Finally, research institutions and academia, such as
          the University of Development Studies (UDS) in Tamale and the Savanna
          Agricultural Research Institute (SARI) benefited from the project.
      -   People at global level, who would benefit from the conservation of the Ghana's
          Northern Savanna ecosystems and biodiversity (including medicinal plants),
          whose uniqueness has a global value.

1.5 Original Components

16.     The project was originally designed with the following four components (details
on the activities supported under each component are reported in Annex 10):
     (a) Formulation of a Policy Framework. This component was aimed at improving
         the policy framework for biodiversity conservation.
     (b) Capacity Building and Awareness Raising. This component was aimed at
         strengthening the capacity of key government and non-governmental stakeholders
         in sustainable biodiversity conservation and management and at raising awareness
         on natural resources and biodiversity conservation throughout the northern
         savanna zone.
     (c) Biodiversity Conservation, Research and Development. This component was
         aimed at improving biodiversity conservation and management in selected areas
         in the northern savanna zone.
     (d) Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation. This component was aimed
         at establishing a project management unit and strengthening the SRMC, which
         was responsible for supervising and monitoring the implementation of the project.

18.     The original structure of the project was maintained (4 components, only slightly
renamed to reflect the new content), but the sub-components and activities were
significantly re-organized. Some activities were cancelled or reduced in scope, whereas
other were added or expanded. For example:
     (a) The scope of component 1 (Policy Framework Establishment) was scaled down,
         and it was decided to concentrate the focus of the component on the development
         of a Savanna Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (instead of a National
         Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan) and on the development of a policy on
         Indigenous Knowledge related to Plant Genetic Resource (instead of the
         development of broad policies on Intellectual Property Rights and Bio-safety).

                                                 6
  (b) In component 2 (Capacity Building and Awareness Raising), support to the
      establishment of a Herbarium was reduced to the minimum requirements to make
      it functional.
  (c) In component 3 (Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Livelihoods), support
      to Gbele Reserve was increased, and a new sub-component on support to
      sustainable livelihoods activities (e.g. establishment of mango orchards, bee-
      farming, low tillage and small ruminant farming, eco-tourism, etc.) was
      introduced. The choice to give more emphasis to sustainable livelihoods activities
      was used on the one hand to bring the project more in line with the stated PDO,
      and on the other hand as an entry point to actively engage communities in natural
      resource management and release their pressure on the reserves.
19.     Reasons for revising the components. During MTR, it was agreed that the way
the project activities were clustered and organized in the project document was confusing
and lacked consistency. Several different classification and coding systems were used in
the PAD, the Annual Operating Plan, the Procurement Plan, the Project CostTab, and the
Annual Reports. This made it difficult to clearly identify a clear nexus between
procurement/inputs, disbursement, project activities, and impact. For this reason, it was
decided to reorganize the sub-components and cluster of activities as described in the
table above. Changes were approved by the Regional VP (ref. par. 22 for more details)


1.7 Other significant changes

20.   In addition to revision of indicators and components, there were four significant
changes during project implementation:
  (a) Geographical re-focus of interventions. During MTR it was observed that the
      activities were too geographically scattered to have a significant impact. It was
      then agreed to reduce the geographical scope of the operation and to focus the
      interventions around the two identified biological corridors, i.e. the Western
      Corridor, from Nazinga in Burkina Faso to Mole NP via Gbele RR; and Eastern
      Corridor, along the Border with Togo. The project worked in protected areas,
      forest reserves, and agricultural lands, adopting a more `landscape' approach to
      conservation and natural resource management.
  (b) Shift in project approach to conservation and sustainable management of
      natural resources. Recognizing the difficulties in achieving conservation
      objectives without linking them to sustainable livelihoods objectives, the project,
      after MTR, put a lot of emphasis on supporting sustainable livelihoods activities
      (e.g. establishment of mango orchards, bee-farming, low tillage and small
      ruminant farming, eco-tourism, etc.), bringing the project more in line with the
      specification of the PDO. A specific sub-component on sustainable livelihoods
      was introduced, and a significant amount of resources were reallocated to this
      sub-component. This choice represented quite a significant shift in the overall
      project approach to conservation and sustainable management of natural resources.
      The project adopted a more `integrated' approach to natural resource management,



                                           7
      where the objectives of biodiversity and agro-biodiversity conservation,
      production of environmental services, improved livelihoods were jointly pursued.
(c) Budget allocation among components and budget categories. During MTR, it
    was agreed that the cost of the activities had not been correctly estimated during
    project design, and therefore the budget allocation among the various categories
    did not reflect the actual financial needs. In addition, following the reorganization
    of activities and sub-components, budget allocation among components needed
    also to be corrected. It was therefore agreed to reallocate the resources among the
    various components and budget categories as summarized in the two tables
    below:

     (d) Extension of the closing date. Because of the delays in the start-up of the project
         (grant was signed in April 2002, but delays in meeting the effectiveness condition
         caused effectiveness to be declared only in November 2002, and project activities
         started only in January 2003), and initial difficulties in implementing project
         activities (31% disbursement only at MTR), most of the project activities could
         not be completed by the project closing date. The project closing date was thus
         extended by one year (from February 08 to February 09).
21.     Approval of changes. The changes agreed at MTR [i.e. (i) modification of
performance indicators; (ii) narrowing down of geographical scope; (iii) recasting of
project components with some activities reduced, some scaled-up and some added; and
(iv) reallocation of the proceeds of the Grant] resulted in the amendment of the Grant
Agreement (as referred to in par. 13 and 19) and were approved by the VP of the Africa
Region1. These changes did not have a negative impact on the outcomes of the project.
On the contrary, as discussed in the following sections (2.1-2.2), they substantively
contributed to improve the performance of the project.


      2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

22.        Factors that have positively affected the quality at entry.
     (a) The choice to decentralize project management where the project is
         implemented. The choice to host the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) to the
         Savanna Resource Management Center (SRMC) in Tamale, the capital of the
         Northern Region, revealed itself to be a good choice for two reasons. First, actual
         project management (i.e. planning, supervision, monitoring) was located close to
         where the project was implemented. Second, the choice of the SRMC, an
         institution where technical staff from MOFA, EPA, MLGRD, and FC is seconded,
         facilitated the coordination among agencies that had overlapping mandates and
         complementary roles in biodiversity conservation and project implementation
         (each agency was in fact responsible for the implementation of a component or a
         set of sub-components).
     (b) The importance given to the involvement of local communities in NRM and
         to awareness rising. This approach, quite innovative at that time in Ghana,
         initially encountered resistance from the Government, but eventually was one of
         the key factors of success of the project.

    The restructuring was done before the new Restructuring Guidelines.


                                                      9
23.      Factors that have negatively affected the quality at entry.
    (a) The cancellation of the second phase of the Natural Resource Management
        Project APL (NRMP-II). In the initial design, the NRMP-II was expected to
        provide the baseline for the Northern Savannah Biodiversity Conservation Project
        (NSBCP), while the NSBCP was supposed to cover the incremental costs linked
        to the biodiversity of global significance in a US$ 28 million package. However,
        when it became clear that the NRMP-II would have not materialized, the scope of
        the NSBCP was not reduced accordingly, and the objectives of the NSBCP ended
        up being too ambitious for its resources (US$ 7.6 million). As a result, project
        activities became too fragmented and spread-out, both geographically and
        thematically, and the impact of the project limited. The attempt to link the
        NSBCP with the Community Based Rural Development Project (CBRDP) to
        address this issue did not materialize.
    (b) The inadequate design of the M&E system (ref. section 2.3). The selected
        indicators did not allow to properly monitoring progress towards the PDO/GEO;
        baseline and target values were not defined2.
    (c) Limited use of existing lessons and experience in community-based
        conservation available in the Region. Several examples and lessons on
        community-based NRM from similar projects were available in the Region, e.g.
        the Partnership for Natural Ecosystem Management project (PAGEN) in Burkina
        Faso, the Pilot Community-Based Natural Resources and Wildlife Management
        project (GEPRENAF) in Cote d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso, among other projects.
        However, it seems that during project design examples and lessons from these
        projects have not been taken sufficiently into account. For instance, the
        experience from GEPRENAF showed that project activities were too spread-out
        to have an impact. Adequate key performance indicators were selected in PAGEN.
        These lessons could have been used to improve the quality of the design of the
        NSBCP.
    (d) Non inclusion of single-source clause for IUCN in project document.
        According to an initial plan, coordination of transboundary planning of biological
        corridors in Burkina Faso, Mali, Cote d'Ivoire, and Ghana was supposed to be
        granted to IUCN. This meant that all Bank's projects dealing with transboundary
        corridors in these four countries were supposed to contract IUCN for this activity.
        However, the single-source clause for contracting IUCN was not included in the
        procurement arrangements of the project document. For this reason, partnership
        with IUCN was delayed, and several activities that IUCN was supposed to carry
        out (e.g. baselines) were delivered late.



2
  In partial justification to the weak M&E at entry, it has to be said that at the time of project design (2002)
less emphasis was given to the design of the indicators and M&E. The concepts of `outcome' indicators (vs
`performance' indicators) and `SMART' indicators (i.e. specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and
time-bound) were still not clearly institutionalized. Log-frames (rather than Result Frameworks) were the
tools used for project design.

2.2 Implementation

24.   Factors that have positively contributed to project implementation.
  (a) Partnerships between the Government and CSOs/NGOs: The strategic choice
      to work in partnership with several civil society organizations (CSOs) and non-
      governmental organizations (NGOs) (taking advantage of the comparative
      advantages of each of them) has probably contributed to effectively reach-out and
      support many rural communities. Public institutions could not in fact fully cover
      the northern savanna territory, and could not be expected to possess all the
      necessary expertise and resources to adequately back-up all the activities carried-
      out under the project.
  (b) The decision at MTR to narrow-down the geographical focus of the project,
      and to concentrate the activities around the two biological corridors. During
      MTR it was observed that the activities were too geographically scattered to have
      a significant impact. It was then decided to reduce the geographical scope of the
      operation and to focus the interventions around the two identified biological
      corridors, working at the same time on different landscapes, i.e. protected areas,
      forest reserves, and agricultural lands. By focusing the different typologies of
      interventions into a relatively limited geographical space, the project exploited the
      synergies among the different activities and maximizing their impact. As
      discussed in the section on Lessons Learnt (Section 6), this is considered an
      important factor that positively contributed to the implementation of the project,
      and an important lesson that could be replicated.
  (c) The decision to reorganize and streamline the design of the M&E system.
      During MTR, the M&E system was improved. 5 new indicators were adopted (ref.
      Section 1.3), and baselines and targets established. This provided an adequate
      reference for monitoring progress towards project objectives. Even though these
      indicators remained imperfect (ref. Section 2.3), the reformulation of the
      indicators at MTR represented a clear improvement compared to what was agreed
      at project entry and a commendable effort to address one of the major
      shortcomings of project design.
25.   Factors that have negatively affected project implementation.
  (a) Limited political weight of the SRMC to influence political decisions. While
      the choice to locate the PCU in Tamale, closer to where the project was
      implemented, positively contributed to the successful implementation of most of
      the activities, the distance of the PCU from the capital had negative impact in
      terms of its capacity to exert political influence and lobby for its interests. It is
      probably for this reason that the objectives of Component 1 of the project (i.e.
      developing a policy framework for biodiversity conservation) were only partially
      achieved (ref. Annex 2 for details).




                                           11
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

26.    The M&E arrangements appear to be one of the weakest aspects of the project.
  (a) Design. The PDO and GEO were defined rather broadly (ref. Section 1.2), and
      not backed-up by adequate indicators. In general, it is not clear which indicators
      were chosen to measure progress towards the objectives, as the PAD reports three
      sets of different indicators (i.e. in Section A.2, in Annex 1 and in Annex 12). Most
      of the selected indicators were not `outcome' indicators - some of them cannot
      even be considered indicators (e.g. `increased public awareness on biodiversity
      issues', or `measurable reduction in poverty and improved health care and
      livelihood systems'). No baselines or target values were set. An alternative M&E
      system was designed by the PCU, but data were not collected until MTR.
  (b) Implementation and Utilization. The weakness of the M&E was not detected
      until MTR. The MTR recognized that the existing M&E was not conducive to
      measure progress and achievements, and that most of the indicators were not
      outcome indicators. Consequently, various actions to correct and improve the
      weaknesses of the M&E arrangements were taken: a new set of indicators was
      adopted (ref. Section 1.3), baselines and target values for these indicators
      established, and, since then, progress was regularly assessed against this new set
      of indicators.
       The reformulation of the indicators at MTR represented a clear improvement
       compared to what was agreed at project entry. Albeit not perfect (some of the new
       indicators continued to be `process' rather than `outcome' indicators), the new
       indicators were commonly accepted as acceptable proxies to assess project
       outcomes at the time of the MTR, and provided an adequate reference to assess
       the project outcomes.
27.     Note of caution. In partial justification to the weak M&E of the project, it has to
be said that at the time of project design (2002) less emphasis was given to the design of
the indicators and M&E. The concepts of `outcome' indicators (vs `performance'
indicators) and `SMART' indicators (i.e. specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and
time-bound) were still not clearly institutionalized. Log-frames (rather than Result
Frameworks) were the tools used for project design. Even if the indicators proposed at
MTR would probably be considered inadequate for today' standards, at the time of MTR
they were commonly accepted as sufficiently good proxies to assess project outcomes.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

28.     Compliance with safeguards. The project was categorized as a Category B
project under the World Bank safeguard policies and guidelines. The safeguards policies
triggered by the project were Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) Pest Management
(OP 4.09) and Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12).




                                            12
    (a) Environmental safeguards. To comply with the environmental safeguards, an
        Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) was prepared during project
        preparation. The ESIA was discussed and disclosed both in country and at the
        Bank's Infoshop in 2001. The ESIA includes an Environmental and Social
        Management Plan (ESMP), which outlines the necessary measures to mitigate
        adverse impact that could emerge during implementation. The ESMP looked at
        component activities, impact levels, mitigation measures and status of monitoring.
    (b) Involuntary Resettlement. The version of the World Bank's Involuntary
        Resettlement Policy that applied to this project was Operational Directive (OD)
        4.30. The newer Operational Policy and Bank Procedures (OP/BP) 4.12 took
        effect on January 1, 2002 and applies only to projects for which the Project
        Concept Review meeting takes place on or after that date. The Concept Review
        for this project took place during 1999-2000 3 . Because OD 4.30 (rather than
        OP/BP 4.12) was in effect during the preparation of this project, a formal
        Resettlement Process Framework was not required, and none was prepared.
        Nonetheless, OD 4.30 was triggered because of the need to take into account the
        livelihoods of people living in the vicinity of project-supported protected areas,
        and mechanisms to address livelihood-related issues were reflected within the
        project's ESMP. No physical displacement of people was ever envisaged during
        NSBCP preparation, and none was needed to carry out the project's stated
        objectives.
        During project implementation in 2006, Government proposed the resettlement of
        the Gbele village (234 people in 24 households), as part of the consolidation of
        the Gbele Resource Reserve (RR), one of the project-supported protected areas4.
        The role of the NSBCP consisted in supporting in 2007 an analysis of alternatives
        to determine the feasibility and costs of carrying out such a resettlement (see
        Gbele Resettlement Socio-economic Survey). A multi-stakeholder Resettlement
        Committee5 was established. It identified a potential site for resettling the entire
        Gbele village, and agreed with local chiefs on the release of the entire land parcel
        needed to resettle this community. Following extensive stakeholder consultation,
        the Gbele community as a whole had fully agreed to the proposed resettlement,
        which Government considers to be voluntary in nature 6 . However, no
        Resettlement Action Plan had been prepared during the project, since this activity


3
 The February 13, 2002 version of the PAD (page 30) erroneously mentions OP/BP 4.12 (rather than OD
4.30) as applying to this project.
4
  Based on the Management Plan of the Gbele Resource Reserve, successful resettlement of the Gbele
village out of the reserve would reduce the pressures on natural resources within this protected area,
thereby improving the prospects for its long-term sustainable management.

 Comprising, among other institutions, the Wildlife Department, the Forestry Department, the District
Assembly, the Department of Social Welfare and Community Development, and representatives of the
divisional and paramount chiefs of the area.
6
  It is understood that the resettlement, if it were carried out with Bank support, might well be
presumptively treated as if it were involuntary, since some households might conceivably have different
preferences from the community as a whole.


                                                  13
      was not planned as a part of the NSBCP and only arose as a possible follow-up
      action late during project implementation, and no budget had been allocated to
      finance it. Government might decide to proceed with this proposed resettlement in
      the near future, provided that it can mobilize the needed financial support from its
      national budget. If the resettlement were to proceed, the Government (MLNR)
      would take responsibility for the construction of houses and other civil works, as
      well as any compensation payments due to the community. If such resettlement
      were to be incorporated within any future Bank-supported operation, it would
      need to be carried out in accordance with OP/BP 4.12.
      Based on the above, we can conclude that the Bank complied with its Involuntary
      Resettlement Policy, both during project design and implementation. There is no
      legacy or obligation for the Bank in relation to a possible resettlement of the
      Gbele community after the project closure.
29.   Fiduciary compliance.
  (a) Quality and compliance to procurement rules. The quality and compliance to
      procurement is satisfactory. Project preparation involved qualified procurement
      specialists who provided qualitative inputs. The design of the procurement scope,
      procedures, review thresholds and frequency of supervision was based on analysis
      of Country Procurement Assessment, Country Performance Portfolio Review,
      procurement capacity assessment of the Ministry of Land and Forestry and NBCP
      Project Management Team. Lessons from previous programmes were
      incorporated and major risks and mitigation measures were identified. Trainings
      for the MLF procurement Unit and the NBCP Project Management Team were
      conducted to ensure adequate capacity for efficient procurement management.
      Procurement aspects were carefully monitored during supervision. Even though
      procurement performance was unsatisfactory until MTR (mainly because of poor
      procurement planning, the lack of procurement focal person at the PCU and
      cumbersome procedures for approvals), performance improved after MTR thanks
      to the recommendations made during the Review, and stabilized on `satisfactory'
      until the end of the project.
  (b) Factors that affected the quality of procurement during project
      implementation. Among the factors that affected the quality of procurement, it is
      important to mention the weak coordination between the Project Management
      Unit (PMU) and the Procurement Unit. Although the overall responsibility for
      project administration, including procurement, rested on the PMU in Tamale,
      procurement management was vested in the Procurement Unit (PU) of MLF in
      Accra, according to the existing practice in Ghana. Coordination between the
      PMU and the PU was weak and this caused several delays in implementing
      procurement.
  (c) Efficiency. In several cases, goods could be purchased by the Ministry's
      `procurement hub' at a very low price, as similar items for different projects were
      purchased together through big contracts using competitive bidding. Assessment
      of cost of items procured through lower procurement methods (e.g shopping) was
      found to be reasonable. As far as contract management is concerned, few


                                           14
       shortcomings were observed. Protracted delays in payment for goods and service
       delivered were rampant due to slow processing of invoices. In the case of works
       contracts, delays of up to over six months, amounting to over 45% time overruns
       have been encountered, with the main reason being delay in payment.


2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

30.    Next phase. Beside a small GEF Medium-Size Project (US$ 1 million) (see
below), a large Bank-funded second phase or follow-on project specifically on
biodiversity conservation is not immediately planned. As discussed in Section 4, in
several cases the awareness created, the capacity built, and the foundations for the
community enterprises that have been established during the project would be sufficient
to ensure the sustainability of the outcomes. In many other cases, however, additional
support to consolidate and capitalize the achievements of the project will be necessary.
Possible sources of support that could help consolidating the achievements of the project
would include:
  (a) CSOs/NGOs: Several organizations that have, in various forms, collaborated and
      contributed to the project (e.g. SNV, Tree Aid, IUCN, RUMNET, etc.) will likely
      continue their support beyond the end of the project with other resources than the
      NSBCP's. Their support would possibly help to achieve sustainability of some of
      the outcomes of the project.
  (b) Government's own budget/ Natural Resources and Environmental
      Governance (NREG) DPO: Several activities that would guarantee long-term
      sustainability of the outcomes of the project could in theory be directly supported
      by the Government with its own budget. The likely increase in the Government's
      budget for natural resource management due to the budget support of the NREG
      DPO could possibly contribute to this. However, whether additional funds for
      natural resource management will be allocated to sustain the achievements of this
      project will ultimately depend on the Government's commitment to use these
      resources for this purpose vis-à-vis other priorities.
  (c) GEF Medium-Size Project (MSP) for Landscape Management and
      Biodiversity: A proposal for a MSP (US$ 1 million) was submitted to GEF in
      December 2008 and approved.           This proposal aims at supporting the
      implementation of the management plan of the Gbele Reserve, and of the
      management plans of the two corridors. While it would be important to guarantee
      an immediate follow-up to some of the activities of the NSBCP, these resources
      could only contribute to support some of the achievements of the project.
31.     Possible (alternative) way forward. Although a specific Bank project on
biodiversity conservation is not in the pipeline, there are various, non-exclusive, options
to capitalize the lessons and results of this project into other Bank operations (Annex 11
describes how lessons from the project may have application in the wider context of
sustainable development of the Northern Region):
  (a) Mainstreaming the approach in rural development initiatives in the North:
      The NSBCP has developed and tested an approach in Northern Ghana that, if

                                            15
        implemented in a defined space, could probably deliver significant results in
        terms of better NRM and sustainable livelihoods. This approach - characterized
        by Government-NGOs partnerships, inter-institutional cooperation, involvement
        and empowerment of communities in NRM, a set of different activities to
        stimulate better NRM specifically tailored to the characteristics and assets of the
        different communities, spatial planning, etc., could be adapted and replicated to
        different interventions in the field of rural development in the North (e.g. natural
        resource-based SafetyNets, community management of common resources to
        mitigate the risks/effects of natural hazards, sustainable land management, etc).
  (b) Promoting a NRM-based tourism growth in North-Western Ghana: The
      Northern Development Strategy and the Government's Manifesto for a better
      Ghana - among other policy strategies and action plans - identify tourism
      (including natural-based tourism) as a possible driver for economic growth in
      Northern Ghana. Achievements and lessons from the NSBCP set the foundations
      for a potential `growth pole' in the North-West of Ghana based on tourism, in
      which Mole National Park would represent the central attraction, and Gbele
      Reserve, Bui National Park, and the South-Nazinga/Western Corridor the satellite
      attractions. The main products under this package would include nature-based
      tourism (e.g. eco-tourism, safari hunting), cultural tourism, and recreational
      tourism. To develop this vision, a relatively limited set of investments, including
      infrastructure development (e.g. roads, dams, offices, visitor centers), private
      sector development (e.g. brokerage), natural resource-based community enterprise
      development, and resource management in protected areas would be needed.


      3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

32.     The project objectives remain relevant to the current country and Bank's
assistance strategy, particularly in relation to their potential to support economic growth.
33.     Relevance to existing country strategies.
  (a) Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy II (GPRS-II). The country's main
      development strategy (2005-09) identifies degradation of the nation's forests;
      depletion of biomass; inefficient use and management of natural resources;
      inequality in sharing the benefits from natural resources, as some of the issues that
      affect economic growth, and sets `restoration of degraded environment and
      natural resource management' as one of the key areas of focus. Among the
      strategies that the GPRS-II outlines to support this development objective: to
      ensure the involvement of communities in sustainable land, forest and wildlife
      resources; to promote integrated ecosystem management; and to develop multi-
      agency approaches to enhance NRM. Development of sustainable eco-tourism is
      also mentioned as a strategy to develop the tourism sector.

    (b) Northern Development Strategy. The Sustainable Development Initiative for
        Northern Ghana - or Northern Development Initiative (NDI) (2009-25) - sets the
        vision of a `forested North' as the long-term vision for the northern regions. The
        Strategy recognizes: (i) the need for households to diversify their sources of
        income; (ii) sustainable land and water management as one of the key strategies to
        increase agricultural productivity; and (iii) the role that tourism (including eco-
        tourism) can play in sustaining economic growth in the regions. The Strategy also
        recognizes that the destruction of natural reserves and game-hunting (particularly
        in the precincts of the Mole NP and Gbele RR) have affected the ability of the
        North to offer viable eco-tourism potentials, and implicitly suggests that
        addressing this issue may contribute to economic growth in the North.
    (c) Manifesto for a better Ghana. The Manifesto for a better Ghana, the political
        roadmap of the new Government that was elected in December 2008, sets
        "Reinforce protection and management of National Parks and other wildlife
        protected areas to sustain biodiversity [...] and eco-tourism" as one of the key
        objectives for the Government under the Economy pillar.
34.     Relevance to current Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The current
CAS (FY08-11) recognizes that the cost of depletion of natural resources (including
forests and wildlife) in Ghana is reducing the potential for economic growth of the
country by about 1% of the GDP. Sustainable natural resource management is one of the
areas of Bank' support under pillar 1 of the CAS - Enhance the Competitiveness of the
Private Sector.


3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives

35.     The assessment of the extent to which the operation's objectives were achieved
should take into consideration the fact that the PDO/GEO, while appropriate, were
defined rather broadly. According to the ICR Guidelines, "... whenever the stated
PDO/GEO are broad and/or vaguely worded [...] intended objectives [need to be]
inferred [...] from key associated outcome targets"7.
36.      Consistent with the approach recommended by the ICR Guidelines, the ICR team
built its assessment by (i) outlining the logical linkage between key indicators (as revised
at MTR) and project objectives (ref. Table 1 below), and (ii) complementing the
observation and assessment of the extent to which the key performance indicators were
achieved, with a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the outputs delivered under
the project (ref. Table 2 below and Annex 2). Based on the above, the ICR team is of the
opinion that the achievement of the project objectives can be considered overall
satisfactory.
37.    A more qualitative assessment of the achievement of the project objectives is
reported in par. 38.

of the project outcomes is discussed in Section 4.

  Even though the target for this indicator has been achieved, the ICR team is of the opinion that this indicator was intended to measure a broader policy impact.
With this understanding, the ICR team believes that this indicator was only partially achieved. Out of the intended activities to support of the establishment of a
Policy Framework for biodiversity conservation (e.g. development of a Savanna Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, development of a National Biodiversity
Action Plan, etc. - ref. Section 1.6), only a background paper on Savanna NRM issues has been delivered.

implemented during the project (ref. Annex 2).

  The ICR team is aware the increase in income may not necessarily be directly and only attributed to the project, and that an impact evaluation would be needed
to determine the actual attribution of the project to this outcome. However, for the sake of this exercise, the team here simply looked at the extent of which the
approved indicators were achieved, complementing this information with a qualitative assessment of the outputs delivered (see Annex 2). In this case, the team
considered that several community-based natural-resource based livelihood activities supported by the project (e.g. mango plantations, bee-farming, eco-tourism,
etc.), though not yet fully profitable, have the potential to (and will likely) become profitable in the coming years. For this reason a `satisfactory' rating was given.
                                                                                  20
38.     Qualitative assessment of the achievements of project objectives. In addition
to the above assessment, the ICR team was requested to provide a more qualitative
assessment of the project achievements. By cross-referencing the field information with
the information producing during implementation, the ICR team believes that the project
produced reasonable (i.e. satisfactory) outcomes. Mango plantations for market exports,
production of shea-nut and shea butter, community-based eco-tourism have improved or
have the potential to improve the livelihoods of the communities targeted by the project.
Better fire management and better surveillance of illegal activities in some areas have led
to local improvements in the environment 16 of the communities (e.g. better range of
livestock, more small game for hunters, lesser distance to collect firewood). Finally, the
wildlife baseline survey carried-out in corridors, the increased knowledge of indigenous
crops, the establishment of the herbarium, the ex-situ storage and in-situ cultivation of
germplasm, and the increased effectiveness in the management of Mole NP, Gbele RR,
South Nazinga and 5 Forest Reserves have contributed to identify, monitor, and conserve
key components17 of biodiversity.


3.3 Efficiency

39.     An Economic and Financial Analysis was not conducted at the end of the project,
and the Government's ICR does not include an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of
the project. The ICR team analyzed the business plans of the Mongori Eco-Village and of
the ITFC (Integrated Tamale Fruit Company, the agro-business company that
commercializes organic mango in Northern Ghana). Both business plans estimated an
increase in the business volume and net profits, suggesting that that costs for the start up
of these activities (eco-tourism in the Mongori village and organic mango plantations)
have been recovered, and these activities are profitable. However, generalizing these
results to all the activities supported by the project is not possible.
40.     As standard procedure for GEF projects, an Incremental Cost Analysis (to
demonstrate the incremental global environmental benefits of the project) and not an
Economic Analysis was carried out during project preparation. However, to demonstrate
financial profitability of certain activities supported by the project (i.e. agro-forestry with
cash tree crops such as mango and cashew), a financial analysis was made. Two farm
models were developed comparing three scenarios: `business as usual' and `agro-forestry
with cash tree crops' (one with mango and one with cashew). The Net Present Value
(NPV) for the mango model was 1.57 million cedis, with an Internal Rate of Return
(IRR) of 93%. The NPV for cashew model was 80,000 cedis, with an IRR of 52%.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

        Rating:          Satisfactory

41.     Overall outcome rating is an average of the ratings given to (a) relevance of
objectives/design; (b) achievement of development objectives; and (c) efficiency.
  (a)   Relevance of objectives/design (Section 3.1): Satisfactory. Project objectives
        remain relevant to the current country and Bank's assistance strategy,
        particularly in relation to their potential to support economic growth.
  (b)   Achievement of development objectives (Section 3.2): Satisfactory. As per
        ICR Guidelines, where the stated PDO/GEO are so broad and/or vaguely worded
        as to preclude any meaningful evaluation, intended objectives should be inferred
        from key associated outcome targets. As shown in Table 2 above, targets set for
        the indicators used to measure project objectives were achieved. A qualitative
        `expert' assessment of the project achievements suggests that the project
        produced reasonable (i.e. satisfactory) outcomes.
  (c)   Efficiency (Section 3.3): Satisfactory. An Economic and Financial Analysis
        was not conducted at the end of the project, and the Government's ICR does not
        include an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of the project. However, the
        financial analysis made during project preparation and the business plans of
        certain activities supported by the project suggest show the profitability of these
        activities.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

  (a)   Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
42.     Not available.


  (b)   Institutional Change/Strengthening
43.      The project definitively contributed to raise the profile of the governmental
institutions involved in management of the savanna's natural resources (e.g. Forestry
Commission, EPA, etc.). In this regard, the choice of the various implementing agencies
to second their technical staff to the Savanna Resource Management Center ended up
representing an excellent model for project implementation. Because of the multi-sectoral
and cross-sectoral nature of this project, the idea of creating a venue up where institutions
with overlapping roles and mandates as far as management of natural resources in the
savanna zone could collaborate and coordinate their activities and maximize their
synergies offered a workable model that could be replicated in the future in projects of
multi-sectoral nature. However, the long-term sustainability of this institution is unclear.
It seems in fact that cross-sectoral coordination and cooperation can be fostered only
where a project acts as catalyst. In the case of the NSBCP, seconded staff from various
institutions has been called back to their mother institution at the end of the project.



                                              22
  (c)   Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
44.     Two positive unintended outcomes were observed:
  (a)   Political profile of management of transboundary natural resources
        increased. The project definitively contributed to increasing the political profile
        of management of transboundary natural resources, as demonstrated by the
        creation of biological corridors, use of territorial plans, and the signature of a
        Memorandum of Understanding between Burkina Faso and Ghana for the
        management of the Nazinga-Mole corridor.
  (b)   Collaboration between Ghanaian and Burkinabe communities along
        biological corridors strengthened. Community members became more aware
        of the common challenges and on the need to collaborate on the management of
        common (transboundary) natural resources.


3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
45.    An independent Beneficiary Assessment was carried out to: (a) assess the
perception of beneficiaries on their participation to and impact of the project, (b)
document relevant behavioral changes attributable to project activities in the beneficiaries,
and (c) identify key lessons in order to improve community-based natural resource
management approaches. The results of the Assessment were presented and discussed
during a Validation Workshop in October 2008.
46.     Major findings.
  (a)   Beneficiaries' perception on impact of the project. The impact of the NSBCP
        was considered remarkably high by beneficiaries. High levels of both awareness
        and adoption of conservation and sustainable use of natural resources were
        recorded among communities. Current awareness level of biodiversity
        conservation and sustainable use of resources among communities is about 76%
        with adoption rates of around 65% on the average. Positive impact on the
        livelihoods and income of communities was also perceived, mainly thanks to
        increased crop yields due to improved soil fertility, reduction of bushfires, and
        start-up of commercial mango plantations, and to the development of eco-
        tourism. Finally, improved health among communities in the northern savanna
        was perceived thanks to improved accessibility of indigenous medicinal plants.
  (b)   Beneficiaries' perception on effectiveness of project activities. High level of
        participation from both institutions and communities to project activities was
        observed. Participation from staff of the key implementing institutions to training
        activities was rated very high (80%), and between 70-80% of the staff who
        attended these training activities considered its capacity improved. In addition,
        training activities generally resulted in improved motivation. Resources provided
        to implementing agencies through the project (e.g. vehicles, office and field
        equipment, etc.) were perceived by staff of those agencies as having improved
        the effectiveness of their work (70%), as well as the institutions' visibility. High
        effectiveness (80%) of the activities from which communities benefited (e.g.
        awareness creation activities) was also perceived by communities.

47.      A more detailed summary of the Beneficiary Assessment, including key lessons
learnt, is reported in Annexes 5 and 6.
48.     Note of caution. The ICR team is of the opinion that the results of the
Assessment should be considered with caution. Comparing the assessment of
beneficiaries with the assessment of the team made during the completion mission, the
ICR team had the perception that the beneficiaries' assessment of project impact could be
biased towards high. At the same time, the ICR team recognizes that a possible over-
rating of the project outcomes from the beneficiaries may be due to the very low baseline
that beneficiaries experienced.


      4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

      Rating:     Significant

49.     It is extremely difficult to make general statements on whether the outcomes of
this project will be maintained over time. As the project was characterized by several
different activities, the sustainability of the outcomes of the project critically depends on
the specific conditions and circumstances in which the project activities were
implemented.
50.     In general, if long-term sustainability of the outcomes mainly depends on three
factors, i.e. (a) the capacity of community natural resource-based enterprises to become
profitable; (b) the likelihood of communities' involvement in the management of natural
resources generated by the project to be maintained over time; and (c) likelihood that
resources leveraged/mobilized through the project would guarantee support to project
activities beyond the life of the project - our assessment of the risks of development
outcomes can be summarized as follows:
          Criteria                                 Assessment                         Sustainability Risk*

                                In some cases the community-enterprises
                                established during the project have become or are
                                likely to become profitable in the coming years.

                                achievements of the project. Without such
                                support, the achievements of the project will not
                                be maintained over time.

                                 collaborated and contributed to the project (e.g.
                                 SNV, Tree Aid, IUCN, RUMNET, etc.) will
                                 likely continue their support beyond the end of

                                 purpose vis-à-vis other priorities.




18
  The ICR team noted that in all those cases in which the involvement of communities into NRM has been
created through alternative livelihood activities whose link to conservation of natural resources is not direct
(e.g. mango plantations), there is an inherent risks that conservation outcomes are not sustainable. The issue
here is whether the objectives of biodiversity conservation of this project should be `strictly' interpreted as
conservation of protected areas and reserves, or more broadly as conservation of landscapes. In the former
case, the ICR team's concern seems appropriate, as alternative livelihoods with no direct link to
conservation of natural resources seem not to provide enough strong incentives to individuals not to
continue or return to unsustainable use of resources. In the latter case, increased vegetation cover thanks to
(commercial) plantations may have actually contributed to improve the overall status of natural resources at
landscape/corridor level.
19
  One of the activities for which sustainability will critically depend on the immediate availability of
resources is the implementation of the Gbele Reserve Management Plan. A proposal for a MSP (US$ 1
million) was submitted to GEF and approved.

   5. ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE
5.1 Bank

    (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
         Rating:       Moderately Satisfactory
51.     There are a few critical shortcomings in the project design that have negatively
affected the implementation of the project, and that have been rectified only during
project implementation: (i) Indicators were inappropriate, M&E arrangements weak, and
no initial baselines and targets were initially set; (ii) Project activities were too scattered,
both geographically and thematically; (iii) the scope of the operation was not reduced
once it became clear during preparation that the baseline project (NRMP-II) would not
have been approved. However, the project design contained also several positive
elements: the design was relevant and consistent to the country and Bank' strategies. It in
addition included various elements that were innovative and proved to be successful (e.g.
the implementation arrangements, partnership arrangements, etc.). In partial justification
to the weak M&E at entry, it has in addition to be said that at the time of project design
(2002) less emphasis was given to the design of the indicators and M&E. The concepts of
`outcome' indicators (vs `performance' indicators) and `SMART' indicators were still not
clearly institutionalized. For these reasons, MS seems appropriate.


    (b) Quality of Supervision
         Rating:       Satisfactory
52.     Despite in the first few years the project team had to face some difficulties in
implementation, as reflected by slow progress in procurement and project activities and
low disbursement percentages, the team progressively managed to bring the project back
on track, as demonstrated by ISRs ratings which moved from initial U/MU in the first
years of implementation to MS/S until the end of the project. Particularly the team needs
to be praised for recognizing some of the bottlenecks that affected the implementation of
the project at MTR, and for taking a series of measures to refocus and reorganize the
project. Project activities were in fact thematically reorganized to give more emphasis to
the livelihoods of the communities (thus bringing the project activities more in line with
the PDO), and geographically narrowed down. Indicators were reduced in number and
revised. Evidence shows that the overall project implementation benefited from these
measures. Disbursement improved, and, as mentioned above, overall implementation
quality stabilized back to MS and S ratings. Another element that is worth mentioning,
the Bank team facilitated the linkages between the NSBCP team and the project team of
PAGEN, in Burkina Faso. A few joint missions were conducted. This helped exchange of
experiences and ideas between the two Bank and Government' teams. An assessment on
the quality of procurement is summarized in Section 2.4.


    (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
         Rating:       Moderately Satisfactory


                                              26
5.2 Borrower

     (a) Government Performance
         Rating:      Satisfactory
53.      Government performance is rated satisfactory. The Government demonstrated
ownership and commitment in supporting the implementation of the project, as
demonstrated by the release of counterpart funds (which actually were increased from the
initially committed US$ 139,550 to the eventually released 293,362.83), active
participation during supervision, and lead role in the discussion and implementation of
the voluntary resettlement of Gbele community. It is however to be noted the delays in
developing the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, and the fact that the
Savanna Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan has not yet been approved.


     (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
         Rating:      Satisfactory
54.     Performance of the Implementing Agency is rated satisfactory. Beside compliance
with credit agreements and financial management, two aspects in the implementation of
the project deserve special praise. First, the active involvement of different governmental
agencies with a mandate in biodiversity conservation in project implementation. MOFA,
EPA, MLGRD and the FC seconded technical staff to the SRMC. Each seconded staff
person was responsible for supervising the implementation of a sub-set of activities.
Second, the recognition that governmental agencies did not have the (technical, human,
and financial) capacity to adequately back-up all the activities carried-out under the
project, and the consequent choice to work in partnership with several civil society
organizations and non-governmental organizations.


     (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
         Rating:      Satisfactory


   6. LESSONS LEARNED

55.     The project delivered good results and produced some useful lessons that must be
capitalized. For example:
  (a)   Institutional/ Implementation arrangements:
        The implementation arrangements for this project provided an effective
        model for inter-institutional cooperation in the North - and could be
        replicated: The institutional set-up for this project, i.e. an institution (the
        Savannah Resource Management Center) where staff from various governmental
        agencies (MLFM, Forestry Commission/Wildlife Division, MOFA, EPA) were
        seconded, proved to be an effective framework for inter-institutional cooperation,
        and provided a model that could be replicated for the implementation of other


                                            27
            multi-sectoral projects/programs. It may be useful to consider this option during
            the discussions for the design of the institutional arrangement for the
            implementation of the Northern Development Strategy.
            Partnerships between the Government and CSOs/NGOs allowed the project
            to effectively penetrate communities: Public institutions could not fully cover
            the northern savanna territory, and could not be expected to possess all the
            necessary expertise and resources to adequately back-up all the activities carried-
            out under the project. As a consequence, working in partnership with several
            civil society organizations (CSOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
            (taking advantage of the comparative advantages of each of them) has probably
            allowed the project to effectively reach-out and support many rural communities.

      (b)   Policy:
            The proximity to the political center enhances the impact on policy
            outcomes: The fact that the PCU was located in Tamale, in the Northern Region,
            limited the capacity of the project team to effectively exert political influence
            and lobby for its interests. As a result, the component on the establishment of a
            policy framework was the one that had more difficulties in being implemented.
            As a lesson, it is important to strengthen the linkages with the center whenever a
            project aims at broader policy outcomes.

      (c)   Natural Resource Management and Sustainable Livelihoods:
            The approach to NRM and sustainable livelihoods tested by the project
            could deliver significant results in Northern Ghana - if spatially focused:
            The project tested in various locations of Northern Ghana a number of different
            activities 20 and approaches 21 to stimulate better natural resource management
            (NRM) that, individually, delivered encouraging results. Until when these
            activities were geographically scattered (i.e. MTR), their impact in terms of
            conservation output and outcomes remained limited. After MTR, once these
            activities begun to be implemented in a defined space, this approach (based on
            partnerships, involvement and empowerment of communities, a set of different
            activities to stimulate better natural resource management, spatial planning, etc.)
            offered promising results in terms of improved NRM and sustainable livelihoods.
            (Annex 11 describes how lessons from the project may have application in the
            wider context of sustainable development of the Northern Region).
            The concept of `wildlife corridors' is a useful concept for spatial planning of
            and transboundary collaboration on NRM - but needs follow-up: One of the
            achievements of the project is the establishment of two biological corridors
            between Ghana and Burkina Faso to connect the two ecological blocks of the

20
  E.g. tree planting, bee-keeping, shea-butter production, community-based eco-tourism, cultivation of
medicinal plants and indigenous crop varieties, etc. These activities were specifically tailored to the
characteristics and assets of the different communities.
21
     E.g. partnerships, involvement and empowerment of communities, spatial planning, etc.


                                                     28
         two countries and allow free movement of wildlife between these blocks. The
         creation of the corridors also resulted in the signature of a memorandum of
         understanding (MoU) between the two countries on the management of
         transfrontier resources. Beside the formal establishment of the two corridors, the
         acquis of this component resides in (i) the introduction of the concept of spatial
         planning in NRM, and (ii) the generation of a political momentum on
         transboundary resource management. However, immediate follow-up is needed
         to sustain and capitalize these achievements: (i) the concept of spatial planning
         needs to be integrated in District plans, and (ii) the plan for the management of
         the corridors has to be implemented.

 (d)     Design:
         Possibility to address a transboundary issue through two national projects.
         Cooperation and collaboration established among the project teams of the Ghana
         NSBCP and Burkina Faso PAGEN demonstrated how it is possible to deal with a
         transboundary issue such as the management of natural resources through the
         implementation of two national projects. This lesson can be repeated in cases
         where only two countries are concerned, and therefore a regional project is not
         possible.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      An Economic and Financial Analysis was not conducted at the end of the project,
and the Government's ICR does not include an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of
the project. The ICR team analyzed the business plans of the Mongori Eco-Village and of
the ITFC (Integrated Tamale Fruit Company, the agro-business company that
commercializes organic mango in Northern Ghana). Both business plans estimated an
increase in the business volume and net profits, suggesting that that costs for the start up
of these activities (eco-tourism in the Mongori village and organic mango plantations)
have been recovered, and these activities are profitable. However, generalizing these
results to all the activities supported by the project is not possible.
2.      As standard procedure for GEF projects, an Incremental Cost Analysis (to
demonstrate the incremental global environmental benefits of the project) and not an
Economic Analysis was carried out during project preparation. However, to demonstrate
financial profitability of certain activities supported by the project (i.e. agro-forestry with
cash tree crops such as mango and cashew), a financial analysis was made. Two farm
models were developed comparing three scenarios: `business as usual' and `agro-forestry
with cash tree crops' (one with mango and one with cashew). The Net Present Value
(NPV) for the mango model was 1.57 million cedis, with an Internal Rate of Return
(IRR) of 93%. The NPV for cashew model was 80,000 cedis, with an IRR of 52%.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

1.     An indipendent Beneficiary Assessment was carried out to assess the perceptions
of the beneficiaries on their participation in, and effectiveness of implementation and
impact of the NSBCP activities in order to support the assessment of project performance
and achievement.
2.         Terms of reference. The Beneficiary Assessment was expected to:
     (a)   Assess not only the impact of the project on beneficiaries, but also the perception
           of the beneficiaries on the activities conducted, the results obtained and the
           institutions involved (Project, implementing agencies, NGOs).
     (b)   Document relevant behaviour changes in the beneficiaries and/or the population
           at large that are related to the project activities (training, awareness, investments,
           capacity-building, etc.)
     (c)   Identify key lessons learnt of the Project in order to improve community
           approaches for the purposes of wildlife and forest conservation, natural resource
           management, and sustainable livelihoods.
3.      Methodology. The methodology involved four steps, i.e. (i) documentary review,
(ii) primary data collection, (iii) data analysis, and (iv) validation workshop. Data
collection in the Northern Savannah Zone (which includes Northern Region, Upper East
Region and Upper West Region), was carried out in September and October 2008. The
validation workshop was conducted on October 9, 2008.
4.      The analysis framework for the Assessment followed the following
methodology/steps. In exploring the implementation and impact of the NSBCP on the
beneficiaries, it was assessed the perception of the beneficiaries (intuitions and
communities) (i) on their participation, and (ii) on the effectiveness of the activities and
the results (level of awareness and skills improvement) and the institutions involved. The
results at the institutional level included the changes in the abilities and motivation to
function both as individuals and collectively with regards to biodiversity conservation. At
the community level, the results included the level of beneficiaries' awareness and
biodiversity conservation behavior or adoption rates. The impact refers to the broader
goal of the NSBCP which in this case is to improve the livelihood and health of
communities in the northern savannah zone of Ghana, and the environment through the
conservation and sustainable use of natural resources including medicinal plants. Thus at
the community level, the impact are indicated by benefits of the community members'
change in behavior on their livelihood and health of the community members through the
conservation and sustainable use of natural resources including medicinal plants.
5.     Summary and conclusions of major findings and their significance (from
Beneficiary Assessment Report).
     (a)   Beneficiaries' perception on impact of the project. The impact of the NSBCP
           has been remarkably high. High levels of both awareness and adoption of
           conservation and sustainable use of natural resources has been recorded. Current
           awareness level of biodiversity conservation and sustainable use of resources is
           about 76% with adoption rates of around 65% on the average. This indicates that


                                                39
      significant majority of the men and women or households in the northern
      savannah zone of Ghana are now engaged in environmental conservation and
      sustainable use of the environment. Thus, there is now increased quantities and
      diversity of plants and wildlife in the northern savannah zone. As a result, there
      has been a positive impact on livelihoods and health care in the zone.
      The NSBCP has also had a positive impact on the livelihoods of the community
      members in the zone. Improved income resulting from improved soil fertility and
      the associated increases in crop yields, as well as improved sheanut collection
      resulting from higher yields of butter tree yield due to reduction in bushfires
      have been observed by the community members. The re-appearance of some
      wildlife coupled with existence tourist facilities, which have brought in their
      wake tourists coming into the fringe communities has created opportunities for
      enhanced income generating activities in these communities. Commercial mango
      cultivation is increasingly becoming an important cash crop for farmers in the
      area. Mango plantations have been cultivated on degraded land, and are
      protected from bushfires by the community members. The other livelihood
      benefits of the NSBCP include the emergent social networks such as the
      Indigenous Crop Network Groups, the strengthened Traditional healers
      Associations, the communally operated mango plantations, , which serves as
      pressure groups for propelling the maintenance of the gains made as part of the
      NSBCP. In this regard, the membership of Traditional Healers Associations in
      the northern savannah zone have got its members to improve on the hygiene,
      shelf life, packaging and labeling of their products and enhanced their
      competitiveness on the market thereby increasing their incomes. The indigenous
      crops cultivation is also expanding and increasingly filling in as important food
      security crop during the hunger season in the zone. During the hunger season, the
      indigenous crops attract higher prices and gives good income as a result of its
      ability to store longer than the non-indigenous crop varieties.
      The project has also contributed greatly to improving healthcare for the people in
      the northern savannah zone and beyond. The increased availability and
      accessibility of all especially indigenous and medicinal plants resulting from
      conservation sustainable use of natural resources means improved access to
      cheaper healthcare.
(b)   Beneficiaries' perception on effectiveness of project activities. The
      remarkable impact of the NSBCP has been achieved because of the high level of
      participation of the institutional and community level beneficiaries, and the high
      level of effectiveness of the activities undertaken in the implementation.
      At the institutional beneficiaries' level, the activities undertaken included
      training of multiple hierarchies of staff in the organizations. The trainings
      embodied multiple formats and durations. For example it and included formal
      post-graduate level training for a staff each of WD and EPA respectively. In
      addition, various short courses and training workshops have been organized for
      the staff of the implementing agencies. The focus of the courses depends on the
      specific implementation agency and the thematic area they are working on. The
      EPA focused wildlife and forest conservation, bushfires control, and alternative


                                         40
livelihoods, whilst the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, focused on indigenous
crops conservation and alternative livelihoods. For the WD, FSD and EPA, they
included training in community entry, conflict resolution, wildlife law and
community mobilization and outreach activities. Specifically FSD participated in
training on mango grafting, and tree nursery management, whilst EPA
participated in training in M&E and gender and advocacy. Ministry of Food and
Agriculture staff participated in multiplication and preparation of plant material
for in-situ and ex-situ conservation. In addition, MoFA staff participated in
training in animal traction, contour farming and small ruminant husbandry.
Participation in these training activities is rated very high (i.e. 80%+) by the staff
of WD, FSD and EPA. Even though the MoFA staff who participated in the
indigenous crops training rated it very high (80%+), the regional staff and staff
from the non-fringe districts rated participation low (33%), because only the staff
from the fringe communities benefited from the training on indigenous crops
conservation. Similarly, the effectiveness of the training activities is rated very
high (80%+) by the WD, FSD and MoFA staff and high (60%-70%) by EPA.
In addition to the training, resources were provided to all the implementation
agencies by the NSBCP secretariat. There was construction of new offices, staff
quarters, access roads, viewing facilities, and tourist camps for the WD and or
the FSD. All the implementing agencies received vehicles, office and field
equipment, in addition operational funds. These resources provided were
perceived by the staff of the implementing agencies as effective, as they were
rated about 70%. Among others, to the staff, they enabled the staff of the
implementing agencies to be mobilised to hitherto inaccessible areas in the
reserves, and reduced the tedium of work involved in routine reporting. In
addition, the improved resources gave them and their organisations more
visibility.
The first results or outcome of the training activities is that the capacity of the
staff of the implementing agencies has been greatly enhanced. The perception of
the staff is that between 70%-80% of the staff have their human capacity
improved as result of the training they have received. This together, with the
resourcing of the implementing agencies has resulted in well motivated staff.
The improvements in the staff's capacity and their organisations' capacity imply
that the NSBCP has contributed to enhancing the capacity of the implementation
agencies to work more effectively in the communities.
At the community beneficiaries' level, the training activities generally include
awareness creation on the state of the natural resources, sustainable use of the
resources and establishment of representative community structures, conflict
resolution and policing natural resource uses. These were undertaken by almost
all the implementing agencies. However, in addition to these, each implantation
agency provided training in or awareness creation activities at the community
level appropriate for its focus.




                                     41
               Whatever the case, the community members indicated a high level of
               participation in the community activities, which they rated 80% or above.
               Similarly, activity effectiveness was also rated very high (80%+).
               Another, community level activity is the use of multiple layers of NGOs to
               implement a well designed communication strategy. The selection of messages
               in the development of the communication strategy aimed "to let people know
               and be motivated to do what is "right" or beneficial" or "to stop what is "wrong"
               or not beneficial with regards to the development goal or objective of the
               thematic area".
               The channels that have been used for the awareness creation have been largely
               what the community members use and have credibility, and therefore largely
               appropriate. In addition, extensive range of appropriate media has been used for
               the awareness creation activities. Most provide opportunity for feedback and are
               preferred by the community members.
6.         Lessons learnt.
     (a)       At institutional level:
           -       Institutional capacity building which includes both training the staff of
                   implementing agencies and provides needed resources for functioning of the
                   implementing agencies is likely to results in high impact.
           -       The training component of the institutional capacity building which include
                   high proportion of staff of the organisation, from multiple hierarchies,
                   selected as transparently as possible ensure a sense inclusiveness within the
                   organisation and tend to result in high effectiveness.
           -       The training activities which use different formats, with targeted content to
                   specific thematic area focus of the organisations results in enhanced
                   knowledge and skills acquisition for the staff.
           -       Resources provided as part of the capacity building activities, should be
                   adequate for the whole range of requirements for the institution to reap the
                   required benefits. In the NSBCP, resources were provided for offices,
                   residential quarters, vehicles, office and field equipment as well as
                   operational funds, in order to achieve the level staff and organisational
                   motivation which resulted in the high impact.
           -       The resources need to be provided and managed in a transparent through
                   proper documentation to and in the recipient organisation. This is to avoid
                   the situation when it becomes impossible to trace such resources once
                   personnel changes occur.
     (b)       At community level:
           -       At the community level, an awareness creation activity which focuses on the
                   current state of the natural resources and its' sustainable usage now and the
                   future enhances the impact of the community activities.




                                                  42
-   High level of community participation and inclusion of representative of the
    different social strata in the training and the community natural resources
    committees enhances the impact of the community level activities.
-   The use of a well researched and designed communication strategy
    implemented by the project's implementation agencies and NGOs ensures
    dissemination activities are more effective and achieves the expected impact.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

Results of the Stakeholder Workshop (i.e. Validation Workshop) conducted on October 9,
2008 to discuss and validate the results of the Beneficiary Assessment are synthesized in
Annex 5.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1.       Government of Ghana obtained a grant from the Global Environment Facility
(GEF) for a Northern Savannah Biodiversity Conservation Project (NSBCP) to support
the conservation of biodiversity, agro-biodiversity and the sustainable utilization of
medicinal plants in the three northern regions of Ghana. The project was implemented by
the Ministry of Lands, Forestry and Mines (MLFM) in collaboration with the Ministries
of Food and Agriculture (MoFA), Health (MoH), Local Government, Rural Development
and Environment (MLGRDE), and the Ministry of Science through their regional and
district agencies, a number of local and international NGOs and several communities in
the three northern regions.
2.     Implementation commenced in September 2002 and is scheduled to close in
February 2009. The present report is Government of Ghana's implementation report
(ICR) which documents and assesses the project implementation performance and
achievements based on the stated project objectives


   1. OVERALL PROJECT ACHIEVEMENT

3.     Over all, progress towards achieving the project development objectives has been
good, and targets have been achieved in most of the components. In some cases,
achievements went beyond set targets, e.g. the number officers trained on NRM issues,
number of communities cultivating indigenous crops, among others).
4.      The project has responded directly to a number of national policies related to the
environment, especially natural resource management, and biodiversity conservation as
stipulated in the National Environment Action Plan, as well as the Growth and Poverty
Reduction Strategy of Ghana (GPRS-II).
5.       Targeting beneficiaries at different levels, the project has improved the capacities
of over 76 forest fringe communities, government institutions, CBOs and NGOs, research
institutions and academia, private enterprises, traditional authorities, DAs and traditional
healers and birth attendants for biodiversity conservation through training, biodiversity
conservation awareness and direct logistic support.
6.      Beneficiaries believe that the impact of the NSBCP has been remarkably high.
High levels of both awareness and adoption of conservation and sustainable use of
natural resources has been recorded. Current awareness level of biodiversity conservation
and sustainable use of resources is about 76% with adoption rates of around 65% on the
average. Independent beneficiary assessment indicates considerable majority of the
households in the selected communities along the forest corridors in the northern
savannah zone are now engaged in environmental conservation and sustainable use of the
environment. There are also increased sightings of wildlife in the Wildlife Parks and
corridors.
7.      A Savannah Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (SBSAP) document and a
policy and guidelines on Indigenous Knowledge related to Plant Genetic Resources
(IKPGR) provide direction for future strategies for sustainable management of savanna
natural resource and protection of savanna endangered species. Implementation of the

                                             45
medicinal plant and livelihood components has even in the short term contributed to
incomes and health care of particularly forest fringe communities.


      2. SPECIFIC PROJECT ACHIEVEMENTS

8.      Specific achievements through project implementation demonstrate the direct
correlation between the project's outputs and their resulting outcomes. For example;
         Biodiversity management is now fully integrated into the core business planning
         of the participating government institutions such as the FC, EPA, DAs and
         communities. Many high government policy makers have made public
         acknowledgement of the importance of biodiversity and the need to conserve it.
         Awareness on the importance, willingness and need to protect biodiversity around
         them by community members has been high as they now appreciate and recognize
         a link between forest health and their own livelihoods.
         Biodiversity issues have been incorporated into some school science curriculum
         through operational biodiversity/science clubs.
         Communities, traditional leaders and District Assemblies are now involved in
         natural resource management, monitoring and coordination of environmental
         protection and improvement of activities at district and community levels.
         Through the MA&D program the project might have contributed towards the
         establishment of positive relationship between economic development and natural
         resource conservation within the rural economies. This has made environmental
         quality a key element in supporting rural economic and social development in
         particularly forest fringe communities.
         Management effectiveness, as measured by the WWF/WB Protected Areas score
         card) has increased in the savanna zone wildlife protected areas and for some
         Forest reserves.
9.      The establishment of two wildlife corridors has created a relationship between the
Ghanaian communities along the biodiversity reserve corridors and their Burkinabe
counterparts. This in the long term will increase free movement of wildlife between the
two countries. A more collaborative relationship has been established between the
communities along the selected corridors for implementation of wildlife management
plan (WMP) using the community resource management area (CREMA) concept of the
forest and wildlife policy.


      3. UNINTENDED OUTCOMES OF THE PROJECT

10.      The project recorded a number of unintended outcomes. For example:
         The indigenous crops and medicinal plants components proved very useful and
         fruitful, crafting farmers as conservationists, and questioning the widespread



                                            46
       perception of migrating farmers as destroyers of natural resources and insensitive
       to indigenous cultures.
       The project also generated a rich inter-cultural dynamic, beyond what was
       intended and could be expected given the collaboration with the Burkina Faso
       communities. Community members got closer and became more aware of their
       specific and common challenges to the extent that they were willing and ready to
       volunteer information faster to the project office.


   4. PERFORMANCE OF THE WORLD BANK

11.     The World Bank played a major facilitation role in the implementation of the
project. The Bank was generally very responsive in granting approvals of annual work
plans and procurement schedules. In addition, the facilitating role of the Bank enabled the
project and that in Burkina Faso to sign an agreement to implement the corridor sub-
component. This created synergies and benefits for project beneficiaries especially those
on the wildlife corridors. The Task Team Leaders (TTL) played a key role in setting out
some activities, e.g. collaboration with ITFC for community mango orchards, the setting
up of the Gbele tented camp and the inclusion of the Market Analysis and Development
Strategy (MA & D) to support enterprise development. Restructuring of project and
setting of indicators at mid-term with the assistance of the WB enabled the project to
sharpen its focus.
12.     Despite this overall positive performance of the World Bank GoG wishes indicate
that the impact of project would have been more visible to beneficiaries if the bank had
not withdrawn the second phase of the Natural Resources Management Program (NRMP
2), a US$28million project that would have supported attainment of the PDO as it would
have paid for livelihood investments and other infrastructures (poverty reduction and
healthcare), by releasing funds and implementation teams time to focus on other aspects
of the PDO ( i.e. biodiversity conservation and medicinal plant conservation). The bank
also tended to provide confusing guidance on the M&E indicators.


   5. PERFORMANCE OF GOVERNMENT, THE PROJECT TEAM, AND IMPLEMENTING
       AGENCIES

13.     The performance of the Ghana Government in the release of counterpart funds
which was an integral part of the process was satisfactory. The project management
complied with the credit agreements and program accounts were audited regularly. A
Project Coordination Committee (PCC) was established, under the chairmanship of the
Deputy Minister in charge of Forestry of the MLFM. The overall responsibility for
project administration, procurement and financial management and coordination rested
on the Project Management Team which was headed by the Technical Director in charge
of Forestry at the MLFM. The performance of implementing agencies was satisfactory.




                                            47
   6. LESSONS LEARNT

14.    A number of useful lessons were learnt in the course of implementing the project.
These lessons related to wildlife corridors, indigenous crops, community entry
approaches, inter-institutional frameworks, and procurement and financial
decentralization. Other lessons learnt include project focus and management, natural
resource management and livelihood support, government-civil society partnerships, and
monitoring and evaluation.
  (a)   Wildlife Corridors. The establishment of corridors is an effective and novel
        scheme for wildlife conservation and sustainable Natural Resource Management,
        with both conservation and production objectives. It serves to enhance the
        conservation of protected areas (widening the conservation belt), while engaging
        communities in both conservation efforts and sustainable production activities. It
        creates many synergies between conservation and production, as well as across
        conservation stakeholders (from Forestry Commission's staff to the local
        population, including community resource management committees that were
        established). In addition, developing the wildlife corridors together with
        neighbouring Burkina Faso (in order to establish transfrontier corridors) allowed
        a rich exchange of experiences, bringing into Ghana's savannah new approaches
        that were developed successfully in Burkina Faso, as well as raising awareness
        on the cross-border dimensions of wildlife and environmental protection.
  (b)   Indigenous Crops. The identification and promotion of indigenous crops is a
        successful and popular component. There is much room for scaling up.
        Indigenous crops revealed a valuable resource and technology for sustainable
        land management, with simultaneous roles in in-situ conservation of agricultural
        biodiversity in the savannah, combating climate change, improving nutrition and
        revitalising the knowledge and cultural specificity of the savannah ecosystem.
  (c)   Community entry approaches. The process of raising awareness and engaging
        communities in conservation and sustainable use of natural resources is very
        slow process, requiring continued support, coaching, innovative participatory
        approaches and the engagement of different local stakeholders (chiefs, healers,
        women leaders, etc.). The project learnt two effective approaches. First, to
        identify, train and support "champions" for certain issues, in order to set example
        for the community or to raise awareness locally (this approach was used in
        project activities on traditional healers, indigenous crops, community
        conservation committees, and wildfire management groups). In addition,
        community-based organisations (CREMAs, FMCs, COMCOs, etc), even if they
        tend to have weak capacities, proved valuable agents for project implementation,
        engaging the beneficiaries and ensuring the achievement of impacts.
  (d)   Inter-institutional implementation framework. The project operated under an
        inter-institutional structure, engaging professionals from various public agencies
        (FC, MOFA, EPA, District Assemblies etc.). It created many synergies and
        cross-sectoral collaboration opportunities, and revealed the importance in an
        inter-institutional engagement in solving the many conservation, environmental
        and poverty issues in northern Ghana. Unfortunately, the project did not


                                            48
      anticipate the need to consolidate the SRMC before the project ended (for
      instance, by ensuring that operational costs were increasingly covered with
      counterpart funds). That would have facilitated the perpetuation of such inter-
      institutional approach to the conservation and sustainable use of savannah
      resources.
(e)   Procurement and financial decentralisation. Projects with a geographical
      focus and with many activities on the ground need a more decentralised funding
      mechanism. In the case of the NSBCP, the Accra-based control of release of
      funds delayed and disrupted the pace of project implementation. Future GEF
      projects with a geographical focus should therefore be designed in ways that
      accommodate the implementation dynamic on the ground.
(f)   Project focus and management. During the Mid-Term Review (MTR), the
      Project experienced a relevant operative shift, consisting mainly in: (i)
      geographical focus, mostly around wildlife corridors, to avoid the dispersion of
      activities with weaker impact and high implementation burden; and (ii)
      simplification of project structure and introduction of a coding system, which
      eased the preparation of AWPBs (annual work plan and budgets) and monitoring.
      It was important to review indicators to make them simple, meaningful and
      feasible to be monitored.
(g)   Natural Resource Management (NRM) and Livelihood Support. A relevant
      component of the project was to engage communities in NRM and to engage
      them in sustainable livelihoods. The Project learnt that an entrepreneurial
      approach, such as the one currently supported by the partner TreeAid, proves
      more effective and sustainable than the usual provision of full grants. This
      change of approach needs to be further considered in the north of Ghana, where
      an approach of giving grants and assets is endemic and tends to weaken
      community's and individuals' efforts.
(h)   Government ­ Civil Society partnerships. Civil society (particularly
      professional and genuine non-governmental organisations) is a valid partner in
      channelling public funds and interventions. In conditions where public
      institutions are poorly present or lack legitimacy, civil society is a critical partner
      and, in fact, its engagement with the public sector can precisely introduce the
      institutional dynamic and the spirit of collective decision-making that is missing.
      However, the engagement of non-public partners in managing public funds and
      investments requires a careful design of the institutional framework, ensuring
      that roles, disbursement flows and reporting requirements, among other elements,
      are well defined and mutually agreed.
(i)   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). An M&E system is an essential ingredient
      of a project and, accordingly, its basics should be defined during a project's
      design, not leaving it as a task for the project implementation (as it occurred with
      this project, leading to a tedious and delayed process of elaborating the M&E
      system). At the same time, M&E systems should be simple and adapted to a
      diverse range of users (e.g. coordinators, auditors, beneficiaries), especially when
      a project foresees many micro-projects and community-level activities. The


                                           49
        M&E system that the project finally elaborated and implemented is probably too
        sophisticated and rather user-unfriendly; consequently, its value is limited. In
        conclusion, M&E systems should be simpler than often designed.


   7. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

15.     The project has fully and satisfactorily completed. At completion, the project
team has conducted a solid analysis of the execution, its results and impacts, and the main
lessons learnt. A Stakeholders' Workshop was successfully carried out, with
representatives from most of the organisations engaged throughout the project. The
project has kept its legitimacy in the northern savannah zone, and has actually gained a
more powerful operational capacity for community-based sustainable development.
16.     At the community level, community members have become collaborators in
resource management as they have appreciated and are convinced of the benefits of
conservation of natural resources but the incidence of lack of funds for community
activities such as boundary cleaning, patrolling, anti-poaching, and wildfire control is real.
At the district level, District Assemblies will continue to provide the implementing
agencies with the same kind of support given during implementation. At the central level,
the project activities have been mainstreamed into the regular operation of the
government institutions particularly the FC, MoFA, and EPA, which would be adequately
financed from their IGFs and budgetary allocation from the treasury.
17.     At post-completion stage there are however some concerns on the future of the
project. The project office has undergone many changes (structural reforms, decline in
staff, and reduction in funding sources) due to various external and internal factors; In
addition, there are relevant risks to the endurance of the development outcome of the
project due to various exogenous factors, principally as follows:
       The project has had a decline in personnel due to high labour turn-over and in
       funding, and therefore experiences a difficulty to replicate and expand the lessons
       learnt;
       The project's learning process and modus operandi have not been sufficiently
       institutionalised, so a continuing dissemination and collaborative spirit among
       stakeholders in the region are necessary.
       The inclusion of the livelihood strategies increased the cost of the project which
       increased the tendency of financial problems for the continuation of the project;
18.     From the onset, the program begun with handouts which has made the
sustainability of the project after the fold-up a bit of a problem because this increased the
expectations of the intended beneficiary communities. The lessons learnt from the
implementation of the project are a useful guide to government for future projects, as
well as in the up scaling of similar projects within the limits of the specific contexts and
resources available.

Annex 11 (Additional). Application of NSBCP's lessons to a wider context of sustainable in the Northern Region

1.      Even if not in the initial ToR of the mission, the team was encouraged by the Sector Leader and the CMU to (i) draw lessons
that may have application in the wider context of sustainable development of the Northern Region, and (ii) to explore opportunities to
capitalize the results of this projects and continuing the engagement/support in this field.
2.     The matrix below summarizes how lessons from the project can have an immediate application in two priority areas of Bank'
support in the North (Agriculture Development and Safety-Net/Food Security), and, vice-versa, how interventions in support of Agric.
Devt and Food Security can contribute to Biodiversity conservation.
