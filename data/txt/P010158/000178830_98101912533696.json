in the implementation of its foodgrain policy by\n            providing additional storage facilities and improving the\n            operational efficiency of the agricultural institutions, so\n            that these institutions can meet foodgrain procurement,\n            distribution and export requirements more effectively and\n            reduce quantitative and qualitative storage losses and\n            storage operating costs. The Credit would finance: (i)\n            construction of 500,000 MT of bagged wheat storage\n            facilities; (ii) construction of 40,000 MT rice/paddy\n            storage facilities; (iii) provision of warehousing, grain\n            testing and quality control equipment for storage facilities\n            and grain procurement centers and for six grain testing\n            laboratories to be established under the project; (iv) pilot\n            facilities for mechanical grain handling; (v) strengthening\n            of Pakistan Agricultural Research Council (PARC),\n            universities and agricultural research institutes for\n            carrying out grain storage research and developing extension\n            training programs; (vi) technical assistance, staff training\n            and study tours in the above fields; and (vii) a study on\n            further storage requirements and grain processing needs."}, "docdt": "1981-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
