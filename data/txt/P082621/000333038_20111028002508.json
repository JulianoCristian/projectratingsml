SOUTHERN", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Second North West\n            Frontier Province (NWFP) Community Infrastructure Project\n            for Pakistan were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was high, Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: implementing a community based project\n            through a local government system that has been recently\n            introduced needs sustained commitment at all levels and a\n            major emphasis on institutional and behavioral change. As a\n            high risk approach, sufficient resources are required to\n            support institutional development and high level champions\n            are needed to maintain commitment and progress. There is a\n            need to review the evolving local government system in the\n            province and prepare approaches for rural development\n            projects that are community based with effective support\n            from government in partnership with civil society\n            organizations. Implementing community projects in\n            environments that are highly insecure need to have a\n            flexible design and use locally trusted organizations. The\n            security situation in the province deteriorated rapidly\n            since the predecessor project making it difficult for the\n            government agency to implement and for the World Bank to\n            provide implementation support. The design needs to be\n            flexible to allow changes in approach, ways of working and\n            expected outcomes. Recovery of the outstanding advance\n            should be started at an early stage to avoid problems such\n            as the exchange losses. Bank staff should closely monitor\n            the available balance in the DA in both currencies i.e. PAK\n            and or US Dollars. A rural development project that requires\n            field work with staff inputs from local governments needs to\n            provide appropriate logistical support. Local governments\n            often face budget and mobility issues, and if appropriate\n            support in the form of financial support and vehicles is not\n            provided by the project, they need to mobilize resources\n            from their own alternative sources. Preparation of new\n            budget item for local governments to procure a new vehicle\n            can require a long period of time and would not easily be\n            approved. However, in order to implement effectively a rural\n            project that requires frequent field visits, it is important\n            to carry out an assessment of staff mobility and constraints\n            of local government bodies."}, "docdt": "2010-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
