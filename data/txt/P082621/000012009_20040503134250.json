Second North West\n            Frontier Province Community Infrastructure Project (CIP-II),\n            builds on the successful experiences of the first CIP, and\n            other complementary programs in the NWFP, but adapts it to\n            devolution. The project will be open to all participating\n            tehsil municipal administration (TMA) units that have\n            demonstrated their capacity to manage the program, and\n            within these to all communities, taking into account the\n            readiness of residents to participate, the level of poverty,\n            and current access to basic infrastructure. The main\n            objective of the project is to promote the well being of low\n            income communities of NWFP by: (a) supporting investments in\n            community development activities, basic services, and small\n            scale productive infrastructure; and, (b) strengthening\n            capacity at the new devolved local government and community\n            levels, to plan and deliver such services and\n            infrastructure. The project's three main components\n            are: 1) local infrastructure and  services, involving\n            support to participating Citizen Community boards (CCBs),\n            and TMAs sub-project investments in small scale, and\n            productive infrastructure projects; 2) improving local level\n            performance, through two distinct sub-components:\n            institutional strengthening, and community development\n            activities; and, 3) implementation support, monitoring and\n            evaluation, through a) technical assistance, mostly local\n            and regional, for capacity building and training, to improve\n            local capacity, particularly at the tehsil level; and, b)\n            implementation support to the Local Government Election and\n            Rural Development Department (LG&RDD) to improve overall\n            administration and coordination, including supervision,\n            monitoring and impact evaluation."}, "docdt": "2004-04-29T00:00:00Z"}
