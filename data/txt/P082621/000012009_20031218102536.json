Community Infrastructure Project\n            (CIPII), and evaluates social and institutional\n            organizations, including institutional arrangements under\n            devolution, examines gender status, reviews the First CIP\n            components, and proposes monitoring and evaluation to be\n            pursued, within a consultation framework, based on the\n            assessment of social safeguards, and critical risks. The\n            consultation process involved a wide participation of\n            stakeholders, local communities, existing Citizen's\n            Community Boards (CCBs) and nongovernmental organizations\n            (NGOs), as well as the private sector, and government\n            agencies. This process fostered an approach that involves\n            local communities to devise practical solutions, through\n            CCBs in a community action planning process, based on human,\n            financial, and operation and maintenance commitments, to\n            integrate physical, social, and economic components with the\n            leadership of the CCB. The role of women should be\n            incorporated, and strengthened in all aspects of the\n            program. To this end, support will be provided through\n            training assistance, and institutional capacity building,\n            and in addition, focused groups discussions among the\n            community members shall address the needs and requirements\n            to improve infrastructure, for appropriate financial\n            management, and, to continue a traditional contribution of\n            voluntary land donation for public benefit. Water quality,\n            waste disposal, overgrazing and deforestation are concerns\n            that will be monitored through water conservation practices\n            (and water rationing if needed), waste management, and\n            community involvement. Moreover, infrastructure development,\n            particularly water supply and roads, shall contribute to\n            poverty alleviation, by providing income generation\n            activities, while improvement of health facilities,\n            especially preventive practices, would be cost-saving instruments."}, "docdt": "2003-11-26T13:07:03Z"}
