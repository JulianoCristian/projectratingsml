1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Niger is a vast landlocked country with an estimated population of 14 million, the
majority of whom live along a narrow band of arable land on the country's southern
border with Nigeria / Benin. The economy is dominated by agricultural activity,
including livestock rearing, mining (mainly uranium), and informal sector trading
activities. Niger is ranked as one of the poorest countries in the world. Despite its
potential, Niger's prospects are clouded by limited exploitation of its natural resources, a
highly degraded natural environment, explosive population growth rate, and extremely
low human and institutional capacity which limits its international competitiveness.
Niger is also located in a potentially volatile sub-region.

At the time of project preparation the country was making steady progress on the political
front following the return to democratic government in late 1999. Deep poverty in the
country was one of the main concerns of the new Government and donors. The thematic
and sectoral choices in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the period were
consistent with the Niger's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) which provided an
uncompromising analysis of poverty and its underlying causes and set forth a national
development program around four central pillars and three cross cutting themes. The
project was designed to respond to the third pillar - ''(iii) The improvement in access of
the poor to quality social services, including basic education, primary health care,
reproductive health services, HIV/AIDS prevention, water and sanitation, and adequate
urban habitat'' - and to the first two cross-cutting themes: (i) effective inclusion of gender
considerations in all programs and (ii) promotion of good governance.

As part of its strategy to meet the objectives of the PRSP the Government developed the
Programme de Développement de I'Education au Niger (PDDE)1 with four main axes:

     1.   Expanding access to basic education prioritizing the poor
     2.   Improving education quality and efficiency
     3.   Improving the use of existing resources
     4.   Building capacity and empowering local structures and communities to manage
          the education system

One of the instrumental objectives in designing the PDDE was to bring all donors into a
single mode of planning, implementation and monitoring, to ensure greater synergy and
complementarities in the implementation of the sector program. With this in mind, the
Government and donors initiated a process for formalization of donor coordination in
November, 2001. In June 2003, the Partnership Framework (Cadre Partenarial) was
signed by almost all donors in the education sector in Niamey during a Forum organized

                                              1
by Government on the PRSP implementation. The PDDE cost of about US$ 300 million
was financed largely within this framework by the Government, HIPC relief, and over 10
funding agencies including the Bank, through Projet d'Appui au Développement de
l'Education de Base (PADEB)2.

IDA played a major role in supporting the preparation and implementation of the PDDE.
Following the Dakar Conference on Education for All in 2000, the Bank was one of the
key agencies that supported the Niger Government in preparing the PDDE by providing
technical support and mobilizing the other donors to participate in the process. In
addition, given the scope of the PDDE and the associated substantial financial needs in a
constrained fiscal environment in Niger - even with resources from the HIPC program -
the financial support of all partners, including the Bank was needed to fill the financing
gap. IDA's contribution of US$ 30 million, provided through an IDA Grant of US$ 24.38
and an IDA Credit of US$ 5.62, was one of the largest. These funds were disbursed
through a separate IDA financed project in collaboration with other donors following the
principles of the Cadre Partenarial. Several other donors disbursed through a pooled
fund.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
Project Development Objectives. The objectives of the Project are to assist the Borrower
to: (a) increase the enrollment and completion rates of the students in its basic education
programs; and b) strengthen the administrative and managerial capacities of the Ministry
of Education (MOE), deconcentrated ministerial branches, and local civil society groups
engaged in the basic education sector.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

N/A

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

The beneficiaries described in the PAD relate to all those who would benefit from the
implementation of the PDDE financed by the government and other partners. No attempt
was made to isolate the unique impact of the PADEB on beneficiaries. Specifically,
PDDE including PADEB was designed to benefit the following groups:

      1. Rural Children.        An additional 290,000 rural children ­ of which 41% girls
         ­ were expected to attend primary schools and acquire an acceptable level of
         basic education. These benefits were supposed to accrue from construction of
         additional classrooms; free provision of textbooks; increased teacher supply
         especially in rural areas; improved teacher training; strengthening of the student
         assessment system; targeted programs to promote access to school and to improve
         school health and nutrition. Expansion of the Comité de Gestion des Etablissements
                           4
         Scolaires (COGES) was also expected to promote quality education.

      2. Illiterate Youths and Adults. An additional 106,000 youth and adults -- of which
         65% women ­ were expected to benefit from quality functional literacy programs.

       3. Increased Investment in Rural Communities. Rural communities were expected
          to benefit from increased provision of public services through increases in the
          proportion of the MOE recurrent budget (excluding salaries) managed at the
          decentralized levels.

       4. The education sector was expected to benefit from policy and institutional
          reforms supported by the program that would generate savings and lay the ground
          for improved sector-financing and sustainability.

       5. Over time, the labor force would benefit through increasing average levels of
          education, thereby increasing productivity, economic growth, and promoting
          poverty reduction.

       6. Staff of both the MOE and communities would benefit from a wide range of
          training to build their capacity as well as new equipment to increase their
          efficiency.

1.6 Revised Components

The construction component was revised in October 2007 when the Government, with
support from donors, decided to reduce the number of mud-and-thatch classrooms from
650 to 300 and to increase the number of classrooms built in cement from 350 to 395. A
decision was also made in two phases to construct 250 classrooms for the Alternative
Rural School program.

1.7 Other significant changes

The DFA was amended in October 26, 2007 to (i) reallocate the Grant Funds; (ii) to
revise an intermediate output indicator and (iii) to extend the closing date of the
agreement by 18 months to June 30, 2009. No changes were made to the PDOs or
outcome indicators. The reallocation of funds was made to finance: (i) the increased
costs of classrooms, school furniture and special rural schools because of modifications
in the construction program; (ii) training and workshops for expanding the operations of
special rural schools, decentralized MOE structures and COGES and (iii) the costs of the
adult literacy program. Some of these costs had been underestimated at appraisal. The
intermediate output indicator related to classroom construction was revised to reflect the
change in the construction program. The closing date was extended to allow more time
to complete the construction program and the procurement process for textbooks.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes



                                            6
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry


In order to fully assess factors affecting implementation and outcomes, PADEB has to be
seen in the context of the PDDE. The rationale for the design of the project was to
"support the first phase of Niger's Ten-Year Basic Education Program in collaboration
with other partners, focusing on areas fundamental to an increased attendance and
completion of primary school, including literacy, and where the Bank has a comparative
advantage." Consistent with this, the PDOs reflect the objectives of PDDE and the
project components comprise selected policies and investments in the PDDE. The
analysis in this section will be done in this context.

Soundness of Background Analysis.             The project design is supported by
substantial analytical work which was undertaken for the preparation of the PDDE and
assessments by the Bank in collaboration with the donors of the fiduciary and
environmental management capacities. These studies included: (a) a Country Status
Report (CSR); (b) Public Expenditure Reviews (PER) for 1998, 1999 and 2000 and (c) an
institutional analysis of the MOE. Project preparation also benefitted from analytical
work which underpinned Niger's PRSP and CAS both of which provided a context for
integrating education sector policies and programs into the macro framework. The results
of these analyses are well reflected in the section on analysis of sector issues ad project
design.

Lessons learned in previous operations were built into the project design. For example,
in leading the preparation and approval of the PDDE the Government carried out
extensive consultations with stakeholders, including trade unions and civil society
groups, from the community level up to the Council of Ministers. This was in response
to experiences under Education II which showed that building consensus among
stakeholders was essential for successful implementation of reforms. Also, support for
the regional/local institutions including the COGES in the management of education
came out of the experience in Education III which showed that involvement of local
leaders and groups is essential for improved education sector performance. Another
lesson applied in the design was to drop cost-sharing in school construction following the
negative experiences with this approach in Education III.

Project Design.

The Project Development Objectives are clearly stated and largely mirror those of the
PDDE. The design deals with the key demand and supply side constraints on access, the
major inputs and systems required for quality improvement, as well as the institutional
reforms essential for increasing the operational efficiency of the education sector.
Moreover, the design of the project is well focused. The implementation of this integrated
package of interventions is likely to contribute significantly to the attainment of the
enrollment, quality and completion rate targets as well as the institutional development
goals. The objectives also support key elements of Niger's PRSP and the CAS.




                                            7
The planned implementation period of four and a half years was relatively short to
achieve the indicators, especially those related to quality and completion rates. The
expected increases in student achievement in French and Mathematics were particularly
ambitious with regard to the project duration. Implementing classroom construction,
teacher recruitment, provision of free textbooks and institutional reforms would probably
take the entire project period with little time left for measurable impact on learning
achievement and completion rates. The short duration was compounded by weak capacity
in the MOE.

The original project duration was probably adequate for the implementation of the
various components. Delays caused by the resulting slower implementation following
the misuse of pooled fund accounts prevented project completion by the original date.
Following resolution of the issues surrounding the fraud, implementation rate increased
and the project was completed by the extended closing date. This suggests that though
the project period was a bit short implementation could have been completed by the
original closing date.

The project outcome indicators were national targets which applied to the entire PDDE.
A large part of the success in achieving the outcome targets could however be attributed
to the project since it was one of the largest contributors to the implementation of the
PDDE.

Project Components. The design of the project components were well aligned to the
project objectives although this is not always explicit. The components related to
increased enrollment and completion rates in basic education included both supply side
and demand side interventions. Additional classrooms were built, new teachers were
recruited and new school places were created including using multi-grade teaching
approaches. Girls and rural students that were at the highest risk of not attending or
completing school were targeted with specific measures such as tutoring and special
schools to reduce constraints to participation. Also, expansion of adult literacy and
involvement of COGES in management of the school system would help promote
increased school enrollment and completion. In addition, components related to quality
improvement that would help raise learning achievement are included in the project to
help promote completion rates. Research has shown that parents withdraw their children
from school if the quality of education is poor. This is a strength in the design.

The components related to Strengthening Management Capacity at MOE and
Empowerment of Local Communities were rather comprehensive although a bit
ambitious. The intention was to put in place an appropriate institutional structure, staffed
with qualified personnel to ensure efficient administrative and technical management of
the system in support of the educational inputs. The component focused on removing
specific constraints, especially at the central level.

Regional and local offices were provided with new responsibilities and training in
decentralized management to support provision of education at the school level. Private
sector participation in the management of the system was encouraged through contracting



                                             8
textbooks providers to deliver textbooks directly to schools. The COGES received
extensive training and resources to permit them to play their roles effectively at the
school level. Most of these proposals seem reasonable except for the rather extensive
structural reforms proposed for the MOE at the central level. This level of reform
normally requires links between the sector reforms and the wider public service.
Although there is no direct discussion of the links between these two sets of reforms, it
seems problems with the implementation of the institutional reforms in the education
sector might have been due to delays in finalizing the wider public sector reforms.
Progress in implementing the MOE reforms has started now that legislation is in place for
wider civil service reforms. These delays were exogenous to the project.

Capacity of implementing agency. The MOE was responsible for implementation of the
project through its normal organizational structure similar to the approach taken for the
PDDE. The Secretary-General as head of the MOE was in charge supported by a small
additional staff responsible for facilitating coordination among the various units. Overall,
the MOE had the minimum capacity required for implementation at the center given that
the project was built largely on ongoing sector programs. However, there were
weaknesses in key departments especially in the areas of planning, fiduciary
management, and school construction. These were addressed through short-term
measures and training at the central and decentralized levels that yielded quick results.

The capacity for implementation was greatly enhanced by the decentralization of certain
functions to regional and local offices as well as to the COGES. This decentralization
reduced the burden on central units to deliver inputs/services such as textbooks to
schools. The result was more efficient use of sector resources. Decentralization,
combined with the additional implementation support at the central level greatly
increased the capacity of the sector to manage project implementation successfully.

Adequacy of Government's Commitment.

Counterpart Funds. The project was designed to minimize the contribution of the
Government to project financing given the fiscal constraints in Niger and in the context
of the substantial efforts the Government needed to make to increase expenditures on
primary education to support the reform effort. The Government planned to increase
expenditures on primary education from 1.4% to 2.5% of the Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) between 2001 and 2012, based on the assumption that the economy would grow at
4% annually, and that the share of fiscal revenue in GDP would rise from 9% in 2001 to
14% in 2012. Counterpart funding was therefore calculated at about 1.3% of total project
costs including duties and taxes. However, in spite of this, provision of counterpart funds
was a problem from the inception of the project. Disbursement of counterpart funds was
the last effectiveness condition to be met in November, 2003 and by July, 2004
disbursement of counterpart funds were in arrears. This was largely due to fiscal
pressure. Following this period, counterpart funds was rated Moderately Satisfactory
(MS) in all Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) until the final ISR in June, 2009 when
it was downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU) because disbursements of these
funds were seriously in arrears leading to delays in payments to staff and suppliers.



                                             9
Design built on lesson Learnt. The design of the components benefitted from lessons
learnt from other projects. There were wide consultations when the analytical work and
key strategies were being designed to build consensus. The COGES were also
established to increase the chances of implementation success. Both of these actions
were based on lessons learnt from Education II and III respectively. Other lessons drawn
from Education III included: (i) dropping cost-sharing in school construction because of
inequities, (ii) basing the project design on a long-term strategy led by the government to
ensure sustainability of project interventions after completion and (iii) involvement of
teacher unions in formulating the terms and conditions for recruiting contract teachers to
avoid resistance. A major lesson learnt from the Public Finance Credit was the need for
capacity building and ownership of reforms by key ministries to ensure success. This
influenced the decision to support the MOE in leading the design of the technical and
institutional reforms as well as to implement the project through the MOE structure, it's
decentralized units and communities.

The Government was fully committed to the PADEB and the PDDE on which it was
based. Education is a high priority in the Government's I-PRSP and the PDDE was
designed to permit more strategic investment in the sector. Preparation of the PDDE was
led by the Government supported by a number of technical committees. Program
documents were drawn up from a dozen thematic pieces and complementary economic
analyses, as well as from conclusions resulting from a number of workshops attended by
parents, teacher unions, religious leaders, NGOs, the private sector, and international
partners. The Council of Ministers held a one-day meeting in April 2001 to review the
draft sectoral policy framework. The meeting endorsed the core reform proposals while
providing guidance to the team for refining some of the strategic and operational options.

Assessment of Risks.

All the three risks under "From Outputs to Objectives" materialized in some form.
Disbursement of counterpart funds was late throughout the project period and there were
problems with recruitment of contract teachers. The main issue was the lack of a proper
management system for the teachers which led to repeated strikes. The need for a proper
management system for contract teachers was not included as a mitigation measure.

Two of the five risks associated with Components to Outputs did not materialize. Two of
the remaining three related to government's commitment to implement the reforms
materialized only partially. These were related to delays in implementing the
institutional reforms at the central ministry level because agreement on the wider public
sector reforms took longer than expected.

Two issues that affected implementation emerged that were not identified as risks. These
were:

(a) the rejection of the mud-and-thatch model for school construction because of
Government concerns about fire hazard related to thatched roofs. It is not clear to what



                                            10
extent this risk was included in the evaluation of the suitability of the design for schools,
and

(b) the unexpected rise in costs of construction materials.

The risks associated with implementation of the project in the context of the Cadre
Partenarial, especially how poor management of the Pooled Fund could affect project
implementation should also have been foreseen. The Bank was aware of the risks
associated with using country systems for fiduciary management during project
preparation.

2.2 Factors Affecting Implementation

The key factors affecting implementation are discussed below in three sections covering
exogenous factors, factors subject to government control and factors subject to
implementing agency control. There was no formal restructuring of the project. The
major change was the extension of the project closing date to allow for procurement of
textbooks to be completed and for the revised construction program to be fully
implemented. The delays in textbooks procurement was the result of increased prudence
adopted by officials in the context of the misuse of pooled funds. Modifications were
made to the output indicators in response to the change in the construction program and
funds were reallocated to better align them to achievement of project objectives. These
responses were appropriate to issues encountered during implementation.

Factors Outside the Control of Government and Implementation Agencies. The key
exogenous factor affecting project implementation was the serious drought and locust
infestation that affected Niger in 2004/05 which led to chronic food shortages and a 1%
fall in GDP in 2005. This, combined with a relatively high population growth rate of
3.3% annually led to increased poverty levels in the country particularly among the rural
population, girls, women and children. The drought adversely affected implementation
of the adult literacy component as poverty and malnutrition increased in the villages. The
high population growth rate would make reaching the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) even more challenging.

Factors Subject to Government Control. Sound macro-economic policies and
improved public expenditure management had a positive impact on government financing
of the PDDE. From 2001 to 2006 the Government maintained sound macro-economic
policies which led to an average GDP growth rate of 4.6% with a high of 5.2% in 2006.
In 2008, real GDP growth reached 9.5 percent due to exceptional circumstances. Fiscal
management has also been good as inflation was held to 1.8% between 2001 and 2006
and was expected to fall to zero in 2007 much lower than the projected 4.1%. Public
sector revenues as a percentage of GDP rose to 15.5%, above projections of 14% for
2012. Despite this relatively good performance, increases in GDP per capita were limited
due to high population growth rates. Sound economic management also did not result in
prompt disbursement of counterpart funds.




                                             11
To complement the macro-economic policies, the Government introduced reforms in
public expenditure management including: (i) a new budget nomenclature, public
accounts charter and procurement law, (ii) preparation of Medium Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEFs) for the education and health sectors, (iii) establishment of a new
Directorate for public procurement and (iv) creation of an independent audit court.

Through these improvements in economic and fiduciary management, the Government
was able to continue allocations to the education sector at reasonable levels and
management and accountability in the use of public funds were greatly improved. The
success in the identification of misuse of funds in the pooled fund account and
subsequent remedies and improvements in the performance of the MOE in these areas
would not have been possible without these reforms. Overall the reforms also
substantially reduced the risk of using the MOE and government management systems
for project implementation and facilitated harmonization of external assistance.

Factors Subject to Implementation Agency Control. The two key factors that
adversely affected project implementation and that were the justification for the extension
of the project closing date were the change in the construction program and increased
prudence in the use of procurement procedures for textbooks.

The decision of the Government with the support of the donor group to cease
construction of the mud-and-thatch classrooms and to replace them with classrooms built
with cement led to a substantial reduction of the number of classrooms built in the project
from the planned 1000 to 695. The sudden decision to drop this model during
implementation led to less than optimal use of project resources.

The misuse of pooled funds was possible because of weaknesses in the fiduciary
management system that were exploited by government officials. Although these funds
were not directly related to the PADEB, it delayed project implementation because the
institutions affected were the same ones responsible for implementation of PADEB.
These weaknesses were identified during preparation and PADEB was partly designed to
strengthen the fiduciary management system. Abuse of the system however occurred
prior to the system being improved. The resulting damages were possibly reduced by the
constructive response of the Government and partners that led to reimbursement of the
funds, introduction of improved management systems and sanctions of the individuals
responsible for the fraud.

The MOE could have managed some other areas much better. These included inefficient
management of contractual teachers, and some resistance in the MOE to the
decentralization program. The rapid increase in the number of contractual teachers was
not accompanied by sound management systems for their administration and deployment.
As a result, there were serious disparities in the distribution of the new teachers. Teachers
were also dissatisfied with their conditions of service and this resulted in conflict and
frequent strikes. This led to lost time on task which had the potential of undermining
learning achievement.




                                             12
With regard to decentralization, there were latent resistances to the transfer of
responsibilities and resources to the regional/local levels and COGES. Resources transfer
was often unpredictable and this prevented these organs from performing their new
responsibilities effectively. Resistance was even stronger in 2005/06 when a new
Minister of Education attempted to recentralize management and made decisions that
affected implementation of the PDDE.

There appeared to be problems with the design and implementation of the student
learning assessment component that made it difficult to measure changes reliably. The
assessment in 2000 was done largely by external technical assistance using questions that
would allow comparison among countries in the region, but not necessarily based on the
curriculum in Niger. When the tests were carried out by MOE officials the questions
were based on a different set of criteria. Consequently the results from the tests could not
be compared. The MOE should have established clear guidelines and standards for
carrying out student assessment in order to obtain reliable results.

On the positive side the MOE was proactive in capitalizing on initiatives that were
producing good results. In the reallocation of funds the MOE requested increased
resources to support expansion of the CAPEDs and COGES both of which had shown
positive results in pilot programs. The MOE was also proactive in implementing the
distribution of books to schools through private suppliers that had proven to be very
successful. Although the impact of these programs could not be fully reflected in the
results of PADEB, they would lay a solid foundation for sustainable expansion of quality
education, including improvements in the health and nutrition status of students.

Implementation Efficiency. Overall the project was efficiently implemented as almost
all the project funds were disbursed by the extended project closing date. In addition,
technical audits showed that the quality of implementation was good as exemplified by
the report on construction. Factors which helped efficient implementation of the project
included the decision by the Task Team to simplify the design by focusing only on the
essential interventions.      The Team resisted recommendations by the Quality
Enhancement Review (QER) to introduce some very interesting but complicated
innovations such as use of computers for teaching because of weak sector capacity. At
the same time, the team did expand successful pilot programs to address specific issues
that would not only help achieve project objectives, but that would help establish a more
solid foundation for further development of the system in the medium term.

The design of the project was no more complex than what it would take to run the
education sector efficiently in Niger. The decision by the team to use the current structure
of the MOE for implementation while improving it from the inside was perhaps the most
efficient way to obtain positive results and to ensure sustainability. If the approach had
been to design and implement education programs outside the normal government system
there is a risk that this would have resulted in financing programs that would not be fully
integrated with sector programs and that would fail once the project closed. In addition,
using new procedures and institutions for implementation would have probably meant




                                            13
establishing a parallel management system that could make implementation more
complex and sap scarce energies and resources from the main sector management.

The government was committed to the project as it was contributing to the
implementation of the PDDE which had been prepared and approved with wide
stakeholder participation. In general commitment to the goals and principles of the
PDDE and PADEB also made implementation more efficient since modifications could
be made during implementation when necessary if achieving the PDOs were at risk.

The risks identified and their mitigation measures were appropriate for the project and
were discussed earlier in section on Assessment of Risks. Lessons learned and included in
project design were discussed in section 2.1. Implementation Delays could have been
avoided as discussed above.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design. The Monitoring Indicators used for this analysis are taken from the DFA
but classified following the structure in annex 1 of the PAD.

The data collection methods were effective and based on already existing sources and
field reports, except for information related to monitoring of student learning. The
quality of information used for monitoring indicators was rated fair throughout the
implementation period. Monitoring of the data on enrollment and completion, including
the share of girls participation, was based on school statistics collected by the Department
of Planning in the MOE. This was the most feasible way of monitoring these indicators
since data on these areas was collected and analyzed annually by the MOE.

However, the data for monitoring changes in learning achievement was more
problematic. Measuring student learning outcomes between 2000 and 2007 appeared to
use different methodologies and data bases which rendered the results incomparable. A
review of the movements of these indicators from 2000 to 2009 shows rather unusual
patterns. The table below shows for example that the indicators for both French and Math
dropped from the baseline of 42% and 55% respectively in 2000 the base line year, to
38.9% and 40.9% respectively in 2006. The following year 2007, they dropped further to
26.5% for French and 16.6% for Math, substantially below the end of project values of
50% and 60% respectively. Research shows that changes of this magnitude in
achievement scores is highly unlikely over a short period of time.

  EOPV (Target) 2007              50              60

The intermediate outcome indicators (annex 2) were less problematic and the MOE and
partners were proactive in revising these indicators when changes were made in the
design of the components. This was the case with the change in the targets for classroom
construction. Each of these indicators had precise quantitative targets which could be
easily monitored. Data for monitoring 5 of the 8 indicators were derived from the Annual
Budget or PER or from regular reports of the MOE or NGOs. This suggests some
reliability, predictability and sustainability in the monitoring mechanisms. Data for the
other three indicators were obtained from consultant's reports for textbooks and field visit
reports for monitoring the number of functioning COGES adequately resourced. Once
these reforms are fully in place and institutionalized they could be included in the annual
monitoring exercise of the MOE.

The indicators were regularly monitored using data from the cited sources and changes
were made as appropriate to improve the chances of achieving the PDOs. Four areas in
which this was evidenced were: (i) share of girls in primary education; (ii) inclusion of
classroom construction for ERAs; (iii) the number of functioning school committees and
(iv) the number of school committees receiving and managing funds. In the case of (i)
above, additional funds were allocated to expand and strengthen the tutoring program
aimed at encouraging girls to attend school. This was because although enrollment was
increasing overall the gap between boys and girls was not closing a quickly as expected.
In the case of the other three, funds were also allocated to expand these programs based
on the experience of successful pilots.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

There were no major issues in applying the provisions of the Environmental and Social
Management Framework (ESMF) and the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF).
Communities and all stakeholders involved with school construction and rehabilitation
were fully informed of the steps that needed to be taken to address any issues in these
areas. The Regional Directors and staff of the School Construction and Equipment
Directorate ensured that contract documents included the required provisions and that
implementation of these provisions were monitored during construction. In spite of the
overall compliance with the safeguard provisions the recommendation to replace trees cut
down for construction was not systematically followed. The Team recommended more
intensive sensitization of communities about this issue and increased involvement of
COGES in the construction process to increase compliance with the tree planting
requirement.

There were no deviations or waivers from Bank policies on safeguards/fiduciary policies
and procedures.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase




                                            15
The post-completion operation for the PADEB is unlikely to be an issue because
implementation of the PDDE to which it was contributing is continuing with financing
from other donors and the recently approved Education For All/Fast Track Initiative
(EFA/FTI) Catalytic Fund (CF) Grant for US$ 8 million. In addition, the Bank is in the
process of finalizing sector analytical work that would provide a basis for updating the
design of the PDDE and for preparing the next phase of the sector program. A request
for a new EFA/FTI CF Grant will be prepared to help finance the next phase
implementation of the PDDE.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation


ICR Ratings: Highly Satisfactory

Project Objectives: The project objectives continue to be highly relevant to the country
needs as reflected in the PRSP and the CAS. Niger's PRSP for the period 2008 ­ 2012
continues to give high priority to the education sector as one of the engines for reducing
poverty and promoting growth. After acknowledging the progress made in the education
sector since 2003 with the implementation of the PDDE, the PRSP reconfirms the
continued relevance of the program. In this regard priority will continue to be given to
the universal completion of quality primary education focusing on the rural population,
girls and the poor, while the foundation is being laid for expansion of quality secondary
education and skills training linked to the job market. The CAS for the period FY08 to
FY11, approved in April, 2008 supports the PRSP Pillar 2 which is related to
strengthening human capital as an integral part of the country's growth strategy.
Specifically for the education sector, the CAS will support increased access to quality
basic education and analytical work on skills development. Consistent with this the
Proposed IDA Assistance includes an Analytical Advisory Activity (AAA) on skills
development and an Education Enhancement and Skills Development Project. The Bank,
along with other donors, is helping Niger prepare its request for another 3-year EFA/FTI
CF Grant to further develop its primary education to achieve 100% completion of
primary education.




Project Components:

Increasing access to basic education: The project components were highly relevant for
increasing the number of school places. It included both supply and demand side
interventions. The supply side included creation of new school places especially in rural
areas, targeting of disadvantaged groups, especially girls with special programs and a
focus on youth and adult education.




                                           16
On the demand-side, the project supported a program to increase girl's schooling by
lowering the direct costs to households through provision of free textbooks and other
inputs, particularly in rural areas. This was an appropriate method for meeting some of
the direct costs of education to stimulate demand.

Improving the quality and efficiency of primary and lower secondary education.

These components were highly relevant to achieve the quality goals of the project. The
approach combined inputs with support for improving the skills of teachers, and
institutional arrangements for increased operational efficiency of the system. In addition,
specially designed programs were put in place to support rural and weak students attain
the required learning levels. The inclusion of monitoring of learning achievement which
would also provide a basis for diagnosing learning difficulties on a regular basis was a
critical addition to the quality package that is often absent in many projects. Support for
quality improvement in lower secondary education would also help promote completion
of primary education since the potential for access to secondary education is an important
consideration in households' decisions to participate in primary education. The
interventions are also limited to reduce complexity in design.

Objective 3: Strengthen the management capacity of the MoE and decentralized entities
and Communities.

Upgrading the capacity of the MOE in critical areas included reorganizing the structure
of the MOE and further developing its human resources capacity as well as improving
and developing key management systems especially with regard to the EMIS and
accounting and procurement. With regard to the COGES the objective was to develop
management systems and to provide training that would permit them to efficiently
participate in management of schools to increase efficiency and to raise learning
outcomes. These institutional development areas were critical for efficient operations of
the education system and were appropriately chosen by the team.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details
on outputs in Annex 2)

Outcome: Achievement of Objective
ICR Rating ­ Satisfactory

As stated earlier, it would be difficult to rely only on the results framework to assess the
achievement of the project objectives since the PADEB indicators are the same as those
for the PDDE to which it was contributing and it is not possible to identify the unique
contribution of the project to achieving the targets indicated. Despite this constraint, the
assessment will start with the extent to which the stated outcome targets were met since
PADEB was one of the largest operations contributing to the implementation of the
PDDE.




                                            17
Table II provides a summary of the extent to which the PDOs were achieved based on the
indicators.

Objective 1 - Increasing enrollment and completion rates of the students in its basic
education programs. As can be seen from table II, 3 of the 5 indicators related to
enrollment increase and completion were met. The completion rate slightly surpassed the
target. However, the targets related to student achievement declined.

                                                                             There is some suggestion that
                                                                             there were technical
                                                                             difficulties in carrying out the
                                                                             tests.
5. Girls' share in primary            39.8%       43%            43%         Achieved
enrollment

As stated above the targets for some of the components supporting this objective were
revised and not all of the targets were met by project completion. For example, only 75
or 30% of the 250 planned ERA schools were established although the overall quality of
construction was judged to be satisfactory by a technical audit. The project was much
more successful in meeting the contract teacher recruitment numbers, but the
effectiveness of these teachers was diluted by poor teacher management.

The achievement targets set for French and Math were probably too ambitious given the
challenges in obtaining measurable increases in learning outcomes over a short period of
time. The CAPEDs and COGES were under resourced and therefore could not be fully
effective during the project period. As a result, only 25% of the planned 2000 COGES
were managing funds by the project completion date. Remedial classes for
underperforming students which could have helped increase retention only covered 15
localities and they were focused largely on girls. Although measurable improvements in


                                                     18
these areas did not accrue during the project period because of their limited coverage,
these interventions are likely to yield the required results in the medium term as the
coverage of these programs expands. This is especially so since the capacity for
measuring learning outcomes has been significantly reinforced in the MOE at the central
and deconcentrated/decentralized levels.

Objective 2. Strengthening the administrative and managerial capacities of MOE,
deconcentrated ministerial branches, and local civil society groups engaged in the basic
education sector. The outcome indicator for this objective can be considered achieved as
the budget reached 89% instead of 90% by the project completion date.

The indicator for the decentralization of the budget increased from 66% in 2002 to 82%
in June 2006 and then to 89% in September, 2007. An associated indicator was that the
share of the primary education budget in the MOE budget should be maintained at no less
than 49%. This target was substantially surpassed as it reached 72.3% in 2008. It is not
clear whether this was an acceptable increase given the need to have a balanced
distribution of the budget among all the sub-sectors.

Objective 2. Strengthening the administrative and managerial capacities of the MOE,
deconcentrated branches and local civil society groups engaged in the basic education
sector.
6. Percentage of primary education 66%                90%        89%      Achieved
expenditures (not counting civil service
salaries) allocated and managed at
decentralized level.


In sum the following conclusions could be reached:

   (a) The PDOs were highly relevant to the development needs of the country and the
          specific issues in the sector.
   (b) The components in support of the PDOs were highly relevant for achieving the
          objectives and were overall implemented in full except for the organizational
          changes proposed for the MOE and the school construction program.
   (c) The key PDO indicators were met except for those related to increases in
          achievement levels in French and Math which were probably inappropriate for
          the project. Flawed design and measuring of the quality indicators should not
          diminish the contribution the quality components would make to increasing
          enrollment and completion rates. Also, the capacity for measuring learning
          outcomes has been reinforced in the MOE.
   (d) Given the duration of the project it seems unlikely that the full impact of the
          project would have been seen during the project period because of the time
          needed to put in place the various interventions. On the other hand the
          PADEB interventions are highly pertinent for promoting increased
          enrollment, completion and student learning. The project is therefore likely to




                                           19
             have a significant positive impact on in the medium to long term once the
             effects of the components work through the system.

3.3 Efficiency


ICR Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The key efficiency target in the project was to progressively reduce the unit cost of
primary education from 21.3% of GDP in 2002 to 16.6% in 2012. This was to be
achieved through: (i) increasing the proportion of contract teachers in the teaching force;
(ii) expanding multi-grade teaching and (iii) expanding the use of double-shift in urban
areas12. At appraisal contract teacher costs were estimated at about 50% that of regular
teachers and over time, increasing the proportion of contract teachers in the teaching
force was expected to reduce average salaries from 6 times GDP per capita in 2002 to 4.3
times GDP per capita in 2012. These were very ambitious targets that were expected to
yield substantial gains in the long run. An added benefit of the policy of recruiting and
posting these teachers in rural areas was expected to be an increase in teacher presence
and productivity leading to increased internal efficiency of the education system and
higher learning outcomes.

With regard to multi-grade teaching, savings were supposed to accrue from more
intensive use of classroom space and teachers. The specifications for classroom design
was modified to include models specially designed for multi-grade teaching that would
accommodate all six grades of primary education and an option for mud-and-thatch
construction on steel frames.

The expected efficiency gains did not accrue as planned largely because of changes in the
way the relevant policy measures were implemented. With regard to contract teachers,
although the numbers recruited exceeded expectations, rising to about 26,000 instead of
the planned 23,000, the unit costs of these teachers also increased much more than
planned because of increased salary levels and other benefits for these teachers. Although
the cost savings from this source was less than expected substantial savings did accrue.
Contract teachers with an annual salary of US$ 1 808 (F CFA 962,000), cost
approximately fifty percent lower than a civil servant teacher whose salary is US$ 3 461
(F CFA 1 841 000). So without the policy of contract teachers, the number of teachers
would have been half for the same budget.

 Although multi-grade teaching continued across the education system, the target for
constructing specially designed classrooms for multi-grade teaching in areas with widely
dispersed population was not met. Construction of classrooms for this component was
introduced in 2005 and the number was further increased when reallocation of funds was
made in October, 2007. At project completion, only 75 of the 250 planned ERA school
classrooms had been constructed. Although these quantitative targets were not met,


12
     PAD Annex 4


                                             20
introduction of this strategy would yield significant savings in costs of classrooms and
teachers costs sector wide while ensuring adequate conditions for learning.

The unit costs of classrooms increased sharply during project implementation due to
inflation and scarcity of building materials in Niger and because of the decision to replace
the steel framed option with cement construction. The unit cost of construction of
classrooms built in cement almost doubled from F CFA 3.8 million at appraisal to F CFA
7.4 million in 2007, while the cost of the metal framed construction increased by almost 3
times from 750,000 to 2,000,000 because of price escalation. The replacement of steel
framed classrooms by cement classrooms and the addition of 75 multi-grade classrooms
with higher unit costs than normal classrooms increased the unit costs. As a result, the
total number of classrooms constructed under the project dropped to 695 instead of 1000.

Overall efficiency is rated moderately satisfactory. The measures for reducing costs
were technically sound and some of the changes that led to increased costs were outside
the control of the MOE such as inflation of construction costs. Although the late
inclusion of multi-grade classrooms probably prejudiced achievement of the project
targets it would lead to significant gains in the long run as discussed above.

Increased cost of contract teachers was partly under the control of the Government as it
was the result of the absence of an effective management framework for these teachers.
This absence of an effective management system allowed easier exploitation by trade
unions. Similar to the discussion on construction of multi-grade classrooms average
teacher costs would fall due to increased use of these teachers.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The justification for this rating is that relevance is considered highly satisfactory,
achievement of PDOs satisfactory and efficiency moderately satisfactory. The PDOs as
well as the components continue to remain highly relevant to the development and
education sector needs of Niger as reflected in the PRSP and CAS. Enrollment rates and
quality need to be improved to raise the average level of education of the population to
help increase productivity and the fiscal and institutional reforms to make this possible
are an integral part of the PDDE and the PADEB.

With regard to the achievement of the PDOs, four out of the six indicators were achieved.
Even though there were contributions from other sources to reaching these targets, the
project could be considered to have made its contributions as agreed at appraisal or as
later modified. As explained above the quality components were also a welcome addition
to the project design and would make substantial contributions to increasing the
proportion of students graduating from primary education. The inability to accurately
measure learning outcomes during the project period should therefore not diminish its
significance.




                                            21
The design of the efficiency measures were technically sound but implementation was
constrained largely by changes in design during implementation, the duration of the
project and contextual issues outside the control of the Government. However, while
these factors prevented achievement of the specified targets the measures introduced
would lead to overall goal of reducing the unit costs of education.

Finally, the success of PADEB should also be seen in the context of the various policies
and strategies it introduced that would have a significant impact beyond the specific
project areas.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
         This has been treated in sections 2, 3 and 4 of the report.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening This has been treated in sections 2, 4 and 5 of
the report.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
       Nothing significant

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)
A beneficiary survey was not available, nor was the team able to hold a stakeholder workshop
specifically for this ICR due to budget constraints. However, interviews were held with key
partners involved with the PDDE to solicit their views which have been incorporated in the
report. The positive response of the COGES and communities to being included in the
implementation of the program indicates their support for the objectives and outcomes.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

Technical: The risk to development outcome for the technical aspects of the project is
considered negligible to low. One of the key considerations during preparation and
appraisal was to simplify the design to increase the chances of success. The project and
various components were designed to be easily implemented by the MOE in partnership
with other stake holders in the sector. Areas in which there were innovations were first
pilot tested before they were taken to scale or substantial training and technical assistance
were provided to ensure that the required capacity was in place to ensure success.

Financial: The risk from financial flows is considered moderate given the economic and
financial constraints of the country as evidenced by lateness in the provision of
counterpart funds. The international community is aware of this risk which was
discussed at appraisal and is committed to provide medium term support to the
government to ensure successful implementation of the program. One of the mitigation
measures is to continue supporting Niger within the context of the EFA/FTI CF
framework. International support allowed the counterpart funds in the project to be
evaluated at a minimum. Without this support this risk would be rated high. The future


                                              22
fiscal situation seems more promising than in the immediate past based on expected
revenue increases from mining and more efficient fiscal management.

Economic: This risk is considered moderate, lower than the high rating in the PAD. This
is because the economic outlook for Niger is much better than it was during the project
appraisal and implementation period. Between 2001 and 2006 GDP growth rate was
erratic but averaged 4.6% because of improved economic performance in 2006. Average
GDP growth is expected to average 5% through 2017. There has been increased fiscal
prudence in the past few years which would allow fiscal space for the government to
meet its commitments for financing the education and training sector.

Social: This risk is considered negligible or low because of the strong commitment to
involvement of stakeholders in the implementation of key policy and program reforms.
Apart from the strong involvement of all levels of stake holders in the preparation of the
project, one of the key objectives is to strengthen the participation of communities in the
management of the education system. The COGES has been widely expanded and the
objective is to make them more effective. Also, key initiatives related to increasing the
participation of girls and poor/rural students is being implemented in partnership with
parents and communities.

Political: This risk is rated moderate because of the uncertainties regarding how or when
the current constitutional crisis in the country would be resolved. The sanctions being
imposed by regional and international organizations could lead to a slow down of normal
government and private sector activities. However, this is likely to be only a temporary
disruption that would not threaten the long term goals of the education system. There is
widespread consensus on the goals of the education sector and the key reforms which are
therefore not likely to change in the event of a change in government.

Environment: The rating for this risk is low or negligible. There are some risks
associated with availability of building materials that has slowed down construction in
some areas. However, the MOE is fully aware of this and has put in place measures to
address them. For example trees cut down for construction were immediately replaced to
avoid deforestation. Another environmental risk was the probability of drought and
famine returning to Niger especially in the poorer rural areas. This is also likely to be a
temporary disruption of implementation rather than a change.

Government Ownership: The probability that this risk would materialize is negligible
or low. The Government is fully committed to the reforms and has been implementing
most of them except those related to the organizational change to the MOE at the center
and some resistance in moving forward with the decentralization program. The latter
started slowly but the key resistances had been resolved by project completion. Some of
the resistance was related to methods for improving the implementation of the reforms
rather than a change in government policy. With regard to the resistances to
implementation of reforms at the center, the issue was related to the wider civil service
reforms which had not been completed at the time of project implementation. Legislation
has now been put in place to support the reforms which would be implemented once the



                                            23
instruments for carrying out the reforms have been agreed. Similar problems were
encountered with regard to the recruitment of contract teachers. The management
systems were not fully in place when expansion of the program started. These
arrangements, including the necessary legislation are now in place.

Other Stakeholder ownership: There is negligible or low probability that this risk
would materialize. The main stakeholders involved with the project are parents,
communities and the private sector. These groups have been strongly committed to the
reforms resulting in more than twice as many COGES being established than planned and
the private sector has taken up its role in the distribution of textbooks effectively.
Systems are being put in place to improve the mechanisms for school construction at the
local community levels. The constraints were more to do with transfer of funds and
quality control than commitment of communities to the new responsibilities.

Institutional Support: Institutional support for the project is strong so the long term risk
from this area is negligible or low. The reforms were approved by the Council of
Ministers following wide ranging discussions among stakeholders. The necessary legal
framework and regulations were put in place to support implementation except for those
mentioned above. In addition, implementation is being carried out by the relevant
directorates of the MOE at the central and deconcentrated/decentralized levels with the
Secretary-General as ex-officio head and in collaboration with key stakeholders. This
ensures integration of project activities in the MOE as part of its normal responsibilities.
This approach is key for ensuring sustainability of the program.

Governance: Governance was a key issue during project preparation. A number of
financial management and procurement reforms and a capacity building program were
therefore agreed and put in place in the sector during implementation. These reforms in
the sector were further strengthened by legislation to improve fiduciary management in
the entire government system. The chances that this risk would materialize in the
medium to long term are therefore rated as moderate.

Natural Disasters Exposure: This risk is rated negligible or low. Although Niger might
suffer from famine, due to drought or infestation by insects, the effects of these
occurrences are likely to be temporary.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

Strategic Relevance and Approach: Overall Bank performance in ensuring quality at
entry is rated satisfactory. The project was based on extensive analytical work which
ensured its strategic relevance to the overall economic and social development needs of
Niger as described in earlier sections. It was consistent with the objectives of the PRSP



                                            24
and CAS, and the design targeted key disadvantaged groups with limited participation in
the education system, such as girls and the rural poor. The project was designed to
contribute to the implementation of the PDDE and to leverage resources of other
stakeholders to deepen sector reforms. In this regard, IDA was continuing the key role it
played in carrying out analytical work as well as in supporting the dialogue through
which the PDDE reforms were designed and approved.

Technical, Financial and Economic Aspects: The approach was to adopt technically
sound designs in developing the components, and to modify these designs as appropriate
to fit the local/country context by building on successful pilots or testing various options
to determine the best approach before finalizing the design. This was the case for
example with the expansion of the COGES and the tutoring program for underperforming
students.

With regard to the financial aspects of the program, the Team took into consideration the
economic constraints of Niger. Expansion of the system was therefore kept modest and
government counterpart funds kept to a minimum. The projections of enrollment
increase were limited to a 4 year horizon to allow changes to be made in the rate of
expansion if the fiscal situation were to change significantly. This approach helped keep
expenditures to a level at which they could be financed within the agreed macro-
economic parameters. Counterpart funds were largely accounted for by taxes and duties.
The project was designed within the agreed economic parameters used for the PEAC and
PRSC.

Poverty, Gender and Social Development:The project focused especially on poverty,
gender and social development consistent with the objectives of the PRSP and the CAS.
Project priorities were influenced by the findings of a beneficiary survey of a sample of
rural communities which identified costs and quality of education as key constraints in
access to quality education for the poor, especially girls. Project interventions therefore
included supply and demand side measures to reduce costs as well as targeted
interventions for the girls and the poor.

With regard to social development, preparation, starting from the analytical work to
appraisal, was highly participatory and communities and civil society groups were
integrated as appropriate in designing the various components. The decentralization
process was a major instrument used to increase participation of stakeholders in the
regions and communities during implementation and project monitoring.

Environmental Aspects: Environmental aspects addressed during project preparation
covered the entire PDDE and included a review of: (i) an Environmental Analysis (EA)
and Environmental Mitigation Plan (EMP) to assess the likely effects of the program and
to design actions to mitigate potential adverse environmental and social impact; (ii) an
ESMF to enable the communities and others to assess the potential environmental and
social impacts of school construction at sites yet to be determined; and (iii) a RPF which
outlined the principles of compensation for loss of land, access to land, incomes, income




                                            25
opportunities, and livelihoods due to the construction of schools and other project
activities.

There was wide consultation with stakeholders during the preparation of the EA, ESMF
and RPF including discussions with representatives of the MOE, municipalities,
environment agencies, private sector and communities responsible for classroom
construction, members of parents associations, teachers, customary chiefs, youth
organizations, and women's organizations and site visits to locations in and outside
Niamey.

The EMP also included clear indicators to be monitored by local NGOs in close
cooperation with various institutions such as the Ministries of Infrastructure, Health and
Environment. The Safeguards documents were disclosed in Niger (3/31/03) as well as at
the Bank's Infoshop.

Fiduciary Aspects: The overall project FM risk assessment was rated moderate while the
risk rating for the country was substantial. Given the country Financial Management
(FM) risk and the issues that evolved after preparation of the project, the moderate risk
assessed did not seem appropriate. Mitigating measures were put in place at the project
design stage to ensure that the FM arrangements of the Directeur des Affaires Financières/
Direction Régionale de l'Education de Base (DAF/DREBA) comply with the minimum
requirements under OP/BP 10:02 which require that FM systems are adequate to ensure
accountability, accuracy of financial information and the timely reporting of project
funds. The ministry was not able to attract qualified FM staff. In light of the need to
ensure that FM arrangements were adequate to meet the requirements of the project, they
resorted to recruiting consultants for the project as FM support to the DAF with a view to
appointing permanent FM staff under the civil service reform program.

Policy and Institutional Aspects: A thorough analysis of the policy issues in the sector
was carried out and a decision made to focus on the urgent critical areas that had to be
addressed to promote further development of the education sector. These areas included:
(i) focus on essential needs; (ii) rural/urban disparities and (iii) institutional reforms to
improve the operational efficiency of the education sector.

Focus on essential needs: It was recognized that the needs of the sector were quite
substantial and complex and addressing all of these in this operation would lead to an
unmanageable operation. This was especially so since one of the major problems was
that the system had weak management capacity and was operating at a low level of
operational efficiency. First priority was therefore given to reforms that would support
ongoing Government programs to make them more effective. To further simplify the
design, it was decided to focus only on primary education at this time while preparing the
foundation for further development of lower secondary education and skills development.
New policies/reforms (strongly recommended by the QER) were limited to a few
carefully selected programs.




                                             26
Reducing inequities between rural and urban schooling (increasing supply of traditional
schools in rural areas as well as testing some community-led alternatives). It was
recognized that traditional methods of enrollment expansion would not suffice to reach
the children left out of the education system because of inappropriateness of the way the
current school system was managed. The project therefore supported the Government in
introducing, on a trial basis, an Alternative Rural School model using flexibility in school
schedules as decided by the parents, and in the academic program, with 20% of the
program having parental and student input.

Sustainability of Teacher Financing (civil service vs. contract-based). Analytical work
showed that efficiency measures alone would not suffice to make the projected expansion
of basic education financially feasible if the salary structure of new teachers were as high
as those of current civil service teachers. Three options for meeting expected new
demands on the education sector were discussed. One option was to increase the share of
basic education within the overall education budget. This was not feasible because of
budget rigidities. The second option was to lower the enrollment target. This option was
rejected since it would undermine Niger's long term development prospects given the
relatively low enrollment rates in the country. The third option was to expand
recruitment of contract teachers at about 50% the cost of civil service teachers. This was
the preferred option. It was estimated that this would lead to a substantial reduction in
the average salary of teachers from 10 times GDP per capita in 1999 to 4.4 times GDP
per capita in 2012.

These measures were key elements for defining the specific policy actions supported by
the project.

Institutional Reform

Implementation arrangements were built on already existing MOE structures, although it
was recognized that this approach would be slower than if a PIU were to be used.
Restructuring the MOE was therefore planned, based on the outcome of the institutional
assessment carried out jointly by Government and partners.

Implementation Arrangements: Implementation was carried out by the MOE and was
fully aligned with the program implementation and coordination arrangements, of the
PDDE with a view to moving towards a sector-wide implementation approach in the
future. This was an appropriate decision to ensure ownership and sustainability. The
arrangements included a Steering Committee that would ensure coordination of all the
relevant ministries, Partners and NGOs involved with the project.

Program monitoring and technical coordination within MOE. In line with his/her
normal mandate, the Secretary General of the MOE with a small team led the overall
policy and technical coordination of program. The DAF managed all fiduciary matters in
liaison with the deconcentrated entities, particularly the DREBA. The risks associated
with entrusting fiduciary management to the MOE DAF was mitigated by new
regulations and capacity building of the ministry in these areas. This arrangement did not



                                            27
pose any major threats to successful implementation of the PDDE/PADEB and the long-
term benefits outweighed some of the delays.

Monitoring and Evaluation: M&E is considered moderately satisfactory. Consistent
with the implementation arrangements, the M&E systems and processes were under the
leadership of the General Secretary of the MOE; the M&E activities would be the shared
responsibility of the core technical departments of the MOE;, Directorate of Human
Services (DAAP), DEP with the Regional Directors of Education feeding the process
with necessary information and data from the field. A progress report was prepared twice
a year on the status of program implementation and outcomes for discussion among the
relevant government agencies and with the partners. This was also an approach that
further reinforced ownership and helped build capacity. The data sets used for
monitoring were largely from existing process to reduce the burden on the MOE and to
help strengthen the overall data collection system of the government.

Periodic impact evaluations and incidence analyses were also planned to better measure
program impact on beneficiaries and efficiency of service delivery. This was an
important addition to obtain knowledge about project impact on areas for which data is
not collected on a regular basis. Supervision missions and other project activities were to
be carried out jointly with the other technical and financing partners under Government
leadership in line with the harmonization principles.

Risk Assessment: The risk assessment is rated moderately satisfactory. All the three
risks under "From Outputs to Objectives" materialized in some form and three of the five
risks associated with "Components to Outputs" did materialize. However, a number of
important issues that affected implementation emerged that were not identified as risks.
These included the rejection of the mud-and-thatch model for school construction which
led to an 18 month extension of the project closing date. Also, the risks of
implementation disruption/delays associated with implementation of the project in the
context of the Cadre Partenarial which involved some partners using weak government
systems should have been foreseen.

Bank Inputs and Processes: Bank inputs and processes are considered satisfactory
through to project approval and the 19 month preparation period is considered to be
reasonable for preparing such an operation. The project team was comprehensive and
included all the key specialties required to deal with the key areas in the PDDE/PADEB.
In addition to the Team Leader an experienced education specialist, the team also
included another Education Specialist, and specialists in quality enhancement, girls'
education, textbooks, rural schools, capacity building, non-formal education, health,
safeguards as well as an architect. This team worked in close collaboration with
colleagues from Poverty Reduction and Economic Management (PREM) and other
relevant units to ensure consistency between the Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit /
Public Expenditure Adjustment Credit Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit (PRSC/PEAC)
and the PDDE/PADEB.




                                            28
Project preparation was preceded by substantial analytical work led by the Bank in
collaboration with other partners that included a CSR and procurement and financial
management assessments. Bank input was instrumental in the dialogue with the
Government on key policy and program issues and played a major role in fostering
harmonization among partners. Prior to appraisal a quality enhancement review was
conducted by Human Development Network ­ Education (HDNED) and the
recommendations were considered in the finalization of the project design.

There were some flaws during the design related to incomplete identification of risks and
underestimation of project costs at appraisal.

 (b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

Focus on Development Impact: Project supervision was fully focused on the
development impact of the project. As an illustration, reallocation of project funds and
extension of the closing date were aimed at actions to address issues encountered during
implementation as well as those that would enhance the development impact of the
project. In particular increased allocations were made for the construction and running of
ERAs, for capacity building of the decentralized structures such as the DREBA,
Inspectorates and Pedagogic Sectors and for nation-wide expansion of the COGES.
Similarly, the project was extended to allow completion of the school construction
program and the delivery of textbooks.

Supervision of Fiduciary and Safeguards Aspects:             The financial management
performance ratings (ISR) of the project during implementation varied from
unsatisfactory to moderately satisfactorily as performance progressively improved in the
last two years of the project. FM arrangements put in place to build capacity to improve
the FM systems permitted the Government to provide reliable financial information - this
included the acquisition of the TOMPRO systems which was fully functional in the later
stages of the project. In addition to measures that were put in place to strengthen the FM
capacity at the earlier stage of the project, the auditor's management letter
recommendations and FM action plans prepared during supervision missions were
progressively implemented by the DAF but there were a few residual actions that were
still pending as of the last supervision mission. An FM action plan was prepared for
project closure.      Currently, the majority of these recommendations have been
implemented and a few are in progress. The designated accounts are being closed and the
disbursement ratios for the grant and credit stand at 100% and 98% respectively. A final
audit of the project for the period January 2008 to October 2009 would be carried out by
an audit firm. Counterpart funds are delayed. Only 73% of the obligation was met and it
is not clear whether the outstanding suppliers and contractors have been paid as
recommended by the last supervision mission.

Adequacy of Supervision Inputs and Processes: IDA supervision inputs and processes
are rated satisfactory. The leadership of the team was stable during the preparation of the



                                            29
analytical work, project preparation and supervision with only two formal changes in
team leadership over the 8 to 9 year span. Implementation was closely monitored. From
2006 to project completion in 2009, the TTL was resident in Niamey. Prior to that, the
Senior Health Specialist resident in Niamey carried out project oversight. The
supervision team composition was also comprehensive and stable. Specialists on the
team usually covered education, institutional development, gender, rural education,
safeguards and fiduciary management. A significant proportion of the team participated
in several missions and at least one member who was not the TTL served on all missions.
This continuity helped establish and maintain a strong dialogue and consistency in advice
to the Government over the implementation period.

Supervision missions were carried out in close collaboration with other partners and the
timing was made to coincide as much as possible with the joint annual reviews of the
PDDE. In this regard the Bank Team played a pivotal role in fostering harmonization in
approach. This role became critical when disbursements from the pooled fund account
were suspended and the implementation of components almost stopped. During this
period the Bank, as one of the few agencies continuing with implementation, used its
dialogue with the government to explore options for resolving the pooled fund issues as
well as to facilitate continued implementation of the PDDE.

The Project Status Report (PSRs) and ISRs were prepared at least twice a year and
overall they contained an accurate picture of the implementation status and issues at the
time. Management reviews of the ISRs by the Sector Unit and Country Management
Unit (CMU)/Country Office were regular and substantive.

Candor and Quality of Performance Reporting: The teams were candid in reporting
performance ratings. Eighteen months after effectiveness in May, 2005, the DO rating
continued to be rated satisfactory because there were no serious threats to achieving the
project outcomes. However, the Implementation Performance (IP) rating was
downgraded from satisfactory to moderately satisfactory to reflect concerns about delays
in the implementation of the institutional development components of the project. This
IP rating was maintained through to December, 2006 because of issues with fiduciary
management. The DO and IP ratings were downgraded to moderately unsatisfactory
because of the mismanagement of the Pooled Fund Account. The MU rating for the DO
was maintained through December, 2007 because of the recognition that delays caused
by the Pooled Fund issue had delayed implementation to such an extent that it was no
longer possible to achieve the DO targets by the original project completion date. The IP
rating was upgraded to MS in June, 2007 once progress had been made in resolving the
pooled fund issue and improvements in implementation started. The DO rating was
upgraded to MS in May, 2008 when the pooled fund issue had been resolved and the
project closing date had been extended. The ratings through to project completion
reflected the same candor.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory




                                           30
Bank's overall performance is rated satisfactory because the teams performed
satisfactorily at the design and approval stages and during project supervision. There
were however some weaknesses at these stages that have been discussed above.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance/ Implementing Agency Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Government and implementing agency performance have been combined since the
project was implemented by the MOE and most of the performance issues were also
related to wider government concerns.

Government Ownership and Commitment: The Government owned the project and
was highly committed to meeting the objectives. The Government requested assistance
from the Bank to help implement the PDDE which had been designed as part of its
program for achieving its PRSP goals. The project was therefore given very high
priority. Government led the preparation and implementation of the project. They also
took the difficult decision to decentralize management of the sector, to redeploy teachers
from urban to rural areas and from administrative to classroom duties to improve
efficiency in the use of resources and to promote equitable access to quality education.

Enabling Environment: The Government put in place the relevant policies and
regulations at the macro and sector levels to support the reforms of the education system.
In particular, reforms were introduced in teacher recruitment, strategies for increasing
rural participation as well as in decentralizing management of education. Although
delayed, the MOE officials did strive to adapt their mode of working to a new
management by objectives approach. Strong leadership in the MOE facilitated this
process.

Adequacy of Beneficiary/Stakeholder Consultations: Learning from previous projects,
the Government carried out extensive consultations on the analytical work that preceded
project preparation and on the project design. This consultation spanned all groups from
the school/village level to the Council of Ministers which finally approved the design.
During these processes the Government worked in close collaboration with the partners
in education.

Readiness for Implementation: The Government carried out all the eight conditions for
effectiveness, including appointment of technical heads at the central and decentralized
levels, preparation of an implementation manual and establishment of improved fiduciary
systems within the prescribed ninety day period. Qualified staff were recruited and
assigned to the General Secretariat and the main divisions of the MOE. That enabled the
MOE to implement the project under the leadership of the Secretary General. This
facilitated the ownership of the project by the MOE. The only action that was delayed
was the provision of counterpart funds.




                                           31
Timely Resolution of Implementation Issues: The Government took effective action to
address implementation issues, but there were some unresolved issues at project
completion. Although issues related to contract teachers were well known there were
delays in addressing these issues. The management structure for contract teachers
especially with regard to payment of salaries remained unresolved at project closing.
Similarly, the decentralization process was slow including the transfer of funds to the
COGES and CAPEDs and proposed institutional reforms at the central MOE are yet to be
implemented. There also continue to be serious delays in filling key positions in the
MOE. The departments of school construction and equipment (DIES) teacher training
(DFIC), basic education (DGEB) and DEP have been functioning with acting directors
for over one year for unexplained reasons. However, the Government was quite effective
in resolving the issues related to the misuse of Pooled Funds.

Fiduciary: With regard to fiduciary matters, the Government performed in a satisfactory
manner. Deep reforms were introduced at the sector and overall government levels
through legislation and other instruments to improve fiduciary management. This
included new management systems for public expenditure management. All covenants
were complied with except those related to timely provision of counterpart funds which
were disbursed in an irregular/delayed manner.

Relationships with Partners: Relationships with partners during the period was
satisfactory despite the issues related to the pooled fund. The systems that had been
established for donor collaboration worked effectively in the resolution of the pooled
fund problems and the lessons learned during this experience were used to further
strengthen the system. Collaboration among Government and donors was also very
effective and PADEB was supervised closely with the PDDE and the interventions of
other partners.

Adequacy of Transition Arrangements: There are unlikely to be any transition issues.
The Government continues to implement the PDDE with Bank support through the
recently approved EFA/FTI CF Grant and financing from other donors. They are also
planning to request an additional 3-year funding from the EFA/FTI CF for further
development of the education system.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Although the Government overall performed satisfactorily during implementation, the
sudden change in the construction program and delays in the implementation of the
institutional development component could have been avoided. The misuse of pooled
funds also delayed project implementation unnecessarily.

6. Lessons Learned

A number of lessons could be drawn from the implementation experience of the PADEB.



                                          32
Lesson 1 ­ Promoting Access for Girls: Provision of school places is not enough to
promote access. Targeted interventions are sometimes needed to address specific
constraints of some groups. The use of ERAs and the tutoring programs for girls was
used effectively in this project. Demand side issues also need to be addressed to
complement provision of school places.

Lesson 2 ­ Community Involvement in Management of Schools: Community
involvement in the management of schools is a key factor for success as demonstrated by
the activities of the COGES.

Lesson 3 ­ Selection of Appropriate Indicators: Consistent with good practice,
Performance Indicators should be selected on the basis of the feasibility of the indicators
being achieved at the end of the project period, taking into consideration the time it
would take to put in place the investments and reforms that are expected to lead to the
proposed changes. If results would only accrue after the project period this should be
clearly indicated. Arrangements should also be made to identify the specific contribution
of a project to a sector program to allow an objective assessment of outcomes. If this is
not possible it should be discussed in the PAD. Non adherence to this approach made it
difficult to assess the specific results of PADEB.

Lesson 4 ­ Management of Contract Teachers: The lesson here is that when large
scale recruitment of contract teachers is planned at lower salary levels, clear and effective
management systems must be in place to ensure that the new teachers are used effectively
and to minimize opportunities for conflict with unions which may not be fully supportive
of the new terms of employment. Also, the terms of employment must meet minimum
national and regional standards to avoid unexpected increases of the costs of these
teachers. If these issues are not properly addressed the results would be inefficient use of
the new teaching resources.

Lesson 5 ­ Reforms to Improve Efficiency in Teacher Training: Reforms aimed at
reducing the period of teacher training on the assumption that teachers already have basic
knowledge of subject contents should first be verified before implementation. This
would help avoid inadequate training and the reversal of this policy as happened in Niger.

Lesson 6 ­ Support for Sensitive Reforms: When models based on adaptations of local
technology that could be sensitive are proposed, such as the steel framed construction of
schools, these models should be fully discussed and agreed with all stakeholders,
including the wider public, before they are implemented to avoid unexpected reversals of
policy.

Lesson 7 ­ Fiduciary Management and Decentralization: Decentralization of
education management especially to local/school levels should be accompanied by a
clearly worked out fiduciary management system that would ensure proper use and
accountability of funds to minimize the risk of leakage and suspension of the reform.




                                             33
Lesson 8 ­ Partnership Collaboration in Implementation of Sector Programs:
During preparation and appraisal every effort should be made to adopt uniform
arrangements for implementation. If this could not be done then the risks associated with
the use of different procedures should be assessed and included in the appraisal/ approval
process.

Lesson 9 ­ Governance Issues: Three factors from the experience are critical to deal
with governance issue in Pooled fund management: (a) the timely identification of the
issue; (b) common concerted reaction among donor partners which led to clear decisions
and measures; (c) the Government leadership in the treatment of the issue.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
The Borrower issues were primarily the same as the ones indicated in the ICR, and were
not only expressed during the discussion of the last supervision mission and the ICR
mission, but are reflected in the aide-memoire shared and agreed upon by both parties.
There are no major areas of disagreement or divergence.

(b) Cofinanciers
The project was not co-financed

(c) Other partners and stakeholders
Not applicable.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

This annex provides more detailed information on the outputs of the project, especially
the links between the various components and outcomes. The discussion will follow the
structure used in annex 2 of the PAD.

Objective 1. To increase in the enrollment and completion rates of the students in its
primary education in rural areas through the following supply and demand side
components:

The supply-side components were:

   (i)     a primary school construction program targeting rural areas and community
           schools;
   (ii)    scaling up multi-grade teaching to increase the number of spaces in existing
           facilities;
   (iii)   consolidation of the expanded contractual teacher program to staff the
           schools; and
   (iv)    expansion of the functional literacy program.

These components were highly relevant for increasing the number of school places.
Although the project proposal was to contribute only 12% of the planned number of
classrooms the strategies for building these classrooms which were aimed at reducing
costs also had a positive impact on construction undertaken with other financing. In
addition, specific targeting of disadvantaged groups, especially girls through special
programs was highly commendable.

On the demand-side, the project supported a program to increase girl's schooling by
lowering the direct costs for households through provision of free textbooks and other
inputs, particularly in rural areas. This was an appropriate method for meeting some of
the direct costs of education to households to help stimulate demand.

Objective 2. To improve the quality and efficiency of primary and lower secondary
education through the following components:

   (i)     a program for providing all students with textbooks and teacher's guides in
           core subjects (mathematics, reading, sciences) at a ratio of 1:1;
   (ii)    expansion of teacher in-service training through reinforcement of the Cellules
           d'Animation Pédagogique (CAPED), and training of school heads on how to
           improve teacher productivity, teaching quality;
   (iii)   increased involvement of parents (COGES) in school management;
   (iv)    piloting of an alternative rural school model (250 schools) to respond to the
           needs of isolated rural communities that cannot be effectively served by the
           normal school delivery system;
   (v)     remediation programs in 15 targeted localities to help retain girls, and



                                           37
   (vi)    measurement of learning achievement.

These components were highly relevant for achieving the quality goals of the project.
The approach combined educational inputs with support for improving the skills of
teachers, and institutional reforms to promote increased operational efficiency of the
system. In addition, specially designed programs were put in place to support rural and
weak students attain the required learning levels. The inclusion of monitoring of learning
achievement which would also provide a basis for diagnosing learning difficulties on a
regular basis was a critical addition to the quality package that is often absent in many
projects.

Objective 3: Strengthen the management capacity of the MoE and decentralized entities
and Communities.

The components designed to achieve this objective were:

   (i)     Upgrading the Capacity of the MOE in critical areas in liaison with the
           PDDE training Plan, and
   (ii)    Strengthening the Capacity of COGESs (COGES).

Upgrading the capacity of the MOE in critical areas included reorganizing the structure
of the MOE, further developing its human resources capacity and improving and
developing key institutional systems especially with regard to the EMIS and fiduciary
management. With regard to the COGES the objective was to develop management
systems and to provide training that would permit them to efficiently participate in
management of schools as a means of increasing efficiency and raising learning
outcomes. These institutional development areas are critical for efficient operations of
the education system and were appropriately chosen by the team.

Outcome Indicators: Judging from the data in the final ISR the enrollment indicator for
rural areas was substantially met as it increased from 38% in 2002 to only 58.9% in 2007,
close to the planned EOPV target of 59%. It is not clear to what extent this increase
could be attributed to PADEB. PADEB was only supposed to contribute 1000 (about
12%) of the planned 8500 new classrooms. With the change in the construction program
this fell to 695 classrooms (about 8%) which were completed by project completion.
However, support for decentralization of construction and for lower cost options would
have had a wider impact beyond the 695 classrooms built.

The number of teachers recruited during the period to match increased enrollment
exceeded the targets. The number of contractual teachers at project completion was
25,803 about 2,803 more than planned. This excess compensated for the shortfall in the
number of regular teachers recruited which fell short of the target of 1109 by about 460.
Although the number of teachers required was exceeded, the impact on increasing
enrollment is not clear. There was some concern that the impact of the rapid increase in
the number of contractual teachers on the system was lower than expected because of the
inefficient management of this corps of teachers which led to frequent strikes and
teachers abandoning their posts.

The target share of girls in primary enrollment was met, rising from 39.8% in 2002 to
43% in 2008. Although the increase in enrollment rate for girls was impressive, the
enrollment gap between boys and girls was still high, about 14%. The increase in girls'
enrollment was due partly to the sensitization program put in place by the COGESs. The
impact of this program was however blunted by under financing and lack of proper
coordination among the Directorate for Girls' Education, Regional Directorates and the
Central Services.

Implementation of the functional literacy program which was expected to have a positive
effect on enrollment was also considered overall to be satisfactory. Enrolment on the
program reached 85% of the target and the ratio of 65% women to men was 5% higher
than the target. The target of 80% success in the final examinations was also not met,
although the rate increased by 20 percentage points. The 80% pass rate was probably too
ambitious. Increased public sector financing of the program partly explains the progress
made in implementing the program.

The completion rate target of 44% was surpassed reaching 45.8% in 2008. The first set
of textbooks for schools were delivered during implementation, but procurement and
delivery of the second set was seriously delayed and resulted in an extension of the
project closing date. Also, the coverage of the CAPEDs and COGES was limited until
they were expanded following reallocation of project funds in October, 2006. The impact
of these interventions is therefore likely to have been limited.

The data on student achievement in French and Math shows that the indicators fell by
15.5 and 38.4 percentage points respectively during the project period. This is
substantially in reverse of the expected increases. These unexpected results suggest that




                                           41
the data might be too unreliable to be used. It appears that different methodologies were
used for conducting the various tests. As such the results are not comparable.

The targets for both the indicators for the second objective related to budget allocation
and teacher pupil ratio were met.

Output Indicators. With regard to the output indicators, only the revised school
construction target was met by the end of the extended project closing date. Only 75
(30%) of the planned 250 ERAs were constructed. There was also a shortfall in the target
enrollment for literacy programs. Although enrollment in the programs increased by
more than 2.5 times, this was substantially lower than the planned six fold increase.
However, the percentage of women was higher than planned; 72% instead of 65%. The
shortfall in enrollment might have been due to the famine in 2005. The 59.4% pass rate
in literacy exams was well below the target of 80%.

Three of the four targets for quality improvement were either met or surpassed. The
number of CAPEDs working effectively and the number of contractual teachers recruited
were surpassed, while the textbook/pupil ratio of 1:1 was achieved and this is likely to
continue as plans for strengthening the system are implemented. The number of training
days for teachers was not achieved because of scarcity of funds that led to a slow start of
the program.

The institutional development targets related to budget allocation and the numbers of
COGESs were substantially surpassed. In the case of the budget, 72% of the budget was
allocated to primary education well above the 49% target. This could have constrained
allocation of resources to other subsectors.    The increase in the number of school
committees was more positive; it was 2.5 times the target and is a major component for
effective provision of education. Management problems prevented quick disbursement
of funds to school committees for management. Consequently, only 25% of the target
was achieved.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


   A. History and institutional organization of the Basic Education Project (BEP)

The Basic Education Project (BEP) was negotiated and approved in May 2003 and the
credit Agreement (N°3812NIR and Gift N° H080NIR) signed in July 2003. It was agreed
that the Project will use the World Bank procedures and that its implementation would be
mainstreamed within the ministry of Education (MoE). National consultants were hired to
support the MoE staff in the implementation of the Project. The Project amount was
evaluated at 19,623,277,000 F CFA with a counterpart fund of 223,417,609 F CFA.

B. Project objectives and expected results
The project objective were to assist the Borrower to: (a) increase the enrollment and
completion rates of the students in its basic education programs; and b) strengthen the
administrative and managerial capacities of MOE, deconcentrated ministerial branches,
and local civil society groups engaged in the basic education sector.

C. Project components
The project comprises three components with some subcomponents as follows:



   1. Expand access to primary school education through (a) construction and
      equipment of classrooms and other schools facilities; (b) improvement of girls'
      education; (c) development of adult' literacy, particularly women; (d) design and
      creation of a national fund for literacy development.

   2. Improving Quality and Efficiency of Primary and Lower Secondary
      Education through: (a) improving pre-service and in-service primary teacher
      training ; (b) Increasing pedagogical tools and textbooks availability in primary
      and lower secondary education; (c) Innovative Targeted Learning Programs and
      (d) institutionalization of learning achievement evaluation.


   3. Institutional development. (a) Provision of technical advisory services to
      selected staff of MOE; the development of an organigram; and identification of
      existing staffing requirements. (b) Provision to MOE of: training to selected staff
      at central and decentralized level; (c) Strengthening of the human resource
      management, financial management, administrative, planning, and monitoring
      and evaluation capacities of selected MOE staff at central and regional levels; (d)
      Design and implementation of an education management information system for
      the MOE; (e) Strengthening COGES management capacities for human resources
      and financial management, planning, and monitoring and evaluation.




                                          49
D. Assessment of the project objectives and expected results


                     1. The objectives

 The project was designed as a contribution to the Education Sector Program (ESP-
PDDE). It constituted the backbone of the implementation of this ambitious Program.
The project objectives are relevant because they were aligned with all the development
objectives of the ESP and the PRSP.

                     2. Assessment of the institutional arrangement

The option to mainstream project implementation within the MoE was a consensual
agreement. The MoE directorates were in charge of implementation with technical
support from external experts.
Overall, the Government respected its commitment during the design and the
implementation of the project. The National council of Education, and the program M&E
unit, including the Deputy General Secretary, were set up and kept functional. However,
the counterpart fund was not entirely disbursed, only 73% of the total due amount were
released.
Implementation was delayed due to weighty administrative procedures. These
administrative procedures partly led the MoE to conduct two reallocations of the project
funds and an extension of the closing date. The reallocations were also to scale up
successful pilots and to reflect changes in the construction program.
Consequently, the project funds reallocations and the transfer to IDA of more than F.CFA
three hundred million translate the low effectiveness and efficiency in the use of the
project funds.

E. Assessment of the project achievements

Overall, the project achieved its development objectives, both on access to quality basic
education, as well as on institutional development component.
The access component contributed to the ESP with the construction and equipment of
classrooms, activities to stimulate the education demand, particularly for girls', and with
the provision of the adult literacy program. The revised objective of classroom
construction was achieved. As regards education quality improvement, the project
contributed to improve the availability of textbooks and other teaching materials, and to
develop teachers in service training program through the financing of the CAPED13.
Overall, for the institutional development, the project objectives were achieved. The
planned equipments are acquired and the selected staff were trained at the central and

decentralized levels. However the expected transfer of competence from the project
contract employees towards the ministry staffs MEN did not take place.



F. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

Project Preparation: During preparation, the project objectives were clearly stated, as
well as the results and the indicators. The recipients were targeted according to their
specific needs. The formulation of the project was accomplished through a participative
process.
Respect of contractual commitments: the MoE and the World Bank discharged their
commitments as regards to the mobilization of material, human and financial resources.
They applied the main rules and agreements stated in the Grant and Credit Agreements
and in the project manuals.

G. lessons Learned

                3. The project strengths
The project strengths are related to its support for school construction, provision of goods
and services, the MoE staff capacity building.

               4. Weaknesses of the project
The project weaknesses are related to the heaviness of IDA procedures which led to some
delays in the project implementation. Basically, the main weakness of the Project is low
absorption the resources which led to reallocations and F CFA three hundred million (300
000,000 FCFA) transfer to IDA.

· Coordination under the formal Memorandum of Understanding between the MoE and
  donors facilitated the implementation, the joint monitoring, the coherence of
  interventions, and synergy of financial resources.

· The harmonization of procedures for mobilization of fund and management of
  financial resources, while creating the conditions to increase expenditures, also allowed
  a significant increase in the achievement of program results.

· The decision to entrust program management to permanent structures facilitated
  capacity reinforcement of the MoE and program ownership by the various actors. It
  also created favorable conditions to assure the sustainability of interventions.
