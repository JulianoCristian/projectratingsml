improve\n            management at all levels by improving the use of existing\n            resources, focusing on rural areas to achieve greater equity\n            and poverty reduction in the medium to long term.  The\n            Project has three components.  The first, to improve access\n            to primary education will have three subcomponents: support\n            to primary school construction and renovation program in\n            rural areas; improve girl's education; and an adult\n            literacy program.  The second component, to improve the\n            quality and efficiency of primary and lower secondary\n            education,  will have five subcomponents: improve\n            pre-service and in-service teacher training in primary\n            education; improve availability of pedagogical inputs in\n            primary and lower secondary education (textbooks and\n            materials); innovative targeted learning programs for\n            alternative rural schools (pilot) and tutoring programs for\n            under-performing students in targeted areas (pilot); and\n            institutionalize the evaluation of learning outcomes. The\n            third component, to strengthen management capacity of the\n            Ministry of Education (MOE) and empower local entities and\n            communities,  will have four subcomponents: improvements to\n            MOE including strengthening organization and HR capacity;\n            improve and/or develop core management systems; strengthen\n            the capacity of school management committees (COGES);\n            provide support to the preparation of the second block of\n            the ten-year program and other core studies."}, "docdt": "2003-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
