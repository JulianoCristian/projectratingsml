The program objectives are\n            to build and renovate primary schools as well as putting in\n            place water infrastructure and health facilities. The\n            environmental and social impact study shows only minor\n            negative impacts on the physical and social environment of\n            the rural and urban areas. A degradation of sites and\n            quarries is expected as a result of collecting building\n            materials, the destruction of vegetation will occur in\n            school building process and, relative loss of animal\n            biodiversity in these sites. Negative impacts are varied and\n            dispersed in the environment and it will be difficult to\n            measure which part of these negative impacts is due to\n            school building sites and restoration formulas that would be\n            easy to maters and follow up. The negative impacts on the\n            natural resources related to the program and which can be\n            controlled by the program are: the destruction of vegetation\n            on the new school building sites, the pollution of\n            excavations left by quarries especially in the rainy season,\n            erosion in borrowed sites and work sites waste management.\n            Mitigation measures include: tree-planting in school grounds\n            and surroundings and, excavations left by quarries must be\n            filled in before the rainy season to avoid pollution. A\n            detailed technical study of sanitary facilities (school\n            latrines) and compost enclosures for school waste management\n            is recommended."}, "docdt": "2003-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
