However, since\n            building of these infrastructures imply involuntary\n            temporary or permanent displacement of populations,\n            annexation of farming land, and the expropriation of private\n            or community holdings, this Political Resettlement Framework\n            aims to formulate principles for resettlement and\n            compensation, specify which institutional mechanisms and\n            procedures are to be applied. Based on the laws of the Niger\n            as well as the Bank's operational directive on\n            involuntary resettlement, the following recommendations are\n            given: preparation of a socio-economic study; define three\n            eligibility criteria for property and revenue restoration;\n            adopt a consultative approach all along the process with the\n            populations affected; develop an information and\n            communications strategy; and in the event of dispute, define\n            the dispute settlement document, favoring transparency,\n            equity and promptitude of settlement. The report establishes\n            principle and procedures related to populations displacement\n            and compensation, focusing on vulnerable groups, proposed a\n            participatory approach and guarantees the affected\n            populations that they will recover their rights."}, "docdt": "2003-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
