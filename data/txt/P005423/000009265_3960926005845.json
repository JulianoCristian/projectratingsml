The project comprises : (1) provision of leak\n            detection equipment and pipe and valve locating equipment;\n            (2) rehabilitation of existing production facilities and\n            distribution equipment; (3) the acquisition of water meters;\n            and (4) studies to develop and/or update water master plans.\n            It further includes (i) the introduction of new financial\n            policies; (ii) studies of sector organization, cost\n            accounting, managment information systems, and provision of\n            related computer equipment; and (iii) training, technical\n            assistance and the development of an appropriate system to\n            develop and coordinate water resources management."}, "docdt": "1987-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
