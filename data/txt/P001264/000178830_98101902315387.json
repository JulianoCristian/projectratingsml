seeks\n            to reduce Kenya's import dependence in sugar and to\n            promote balanced regional economic growth and employment.\n            The project includes: (a) improvement of outgrower and\n            nucleus estate sugar production; (b) factory rehabilitation\n            and expansion; (c) provision of modest staff housing plus\n            utilities; (d) road upgrading and construction; (e)\n            drainage; (f) irrigation; and (g) research. The project\n            would result in a 109,000 tons per annum increase in sugar\n            production and related decrease in imports by the mid-1980s\n            saving about US$30.0 million net foreign exchange annually;\n            income increases of between 25%-190% for some 10,800\n            smallholder families would result, and incomes to the sugar\n            estates and several hundred large cane producers would also\n            increase. In addition, some 1,000 wage paying opportunities\n            would be created. The project faces some risks in that the\n            incremental cane output could be less than anticipated if\n            the planned organizational improvements in company-outgrower\n            relationships fail to materialize or if yield shortfalls\n            occur due to varying soils and weather conditions.\n            Furthermore, investment in additional sugar production\n            capacity beyond that currently planned could result in a\n            surplus above domestic consumption, which might have to be exported."}, "docdt": "1978-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
