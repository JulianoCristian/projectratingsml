in\n            the Government's development plan for the road network\n            and supports the Bank Group's lending strategy through\n            institution building and by improving road transport for\n            agricultural exports and tourism. In particular, the project\n            is designed to improve several roads, mostly in the coastal\n            plain, which carry high traffic volumes, including a major\n            part of agricultural exports and tourist traffic. The\n            proposed project comprises: (i) construction of two lanes of\n            the uncompleted part (33 km) of Primary Road 36 (RP 36) from\n            Casablanca to Rabat; (ii) improvement of sections, totalling\n            679 km, of 17 primary and secondary roads; (iii) purchase of\n            highway maintenance equipment; (iv) traffic studies in\n            Casablanca and Rabat; (v) the establishment of a\n            transportation planning office in the MPWC; and (vi)\n            detailed engineering of two road sections."}, "docdt": "1973-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
