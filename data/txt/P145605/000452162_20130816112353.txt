﻿LOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
COLOMBIA
ENHANCING FISCAL CAPACITY TO PROMOTE SHARED PROSPERITY
DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
Borrower              Republic of Colombia
Implementing Agency   Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MHCP)
Financing Data        IBRD Loan Amount: US$600 million
Operation Type        Stand-alone single-tranche development policy loan (DPL). Responds
to a request by the Government for additional budget support
resources and pursues a complementary approach among different
Bank instruments, following up on previous operations in the fiscal
and public sector management realms.
Main Policy Areas     In line with the priorities set by the Government, the Enhancing Fiscal
Capacity to Promote Shared Prosperity DPL supports the
implementation of reforms in six main policy areas:
(a) More equitable tax policy and administration
(b) Inter-regional equity and broadening local revenue sources
(c) Equity in social spending
(d) Gender equity
(e) Open access to national financial management information systems
(f) Monitoring of poverty and other social indicators
Key Outcome           By December 2014:
Indicators            (a) A more equitable tax policy and administration:
*  Total direct tax revenues paid by the top 0.4 percent of earners
as percentage of GDP
* Tax revenues from CREE as a percentage of GDP
(b) Improved inter-regional equity and a more equitable decision
making process for regional investment projects:
* Number of projects approved by OCAD and under contract
that correspond to the new General System of Royalties
(c) Better targeting of subsidies to old-age population:
* Share of eligible beneficiaries receiving the Colombia Mayor
Program subsidy
(d) Improved capacity of the government to protect women who are
victims of gender based violence:
* Total budget assigned to finance provision of specific
measures to protect women who are victims of gender violence
as a percentage of the National Current Expenditures
(e) Expanded access and coverage of the national financial
management information to the public:
*  Percentage of the information related to budget execution with
respect to the total amount of the National Budget that is
published in the transparency portal on daily basis.
*  Percentage of the information related to revenue collection
with respect to the total amount of the National Budget that is
I      published in the transparency portal on daily basis.

﻿(f) Improved monitoring of poverty and other social indicators:
* Endorsement of annual release of monetary and
multidimensional poverty indicators and its corresponding
micro-data by the Monetary Poverty Expert Committee and the
Multidimensional Expert Committee
Program Development   To support the Government of Colombia in improving fiscal,
Objective(s) and      territorial, and gender equity through specific actions in targeted
Contribution to CPS   policy areas, while enhancing access to information and accountability
in public spending. This is consistent with the three pillars of the
GoC's National Development Plan "Prosperity for All 2010-2014": (i)
Sustainable Growth and Competitiveness, (ii) Equality of
Opportunities for Social Prosperity, and (iii) Consolidation of Peace.
It is aligned with the World Bank's CPS FY12-16 strategic theme 3:
Inclusive Growth and Enhanced Productivity, by contributing to the
long-term outcome of "Improved Public Sector Management and
Equity and Efficiency of Economic Policies."
Risks and Risk        The overall risk is assessed as low.
Mitigation            Economic risks: low. Colombia's economic performance remains
strong in an uncertain external environment. With softer external
demand, sound policies have supported positive outcomes. Fiscal
consolidation reduced the sovereign risk premium, strengthened the
economy's resilience to external shocks, and enhanced the
countercyclical power of fiscal and monetary policy. Colombia
currently has one of the lowest Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI)
spreads in the region. The appreciation of the Colombian peso remains
a policy concern, as it has grown stronger in response to lower interest
rates and significant capital inflows. At the same time, the flexible
exchange has acted as a shock absorber in times of global economic
crises and uncertainty.
Political and social risk: low. Overall political risk in the country
remains low, partially helped by the Government's stout
Congressional majority. This strong presence is expected to ensure
policy continuity and contribute to the approval of the upcoming
health care and pension reforms.
Implementation risk: low. The choice of a stand-alone, single
tranche DPL operation reflects two main objectives. First, it pursues a
complementary approach among different Bank instruments. Also, it
recognizes and supports the ongoing reforms while mitigating the risk
of a programmatic approach under the current political calendar in the
country. Tax evasion is the main risk in implementing IMAN. The
approved reform mitigates this by changing the direction of guilt
charges: taxpayers must now prove they have not evaded taxes.
Moreover, the GoC has incorporated into its tax revenue projections a
tax evasion of 20%. Regarding CREE, the vulnerability of revenues in
terms of the economic cycle represents a risk area, which can be
mitigated by the government's stabilization funds to compensate for
I missing revenues to secure resources for ICBF and SENA.

﻿IBRD PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A PROPOSED
ENHANCING FISCAL CAPACITY TO PROMOTE SHARED PROSPERITY
DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
TO COLOMBIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1. Despite strong macroeconomic performance, significant reductions in poverty, and
improvements in social indicators over the past decade, the level of income inequality
in Colombia remains high. Between 2002 and 2012, moderate poverty based on monthly
income fell from 49.7 to 32.7 percent, while extreme poverty declined from 17.7 to 10.4
percent. In spite of this progress, the rate of poverty reduction in Colombia remains
constrained by high inequality and is relatively unresponsive to growth, falling below that
of such regional peers as Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. Colombia's unequal distribution
of income is reflected by a Gini coefficient that is higher than the Latin America and
Caribbean (LAC) regional average and among the 10 highest in the world.
2. In addition, Colombia's overall fiscal system    (tax and transfers) shows a limited
redistributive capacity, even compared to LAC countries. For example, Colombia and
Brazil start from an almost identical level of inequality (0.575 and 0.574, respectively), as
measured by market income (Figure 1).1 After applying the current tax and transfers
structure, however, Brazil's Gini coefficient is considerably lower. Indeed, once direct and
indirect taxes and transfers and subsidies are taken into account-the Gini coefficient of
the so-called post-fiscal income-is 0.569 for Colombia and 0.541 for Brazil.2 If cash and
in-kind transfers through public spending are considered, the difference is striking, with
the final income Gini at 0.535 for Colombia and 0.438 for Brazil. These results suggest
that the potential for fiscal redistribution in Colombia remains largely untapped.
3. In response, the Government of Colombia (GoC) has made reducing inequality a top
priority, turning its attention to understanding how reforms, policies, and
institutions affect social outcomes, particularly equity. This emphasis is reflected in the
strategies and goals of the GoC National Development Plan (Plan Nacional de
Desarrollo, PND) "Prosperity for All 2010-2014" (Prosperidadpara Todos 2010-2014).
The three objectives of the PND are (i) Sustainable Growth and Competitiveness, (ii)
Equality of Opportunities for Social Prosperity, and (iii) Consolidation of Peace.
Market income refers to wages and salaries, income from capital, private transfers; before government taxes, social security
contributions and transfers. For details on the methodology, see Lustig, N., C. Hurtado and M. Mel6ndez, 2013, "Gasto
Social, Impuestos y Redistribuci6n del Ingreso en Colombia - Commitment to Equity Assessment (CEQ)", Draft.
2 Subtracting direct taxes and employee contributions to social security from market income gives net income. Adding direct
transfers results in disposable income; once indirect subsidies have been added and indirect transfers subtracted, the result is
Post Fiscal Income.

Note: Market income refers to wages and salaries, income from capital, private transfers; before govemment
taxes, social security contributions and transfers. Subtracting direct taxes and employee contributions to social
security from market income gives net market income. Adding direct transfers results in disposable income; once
indirect subsidies have been added and indirect transfers subtracted, the result is post fiscal Income. Adding cash
and in-kind transfers results in final income.
4. The    proposed   Enhancing    Fiscal Capacity     to  Promote    Shared   Prosperity
development policy loan (DPL) (USD 600 million) supports reforms that aim to
reinforce the recent gains in reducing income inequality and to improve overall
equity in several key dimensions. The proposed single-tranche DPL supports reforms in
three main pillars:
*   Improving equity in the tax structure and regional equity through the reform of the
royalties system;
*   Better targeting of social spending, including life-cycle equity --through policies to
reduce poverty among the elderly-- and gender equity through the strengthening of the
government's capacity to protect women from gender-based violence, and;
*   Improvements in    cross cutting policies that support transparency, quality   of
information, and accountability in the execution of the public budget, as well as public
reporting of poverty and social welfare outcomes.
5. The technical analysis has shown that the reforms are likely to have a positive impact
on equity. Analytical work was carried out as part of the programmatic knowledge
engagement with GoC and the Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) for this
operation. It has found that the implementation of the reforms will reduce income
5


﻿inequality after taxes and transfers, enhance the redistributive capacity of the system,
increase the speed of regional convergence within the country, and reduce poverty among
the elderly. In addition, the reforms will improve the efficiency and transparency of
budget management and administration, strengthening conditions for transparency and
accountability, and will support better monitoring of achievements in the social sectors.
By reducing the cost of formalization in the productive sector, the reform is likely to have
an effect on formal employment and wages. Finally, the reforms will strengthen the
framework to protect women from gender-based violence.
6. The operation is fully consistent with the World Bank's goals to end extreme poverty
and promote shared prosperity. While economic growth is important for increasing
welfare, equity-driven policies, such as the ones supported by this operation, enhance a
society's capacity to grow in a sustained and inclusive manner. Enabling marginalized
people and regions to improve their conditions will unleash their economic potential,
increasing overall productivity and spurring growth.
7. The choice of a stand-alone, single-tranche DPL operation reflects two main
objectives. First, it pursues a complementary approach among different Bank instruments,
following up on previous operations in the fiscal and public sector management realms,
while building on the analytical and technical support work performed through the
programmatic knowledge engagement services and other instruments (see Table 1). Also,
it recognizes and supports the country's ongoing reforms, while mitigating the risk of a
programmatic approach under the current political calendar in the country.

﻿II. COUNTRY CONTEXT
A. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN COLOMBIA
Recent Economic Developments
8. Over the last years, the GoC has moved forward on structural reforms toward the
achievement of macroeconomic stability and social progress. It has adopted structural
fiscal reforms to improve macroeconomic management (the Fiscal Responsibility Law,
the Fiscal Rule, and a Comprehensive Tax Reform) as well as a series of landmark laws,
such as the Victims and Land Restitution Law of June 2011, which provides for monetary
compensation and restitution of land to the victims of the armed conflict. Following this
positive reform track, Colombia has been officially invited by the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to open membership talks; a three-year
process of negotiations and further reforms are expected.
9. Colombia has shown strong economic performance and resilience to global shocks in
recent years, due to a combination of favorable external environment and sound
policy management. A relatively low trade openness and limited inclusion in global
financial markets limited Colombia exposure to shocks. The country's strong
macroeconomic framework, combined with a robust financial sector and appropriate
regulatory responses, helped the economy by creating a cushion against external shocks
and paved the way to economic expansion. Benefiting from high commodity prices, the
economy recovered from the 2008-09 global economic crisis after only two quarters,
much faster than the regional average of six quarters.3
10. Although growth slowed from 6.6 percent in 2011 to 4.0 in 2012, it remains strong,
above the regional average (3.6 percent), and close to the global emerging markets rate
(5.5 percent).4 The deceleration of 2012 was the combined result of a weak external
demand (lower commodity prices), unforeseen supply shocks (disruptions in coal
production), slow execution of public investment, and drop in manufacturing and retail
sales. In 2013, growth is expected to remain similar to 2012, helped by the Government's
new investment program and expansionary monetary policy. An unfavorable external
environment, structural bottlenecks and labor unrest are among the factors that will
prevent a higher growth rate in the near term.
11. The Central Bank has appropriately maintained a loose monetary policy in response
to lower-than-potential GDP. Since August 2012, the interest rate has been reduced by
200 basis points, reaching 3.25 percent in April 2013. This process followed a period of
tightening policy in which the monetary authorities had gradually raised the rate (by 225
basis points since early 2011) to reduce the risk of overheating. Inflation reached the
lower bound of the target band (2 percent) in May and increased slightly to 2.2 percent in
June 2013; future interest rate cuts are not expected in the short run.
12. In 2012, Colombia exhibited a strong fiscal performance, due in part to the increased
tax revenues generated by the recent tax reforms and favorable oil prices. The

﻿combined public sector deficit dropped from -2 percent in 2011 to 0.3 percent in 2012,
while the primary balance increased from 0.8 percent to 2.9 percent of GDP in the same
years. This, in turn, contributed to a decline in the public debt ratio from 36.0 to 32.7
percent of GDP.5 The key driver was a strong increase in the central Government's tax-to-
6
GDP ratio, which rose by one percentage point, reaching 14.5 percent in 2012.
13. The exports and imports boom at the end of 2011 widened the current account
deficit, but the balance of payments, backed by net FDI inflows, remains strong. The
strong demand for investment-related imports and large profit repatriation by foreign
firms was more than offset by net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, keeping the
current external account slightly above 2011 levels. Gross FDI flows-most of which
originated in the oil and mining sector-increased by more than 10 percent in 2012, to
US$15 billion (4 percent of GDP), and will probably sustain Colombia's share of global
FDI, at 0.8 percent.
14. The peso's appreciation cycle seemed to have halted and nominal values are close to
their levels one year ago. While in recent years the Colombian peso (nominal as well as
the real effective rate) has grown gradually stronger in response to significant capital
inflows (primarily FDI) and increases in government spending, amidst high volatility, the
peso has gradually depreciated to an average of COP 1907 per US dollar in June 2013-
about the same as in early 2012. The nominal depreciation has been partially driven by
lower interest rates and continued currency purchases by the Central Bank. At the same
time, the flexible exchange rate has exhibited substantial volatility, acting as a shock
absorber in times of global economic crises and uncertainty.
15. In sum, Colombia's economic performance remains robust amid an uncertain
external environment. Given the softer external demand, sound policies have supported
positive outcomes. Fiscal consolidation reduced the sovereign risk premium, strengthened
the economy's resilience to external shocks, and enhanced the countercyclical power of
fiscal and monetary policy. Colombia currently has one of the lowest Emerging Market
Bond Index (EMBI) spreads in the region. The country also exhibits solid liquidity
management, as evidenced by rapid reserve accumulation, and has tapped international
markets for external financing at favorable terms.

﻿B. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
16. Colombia has a robust macroeconomic framework, which rests on three mutually re-
enforcing pillars: (i) a responsible fiscal policy based on a credible medium-term fiscal
framework, supported by the new Fiscal Rule, (ii) a monetary policy based on an
inflation-targeting regime complemented by a floating exchange rate with moderate
interventions, and (iii) sound macro and micro prudential policies combined with a robust
financial system. This framework provides a solid basis for the country's economic
prospects. In the short to medium term, aggregate demand is likely to be boosted by
consumer and investor confidence, infrastructure investments, and the implementation of
the Free Trade Agreement with the US.
17. Colombia would not be immune to a new global slowdown, but the economy is well
prepared to respond. Although the global economic environment has improved slightly,
international growth prospects for 2013 remain subdued and market uncertainty continues
to be high. Colombia is vulnerable to three types of external shocks: a slowdown in
economic activity in the US, a strong decline in oil prices, and reversal in investment
flows. However, the country has good capacity and room to respond to shocks through
countercyclical fiscal and monetary policies.
18. Projections for the short- and medium-term outlook incorporate the latest prospects
for the global economy as well as recent Central Bank monetary and exchange rate
policy announcements. Given the global context, domestic economic policy is expected
to be loose on both the monetary and fiscal sides. After a long expansionary period,
monetary policy is expected to remain unchanged for the next months at a rate of 3.25
percent, while fiscal policy is likely to stay flexible as the country moves closer to the
targeted structural fiscal balance. In this baseline scenario, the Colombian economy is
expected to develop as shown in Table 2.
*  Growth and inflation. Economic performance is expected to remain slower in 2013
at around 4 percent and pick up gradually, converging to its potential growth rate of
4.5 percent in the medium term. On the demand side, rising household income, private
consumption, and investment are expected to sustain domestic demand growth. On the
supply side, oil and mining activity is projected to pick up, followed by a recovery in
the coffee sector. In one of the lowest inflation periods in recent history, price
increases will stay in the target range of 2-4 percent over the projection period, kept in
check by interventions from the Central Bank.
*  Fiscal accounts. The central Government's fiscal deficit is projected to remain at 2.4
percent of GDP in 2013, declining slightly to 1.7 percent in 2016. These fiscal
projections reflect the expected decline in tax revenue ratios generated by the
scheduled phase-out of the financial transaction tax and wealth tax, starting in 2014.
For the central Government to meet its structural deficit target of 2.3 percent of GDP
by 2014-as stipulated by the Fiscal Rule-this revenue decline must be offset by
lower capital spending. A comprehensive tax reform was also approved by Congress
as part of the Government's efforts to offset the decline in revenues. The reform,
supported by this DPL, is intended to raise formal employment and improve fairness
in the tax system with the expectation that this will contribute to raise revenue.

*   External accounts. The external current account deficit widened marginally after the
2011 export and imports boom, pushed by an increase in private investment and factor
income outflows. In the medium term, the external deficit will gradually narrow again
as imports moderate and commodity exports continue to benefit from solid
international prices and higher volumes of trade. The deficit is expected to be fully
financed through continued high inflows of net FDI.

﻿19. The debt sustainability analysis indicates that the trajectory of public debt is
declining in the baseline scenario. This analysis is consistent with the macroeconomic
assumptions outlined in Table 1 (see Annex 3 for details). In the baseline scenario, the
combined public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline from 32.4 percent of the gross
combined public sector debt in 2013 to 27 percent in 2017. Because a large share of
central Government debt is in local currency and on fixed terms, shocks to the interest and
exchange rates have only a modest impact on the debt trajectory. At the same time, the
debt outlook is not severely affected by shocks to economic growth or the primary
balance. Contingent fiscal liabilities represent the single most important risk to debt
sustainability, although the simulated shock of an increase of 10 percent of GDP does not
alter the declining debt trajectory. Thus, public debt sustainability is not a major concern
in the medium term.
20. In summary, Colombia's macroeconomic policy stance is deemed adequate.
Medium-term fiscal policy remains prudent, with proposed fiscal adjustments already well
underway. Monetary and exchange rate policies are also supportive of macroeconomic
and financial stability, though downside risks remain significant.
C. POVERTY, INEQUALITY, AND SHARED PROSPERITY
21. During the last decade, economic growth in Colombia has been accompanied by a
decline in poverty. Between 2002 and 2012, moderate poverty fell from 49.4 to 32.7
percent, while extreme poverty declined from 17.6 to 10.4 percent (Table 3). Even so,
given the country's economic performance, the rate of poverty reduction is slower than
that of regional peers. The fact that poverty levels remain relatively high-given the
country's per capita income -is partly explained by Colombia's unequal distribution of
income.

22. Between 2005 and 2010, poverty reduction in Colombia was the result of economic
growth, with a relatively lower contribution through redistribution. By contrast, in
the LAC region as a whole, in the same period, falling inequality was responsible for
about 40 percent of countries' poverty reduction, on average. For Colombia, the trend
changed after the reduction in inequality that took place between 2010 and 2012 (see
Table 3).

for the Colombia Equity Assessment.

﻿23. Colombia's less well-off people have benefitted more from growth than the average
person. From 2010 to 2011, real income per capita of the bottom 40 percent-the World
Bank's indicator of shared prosperity-grew at 8.1 percent, while the mean growth rate
was 3.3 percent. Moreover, from 2003 to 2011 the annual growth rate of the income of the
bottom 40 percent in Colombia was 5.1 percent, higher than LAC's 4.8 percent.
24. Colombia is performing well, relative to LAC, in terms of convergence to the world
top performers in Sen's welfare index -- a measure of society's overall welfare. This
indicator of convergence, also known as the Shared Prosperity Convergence Index
(SPCI),9 shows that, while LAC as a region has performed below par in terms of
convergence, in the past year Colombia converged at a faster rate (a 7.3 percent
improvement on the index with respect to LAC's average of 4.3 percent).10 Colombia's
faster pace of SPCI can be attributed to its higher rates of economic growth and recent
reduction in income inequality.
25. However, income distribution in the country remains among the most unequal in the
world. The country's Gini coefficient is well above LAC's regional average and among
the 10 highest in the world; and in comparison to regional and upper-middle-income
countries, Colombia ranks second-highest. Such high inequality limits the effect of growth
on poverty reduction (growth elasticity of poverty). Despite the strong growth during the
decade, the share of total income belonging to the lowest decile in the country continues
to be around 1 percent of total income, while well over 40 percent of total income is
concentrated in the top decile. However, the Gini coefficient has started to decrease in the
last two years, as Table 3 shows.
26. Among the different income sources, labor income distribution remains highly
unequal. The persistence of household income inequality in Colombia is largely
explained by the persistence in labor income inequality, which in turn reflects labor
market rigidities and an unequal distribution of skills, particularly educational ones. While
the dispersion in returns to education fell between 2002 and 2011, the lack of skills among
the poor increased in terms of its effects on inequality (Azevedo et al. 2012). Public
transfers have played a role in reducing poverty and inequality over the last decade, but
they are relatively small compared to the role of labor income.
27. Although better economic conditions and demographics have increased labor market
participation by more than a half-million people, Colombia's unemployment rate-
at 10.4% in 2012-is still one of the highest in the region." With this high
unemployment, Colombian labor markets continue to be characterized by pervasive labor
informality, which accounts for 50-60 percent of the labor force, depending on the
definition used.12 For the extremely poor, income-generation opportunities are very
limited, and their unemployment rate is close to 35 percent. When extremely poor people
do work, their jobs tend to be in the low-productivity informal sector, with low probability
9 The Sen's welfare index is calculated as the product of GDP per capita, and the difference between 1 and the country's Gini
coefficient. The Shared Prosperity Convergence Index (SPCI) is the gap of Sen's welfare index of a country with respect to
the best performers in this index in the year 2000 (the 10 countries in the world with the highest Sen's welfare index).

﻿of moving into better jobs.13 In addition, gender inequalities in the labor markets
contribute not only to inequality, but also to further labor market rigidities.14 High
minimum wages and labor costs, misperceptions about social security benefits, skill
mismatches between labor supply and demand, and weak labor intermediation systems
help explain these poor labor market outcomes. 15
28. The redistributive capacity of the Colombian system of taxes and social transfers can
be improved. In particular, the effect of social transfers in Colombia, when netted out of
the tax system shows a weak effect on income inequality. For example, in Figure 3, social
programs on the right-hand side are only relatively progressive (compared to initial
distribution) (including indirect subsidies, spending on tertiary education, and indirect
taxes), while the social programs on the left-hand side are progressive in absolute terms
(such as the conditional cash transfer Familias en Accion, subsidies to the elderly Adulto
Mayor, now Colombia Mayor, and spending on health and elementary education 6).

29. Vulnerability to poverty remains an important issue, notwithstanding recent years'
progress in poverty reduction (World Bank 2012). Estimates of income mobility for the
1992-2008 period suggest that in Colombia only one out of every 50 households that were
able to climb out of poverty ($4/day PPP) in 1992 had also been able to cross the middle-
class threshold of $10/day PPP in 2008. Thus a sizable segment of the population is still at
risk of falling back into poverty.

14 The ratio between female and male labor force participation was 0.54 in 2006, lower than the average for lower-middle-
income countries (World Bank Gender Stats indicators, http://www.worldbank.org/gender; Data and Statistics).
15 See World Bank, 2005. "Spending Wisely - Buying Health Services for the Poor", Washington D.C.; World Bank, 2009;
and World Bank, 2010.
16 This does not, however, reflect quality issues in access to basic services.
15


﻿30. A large degree of regional inequality still persists in Colombia. Differences in GDP
per capita across Colombian Departamentos and regions have traditionally been high and
fairly persistent. GDP per capita in the richest state in 2000 was 4.95 times that of the
lowest, and in 2011 this ratio was 5.48.    According to data for Colombia's main 13
metropolitan areas for which the GEIH household survey is statistically significant,
poverty levels are also far from being uniform across the country. In 2012 the
metropolitan areas with the highest moderate poverty were Monteria (36.9%) and Pasto
(36.8%), and those with the lowest were Bucaramanga (10.4%) and Bogota (11.6%).
31. Poverty among the elderly in Colombia is high. According to a recent press release by
Colombia's National Bureau of Statistics (DANE),18 in 2012 the incidence of moderate
poverty among households headed by a senior citizen (older than 65 years old) was
27.6%, but in rural areas it was much higher (42.7%).
32. Although progress has been made in gender equality, important challenges remain.
As in most countries in the region, education gender gaps in Colombia have closed and
are even reversing. In 2011, enrollment rates for girls were slightly lower than those of
boys at the basic level (86.6 vs. 87.5 percent, net percentage), but they were higher at the
secondary (78.7 vs. 73.3 percent) and tertiary levels (44.9 vs. 41.0 percent).19
33. Maternal mortality and other health indicators for women have improved, although
differences persist, including in terms of access to health care. The Government has
promoted an active policy on sexual and reproductive health; and over the last decade,
maternal mortality and mortality due to ovarian cancer have decreased, while a significant
improvement has been reported in prenatal care and delivery. Progress is still lagging on
other health targets, however. In particular, teenage pregnancy has worsened in the last
two decades: in 2010, 19.5 percent of girls between 15 and 19 years of age reported being
20
or having been pregnant.
34. While the female labor market participation in Colombia has increased, women still
face lower wages and higher unemployment rates than men. The female labor
participation rate grew from 51.5 percent in 2000 to 59.4 percent in 2011, but it still lies
well below men's (at 82.1 percent in 2011).21 Although the wage gap has diminished
some-mainly because of the increase in women's level of education-women who work
the same number of hours and who have the same levels of education as men continue to
earn less (Pefia et al. 2013).
35. Domestic and gender-based violence remains high in the country. In 2010, of 51,000
reported cases of partner abuse, in 88 percent the woman was victimized.22 According to
1 GDP per capita in real COP of 2005. For 2000, the richest Departamento was Bogota DC, with COP 11.5m per capita,
and the poorest was Choco, with COP 2.3m per capita (both Casanare and Arauca were omitted because of their unusually
high oil revenues in 2000). In 2011, the richest Departamento was Bogota DC, with COP 15.7m per capita, and the poorest
was Vaupes, with COP 2.9m per capita.

﻿the Encuesta Nacional de Demografta y Salud 2010 (Demographic and Health Survey), 23
65 percent of Colombian women reported that their husband or partner tried to exert some
form of control over them. The proportion of women who reported experiencing physical
violence at the hands of their spouse or partner decreased slightly, from 39 percent in
2005 to 37 percent in 2010. However, underreporting is frequent: according to the survey,
73 percent of the women who experienced physical violence never reported the violence
or sought help of any kind.
36. The armed conflict has also had serious consequences for women and girls. Close to
83 percent of persons displaced as a result of the conflict are women and children, and
24
female-headed households make up 43 percent of displaced families. Acts of sexual
violence have frequently been committed by armed forces, paramilitaries, or members of
the guerrilla forces. Trafficking in women for sexual purposes and sex tourism remain
problems, particularly in coastal cities. Colombia is a major source country for women
and girls subjected to sex trafficking in Latin America, the Caribbean, Western Europe,
Asia, and North America, including the United States, as well as a transit and destination
country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor.25
III. THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND BANK SUPPORT
37. During the last year the Government of Colombia has carried out a comprehensive
set of reforms in order to achieve the goals in its development plan "Prosperity for
All, 2010-2014." Overall, the reform program has improved fiscal, territorial, and gender
equity through specific actions in targeted policy areas, while enhancing access to
information and accountability in public spending. The program includes a series of
measures that can be grouped in three main pillars: (a) improving equity in the tax
structure and regional equity through the reform of the royalties system; (b) better
targeting of social spending, including life-cycle equity and gender equity through the
strengthening of the government's capacity to protect women from gender-based violence,
and; (c) Improvements in cross cutting policies that support transparency, quality of
information, and accountability in the execution of the public budget, as well as public
reporting of poverty and social welfare outcomes.
A. LINK TO COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
38. The proposed DPL is aligned with the World Bank's Colombia CPS FY12-16
(Report No. 60620-CO, discussed by the Board of Executive Directors on July 21,
2011), specifically strategic theme 3: Inclusive Growth and Enhanced Productivity,
by contributing to the long-term outcome of "Improved Public Sector Management
and Equity and Efficiency of Economic Policies." The objective is to support the GoC
in improving fiscal, territorial, and gender equity through specific actions in targeted
policy areas, while enhancing access to information and accountability in public spending.
This is consistent with the three pillars of the GoC's National Development Plan: (i)

﻿Sustainable Growth and Competitiveness, (ii) Equality of Opportunities for Social
Prosperity, and (iii) Consolidation of Peace.
B. CONSULTATIONS
39. Government's program has included a complex process of consultations and
negotiation. In addition to the participatory measures associated with the National
Development Plan "Prosperity for All, 2010-2014," all Prior Actions were subject to
consultations which in some cases spanned more than two years since the first
conversations with various stakeholders. The GoC has relied on several processes to reach
agreement on the reforms supported by this DPL. In the case of the tax reform, the MHCP
conducted over 110 meetings with a broad range of stakeholders: unions, chambers of
commerce, other private sector associations, social sectors, and academia. The DNP led
the reform process of the General System of Royalties which trained over 8,700 entity
officials at the municipal and departmental level and included 630 training sessions,
workshops, and consultations with internal control agencies, universities, civil society,
and within the 32 Departamentos. The consultation process for gender equity reforms
lasted nearly two years and involved detailed discussions among experts, including
international donors and women's rights organizations throughout the country, concluding
with DNP's publication of the CONPES Social 161 on gender equity on March 12, 2013.
The process for implementation of SIIF II included trainings on how to use the new SIIF
II system, press conferences, and an advertising campaign to promote the system
internally and externally. Finally, the effort to improve public reporting and transparency
of poverty and social indicators began with the launch of an inter-institutional committee
of poverty experts (MESEP) in 2009.26 The committee met 45 times and has produced 35
technical briefs, jointly prepared by DNP and DANE's technical secretariat leading to the
publication of official methodologies and institutional arrangements to measure poverty in
27
Colombia and the launch of the new poverty committee in 2012.
C. COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS
40. The Bank's country team has collaborated very closely with the IMF, notably on the
review of macroeconomic developments, including fiscal projections and the analysis of
debt sustainability. Overall, the proposed DPL program is consistent with IMF policy
advice. The two institutions have worked closely together in areas related to the DPL
program, including revenue administration improvement and public financial management
(including debt management). The IMF and the Bank have also been advising the
Government on tax policy reform and customs administration. Within the World Bank
Group, the DPL team has coordinated closely with the IFC on areas related to the equity
and efficiency of the tax system. In particular, the IFC has initiated a program with the
Tax and Customs Revenue Authority (DIAN) on tax simplification, performance
indicators, and compliance costs, which complements the tax reform efforts. No other
main donor, such as the IADB or CAF, is currently supporting any of the main policy
areas of this operation.

participants from DNP, UN-ECLAC, the World Bank, as well as Colombian academics and independent experts.
27 Consisting of DANE as the producer of the indicators, DNP as the responsible for replicating the calculations;
and the Ministry of Social Protection as the responsible for designing Colombia's poverty reduction strategy.
18


﻿D. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS
41. The proposed DPL complements the Bank's substantial partnership with the GoC
on fiscal and public sector management. As Table 1 showed, the proposed DPL is part
of a strategic, programmatic, and multi-sectoral engagement that includes lending
operations, knowledge products, and technical assistance:
*  The tax reform formulation and discussions were supported by a series of tax studies
carried out under the Fiscal and Growth PKS (P124256).
*  The Colombia Subnational Institutional Strengthening investment loan (P123879),
currently under preparation for $70 million, will support increased public service
delivery at the subnational level in the areas of tax administration, public expenditure,
procurement, human resources, monitoring and evaluation, and transparency and
social participation. The proposed DPL complements this investment loan by
supporting policy reforms in strengthening subnational performance in core public
management areas and utilizing the national financial management system, Sistema
Integrado de Informaci6n Financiera, or SIIF (Consolidation of Public Management
Information Systems, P106628).
*  Since July 2011 the Bank has provided a programmatic series of DPLs supporting
Colombia's fiscal reforms, totaling $500 million. The proposed DPL builds on the
programmatic series in the tax reforms it would support.
The focus has been on using the range of Bank instruments to clarify where the needs lie
and to build collective synergies and deliver knowledge and financial services to match
Colombia's ongoing development agenda.
E. LESSONS LEARNED
42. The design of the proposed operation takes into account the lessons learned from the
Bank's program with Colombia and the Bank's experience with other middle-
income countries. The most important lessons include the following:
*  Operations should be backed by solid analytical work. Analytical work and
evidence-based policy design constitute solid back-up for the proposed operation.
*  Operations should be focused and avoid large and complex policy program.
Rather than seeking to cover an extensive list of measures, this DPL concentrates on
the key elements of the Government's tax and royalties reforms from an equity
perspective with key policy areas in the program.
*  It is important to take into account the political economy of reform. In designing a
policy-based operation, political factors and the legislative needs of the country need
to be well understood and included in the dialogue with the client. Lessons from
previous DPLs suggest caution in including legislative measures (particularly
Constitutional reforms) that, although approved by Congress, may face subsequent
legal challenges. The proposed DPL focuses exclusively on administrative measures
that are fully under the control of the Executive.
19


﻿F. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS
43. The proposed DPL builds on previous analytical and technical assistance work, and
particularly on the outcomes of the Colombia Equity Day that the World Bank
organized in March 2013. This event consisted of a full day of discussion on equity
challenges in Colombia with academics, international experts, and policymakers at the
highest level.
44. The analytical framework used in this operation is based on the key notion that
growth and equity are needed to sustain a robust process of shared prosperity. While
economic growth is important for increasing welfare, equity-driven policies enhance the
capacity to grow in a sustained manner. Enabling marginalized people to improve their
condition can unleash their economic potential, increasing overall productivity and
spurring growth. In such a shared prosperity framework, policies can enhance the capacity
of the system through four main channels: (a) maintaining an equitable, efficient, and
sustainable fiscal policy; (b) strengthening fair, transparent institutions that deliver quality
public goods; (c) enabling an environment of well-functioning and accessible markets;
and (d) developing instruments to improve risk management at the macro and household
levels. These channels reinforce each other, forming a virtuous cycle (see Figure 5).

45. It is important to say that equity, in this framework, entails a comprehensive
outcome: citizens must have equal access to opportunities, be able to live in dignity, and
have the autonomy and voice to participate fully in their communities and decide on life
plans they have reasons to value. Within this comprehensive framework, the process to
achieve that outcome is also seen as part of the equity agenda.
20


﻿IV. THE PROPOSED ENHANCING FISCAL CAPACITY TO PROMOTE SHARED
PROSPERITY DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION
A. OPERATION DESCRIPTION
46. The proposed single-tranche DPL supports reforms that address several issues
related to equity. Reforms can be classified in three main levels:
*  Improving horizontal equity in the tax structure and inter-regional equity through the
reform of the royalties system;
*  Better targeting of social spending, including life-cycle equity-through policies to
reduce poverty among the elderly-and gender equity through the strengthening of the
government's capacity to protect women from gender-based violence, and;
*  Improvements in cross cutting policies that support transparency, quality of
information, and accountability in the execution of the public budget, as well as public
reporting of poverty and social welfare outcomes.
This section describes the six policy areas that correspond to these issues; the complete
policy matrix is presented in Annex 1. Analysis has shown that the Government reforms
in these areas will increase equity and contribute to growth, as they are intended to do (see
Annex 5).
B. POLICY AREAS
Policy Area I. More equitable tax policy and administration
Prior Action 1: The GoC has improved the progressivity of its tax system by: (i) establishing an
alternative income tax; (ii) introducing a luxury tax; and (iii) simplifying the value-added tax, as
evidenced by the issuance of the Borrower's Law No. 1607, dated December 26, 2012, duly
published in the Borrower's Official Gazette on December 26, 2012.
Prior Action 2: The GoC has reduced the cost of formal employment creation by: (i) reducing
firms' payroll contribution for employees with salaries below ten minimum monthly wages; and
(ii) creating a new tax on corporate profits, as evidenced by the issuance of the Borrower's Law
No. 1607, dated December 26, 2012, duly published in the Borrower's Official Gazette on
December 26, 2012.
47. Notwithstanding recent successful reforms, the equity and efficiency of the
Colombian tax system are impaired by structural weaknesses. The tax system that
prevailed until 2012 upheld an uneven distribution of the tax burden among taxpayers
through differentiated tax rates and a substantial number of special preferential treatments
favoring certain economic sectors-not always supported by a solid economic or
administrative rationale.
48. On December 2012, Congress approved a comprehensive tax reform designed to
improve equity and efficiency, promote hiring in the formal sector, and simplify the
21


﻿tax system to promote voluntary compliance.28 Law No. 1607 introduced revenue-
neutral reforms to the corporate and personal income taxes, payroll taxes, value-added tax
(VAT), and other aspects of the tax system with a twofold objective: promote vertical and
horizontal equity across taxpayers, and foster formal labor employment. The tax reform
also incorporates measures to strengthen tax administration powers and curb tax evasion
and evasion. The introduction of this tax reform continues the ambitious fiscal reform
program launched by the Government since it assumed office in August 2010.
49. The law introduced the following changes:
*  A new alternative income tax (Impuesto Minimo Alternativo Nacional, IMAN) is
now applied to improve progressivity in the personal income tax structure. As a
result, the top 0.4 percent of the income distribution will face higher tax liabilities than
under the previous system, while the remaining 99.6 percent of taxpayers are expected
to experience a slight decrease in their tax bill. According to Bank estimates, the
IMAN will contribute to greater equity, reducing the Gini coefficient of income
earners from 0.57 to 0.55.
*   The VAT structure was streamlined to reduce administrative and compliance
costs, and a new luxury tax introduced progressivity into the consumption tax
system. The reforms are designed to be revenue-neutral, so it is expected that VAT
revenue will remain unchanged.
*  Payroll taxes were reduced to alleviate the tax burden on the labor sector and
provide incentives for corporations to increase hiring. According to the GoC, this
reduction could create between 400,000 and 1 million new jobs in the formal sector.
*  A new corporate tax was introduced (Impuesto sobre la Renta para la Equidad,
CREE) to shift the income tax burden from labor to capital. Revenues will be used
to finance programs at the National Training Institute (Servicio Nacional de
Aprendizaje, SENA), the National Welfare Institute (Instituto Colombiano de
Bienestar Familiar, ICBF), and the health system. The CREE also shifts the burden of
financing these so-called parafiscales from companies in labor-intensive industries to
those in highly profitable and capital-intensive industries (such as oil and gas).29
28 Additional revenue from the tax reform is expected to be negligible. The reform can be defined as a structural reform as it
affects the tax system as a whole, while previous tax reforms focused on specific issues or elements of the tax system (see
Annex 3 for details).
29 At the same time, the general corporate income tax rate was reduced from 33 to 25 percent, to promote investment and
formal sector employment.

﻿Policy Area II. Inter-regional equity and broadening local revenue sources
Prior Action 3: The GoC has redesigned the General System of Royalties by mandating that all
regional investment projects are approved and supervised by the 6rganos Colegiados de
Administracion y Decision, as evidenced by: (i) the issuance of the Borrower's Law No. 1530,
dated May 17, 2012, duly published in the Borrower's Official Gazette on May 17, 2012; (ii) the
issuance of the Borrower's Decree No. 1075, dated May 22, 2012, duly published in the
Borrower's Official Gazette on May 22, 2012; and (iii) the issuance of the Borrower's Decree No.
1949, dated September 19, 2012, duly published in the Borrower's Official Gazette on September
19. 2012.
50. Colombia's subnational governments (SNGs) collectively account for a large share of
public spending, reaching 8.1 percent of GDP in 2011.30 Municipalities and departments
raise 3 percent of GDP in tax revenues, with the remainder provided by the General
Participation System (Sistema General de Participaciones), central Government transfer
arrangements, and other funding sources such as non-tax revenues and royalties on natural
resources.31
51. Recognizing the critical importance of improving SNGs' access to resources and
strengthening their capacity to provide basic services, the Government is adopting a
new decentralization approach. The GoC has redesigned the General System of
Royalties by mandating that all regional investment projects be approved and supervised
by the OCADs, which comprise representatives from the national and subnational
governments. The focus is on providing resources to SNGs while building capacity,
strengthening central Government monitoring and assistance to SNGs, and increasing
effective demand for SNG performance at the local level. As part of the royalties reform,
two funds have been established.
*   The Regional Development Fund aims to enhance competitiveness in the economy
and promote the social, economic, institutional, and environmental development of
the territorial entities by financing investment projects of regional impact, to be
agreed upon by the National Government and the regional entities in the
framework of partnership schemes.
* The Regional Compensation Fund will finance development projects of regional
and local impact in the poorest regions of the country.
52. To enhance citizens' participation, the Bank has supported citizen visible audits
(Auditorias Ciudadanas Visibles, or CVAs) to monitor the use of royalty funds in
Colombian municipalities. Funded by the Governance Partnership Facility, this work
supported 25 communities in implementing audits covering 25 public works, representing
investments of US$75 million. The 2012 impact evaluation showed that public
investments monitored through CVAs performed better than investments with no citizen
30 Subnational governments refers to regional government entities (Entes Territoriales) below the central Government, which
include regional governments (Departamentos) and municipalities (Municipios). Article 286 of the 1991 Constitution defines
Entes Territoriales as departamentos, distritos, municipios and territorios indigenas.
31 According to the previous law, royalty resources were distributed to entities that produce or transport natural resources.
The new law (Law no. 1530/12) aims to change the distribution criteria.
23


﻿oversight.32 The results from    this evaluation have been used as inputs in the overall
decentralization framework coordinated by the Government.
53. The proposed operation is expected to allow poorer Departamentos and
municipalities to access resources and carry out projects to foster regional
development. As the PSIA analysis shows (see Annex 5), the rate of growth convergence
across regions will speed up in the post-reform distribution of royalties, reducing
territorial inequities.
Policy Area III: Equity in social spending
Prior Action 4: The GoC has: (i) issued new rules for the operation of Colombia Mayor; (ii)
increased the coverage and budget of Colombia Mayor; and (iii) reinforced the targeting of the
program towards old-age population under conditions of extreme or moderate poverty, as
evidenced by the Borrower's Ministry of Labor's Resolutions: (A) No. 1370, dated May 2, 2013;
and (B) No. 2958, dated November 23, 2012.
54. The share of elderly people in Colombia is increasing. By 2010, individuals of 59 years
of age and above made up 10 percent of the population in the country (4.5 million people).
According to the National Demographic and Health Survey 2010, one-fifth of this share of
the population is illiterate, and 58 percent have only elementary schooling. More than one-
fourth (27 percent) of the elderly population works, most of them out of necessity, and for
the most part their economic condition is precarious. Of the total of working elderly, 74
percent receive incomes below the minimum wage.33
55. The Social Protection Program for the Elderly (Programa de Protecci6n Social al
Adulto Mayor) was created to protect elderly people living in conditions of extreme
poverty and high vulnerability.34 The program, now known as Colombia Mayor, has
been expanded: the GoC increased the budget to expand its coverage and reinforced the
targeting toward the old-age population in conditions of extreme or moderate poverty.
Colombia Mayor now benefits around one million elders living in extreme poverty and is
expected to reach all of its target population (2.4 million people) by 2015.
56. The planned expansion of Colombia Mayor is expected to enhance equity in social
spending in Colombia by decreasing poverty in old age. See PSIA analysis (Annex 5).
32 Conclusions from the evaluation: (i) over 60 percent of the population ranked the performance of the investment projects
monitored with CVAs above other non-CVA monitored projects in their community; (ii) an impact of the CVAs on the
percentage of citizens that reported that they or their families had received a benefit from the investment project, providing
evidence that giving voice to the community can help improve the alignment of public investments with citizens' needs; and
(iii) over 30 percent of participants remained in contact with their local government after the program was completed,
suggesting that the use of CVAs improved the level of citizen engagement with the municipal authorities.
33 The average number of minimum wages received by the working elderly is 1.3. The highest incomes are received by
individuals who work as government employees, those who are retired, and those who are employers. Of the working elderly,
14 percent complement their wages with contributions from family members (living in or outside the country); 10 percent
have a retirement pension, 9 percent receive social welfare subsidies, and 61 percent do not have any other income besides
their wages.
34 The program stemmed from Law 797 of 2003. In Decree No. 3771 of 2007, the eligibility age for this benefit was set at
three years below the required pension retirement age. In 2014, the eligibility age for the program will be 59 and above for
men, and 54 and above for women.
24


﻿Policy Area IV. Gender equity
Prior Action 5: The GoC has mandated the provision of specific measures to protect women who
are victims of gender violence, such as provision of meals, transport and temporary housing, as
evidenced by: (i) the Borrower's Decree No. 2734, dated December 27, 2012, duly published in the
Borrower's Official Gazette on December 28, 2012; and (ii) the Borrower's Ministry of Health's
Resolution No. 459, dated March 6, 2012.
57. Gender-based violence (GBV) is one of the central issues that affect the welfare of
women in Colombia. Domestic violence in particular is endemic in the country:
according to Demography and Health Surveys 2010, 37 percent of Colombian women
who have ever had a partner report having suffered physical violence by a spouse/intimate
partner. Partner violence occurs somewhat less among those who have completed higher
education and among the wealthiest women, but the differences are not very significant.
58. Domestic violence affects labor market outcomes and constitutes a violation of basic
human rights. Domestic abuse violates nearly every principle of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and impedes other development outcomes. Women who
suffer from domestic violence are more likely to have poorer health and to have
considerably lower earnings (between 40-60 percent lower in Latin America) than similar
women who are not subject to abuse. Moreover, domestic violence has far-reaching
effects on the economic and social welfare of future generations. Exposure to domestic
violence in childhood triggers a multitude of health, psychological, and behavioral
problems, which are in turn associated with lower earnings, substance abuse, risk of
violence, and other negative consequences in adulthood. Reducing domestic violence can
indeed go a long way to improve gender equality and other development outcomes.
59. Following Law 1257 of 2008, the GoC passed a number of initiatives to protect
women who are victims of gender violence. Most recently, the Decree No. 2734 dated
December 27, 2012, which mandates the provision of specific measures to protect women
who are victims of gender violence, such as provision of meals, transport and temporary
housing. Moreover, in March, 2013, through CONPES Social 161, the GoC launched the
guidelines of the National Public Policy of Gender Equity and a comprehensive plan to
guarantee a life free of violence.
60. This operation will enable the implementation of reforms to protect women from
GBV, which in turn is expected to have a positive impact on the conditions for gender
equity (quality of life, and labor market outcomes).
Policy Area V. Open access to national financial management information systems
Prior Action 6: The GoC has implemented measures to strengthen the operation of SIIF Nacion to
enhance transparency and accountability in the execution of the public budget, including, inter alia
the incorporation of data related to revenues and budget execution to the transparency portal
(Portal de Transparencia Economica), as evidenced by: (i) Letter No. 2-2013-026879, dated July
29, 2013; (ii) the Borrower's Decree No. 2674 of December 21, 2012, duly published in the
Borrower's Official Gazette on December 21, 2012; and (iii) the Borrower's Ministry of Finance's
Act. No. 16 of February 26, 2013.


﻿61. Since 2004, Colombia has been upgrading and modernizing its information
technology systems to support the management of public finances and the budget. In
2010, a new integrated financial management information system, Sistema Integrado de
Informaci6n Financiera (SIIF II), was implemented in all central and decentralized
government entities to (i) increase institutional coverage, (ii) integrate administrative
modules with the Core Treasury System, (iii) increase the security level of transactions,
and (iv) reduce operational costs. A team has been working to simplify and standardize
some of the processes.35
62. SIIF II has helped to increase transparency, control, and predictability in budget
management. It has increased the institutional coverage of the Government's financial
management information system, expanding from 66 to 167 institutions (100 percent of
Central Government and a significant part of nonfinancial public corporations). According
to MHCP calculations, the implementation of SIIF II is saving the Government around
US$113 million annually. In 2011 the Government launched the Budget Transparency
Portal,36 covering 100 percent of the national budget, to promote citizens' participation in
and social engagement on the utilization of public resources.
63. Even though Colombia has been working since 2004 to upgrade and modernize its
information technology systems to support the management of public finances and
the budget, the objectives have not been fully achieved. There is no integrated analysis
of investment and operating budgets that encompasses ministry strategies, objectives,
performance information, and related budget allocations. Operating expenditures account
for more than half of the central Government's expenditures, yet it is unclear whether
there is a formal process to review operating spending (and recommend policy changes
that could save resources). SIIF II has not implemented functionalities for program
budgeting, including objectives and indicators for monitoring and evaluation. It does not
contain tools to analyze the budget from different classification views, and, as a result, it
supports only management of expenditure and income.37 Also, SIIF uses only the modules
related to the Core Treasury System (modules 1 to 7), while the remaining modules were
developed but have not been implemented.38
64. The GoC has implemented measures for the operation of S1IF II to enhance
transparency and accountability in the execution of the public budget. In particular, it
is working to improve the system's governance, harmonize budget execution and
accounting procedures, and integrate and improve royalties management.
35 This includes writing the functional specifications to contract with a software development company. The software consists
of independent but well-integrated modules, all of which meet high international security standards and operate on a full web
platform. They include Budget Preparation, Budget Appropriations, Budget Execution, Income Execution, Accounting,
Payment and Cash Management, Budget Execution Ceilings, Procurement and Contract Management, Inventory
Management, and Billing and Accounts Receivable.
36 www.pte.gov.co
3 The design of SIIF II was based on budget coding, not budget classification. Although the current budget codes identify the
different classification levels, for SIIF II the composition of this code has no meaning, and it is used only to identify the
budget allocation line that expenses should affect.
38 The MHCP is strengthening the normative and legal framework to implement the rest of the modules, to expand the system
into a complete integrated financial management information system. The increase in the coverage was possible due to new
technologies, such as the full web platform hosted by the MHCP and high security standards for authentication, digital
signatures, and information custody, among others.
26


﻿65. The adjustments required for SIIF II to be a strong instrument for policymaking will
require changes in the information systems that support expenditure and budget
management. To support performance budgeting, the SIIF will need to be enhanced with
strong tools that facilitate the analysis of information from different perspectives and
forecast scenarios.
Policy Area VI. Monitoring ofpoverty and other social indicators
Prior Action 7: The GoC has updated its methodology for the measurement of poverty through the
establishment of institutional arrangements for improving the quality, transparency and
replicability of poverty and other social indicators, as evidenced by: (i) the publication of
Document CONPES Social No. 150, dated May 28, 2012; and (ii) the establishment of: (A) the
Executive Committee for the Measurement of Monetary Poverty; and (B) the Executive Committee
for the Measurement of Multidimensional Poverty, through the issuance of DANE's Resolutions
No. 871 and 877, respectively, of August 24, 2012.
66. The GoC has enhanced the credibility and clarity of the official poverty
measurements, following revisions to the methodology implemented in the mid-
2000s. In 2006, DANE revised the national household survey into the Gran Encuesta
Integrada de Hogares (GEIH). However, improvements in the survey did not fully match
the previous poverty measurement methodology,39 and communicating the impacts of the
new methodology on the measurement of poverty proved complex.
67. In 2012, the GoC issued an updated national official methodology for the
measurement of poverty, creating institutional arrangements for improving the
quality, transparency, and replicability of poverty and other social indicators. In
addition to guidelines to measure monetary poverty, the revised framework establishes
specific roles for each institution: DANE is the producer of the indicators, DNP is the
validating institution responsible for replicating the calculations, and the Ministry of
Social Protection is responsible for designing Colombia's poverty reduction strategy.
Later DANE Resolutions established two Executive Committees to regulate the
production and dissemination of such indicators as the multidimensional poverty index.
68. The long-term objective of this policy area is to enhance the transparency and
quality of information to effectively monitor poverty and other social welfare
indicators of equity. As the monetary poverty measurement methodology in Colombia
solidifies and progress is measured transparently and communicated accurately and
clearly, policymakers can focus more on addressing the country's key challenge of high
inequality and on promoting prosperity for all.

﻿V. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION
A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (PSIA)
69. The Government policies supported by this operation are expected to have a positive
poverty and social impact. A Poverty and Social Impact Assessment was carried out
with a strong engagement with the GoC counterparts, and provides a robust analysis of the
positive outcomes on equity of the supported policy actions, as explained below (A
detailed summary of the PSIA is provided in Annex 5).
70. The PSIA was structured to follow the policy areas outlined in the Program Document.
For the first three policy areas, direct potential outcomes were analyzed. Specifically,
within Policy Area 1, the implementation of IMAN is expected to reduce the Gini
coefficient of market income of a distribution that includes top earners in almost one
percentage point (from  0.586 to 0.579).40 Moreover, the reduction of firms' payroll
contributions and the introduction of a new tax on corporate profits are expected to
contribute to increase formal employment in around 10 percent and formal labor earnings
between 4.8 and 4.9 percent (both cases with respect to the benchmark). Policy Area 2,
regarding the reform of the royalties system  is expected to achieve its objective of
increasing the speed of convergence within the country. The new royalties system is
expected to become a factor of regional convergence for the period 2012 to 2016, by
accelerating the catch-up effect between poor and rich Departamentos. Policy Area 3,
towards enhancing equity in social spending with a focus on the elderly, is expected to
have a positive impact on poverty reduction and inequality. In particular, the incidence of
poverty among the age/strata eligible income group would decline the most when
universal coverage is implemented.
71. For the policy area that aimed to improve the capacity of the government to protect
women who are victims of gender base violence, qualitative work is planned during the
supervision stage of this operation to better understand the impact of the implementation
of the policy that mandates the provision of temporary housing, feeding, and
transportation for treatment of women victims of violence and/or their children. Finally,
this PSIA does not anticipate negative impacts of the last two policy areas related to open
access to national financial management information systems and monitoring of poverty
and other social indicators, as these policies are expected to promote transparency and
accountability in government leading to the more efficient use of resources and the ability
to reliably track progress and evaluate the impact of policy reforms.
B. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
72. The proposed operation is not likely to have any significant effects on the
environment, forests, and other natural resources. As this operation focuses on tax
reform, transfers to SNGs, improvement in coverage and transparency of social spending
40 This reduction of the Gini is not trivial, considering, for example, the average yearly reduction of the Gini in Latin
American countries (1.2 percent annually) over the last 10 years (Lustig, N., L.F. Lopez-Calva, and E. Ortiz-Juarez, 2012,
"Declining Inequality in Latin America: The Cases of Argentina, Brazil and Mexico", World Development, Vo. 44. P. 129-
141.).
28


﻿and financial management, and gender equity, it is not expected to have any impact on the
environment. However, to the extent that actions supported by the loan program are
successful, over time, in attracting new private investment, there will be a need to
continue strengthening Colombia's institutional capacity to identify and address
environmental policy and regulatory issues.
73. The GoC is well prepared to address potential environmental impacts. The new
Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development has prioritized the implementation
of measures to strengthen the sustainability of some of the major economic sectors
(agriculture, mining, and construction). The Bank has been supporting the Government in
this process through a package of services, including the Environmental DPL series, the
Sustainable Development Investment Loan, and the provision of targeted technical
assistance and analytical support in the area of environmental management.
C. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING, AND EVALUATION
74. MHCP, DNP, and DANE are responsible for coordinating actions among the
concerned agencies. MHCP's Department for Public Credit will collect the necessary
data to assess the implementation progress for which the MHCP is responsible and report
it to the Bank. Similarly, the DNP's Directorate of Evaluation of Public Policies, which is
responsible for the National Evaluation System of Management and Results (SINERGIA),
will collect and report to the Bank the information related to the implementation progress
of royalties, Colombia Mayor, and gender indicators. Finally, DANE will be responsible
for the annual online release of household survey micro-data for replicating poverty and
other social indicators.
D. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS
Public financial management
75. The public financial management systems are adequate to support development
policy lending. The national-level public financial management (PFM) systems show
advanced levels of performance that are moving toward good international practices,
according to the most recent Public Financial Management and Procurement Report
(2009) and subsequent reports from the IMF and World Bank.41 Notwithstanding, there
remains areas for further strengthening of public financial management systems, such as
information systems and budget management. In 2012, a new financial and administration
system (SIIF II) was put into operation, and an effort is under way to adopt a Unified
System of Investment and Public Finance. The Government is now increasing the
coverage of SIIF II and providing consistency to the different PFM tools.42 Colombia has
an effective track record of implementing PFM reforms, which the Bank has supported.
Salient features of the PFM systems are summarized below.
41 See International Monetary Fund, 2012, "Colombia - Implementing the Structural Balance Rule under GFSM 2001 with
improved budget planning tools", Washington D.C.; and World Bank, 2013 forthcoming, "Opportunities for Budget Reform
in Colombia", World Bank, Washington, D.C.
42 These include the National Development Plan (PND), the fiscal rules, the Public Investment Program (PIP), the MTFF, the
MTEF, the Operative Annual Investment Plan, and the financial plan.
29


﻿*   The budget is comprehensive, well documented, and implemented as planned,
with actual expenditures deviating only slightly from planned levels. Budget
planning is based on a multiyear perspective,43 and annual formulation reflects a
mostly well-functioning policy-based system.44 Execution of budgeted expenditures
suggests a largely credible budget, although some arrears may exist. The Borrower has
published its annual budget in a timely fashion (Decree 1882 of September 11, 2012).
*   Revenue and expenditure controls are comprehensive, and there is a continuous
effort to improve them. Of significant relevance are strong measures to safeguard the
overall integrity and accuracy of revenue data by integrating or reconciling the
different accounting systems used by the tax administrator, ensuring consistency
between the information from accounting and statistical records, and guaranteeing
timely recording of transactions. Records and controls on cash flows, balances, and
public debt support sound fiscal management and provide public institutions with the
tools for predicting funding to execute their budgets in an orderly manner.
*   The consolidated public accounts are prepared within six months after the end of
the fiscal year. They include full information on revenues, expenditures, and financial
assets and liabilities. Year-end accrual-based financial statements are issued by the
Accountant General and presented by May 15 of the following year to the Controller
General for audit purposes. The Controller General's auditing policies and procedures
provide for the application of financial, compliance, and performance procedures
consistent with the National Government's auditing standards. Audit reports are
submitted before July 1 of the following fiscal year to the Congress and the President.
76. The GoC is implementing an accounting and auditing reform agenda to adopt and
implement international accounting and auditing standards. In the last two years,
there have been significant developments towards implementing this reform, including
new legislation, and an inter-institutional commission involving key government
authorities   to   operationalize    transitional  arrangements     towards     completing
implementation. There remains a few challenges for the GoC to overcome in the reform
process, including establishing monitoring indicators to measure progress in the transition
years, revamping and/or adjusting information systems, revising business processes,
establishing quality assurance mechanisms to ensure the quality of financial reporting by
companies and the public sector entities, and defining a comprehensive country strategy
for education and training of accountants and public officials involved in implementation.
The completion of implementation of the reform agenda will contribute to improve
competitiveness and access to markets in the private sector, and enhancing governance
and transparency in the use of public funds, which will be reflected in the consolidated
public accounts by end of 2015.
43 The country has developed key PFM multiannual instruments since 2003, such as MTFF and MTEF. However, they are
presently not used adequately since, instead being prepared sequentially with the budget, they are developed in parallel. That
makes it impossible for CONPES to have an informed discussion on the strategic direction of the budget and the setting of
hard expenditure ceilings early in the budget year (IMF, 2012).
4 As identified by IMF (2012) and World Bank reviews (forthcoming 2013), policies or priorities are explicit, but they are
not directly linked to the budget, given budget classification problems. The economic and functional classifications are only
available for planning purposes, not for budget tracking and reporting. These classifications need to be included as segments
of the Chart of Accounts in the SIIF II system. The recurrent and investment budgets are independently prepared and
executed (even institutionally/organizationally), and the classification varies between preparation and execution, and across
ministries. This prevents the budget from being an effective policy decision tool.
30


﻿Procurement
77. An assessment of the public procurement system concludes that over the past five
years Colombia has significantly modernized the procurement system, but work
remains in terms of consolidating gains and ensuring sustainability. One of the most
relevant steps forward was the November 2011 creation of the Procurement Directorate
(Agencia Nacional de Contrataci6n Publica, Colombia Compra Eficiente) to oversee and
lead the procurement reforms. However, important challenges remain: (i) the legal
framework should regulate standards, not just processes, and align procurement to
expenditure policy; (ii) the e-procurement system should be updated and become a
transactional procurement platform to improve transparency, generate competition, or
streamline processes; (iii) a professional workforce should be developed; procurement
staff lack both knowledge and professionalism to deliver the best outcomes, including
cost-saving strategies; and (iv) the Procurement Directorate should be furnished with
sufficient resources and capacity to effectively champion further modernization efforts. In
sum, the legal, institutional, and operational frameworks must be dynamic and adaptable
to respond the challenges in the market as new technologies and ways of doing business
develop in Colombia and around the world.
E. DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING
78. Disbursement arrangements. Once the DPL becomes effective and the Borrower
complies with any withdrawal tranche release conditions, and following the Borrower's
request, the Bank would deposit the funds into an account denominated in US dollars of
the Central Bank (Banco de la Repblica) for subsequent credit into the Treasury Single
Account of the MHCP, thus becoming available to finance budgeted expenditures. The
MHCP will provide the Bank with a written confirmation of the transaction after the funds
are disbursed by the Bank.
79. There is no evidence that the banking control environment into which the DPL
proceeds would flow is other than adequate. This assessment is based on a review of
the 2011 and 2012 external audit report of the Banco de la Repblica, the latest IMF
Central Bank safeguards assessment (2010), and the 2012 IMF Article IV Consultation.
Because the Borrower's PFM systems and the fiduciary arrangements for this financing
are assessed as adequate, the Bank will not require an audit of the designated account, and
no additional fiduciary arrangements are considered necessary at this time.
F. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
80. This DPL is subject to risks related to a deteriorating external economic
environment and reform program implementation. Despite solid fundamentals,
Colombia's near-term macroeconomic outlook could be adversely affected by external
shocks. This risk is mitigated by the country's high policy response capacity. There are
also risks of policy slippages related to the implementation of projects at the subnational
level because of the increasing amount of royalties. By way of mitigation, this DPL was
designed to exclusively support administrative measures that do not depend on legislative
processes. The overall risk classification is thus considered low.
31


﻿Economic Risks
81. Despite high exposure to external shocks, Colombia exhibits low vulnerability
because of its high policy response capacity. Colombia is exposed to three types of
external shocks: a slowdown in economic activity in the US, a decline in oil prices, and
global financial market turmoil (World Bank, 2012). Mitigation: The country's macro
resilience is based on solid initial conditions and policy buffers to respond. Economic
growth is solid, and the absence of significant domestic or external imbalances helps shore
up stability. Substantial foreign direct investment inflows, ample accumulation of foreign
reserves, and a Flexible Credit Line with the IMF protect Colombia's external position.
82. The appreciation of the Colombia peso, which has been an issue of concern, has
halted since the beginning of 2013. The Colombian peso (the nominal as well as the real
effective rate) has grown gradually stronger in recent years because of significant capital
inflows (primarily FDI) and improved fiscal policy. Recently, however, a combination of
lower interest rates, currency purchases by the Central Bank, and change in the
international financial environment have contributed to a nominal depreciation of the
peso. The flexible exchange rate has exhibited substantial volatility, acting as a shock
absorber in times of global economic crises and uncertainty.
Political and Social Risks
83. Over the past months Colombia has experienced labor unrest in several sectors and
increasing political opposition from groups associated with the previous
administration, which have had negative impacts on the President's approval ratings.
However, overall political risk in the country remains low, helped by the Government's
stout Congressional majority. This strong presence is expected to ensure policy continuity
and contribute to the approval of the upcoming health care and pension reforms.
84. The political debate is dominated by security issues. This includes the initiative of
relaunching a peace process with the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia
guerrillas. This process has yielded a first agreement regarding land ownership and
exploitation, which sets the conditions for further negotiation in other areas. President
Santos's reelection possibilities will depend largely on progress in the peace talks.
Implementation Risks
85. Colombia has high credibility on fiscal prudency. The choice of a stand-alone, single-
tranche DPL operation complements previous operations in the fiscal and public sector
management realms, while building on analytical and technical support work. Also, it
recognizes and supports Colombia's ongoing reforms while mitigating the risk of a
programmatic approach under the political calendar in the country, where the upcoming
electoral cycle will make immediate further reforms unlikely (although the next
administration may further the reform program).
32


﻿86. Implementation risks differ by policy area, but are generally low. Tax evasion is the
main risk in implementing IMAN.45 The approved reform mitigates this by changing the
direction of guilt charges: taxpayers must now prove they have not evaded taxes.
Moreover, the GoC has incorporated into its tax revenue projections a tax evasion of 20%.
Regarding CREE, the vulnerability of revenues in terms of the economic cycle represents
a risk area, which can be mitigated by the government's stabilization funds to compensate
for missing revenues to secure resources for ICBF and SENA.
87. Implementation risks for the royalties reform include effective coordination among
institutions involved; SNGs' capacity to design and implement projects; identifying
projects of regional scope; and establishing periodic impact evaluations. These risks
can be mitigated by strengthening the institutional network, which includes the Governing
Committee, the Bank of Projects, and DNP. Other risks relate to projections of royalties,
which depend on the speed/volume of exploitation of natural resources and international
prices. Projections for future periods, however, are conservative, and a savings and
stabilization fund (which receives 25-30% of the total funds of the general royalties
system) is being implemented as a mitigating measure. The system may also be subject to
public backlash, because some SNGs will be negatively affected, which might translate
into implementation delays. To avoid delays, the Bank can intensify the support it
provides through the new investment lending operation-which will enhance SNGs'
management capacities-as well as continue work on CVAs.
88. In consolidating SIIF II, operational risks include system failures, unauthorized
access to the database, and data inconsistency. The MHCP team is performing a series
of tests to improve consistency and is reinforcing a second contingency system in case of
operational flaws. Delays in the consolidation of SIIF II also constitute a challenge.
However, the Government is working on increasing coverage beyond the national budget;
adopting a Unified System of Investment and Public Finance; and providing consistency
among the different planning and fiscal management tools. To avoid delays, the Bank can
intensify its support through the investment lending operation and technical assistance.
89. In terms of poverty monitoring poverty, some risks are associated with potential
changes of government and technical staff, which might reverse the public release of
micro-data to reproduce poverty and inequality numbers. The Expert Committees for
Monetary and Multidimensional Poverty-which include technical staff from the
government, social sectors, academia, and international organizations-would function as
mitigation mechanisms.
45 The official tax collection projection incorporates a 20 percent evasion rate, making the baseline a conservative goal.

Washington D.C. 20433
Asunto: Carta de política - Fortalecimiento de la Capacidad Fiscal para la Promoción de
la Prosperidad Compartida.
Estimado Señor Kim,
La estrategia económica del Presidente Juan Manuel Santos se centra en mantener el
crecimiento económico y aumentar la equidad y el bienestar en los colombianos. Hoy, es
posible afirmar que hemos avanzado con paso firme hacia el cumplimiento de estas
metas. La economía colombiana cuenta con una estabilidad macroeconómica y fiscal
reconocida a nivel mundial. Es así como el PIB presentó un crecimiento de 4% en 2012 y
se espera que este año sea alrededor del 4,5%, a pesar del difícil panorama económico
mundial. Este crecimiento se ha reflejado en un aumento del ingreso promedio por
habitante, que se ubicó en US$7.800 dólares anuales en 2012, tres veces más que lo
observado en el año 2000.
La estabilidad económica ha conducido a que los indicadores macroeconómicos se
ubiquen en sus niveles de equilibrio de largo plazo. Por una parte, el desempleo alcanzó
niveles de un dígito a finales de 2012, y en mayo de 2013 se situó en 9,4%, la cifra más
baja en dicho mes en los últimos trece años. Por otra parte, la inflación se situó para el
mes de junio en un nivel de 2,2%, ubicándose cómodamente dentro del rango meta del
Banco de la Republica, lo que implica que hay espacio para utilizar la política monetaria
en caso de que las condiciones internas o externas empeoren, garantizando la estabilidad
del crecimiento económico. La mejora en los indicadores macroeconómicos y fiscales, a
su vez, ha resultado en un aumento en la confianza de los inversionistas en Colombia. De
esta forma, la tasa de inversión del país se ubicó en 27,7% del PIB, la más alta de la
historia y la segunda más alta de la región. Una muestra de este hecho ha sido el aumento
en la Inversión Extranjera Directa, que en 2012 alcanzó su máximo histórico, superando
los US$15 mil millones.
36


﻿La fortaleza macroeconómica del país también se ha reflejado en la mejora de la postura
fiscal. El Gobierno del presidente Santos se ha comprometido a mantener un saludable
estado de las finanzas públicas y a lograr niveles manejables de deuda. Al comenzar esta
administración, el déficit fiscal del Sector Público Consolidado fue de $17,7 billones
(3,3% del PIB), mientras que en el 2012 presentó un superávit de $1,8 billones (0,3% del
PIB). Al mismo tiempo, la consolidación fiscal ha permitido reducir la deuda que tiene el
país a niveles cercanos a 25,1% del PIB al finalizar 2012. Con la reducción de la deuda,
se disminuye la cantidad de ingresos que se destinan al pago de intereses, permitiendo el
uso de estos recursos en proyectos de alto impacto social.
La buena gestión macroeconómica y fiscal de los últimos años fue reconocida por las
agencias calificadoras más importantes del mundo, gracias a lo cual se produjo una
mejora en la perspectiva de "estable" a "positivo" por parte de DBRS (Febrero 2012),
Standard and Poor's (Agosto 2012), Fitch (Marzo de 2013) y Moody's (Julio 2013). La
implementación de las reformas fiscales y la continuidad de las políticas económicas
genera un círculo virtuoso: permiten una reducción en el nivel de endeudamiento y en el
servicio de deuda, contribuyendo así a mejorar la posición financiera del gobierno y, en
consecuencia, permitiendo incremento futuros en la calificación.
Sin embargo, el Gobierno colombiano reconoce que aún falta afianzar algunos aspectos
de política que permitan garantizar una senda de crecimiento sostenido en el mediano
plazo que, a través de aumentos de la productividad y de la competitividad, permitan
generar aún más empleo, reducir los niveles de pobreza y desigualdad, y por tanto
mejorar las condiciones de vida de la población. De hecho, en 2012 el porcentaje de
personas en situación de pobreza a nivel nacional pasó de 34,1% en 2011 a 32,7% en
2012, mientras que la desigualdad se redujo levemente, ya que el coeficiente de Gini pasó
de 0,548 a 0,539, a nivel nacional. El Gobierno es consciente de que una reducción mayor
en la desigualdad fortalecerá el vínculo entre crecimiento y reducción de la pobreza.
El Gobierno está convencido que el desafío más importante para el desarrollo del país es
la superación de la pobreza y la diminución de la desigualdad. Por esta razón, en su Plan
de Desarrollo "Prosperidad para Todos" identifica que el camino hacia la prosperidad
para todos se construye con base en una reducción de las desigualdades regionales y de
las brechas de oportunidades que existen en Colombia.
En este sentido, el Gobierno Nacional presentó ante el Congreso de la Republica la
reforma tributaria que fue aprobada mediante la Ley 1607 de Diciembre de 2012, cuyo
objetivo concreto es hacer llegar prosperidad a cada uno de los colombianos. Este
concepto, que ha sido trasversal a todas las iniciativas de política pública de este
Gobierno, se manifiesta en esta reforma a través de dos pilares: la equidad y la
formalización. De allí la importancia histórica de la iniciativa, pues se trata de la primera
reforma al sistema impositivo en más de 20 años que se fundamenta, más que en el
recaudo, en atacar los dos problemas de mayor relevancia en el país: la desigualdad y la
informalidad. En efecto, Colombia es uno de los países más desiguales del mundo bajo
cualquier metodología de medición, y uno de los que tiene mayor informalidad laboral.
2
37


﻿El primer objetivo de esta reforma fue el de sustituir los impuestos al empleo por
impuestos a las utilidades para incentivar la creación de empleo formal. Así como ya se
utilizaron de manera exitosa los incentivos al capital para aumentar la tasa de inversión a
niveles históricos, esta reforma se enfocó en incentivar la generación de empleo moderno
y formal como requisito indispensable para reducir la desigualdad. La reforma tributaria
exoneró a partir del mes de mayo de 2013 a los empleadores de los aportes parafiscales
(SENA e ICBF) y de contribuciones a salud respecto de trabajadores del sector privado
que devenguen hasta 10 SMLM. Esta medida reduce los impuestos de la nómina a cargo
del empleador en más de 40%, al pasar de 29,5% a 16%. A su vez, con el fin de no
afectar el funcionamiento y continuidad de los programas sociales de las entidades que
estos aportes financiaban, se implementa el CREE, un impuesto del 8% sobre las
utilidades de las empresas.
El segundo objetivo de la reforma fue el de tener un sistema de tributación más justo, en
donde la base de la pirámide, 18 millones de personas que ganan menos de 3 millones
600 mil pesos (1,960 dólares) mensuales no pagarán impuesto a la renta, mientras que los
que ganan más de 10 millones de pesos (5,500 dólares) mensuales, apenas 92 mil
personas, pagarán un poco más. En efecto, antes de la reforma, la tarifa promedio de renta
para personas naturales resultaba más baja para las personas que devengaban salarios
altos en relación con las personas de menores ingresos. En consecuencia, los trabajadores
con ingresos inferiores a $1,5 millones asumían tarifas entre 5% y 6%, mientras los que
devengaban más de 9 salarios solo pagaban tarifas efectivas entre 3% y 4%. Con la
reforma se crea el Impuesto Mínimo Alternativo -IMAN, como un sistema obligatorio
para determinar un impuesto de renta mínimo para empleados, que solo admite como
deducciones sobre los ingresos los aportes obligatorios a seguridad social y en general,
los relacionados con indemnizaciones, seguros y pérdidas por catástrofes. Así, aunque los
empleados continúan realizando su declaración por el sistema ordinario, el impuesto que
resulte no puede ser inferior al obtenido con el IMAN. Además, se introdujo un impuesto
al consumo de bienes suntuarios, como botes y vehículos de alta gama.
El tercer objetivo de la reforma es el de simplificar la estructura del IVA, reduciendo el
número de tarifas de 7 a 3, y generando un alivio importante para el agro colombiano,
que se verá beneficiado con la reducción o eliminación del IVA a sus insumos.
Con esta reforma histórica, pensada para el beneficio de los colombianos, se estima que
el país ganará entre 400 mil y 1 millón de empleos modernos y formales. Asimismo,
Colombia aspira a dejar de ser el segundo país más desigual de la región para llegar en un
plazo corto, a estar muy cerca del promedio regional en materia distribución del ingreso.
Otro logro del Gobierno Nacional con miras a disminuir la inequidad y generar
mecanismos de ahorro e inversión que contribuyan con las condiciones para apoyar el
desarrollo de las regiones, es la reforma al régimen de regalías. Con dicha reforma,
aprobada en 2011, el país redujo el coeficiente de Gini de distribución de recursos de
regalía7s en 53 puntos. Antes, el 80% de las regalías llegaban a 9 departamentos que
representaban el 19% de la población del país. Ahora, la totalidad de los 32
departamentos del país reciben recursos de regalías, al tiempo que los departamentos y
3


﻿municipios productores y portuarios continúan con una importante participación dentro
de esta redistribución.
Como contribución al principio de equidad intergeneracional, gracias a la reforma, las
entidades territoriales reservarán una porción de las regalías para estabilizar la inversión
cuando los recursos sean más escasos y así mantener el gasto público en niveles
deseables a través del tiempo. De igual manera, debido a la inversión de las regalías, las
entidades desarrollarán obras para mejorar la calidad de vida de sus ciudadanos y la
competitividad de las regiones mientras que, gracias a la dinámica de los Órganos
Colegiados de Administración y Decisión-OCAD en la aprobación y supervisión de
proyectos de inversión, se contribuye con la mejor coordinación entre los diferentes
niveles de gobierno (nacional y territorial), que se traducirá en una agenda de trabajo que
permitirá desarrollar una visión de desarrollo regional en el mediano plazo.
El Gobierno reconoce el gran reto que una reforma de este carácter representa y trabaja
en ese sentido para lograr una mejor coordinación institucional del Sistema, capacitar a
las entidades territoriales y acompañar cada paso de la implementación del Sistema
General de Regalías.
Asimismo, el Plan Nacional de Desarrollo de la Administración Santos plantea que el
país requiere un Sistema de Protección para la Vejez (SPV) universal, incluyente y
equitativo, que busque aumentar gradualmente la cobertura que tienen los mecanismos
vigentes de protección a la vejez y lograr que cada vez más personas mejoren sus
condiciones de vida al final de su ciclo productivo, a través del esfuerzo personal y
esquemas solidarios definidos por la Ley. En este contexto las acciones de política
pública enmarcadas en los Servicios Sociales Complementarios que buscan contribuir a
mejorar la calidad de vida mediante la protección de las contingencias que afectan a la
población vulnerable al momento de finalizar su vida productiva, se han centrado por el
Gobierno Nacional en fortalecer el Programa de Protección Social al Adulto Mayor, hoy
Colombia Mayor. Este programa tiene como objetivo fundamental proteger al adulto
mayor contra el riesgo económico de la imposibilidad de generar ingresos y contra el
riesgo derivado de la exclusión social. De esta manera se han establecido nuevas reglas
operativas, se ha realizado ampliación de cobertura dirigida a las personas de mayor edad
y de manera particular se ha posibilitado el ingreso automático de personas centenarias y
priorizado el ingreso de personas de 81 y más años, así como de los adultos mayores
residentes en Centros de Bienestar del Adulto Mayor e indígenas residentes en resguardos
legalmente constituidos.
La lucha contra la pobreza y la desigualdad, así como la promoción del desarrollo
socioeconómico del país, se fortalecen al implementar acciones que garanticen el goce
efectivo de los derechos humanos. En este sentido el país ha realizado ajustes
institucionales y ha construido un marco normativo para la promoción de la equidad de
género, como respuesta a la desigualdad y a la discriminación experimentada por las
mujeres en Colombia. Es así como en marzo del presente año se lanzó el documento de
política de Equidad de Género para las Mujeres (Conpes Social 161) que incluye
acciones, construidas de manera participativa: (i) para promover la autonomía económica
4


﻿de las mujeres, (ii) en educación, (iii) en participación, (iv) en salud, (v) para garantizar
una vida libre de violcncia y, (vi) para lograr una transformación cultural y construcción
de paz. En línea con la construcción normativa para garantizar el goce efectivo de los
derechos de las mujeres, en diciembre de 2012 fue promulgado el Decreto 2734 que
establece procedimientos, responsables institucionales y recursos para la atención de las
mujeres víctimas de la violencia.
Por último es importante considerar el esfuerzo que ha hecho el Gobierno en mejorar y
hacer más equitativo el acceso a la información y en mejorar los niveles del transparencia
sobre el manejo financiero y presupuestal. Es así como se han implementado medidas que
buscan mejorar los niveles de transparencia, como lo es el alcance del Sistema Integrado
de Información Financiera (81F) en el Portal de Transparencia Económica, al alimentar
gradualmente este portal con información sobre ejecución presupuestal, gastos e ingresos
de la Nación.
Con el objetivo de continuar fortaleciendo las políticas que permitan garantizar una senda
de crecimiento sostenido, generar más empleo, reducir los niveles de pobreza y
desigualdad, y por tanto mejorar las condiciones de vida de la población, el Gobierno de
Colombia solicita al Banco Mundial un Préstamo de Política de Desarrollo a favor del
Fortalecimiento de la Capacidad Fiscal para la Promoción de la Prosperidad Compartida,
dando apoyo en seis áreas clave: (i) una política y administración tributaria más
progresiva, (i) el aumento de la equidad inter-regional y de la capacidad de los gobiernos
subnacionales, (iii) una mejora en la focalización del gasto social a adultos mayores, (iv)
el fortalecimiento de la capacidad del gobierno de atender a mujeres víctimas de
violencia, (iv) mayor transparencia en acceso a la información del manejo financiero y de
presupuesto público, y, (Y) la mejora en el monitorco de la pobreza y otros indicadores
sociales.
Agradeciendo su atención, reciba un cordial saludo.

President

Washington, DC 20433
Subject: Policy Letter - Enhancing Fiscal Capacity to Promote Shared Prosperity
Dear Mr. Kim,
The economic strategy of President Juan Manuel Santos focuses on maintaining economic
growth and increasing the well-being and equity of the Colombian people. Today, we can
affirm that we have made substantial progress towards the achievement of these targets. The
Colombian economy has macroeconomic and fiscal stability that is recognized worldwide.
GDP growth was 4% in 2012 and is expected to be around 4.5% in the current year, in spite of
a difficult global macroeconomic outlook. This growth has been reflected in the increase in
mean income per capita, which was US$7,800 in 2012, three times the level in the year 2000.
Economic stability has led to the achievement of long-run equilibrium in the country's
macroeconomic indicators. Unemployment reached one-digit levels towards the end of 2012,
and in May 2013 it was 9.4%, the lowest May figure in the last 13 years. Inflation during the
month of June was 2.2%, within the limits set by the Banco de la Republica. This implies that
there is room to use monetary policy if internal or external conditions deteriorate, and so
guaranteeing the stability of economic growth. The improvement in macroeconomic and
fiscal indicators, in turn, has resulted in an increase in investor confidence in Colombia. Thus,
the country's investment rate corresponded to 27.7% of GDP, the highest in history and the
second highest in the region. An example of this growth has been the increase in foreign
direct investment, which in 2012 reached a historical high of US$15 billion.
The country's macroeconomic strength has been reflected in the improvement in its fiscal
stance. The Government of President Santos has committed to keep the public finances in a
healthy state and to achieve manageable levels of debt. At the beginning of this government,
the fiscal deficit of the consolidated public sector was COP$17.7 billion (3.3% of GDP),
while by 2012 there was a surplus of COP$1.8 billion (0.3% of GDP). At the same time, fiscal
consolidation allowed the country to reduce its debt to levels close to 25.10% of GDP at the
end of 2012. The reduction in the debt has meant a decrease in the amount of income that is
used to pay interest, freeing resources to be used for projects of high social impact.
41


﻿Colombia's good macroeconomic and fiscal management in recent years has been recognized
by the most important rating agencies in the world, which have upgraded the country's rating
from "stable" to "positive": DBRS (February 2012), Standard and Poor's (August 2012),
Fitch (March 2013), and Moody's (July 2013). The implementation of the fiscal reforms and
the continuation of the economic policies generate a virtuous circle: a reduction in the level of
debt and its interest, contributing to an improvement in the Government's financial position
and, as a consequence, allowing for a future increase in the rating.
Nonetheless, the Colombian Government recognizes that there are still some aspects of policy
that require further strengthening to ensure a sustained medium-term growth path, in which
increases in productivity and competitiveness translate into job creation, reductions in poverty
and inequality levels, and, thus, improvements in the living conditions of the population. In
2012, the share of the country's people living in poverty decreased from 34.1% to 32.7%,
while inequality decreased slightly, as the national-level Gini coefficient declined from 0.548
to 0.539. The Government is mindful of the fact that greater reductions in inequality will
strengthen the link between growth and poverty reduction.
The Government is convinced that the most important challenge for the country's
development continues to be overcoming poverty and reducing inequality. Accordingly, in its
development plan "Prosperity for All," the Government notes that the road to prosperity for
all must be built on a reduction of the regional inequities and opportunity gaps that exist in
Colombia.
For this reason, the National Government presented to Congress the fiscal reform, approved
by Law 1607 of December of 2012, with the concrete objective of bringing prosperity to each
Colombian citizen. This objective, cutting across all policy initiatives of the current
administration, is reflected by the two pillars of the reform: equality and formalization. This
historical initiative is the first reform to the tax system in over 20 years with an objective that
goes beyond tax collection to address two of the most fundamental problems in the country:
inequality and informality. Indeed, Colombia is one of the most unequal countries in the
world in terms of income, as measured by any methodology, and one of the countries with the
highest level of labor informality.
The first objective of this reform consists of substituting taxes on employment for taxes on
profits, to incentivize formal employment creation. As incentives for capital have been
successfully used in past years to increase the investment rate to record levels, this reform
focuses on incentivizing the creation of modern and formal employment as an indispensable
requirement to reduce inequality. Starting in May 2013, the tax reform exempted employers
from making contributions for the parafiscales (SENA and ICBF) and from health
contributions on behalf of private sector workers with an income of less than 10 times the
minimum wage. This measure reduces employers' payroll taxes by more than 40%, from
29.5% to 16%. At the same time, to avoid affecting the operation and continuity of the social
programs funded by payroll taxes, the reform introduced the CREE, a tax of 8% on capital
gains.
The second objective of this reform was to create a fairer tax system, in which the base of the
pyramid, 18 million people earning less than COP$3.6 million (US$1,960) per month, would
not pay income taxes, while those earning more than COP$10 million (US$5,500) monthly,
42


﻿barely 92 thousand individuals, would pay slightly more. Indeed, before the reform, the
average tariff for taxpayers was lower for those with high wages than for those with lower
labor earnings: workers who earned less than COP$1.5 million had tariffs between 5% and
6%, while those who earned more than 9 minimum wages paid effective taxes of only 3% to
4%. With the reform, the IMAN (Alternative Minimum Tax) was created as a mandatory
system to define a minimum income tax, which allows workers to deduct from their income
only the mandatory contributions to social security and, in general, expenses related to
compensations, insurance, and catastrophic loses. Thus, although workers will continue doing
their tax returns through the standard system, the final tax cannot be lower than that obtained
through IMAN. And, in addition to other measures, the reform introduced a consumption tax
on luxury goods, such as boats and high-end cars.
The third objective of the reform is to simplify the VAT structure, reducing the number of
rates from seven to three and creating significant relief for agricultural producers, who will
benefit from the reduction or elimination of VAT to their inputs.
With this historical reform, designed to benefit the Colombian people, the country is expected
to gain between 400 thousand and 1 million modern and formal jobs. Moreover, Colombia
aspires to cease to be the second most unequal country in the region by closing, within a short
span of time, the distance to the regional average in terms of income distribution.
Another achievement of the National Government, aimed at decreasing inequality and
creating savings and investment mechanisms contributing to the conditions necessary to
support regional development, is the reform to the royalties system. With this reform,
approved in 2011, the country reduced the Gini coefficient of royalties distribution by 53
points. Previously, 80 percent of royalties reached nine departamentos, representing 19
percent of the country's population. Currently, every one of the 32 departamentos in the
country receives resources from royalties through their participation in the Regional
Development, Regional Compensation, and Science, Technology and Innovation Funds. At
the same time, producing departamentos, municipalities, and ports continue their important
participation within the new redistribution.
To contribute to intergenerational equity, and as a result of the reform, the territorial entities
will reserve a share of royalties to stabilize investment when resources grow scarcer, thus
maintaining public spending over time. Likewise, by investing the royalties, the entities will
develop public works to improve the quality of life of their citizens and the competitiveness of
regions. At the same time, the role of the Organos Colegiados de Administracion y Decision
(OCADs) in approving and monitoring investment projects will contribute to enhanced
coordination between the different levels of government (national and regional), reflected in a
work agenda that develops a vision of regional development in the medium term.
The Government recognizes that a reform of this character represents a great challenge. Thus,
it is working to achieve enhanced institutional coordination, provide training and capacity
building to territorial entities, and oversee each step of the implementation of the General
System of Royalties.
Moreover, the National Development Plan "Prosperity for All 2010-2014" notes that the
country requires a System of Old Age Protection (Sistema de Proteccion para la Vejez, SPV).
43


﻿Such a system must be universal, inclusive, and equitable, seeking to gradually increase the
coverage of the current mechanisms of old age protection, and ensuring that more and more
people improve their living conditions at the end of their productive cycle through personal
effort and through solidarity schemes defined by the Law. In this context, the National
Government has centered its public policy actions, framed in the Complementary Social
Services which aim to contribute to improve quality of life by protecting the vulnerable
population from contingencies that could affect the end of their productive life, on
strengthening the Social Protection Program for Old Age, now known as Colombia Mayor.
This program has the main objective of protecting the elderly against the economic risk of
being unable to generate an income and the associated risk of social exclusion. New operating
rules have thus been established, including the expansion of coverage to older individuals, in
particular, the automatic entry of individuals of 100 years of age or more and prioritized entry
for individuals of more than 81 years of age, as well as for the elderly residing in Centers of
Welfare for the Elderly and indigenous residents in legally constituted shelters.
The fight against poverty and inequality and the promotion of the country's socioeconomic
development are both strengthened by actions that guarantee the effective enjoyment of
human rights. Thus, the country has carried out institutional adjustments and built a new
framework to promote gender equity, in response to the inequality and discrimination
experienced by women in Colombia. The policy document on Gender Equity for Women
(Conpes Social 161) was launched in March of the present year. The document includes
actions, developed in a participatory fashion, to promote women's (i) economic autonomy, (ii)
education, (iii) social and political participation, (iv) health, (v) freedom from violence, and
(vi) to achieve a cultural transformation and build peace. In line with this framework to
guarantee women the full enjoyment of their rights, Decree 2734 was enacted in December
2012, establishing procedures, responsible institutions, and resources for women who are
victims of violence.
Lastly, it is important to highlight the Government's efforts to improve open access to
information and to improve the levels of transparency in its financial and budgetary
management. Measures to improve transparency have included expanding the reach of the
Integrated System of Financial Information (Sistema Integrado de Informacion Financiera,
SIIF) in the Economic Transparency Portal, by incrementally adding information on budget
execution, national expenditures, and incomes.
With the objective of continuing to strengthen policies that help ensure a sustained growth
rate, generate more jobs, reduce the levels of poverty and inequality, and thus improve the
living conditions of the population, the Government of Colombia is requesting from the
World Bank a Development Policy Loan for Enhancing Fiscal Capacity to Promote Shared
Prosperity. This loan will support six key policy areas: (i) more progressive tax policy and
administration, (ii) the strengthening of interregional equity and subnational government
capacity, (iii) improved focus of social spending on the elderly, (iv) the strengthening of the
Government's capacity to attend to women who are victims of violence, (v) enhanced
transparency in access to information on budgetary and financial management, and (vi)
improvement in the monitoring of poverty and other social indicators.

﻿ANNEX 4: FUND RELATIONS NOTE46
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund today approved a new two-year
arrangement for Colombia under the Flexible Credit Line (FCL) in an amount equivalent to
SDR 3.87 billion (about US$5.84 billion). The Colombian authorities indicated that they
intend to treat the new arrangement as precautionary and do not intend to draw on the line.
Colombia's first FCL was approved on May 11, 2009 (see Press Release No. 09/161) and two
successor arrangements were approved on May 7, 2010 (see Press Release No. 10/186) and
May 6, 2011 (see Press Release No. 11/165)
Following the Executive Board discussion of Colombia, Mr. David Lipton, First Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chairman of the Board, made the following statement:
"Colombia has very strong policy frameworks, comprising an inflation-targeting regime, a
flexible exchange rate, effective financial sector supervision and regulation, and a fiscal
policy guided by a structural balance rule for the Central Government. The authorities also
have a sustained track record of implementation of very strong policies, which have
underpinned strong economic performance in recent years. Looking ahead, the authorities are
firmly committed to maintaining such policies and to undertaking further initiatives-
including the recently-approved tax reform-to bolster growth, reduce inequality, and further
increase economic resilience.
"Colombia's macroeconomic policies provided resilience to the global financial crisis and
supported a strong recovery and gradual rebuilding of policy buffers. The exchange rate has
played a key shock-absorbing role, and the financial system has remained stable. The
authorities have also taken advantage of strong capital inflows to partially rebuild their
international reserve position.
"However, risks to the global economic outlook remain elevated, and if they materialized,
they would affect Colombia's economy and external accounts. Access to the Fund's Flexible
Credit Line (FCL) instruments will continue to play an important role in supporting the
authorities' macroeconomic strategy if that were to happen. A successor arrangement, which
the authorities intend to continue to treat as precautionary, will help Colombia to effectively
manage potential shocks and sustain strong economic performance, while the authorities
continue strengthening their policy framework and rebuilding policy buffers."
Background on the Flexible Credit Line:
The FCL was established on March 24, 2009 and further enhanced on August 30, 2010 (see
Press Release No. 09/85 and 10/321). The FCL is available to countries with very strong
fundamentals, policies, and track records of policy implementation and is particularly useful
for crisis prevention purposes. FCL arrangements are approved for countries meeting pre-set
qualification criteria. The FCL is a renewable credit line, which could be approved for either
one or two years. Two-year arrangements involve a review of eligibility after the first year. If
the country draws on the credit line, the repayment period is between three and five years.

IMF Press Release No.13/229, June 24, 2013. (To be updated).

﻿There is no cap on access to Fund resources under the FCL, and access is determined on a
case-by-case basis. Qualified countries have the full amount available up-front, with no
ongoing conditions. There is flexibility to either draw on the credit line at the time it is
approved, or treat it as precautionary.

﻿ANNEX 5. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT47
1.     The PSIA, developed according to World Bank guidelines, is designed to provide
a robust analysis of the positive outcomes on equity of the policy actions outlined in the
DPL. It documents the expected impacts of each of the policy actions with potential non-
trivial outcomes in each one of the key concepts of equity: horizontal equity in the tax
structure and regional equity through the reform of the royalties system, better targeting of
social spending including life-cycle equity and gender equity, and broader policies to support
transparency, quality of information and accountability in the execution of the public budget
and reporting of poverty and social welfare outcomes.
2.     Quantitative and qualitative analyses specific to the policies evaluated were
performed, and information was gathered from literature reviews and interviews with
officials from the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MHCP), Department of National
Planning (DNP), Alta Consejeria Presidencial para la Equidad de la Mujer (Presidential
Council for Women's Equity) and key stakeholders. Through collaboration and the provision
of evidence, the PSIA was used to strengthen the policy dialogue with Government of
Colombia (GoC) counterparts.
3.     Social inequality remains high and is constraining poverty reduction in Colombia
making the promotion of equity a policy priority. Divergent from most countries in Latin
America, income inequality in Colombia increased sharply in the 1990s and 2000s making it
among the least-equal countries in the world.48 This level of inequality is an impediment to
poverty eradication as the rate of poverty reduction in Colombia is low compared to its
regional peers given its economic growth. In order to promote the virtuous cycle of shared
prosperity, of which equity and growth are key outcomes, and to eliminate extreme poverty,
equity must be a policy priority. This priority is reflected in the strategies and goals of the
GoC National Development Plan (Plan Nacional de Desarrollo, PND) "Prosperity for All
2010-2014" (Prosperidad para Todos 2010-2014).
4.     The Government policies supported by the Colombia Enhancing Fiscal Capacity
to Promote Shared Prosperity Development Policy Loan (DPL P145605) are expected to
have a positive poverty and social impact. In line with the loan's main objective of
promoting shared prosperity, there are reasons to expect a positive impact from each of the
supported reforms. The prior actions of equitable tax policy and inter-regional equity are
expected to reduce income. The prior actions of better targeting of social spending are
expected to reduce poverty in old age and improve the living conditions of women who were
victims of gender violence by means of a more efficient allocation of resources towards
vulnerable populations. Finally, the prior actions related to open access to national financial
management information systems and monitoring of poverty and other social indicators are
expected to promote transparency and accountability in government leading to the more

Tania Diaz-Bazan (ETC, LCSPP), Ted Enamorado (Consultant), Gabriel Lara Ibarra (ETC, PRMPR) and Mary Alexander

﻿efficient use of resources and the ability to reliably track progress and evaluate the impact of
policy reforms.
5.     The PSIA summarizes the main results of studies analyzing the potential effects
on poverty, inequality and labor market outcomes of the tax and royalties reforms as
well as polices to better targeting of social spending. A qualitative study on the policy area
of gender equity is planned for the supervision stage of this DPL. Finally, the policy areas
related to transparency and accountability have less of a direct impact on social outcomes and
thus are out of the scope of the analytical work of this PSIA. However, these policy areas
clearly do not have a negative impact on social outcomes and will most likely promote shared
prosperity in Colombia. This annex provides further details and explanations on the analyses
undertaken and the documentation of impacts.
I. IMPROVING HORIZONTAL EQUITY IN THE TAX STRUCTURE AND INTER-
REGIONAL EQUITY THROUGH THE REFORM OF THE ROYALTIES SYSTEM
POLICY AREA I: MORE EQUITABLE TAX POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION
Prior Action 1: The GoC has improved the progressivity of its tax system by: (i) establishing an
alternative income tax; (ii) introducing a luxury tax; and (iii) simplifying the value-added tax, as
evidenced by the issuance of the Borrower's Law No. 1607, dated December 26, 2012, duly
published in the Borrower's Official Gazette on December 26, 2012.
6.     Fiscal redistribution can help combat the high levels of income inequality in
Colombia. One reason for Colombia's inequality is the limited redistributive capacity of the
country's fiscal system. Following methodology developed by Lustig, et. al (2013), Figure
A5.1 shows the redistributive capacity of the Colombia fiscal system relative to other Latin
American countries. For example, Colombia and Brazil start from an almost identical level of
inequality (0.575 and 0.574, respectively), as measured by market income.49 After applying
the current tax and transfers structure, however, Brazil's Gini coefficient is considerably
lower. Indeed, once direct and indirect taxes and transfers and subsidies are taken into
account-the Gini coefficient of the so-called post-fiscal income-is 0.569 for Colombia and
0.541 for Brazil.50 If cash and in-kind transfers through public spending are considered, the
difference is striking, with the final income Gini at 0.535 for Colombia and 0.438 for Brazil.
These results suggest that the potential for fiscal redistribution in Colombia remains largely
untapped.
49 Market income refers to wages and salaries, income from capital, private transfers; before government taxes, social
security contributions and transfers. For details on the methodology, see Lustig, et al. (2013).
50 Subtracting direct taxes and employee contributions to social security from market income gives net income. Adding direct
transfers results in disposable income; once indirect subsidies have been added and indirect transfers subtracted, the result is
Post Fiscal Income.

7.     The tax reform    of December 2012 aims to improve progressivity in the tax
structure through changes in both direct and indirect taxes. The new alternative income
tax (Impuesto Minimo Alternativo Nacional, IMAN) levies higher tax rates on the top 0.6
percent of the income distribution than under the previous system, while the remaining 99.4
percent of taxpayers are expected to face lower taxes than previously. To improve the
progressivity of consumption taxes, a higher rate on "luxury" goods was introduced to the
value-added tax (VAT) structure, allowing rates for other goods and services to be lowered
without decreasing revenues. At the same time, the VAT structure was streamlined to cut
down on administrative and compliance costs.
8.     The PSIA    relied on three analyses to determine the potential distributional
effects of the tax reform. The first is a simulation performed by Lustig et al. (2013) of the
poverty and inequality effects of changes in the tax structure related to both IMAN and VAT
using the Encuesta de Calidad de Vida (Survey on Living Conditions, ECV) and
implementing the methodology of the Commitment to Equity Assessment (CEQ) (see Box
A5. 1). The second analysis attempts to resolve the underlying problem of studies that only use
household income to analyze changes in the Gini5'-the exclusion of the top earners from
household surveys.52 By incorporating data from both tax records and the Gran Encuesta
Integrada de Hogares (GEIH) the full income distribution is considered to best capture the
distributional impact of IMAN reforms (see Box A5.2). The third analysis uses data from the
Encuesta Nacional de Ingresos y Gastos (National Household Income and Expenditure
s E.g., Gasparini L., G. Cruces, and L. Tornarolli, 2009, "Recent trends in income inequality in Latin America", Society for
the Study of Economic Inequality.
52 For some studies, the reverse is true, with the focus only on top earners. E.g., Atkinson, Anthony B., Thomas Piketty, and

﻿Survey, ENIG) and the ECV 2011 to assess the changes in tax revenue and the distributional
impact of the VAT reforms based on a micro-simulation model (LATAX) that was recently
used to study the impact of tax reforms in Mexico and El Salvador (see Box A5.3).
Box A5.1. Simulation of the tax reform (CEQ methodology)
Lustig et al. (2013) perform a simulation of the effects of the tax reform using the ECV 2010. The
analysis was developed in the context of the loan preparation, using the CEQ methodology. This
methodology uses standard incidence analysis to provide insight into the effects on redistribution and
poverty reduction of policy reforms. A step-by-step guide to this methodology is provided by Lustig
and Higgins (2012).53
Limitations and assumptions: (i) All independent workers who report labor income below 1548
UVT are assumed to receive back 11 percent of their income; (ii) the minimum tax for all workers
who report labor income over 1548 UVT is calculated using the IMAN table; the rent tax is substituted
for this estimated value, when the reported one is lower; and (iii) if the expenditure on a product that
had changes in VAT is packaged with the consumption of other products for which VAT did not
change, the previous VAT rate is the one taken into account.
Box A5.2. Distributional Impact of IMAN reforms (top earners)
To assess the tax revenues and the distributional impact of the IMAN reform, the study uses data from
tax records and a household survey. The tax records cover the right tail of the income distribution
(since only individuals who earn a high enough income have to file taxes), while the household survey
covers the left tail of the income distribution. Household surveys are generally not representative of
the top section of the income distribution. The income distributions from Gran Encuesta Integrada de
Hogares (GEIH 2011) and administrative data from tax records from DIAN (2010) are thus combined.
Certain individuals who are in the surveys are also in the administrative record; thus individuals with
total incomes greater than 3300 UVT (Decree 4929 Art 8-time period to declare tax on income) are
eliminated from the GEIH to create a single income distribution. The Gini and fiscal collection are
then calculated using the composite distribution.

﻿Limitations and assumptions: (i) The Gini coefficient is estimated only for those workers who report
having labor income; that is, the estimation corresponds to a labor income Gini; (ii) the analysis is
based on GEIH raw data, not on MESEP data (currently used for poverty and inequality estimations);
(iii) the estimation does not account for changes in the tax declarations as an answer to the change in
the legislation; and (iv) it is assumed that all individuals pay IMAN according to their income-that is,
tax evasion is not accounted for.
Box A5.3. Assessment of the distributional impact of the VAT
The methodology applied to analyze the distributional impact of the reform of the VAT is
based on a micro-simulation model, LATAX. This platform was originally developed to
analyze tax and benefit reforms in Mexico, based on models developed by experts at the
Institute of Fiscal Studies in the United Kingdom. The expanded LATAX model has been
implemented in two Latin American countries, Mexico and El Salvador, to assess their tax
reforms in 2010 and 2011, respectively.54 The program identifies changes in tax revenue and
the distributional impact of tax reforms, assuming that households do not modify their
behavior as a consequence of changes in the tax system. In addition, the model allows the
simulation of the reaction of the households through behavioral changes along some specific
dimensions. To assess the distributional impact of the Colombian tax reform, the study uses
the survey on living conditions (ECV 2011) that collects household information on net
income and household expenditures, as well as the household income and expenditure survey
(ENIG). It simulates the Colombian tax system according to the tax code and produces results
for the status quo, the proposed tax reform, and the approved tax reform.
Limitations and assumptions: (i) The program does not model household or individual
responses to changes in wage rates and prices; (ii) it is assumed that all individuals conducting
transactions pay the VAT; and (iii) the data underestimate households with high
consumption-robustness checks are being applied.
9.     Within Prior Action 1, the implementation of IMAN and the reforms to the VAT
structure which reduce administrative and compliance costs and introduce a new luxury
tax are expected to contribute to greater equity.
10.    The results of the first study, the Commitment to Equity Assessment (CEQ),
indicate that the tax reform will have a positive impact on decreasing income inequality,
as well as on poverty reduction. In particular, Lustig et al. (2013) find the Gini coefficient
would decrease from 0.535 to 0.534, while moderate poverty (using US$4 PPP) is estimated
to drop from 33.4 to 33 percent, and extreme poverty from 18.2 to 17.7 percent (see Figure
A5.2). However, since this methodology does not contemplate top earners, is likely to
underestimate the effect of the reforms
54 See Abramovsky L., 0. Attanasio, and D. Phillips, 201 1a. "A tax micro-simulator for Mexico (MEXTAX) and its
application to the 2010 tax reforms"; and Abramovsky L., 0. Attanasio, and D. Phillips. 2011b. "Demand responses to

11.    The second study, which takes into account the full income distribution
(including top earners), finds larger redistributive impacts of the tax reform. Results
show that with the changes regarding IMAN, the Gini coefficient of market income of a
distribution that include top earners will decline in almost one percentage point (from 0.586 to
0.579), while fiscal collection will stay the same (see Tables A5.1 and A5.2). This reduction
of the Gini is not trivial, considering, for example, the average yearly reduction of the Gini in
Latin American countries (1.2 percent annually) over the last 10 years (Lustig et al. 2012).

12.    The third study following the LATAX        methodology shows little change in
inequality while revenues collected may fall as a result of the VAT reforms. Inequality as
measured by the Gini using consumption data does not change by more than .0004 between
56


﻿any of the scenarios (status quo, the proposed reform, and the approved reform). Tax
collection falls when the approved tax reform is simulated, from 13.7 to 12.9 billions of COP
(see Tables A5.3 and A5.4). While these results do not support the equity aspect of this
reform, they do not indicate a decrease in equity; we are continuing to check their robustness.
Furthermore, they do not take into account the reduced administrative and compliance costs
of streamlining the tax structure, which makes more funds available for social spending.

Prior Action 2: The GoC has reduced the cost of formal employment creation by: (i) reducing
firms' payroll contribution for employees with salaries below ten minimum monthly wages; and
(ii) creating a new tax on corporate profits, as evidenced by the issuance of the Borrower's Law
No. 1607, dated December 26, 2012, duly published in the Borrower's Official Gazette on
December 26, 2012.
13.    In terms of Prior Action 2, the reduction of firms' payroll contributions and the
introduction of a new tax on corporate profits are expected to contribute to the creation
of formal jobs and an increase in labor earnings. Incentivizing the creation of formal jobs
will increase equity in Colombia where labor informality is pervasive55 and unemployment
levels remain high, especially among the extreme poor.
14.    A dynamic general equilibrium model was used to evaluate the effects of the
fiscal reform on labor markets. The methodology used follows a dynamic general
equilibrium model with capital accumulation, tax evasion, and occupational choice along the
lines of Lucas (1978)56 and Ant6n and Leal (2012)57 (see Box A5.4). Calibrated to match key
features of the Colombian economy using data collected before the fiscal reform approved in
December 2012, the study focuses on the potential effects of the cut in paraftscales on total
employment, the creation of new formal jobs, and on wages. The main source of employment-
related data is the GEIH for the second quarter of 2012. Simulations were performed to
measure the impact of a reduction in labor taxes under two scenarios: the corporate income
tax rate is kept at 33 percent (scenario A), and the corporate tax rate is 34 percent, reflecting
the 1 percent increase in the tax on corporate profits (Impuesto sobre la Renta para la
Equidad, CREE) (scenario B).
55 Labor informality is estimated to be -50-60 percent of the labor force

﻿Box A5.4. Effects of the fiscal reform on labor markets
The methodology is based on a dynamic general equilibrium model (see Lucas, 1978; and Ant6n and
Leal, 2012), with a representative multi-member family that maximizes lifetime utility. Family
members are endowed with "managerial abilities," and they may optimally choose to be an employee,
an own-account worker, or a full-time entrepreneur (employer). On the production side, firms require
capital, labor, and managerial ability to produce goods in a perfectly competitive environment. Each
firm is run by a full-time entrepreneur. Goods may also be produced by own-account workers using a
similar production technology. A government imposes three different taxes on firms: VAT, corporate
income, and contributory social insurance (CSI) taxes. Firms have an incentive to evade taxes, facing
an endogenous probability of being detected by the authority in doing so. This probability is
proportional to the firm's size, so that small-scale firms have a lower probability of being detected by
the fiscal authorities. If detected, firms must pay all taxes evaded plus a fine. The model also assumes
that fiscal authority cannot impose taxes on own-account workers, since it is difficult and costly for
the authority to monitor the economic activities of people working on their own.
A firm may choose to evade CSI taxes for all or some of its workers. If a firm does not cover CSI
taxes for a worker, that worker is labeled as informal; otherwise, the worker is formal. Given the
incentive structure, large firms will hire mostly formal workers as the probability of being detected
evading CSI taxes is larger. Small firms hire relatively more informal workers. This implication is
consistent with Mexican data, as discussed by Ant6n, Herndndez, and Levy (2012).8 Own-account
workers optimally choose not to pay CSI taxes and are thus classified as informal workers. As a result,
the possibility of evading CSI taxes gives place to the coexistence of formal and informal employees
in equilibrium.
Labor demand functions for formal and informal workers can be obtained from the firm's optimization
problem. These functions are affected by the tax structure in place, so that a change in any tax rate
may affect labor demand. Labor supply is endogenously provided by own-account workers and by
family members who choose to become employees: the household simultaneously chooses the
fraction of employees that provide services as formal and informal workers. Overall, the model
endogenously yields labor supply and demand functions for both formal and informal workers, and
computes the equilibrium wage rate in each market. This structure is suitable to estimate the effects of
changes in the tax structure on formal and informal workers as well as on average wages.
For this study, the model is calibrated for the Colombian economy using a reference year of either
2012 or 2011, depending on data availability. Some parameter values in the model are either
observable or taken from the academic literature; others are non-observable and parameters are chosen
so that the model replicates some relevant moments observed in the data. These moments include
(among others) the average number of workers per establishment; the average number of workers in
establishments with 100 or more workers; the fraction of own-account workers in the labor force; and
the revenue of VAT taxes as a share of GDP.
Limitations and assumptions: (i) Government employees were excluded as the focus of the analysis
is on private agents; (ii) salaried workers are considered formal if they are affiliated with a
contributory health system (Entidades Promotoras de Salud) and they also contribute to a pension
fund; (iii) the model includes the change in financing from labor to corporate income for SENA,
ICBF, and employer's contributions to health care; and (iv) a 9 percent of benchmark wage rate
transfer is also assumed to be given to formal workers as a lump sum to compensate for the fall in
transfers due to the change in the labor tax in the form of SENA and health care.

Insurance", Inter-American Development Bank.

﻿15.    The results of the simulations show    that the tax reform    increases salaried
employment and total employment. Under scenario A, salaried employment increases more
(7.9 percent) than under scenario B (7.1 percent), but own-account and informal employment
both decrease more under A than under B; thus there is a greater increase in total employment
under scenario B (0.5 percent) than under scenario A (0.3 percent) (see Table A5.5). Because
the reform makes salaried labor less expensive, the demand for salaried workers increases,
decreasing own-account employment. Excluding informal salaried workers shows that formal
salaried employment increases by over 10 percent under both scenarios. While the total effect
is greater under scenario B, individual effects are muted: raising the corporate tax partially
offsets the increased demand in labor that results from decreasing the labor tax, while also
partially offsetting the decrease in own-account employment as some employers may choose
to become own-account workers to avoid the corporate tax. Increased total and formal
employment as a result of decreased labor taxes with and without an increase in corporate
taxes indicates that this reform is unambiguously expected to enhance equity.
16.    The model also predicts an increase in wages as a consequence of the reduction of
the payroll tax. Both formal wage earners and employers see a rise in average earnings of 4
percent or greater as a result of the tax reform under both scenarios (see Table A5.5). While
own-account earnings change the least, they still rise by over 2.5 percent. In every case but
employers, earnings under scenario B rise less than under scenario A as some of the increase
in corporate tax is passed on to employees. The reasons earnings for employers increase more
under B than under A can be partially explained by the decrease in total employers under
scenario B as employers change to own-account workers. The increase in wages across
workers indicates the positive social impact of this reform: as rising incomes will contribute
to poverty reduction, and the creation of more, better-paying jobs will help reduce income
inequality.

17.    Regional inequality is persistent in Colombia. GDP per capita in the richest state in
2000 was 4.95 times that of the lowest, and in 2011 this ratio was 5.48, reflecting the high and
persistent level of disparity. Regional disparity is also reflected in the incidence of poverty
among smaller municipalities. While 29 percent of the population at large has one or more
unmet basic needs, this number increases to approximately 46 percent in municipalities with
less than 50,000 inhabitants.
18.    The reform of the royalties system aims to improve regional equity by allowing
poorer municipalities to access resources and carry out projects to foster regional
development. Forty percent of resources from the Regional Development Fund will be
distributed yearly according to how the level of poverty within each Departamento as
measured by the Index of Unsatisfied Basic Needs (Indice de Necesidades Basicas
Insatisfechas, NBI) compares to the national NBI. Resources from the Regional
Compensation Fund will also be distributed across Departamentos according to the poverty
headcount, relative unemployment rate, and NBI measures of relative poverty. Of these funds,
40 percent are to be used in financing projects of local impact.
19.    An income convergence analysis was carried out to measure the extent to which
poor Departamentos are catching up to rich Departamentos and to estimate the potential
effects on convergence of the royalties system reform. Similar to the work carried out on
regional convergence in Colombia by Cdrdenas and Pont6n (1995),59 the analysis is based on
Barro and Sala-i-Martin's concepts of absolute and conditional convergence.60 First, an
empirical analysis focuses on the trend of GDP convergence among Departamentos from
2000 to 2011, using GDP data deflated by the published regional GDP deflator from DANE.
This analysis determines whether initial levels of GDP are correlated with changes in GDP
over time. A negative correlation indicates that poorer regions are catching up with richer
regions. The standard deviation of GDP per capita of Departamentos by year is also analyzed
to check whether regional dispersion has increased or decreased. Furthermore, analyses of
conditional convergence using income and expenditure data from DNP and income under the
new system of royalties are implemented to analyze the role of past royalties in economic
convergence and potential effects of royalties reform on regional development patterns going
forward (see Box A5.5).

﻿Box A5.5. Regional convergence and prospective impacts of the royalties system reform
The objective of the study is twofold: (i) to present and discuss empirical evidence on regional
convergence or divergence in per capita income at the regional (Departamento) level in Colombia, and
(ii) to estimate convergence patterns, given recent changes in the formula of distribution of the
royalties system in Colombia.
The main analytical framework of this study is based on the contribution of Barro and Sala-i-Martin
(1991), although it is not limited to this work. The study analyzes regional development patterns at
three different levels. First, it reviews empirical evidence on absolute convergence in per capita
income within Colombian Departamentos. In doing this, it makes use of two different but
complementary concepts of convergence: the so-called -convergence and u-convergence. The first
concept emphasizes the negative relationship between initial levels of per capita income and the
growth rates of the same variable over a certain period, whereas the second one emphasizes the
evolution of a measure of dispersion (i.e., the coefficient of variation) of the per capita income
variable. In that sense, the first concept focuses on the existence of a catch-up effect, while the second
focuses on the reduction of dispersion across regions.
The second level of analysis focuses on the concept of conditional convergence. This analysis allows
us to identify the role of royalties and other federal transfers to subnational governments in the
regional convergence process over the recent past. The third level of analysis projects the convergence
pattern given the changes in the formula of distribution of royalties approved in 2012, which will take
effect progressively over the next years.
Combining the results from these three levels of analysis allows us to conclude whether there is an
intrinsic trend towards convergence in per capita income in Colombia; whether this process has been
hampered or accelerated by the convergence in some other fundamental variables; and what would be
the potential effects of the recent reform of the royalties system.
We conduct regression analysis of the following type to analyze absolute P-convergence:
-i Y"        a           + 3y                           1
and of the following type to analyze conditional P-convergence:
- 1     = a - /5 y1 _     - +3xi,, + ui,            (2)
where yi,, is the log of per capita income in state or region i in period t, x;,,,t is a conditioning variable,
U;,, is a stochastic term, and T is the length of the period under analysis.
u-convergence is the change in the standard deviation of GDP per capita of the Departamentos over
the time period.
Limitations and assumptions: (i) The period of analysis is restricted by data availability; (ii) all
variables (except royalties) continue the growth rate observed for the 2000-2011 period; (iii) royalties
are distributed according to the new formula (Regional Development Fund and the Compensation
Fund)- i.e. 2013 the funds will grow from 50 to 60%, in 2014 from 65 to 75%, and in 2015 from 75
to 80%; (iv) inflation of 3.5% (2014), 3.2% (2015), and 3% (2016); and (v) population projections are
used to calculate GDP per capita.
61


﻿20.   The regional convergence analysis shows that Departamentos have been
converging but that the past royalties system was a factor of divergence. The analysis of
absolute convergence shows that Departamentos are both becoming less disperse in terms of
per-capita GDP and that originally poorer Departamentos have been catching up to wealthier
ones. When the effects of royalties and transfers are included in the model, results from the
conditional convergence in per capita income study show that the previous royalties system
was a factor of divergence among Departamentos in Colombia during the 2000 to 20011
period.
21.   Prior Action 3 regarding the reform of the royalties system is expected to have a
positive impact on regional equity. In particular, the analysis shows that the new royalties
(regalias) system will achieve its objective of increasing the speed of convergence within the
country (Figure A5.3). The new royalties system is expected to become a factor of regional
convergence for the period 2012 to 2016, by accelerating the catch-up effect between poor
and rich Departamenlos (see Table A5.6). The status quo distribution implied that 20 percent
of resources were appropriated by nonproducing regions, while 80 percent would stay in
producing regions. The post-reform distribution will be the opposite: 80 percent of resources
will go to nonproducing regions and 20 percent to producing ones.

II. BETTER TARGETING OF SOCIAL SPENDING
POLICY AREA III: EQUITY IN SOCIAL SPENDING
Prior Action 4: The GoC has; (i) issued new rules for the operation of Colombia Mayor (ii)
increased the coverage and budget of Colombia Mayor, and (iii) reinforced the targeting of the
program towards old-age population under conditions of extreme or moderate poverty, as
evidenced by the Borrower's Ministry of Labor's Resolutions: (A) No. 1370, dated May 2, 2013;
and (B) No. 2958, dated November 23, 2012,
22.   The high rate of poverty among the elderly in Colombia distinguishes this group
as a particularly vulnerable segment of the population, especially given that the
productive assets of this group will only diminish over time. According to DANE, in 2012
the incidence of moderate poverty among households with a senior citizen (older than 65
years old) as the household head is 27.6%, but is almost double in rural areas (42.7%) with
respect to urban areas. More than a fourth of the elderly population works and of these
workers, 74 percent perceive incomes below one minimum wage. As the population share of
the elderly is increasing, it is becoming especially important to reduce the incidence of
poverty among this group.
23.   Stemming from Law 797 of 2003, the Social Protection Program for the Elderly
(Programa de Proteccidn Social at Adulto Mayor, PPSAM), or Colombia Mayor, was
created to protect the elderly population against living under conditions of poverty. The
GoC has increased the budget for expanding coverage and increasing the benefits of transfers
towards the elderly population. It has also established new mles of operation and reinforced
the targeting of the program towards the impoverished elderly. Currently, Colombia Mayor
benefits around one million elders living in extreme poverty and is expected to reach all of its
63


﻿target population of elders living in both extreme and moderate poverty (2.4 million people)
by 2015.
24.    A study conducted for the PSIA used a micro-simulation exercise to study the
potential impacts on poverty and inequality of the Colombia Mayor61 expansion in
coverage for the years 2013 and 2014. Using data from the GEIH 2011 and MESEP
database (DANE), the study creates estimations for employment, earnings, and the income
distribution for the years of interest, and uses these as a benchmark to estimate the changes in
poverty and inequality for the total population, the elderly population, and the income-poor
elderly population that result from simulated expansions in the Colombia Mayor program (see
Box A5.6). The three simulations involved (i) expanding coverage by 45,000 more
beneficiaries, (ii) expanding coverage by 137,000 more beneficiaries, and (iii) providing
universal coverage of beneficiaries (2.4 million total).
Box A5.6. Prospective effects on poverty and inequality of social spending reforms
The study estimates the potential impacts on poverty and inequality of the recent changes in Colombia
related to equity of social spending. The study focuses on the proposed expansion of the Colombia
Mayor program. The program provides monetary and in-kind benefits to seniors who earn very low
incomes or are living under conditions of poverty. In mid-2013, Colombia Mayor served
approximately one million senior Colombians and the number of beneficiaries is planned to increase to
2.4 million over the next five years.
A micro-simulation exercise is used to study the potential impacts of the Colombia Mayor expansion
between 2011 and the end of 2012. The analysis is conducted as follows: First, data from the GEIH
2011 is used to identify beneficiaries and potential beneficiaries of Colombia Mayor. Second we
calibrate the number of beneficiaries found in the survey to reflect the number of beneficiaries of the
program as of December 2011. Third, using the program requirements and prioritization rules, we
simulate the inclusion of new beneficiaries into the program. Fourth, we compare the income
distribution that arises from the simulated expansion of the program to the benchmark income
distribution obtained from the GEIH income data. This comparison helps to estimate changes in
poverty and inequality that result from the simulated expansion of Colombia Mayor and its effects on
the total population, the elderly population, and the members of the elderly population with incomes
below the poverty line.
Depending on data availability, the model defined above could be modified using results from other
micro-simulation models from recently proposed changes to the tax system. In particular, we will
explore the feasibility of incorporating the effects on disposable income of the implementation of the
IMAN and the VAT reforms.
Limitations and assumptions: (i) Partial equilibrium with no change in behavior (changes in the
labor supply of household members); (ii) the household survey identifies a smaller number of
beneficiaries; (iii) the household survey does not include SISBEN III (a proxy means test index widely
used as a targeting system for social programs in Colombia), only income-based strata; and (iv) to
estimate poverty rates we estimate a new poverty line for the projected years of interest to account for
potential price changes.
6'The program provides monetary and in-kind benefits to seniors who earn very low incomes or are in situation of poverty. In
mid-2013, Colombia Mayor served approximately 1 million senior Colombians and the number of beneficiaries is planned to
increase to 2.4 million in the next five years.
64


﻿25.    Prior Action 4, towards enhancing equity in social spending with a focus on the
elderly, is expected to have a positive impact on poverty reduction and inequality. In
particular, micro-simulations of the effect of changes in Colombia Mayor show a reduction in
poverty incidence for the population group of 65 years of age and older. Table A5.6 presents
results of the three simulations. The incidence of poverty among the age/strata eligible income
group changes substantially when universal coverage (simulation 3) is implemented. This is
not surprising, since the target group of beneficiaries using strata criteria is, by definition, in
poverty; therefore, allocating transfers to these people will have more impact on poverty than
if this targeting is not implemented. In fact, prioritization through targeting by age, income,
status as the household head, and whether the individual lives alone increases the number of
identified beneficiaries from 176,000 under existing institutions' identification to 672, 894
beneficiaries.

POLICY AREA IV: GENDER EQUITY
Prior Action 5: The GoC has mandated the provision of specific measures to protect women who
are victims of gender violence, such as provision of meals, transport and temporary housing, as
evidenced by: (i) the Borrower's Decree No. 2734, dated December 27, 2012, duly published in the
Borrower's Official Gazette on December 28, 2012; and (ii) the Borrower's Ministry of Health's
Resolution No. 459, dated March 6, 2012.
26.    Gender-based violence is prevalent in Colombia, reflecting the limited agency
women may have in society and at home. While domestic violence is notoriously
underreported, the estimates obtained from the Encuesta Nacional de Demografia y Salud
2010 (Demographic and Health Survey) still show that 37 percent of women reported
experiencing violence at the hands of their spouse or partner. Violence between partners
involves the victimization of women in the majority of cases. This reflects that agency may be
65


﻿restricted by gender which not only entails, in and of itself, inequity and a violation of basic
rights, but also impedes other development outcomes such as health, earnings, and can lead to
social and psychological problems for both abused women and child witnesses to abuse.
These far reaching implications make gender equality a crucial issue to address within the
country's equity agenda.
27.    Prior action 5 which supports legislature measures on the provision of specific
measures to protect victims of gender violence is expected to contribute to the reduction
of gender inequities. Key social assistance for victims of GBV and their children include
temporary services of housing, food and transportation to be granted by administrative and
judicial authorities such as the Comisarias de Familia, are expected to help reduce the
incidence of GBV. The recipients of this assistance are targeted through two mechanisms: 1)
the summary of service providers that specifies the effect on physical or mental health of
women related to the event of violence, and requirements of medical and/or psychological
treatment, and 2) the assessment made by the National Police of the particular risk that the
woman is a victim.
28.    Qualitative  work    is planned    to  better  understand   the   impact of the
implementation of the policy that mandates the provision of temporary housing, feeding,
and transportation for treatment of women victims of violence and/or their children. In
particular, the objective of the analysis will be to identify which implementation strategies
have proven successful and where there might be potential bottlenecks. Box A5.7 provides
some details of the proposed qualitative analysis.
Box A5.7. Proposed qualitative analysis on the effects of the implementation of the temporary
services for treatment of women victims of violence and/or their children
Drawing on a similar study in Brazil, the proposed analysis will consists of in-depth interviews with
recipients of these services from various socioeconomic groups in selected regions as well as with
service providers and staff from the implementation agencies (health sector staff, Comisarias de
Familia, and others).
Evidence from qualitative research in Brazil and other countries suggests that measures directly aimed
at domestic violence are more effective in settings where economic opportunities are greater and social
norms are less stringent, particularly in urban areas. In rural areas, where economic dependence on
partners is stronger and social norms more traditional, no impacts were found. Other studies have
identified additional barriers that might reduce the potential effectiveness of these types of programs:
economic dependence on the partner (and often the abuser), difficulties in physically accessing
services, and disparity in access to information on the domestic violence law, which often depends on
income level, education, age, and geographic location, enhancing the equity implications of the
outcome.
The qualitative work will focus on the following questions: (i) How are services being implemented
and how do different stakeholders cooperate and coordinate efforts? (ii) How do services address the
needs of women of different socioeconomic levels, age, ethnicity, marital status, geographical area,
etc.? (iii) How do users/beneficiaries, providers/implementers, and decision-makers perceive the
quality of the interventions? (iv) How can multiple interventions be linked effectively to leverage
impact? (v) What are critical bottlenecks in the process of providing these services? (vi) How well
equipped-with resources, capacity, and support from other institutions-are the implementing
institutions to address the needs of victims?

﻿III. IMPROVEMENTS IN CROSS CUTTING POLICIES THAT SUPPORT
TRANSPARENCY, QUALITY OF INFORMATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY
POLICY AREA V: OPEN ACCESS TO NATIONAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
INFORMATION SYSTEMS
Prior Action 6: The GoC has implemented measures to strengthen the operation of SIIF Nacion to
enhance transparency and accountability in the execution of the public budget, including, inter alia
the incorporation of data related to revenues and budget execution to the transparency portal
(Portal de Transparencia Economica), as evidenced by: (i) Letter No. 2-2013-026879, dated July
29, 2013; (ii) the Borrower's Decree No. 2674 of December 21, 2012, duly published in the
Borrower's Official Gazette on December 21, 2012; and (iii) the Borrower's Ministry of Finance's
Act. No. 16 of February 26, 2013.
29.    Enhancing transparency and accountability in the execution of the public budget
will ensure that funds are spent efficiently and in accordance with public priorities.
According to the calculations of the Ministry of Finance (MHCP), the implementation of SIIF
II is saving the Government around US$113 million annually; increased savings can be spent
on other services and goods, such as those that promote poverty reduction and shared
prosperity. Furthermore, greater transparency can ensure that the government is held
accountable for spending so that the social contract can be upheld.
POLICY AREA VI: MONITORING OF POVERTY AND OTHER SOCIAL
INDICATORS
Prior Action 7: The GoC has updated its methodology for the measurement of poverty through the
establishment of institutional arrangements for improving the quality, transparency and
replicability of poverty and other social indicators, as evidenced by: (i) the publication of
Document CONPES Social No. 150, dated May 28, 2012; and (ii) the establishment of: (A) the
Executive Committee for the Measurement of Monetary Poverty; and (B) the Executive Committee
for the Measurement of Multidimensional Poverty, through the issuance of DANE's Resolutions
No. 871 and 877, respectively, of August 24, 2012.
30.    Prior action 7 is expected to enhance the transparency, quality of information
and governance of the monitoring of poverty, inequality and other social welfare
indicators. The establishment of new institutional arrangements for the monitoring of social
indicators agreed by the GoC, academics and international organizations will be critical to
better inform future reform initiatives conductive to improve social welfare.
