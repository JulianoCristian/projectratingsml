{"cdata!": "The Government of Colombia (GoC) has\n            identified teenage pregnancy as a priority issue. The\n            current strategic framework to address teenage pregnancy in\n            Colombia is outlined in the CONPES 147, effective from\n            February 2012 until March 2014. The CONPES 147 establishes a\n            multi-sectoral framework that aims to address the\n            determining factors of teenage pregnancy within Colombia\n            (Box 1).  The national strategy outlined in the CONPES 147\n            was piloted in 192 municipalities for youth ages 10 through\n            19.  Building on this strategy, the Commission for the\n            Guarantee of Sexual and Reproductive Rights is developing a\n            new framework to guide the government\u2019s policy and\n            activities to address this important policy issue in the\n            coming years.  Parallel to its work on teenage pregnancy,\n            the GoC released a national strategic framework to generate\n            opportunities for Colombian youth in July 2014. The note\n            includes an overview of the WDR 2012 gender equality\n            framework and World Bank regional study on teenage\n            pregnancy; outlines the Colombian country context with\n            regard to gender equality and youth labor market outcomes;\n            reviews interventions that develop life skills; and\n            highlights how these interventions might be relevant to the\n            GoC policies and programs related to teenage pregnancy\n            prevention (CONPES 147) and youth labor (CONPES 173)."}, "docdt": "2015-06-25T00:33:01Z"}
