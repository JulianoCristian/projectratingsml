outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: this operation is a good illustration of the\n            Bank\u2019s ability to produce a cross-sectoral response to a\n            Borrower\u2019s cross-sectoral demand. The Bank fully capitalized\n            on a unique window of opportunity that opened as a result of\n            the high priority being given to equity by Colombian\n            authorities and the passage of critical reforms focusing on\n            various dimensions of equity. The Bank made an important\n            contribution to the dialogue on equity and poverty in\n            Colombia with the robust analytical work produced under the\n            PSIA and the high-policy level discussions during the\n            Colombia Equity Day. This, in turn, has allowed the Bank to\n            continue to play an active role in key poverty and equity\n            related forums beyond the operation\u2019s lifetime, such as the\n            executive committee on multi-dimensional poverty. Sound\n            governance, including clear assignment of responsibilities\n            across government agencies, is critical for effective and\n            sustainable M&E of poverty and equity dimensions. In the\n            case of this DPL, this is positively illustrated by the\n            successful implementation of enhanced governance mechanisms\n            to ensure the soundness, transparency and replicability of\n            poverty measures. Conversely, the lack of an\n            institutionalized M&E mechanism to measure the\n            distributive impact of the fiscal reform hampered its measurement."}, "docdt": "2015-10-14T00:38:02Z"}
