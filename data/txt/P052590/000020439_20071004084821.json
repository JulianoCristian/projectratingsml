principal ratings for the Argentina\n            National Highways Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project are\n            as follows: the outcome was moderately satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was moderate, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the borrower performance\n            was moderately satisfactory. Some of the lessons learned\n            from the project include the following: performance-based\n            contracts for road maintenance, such as the CREMA contracts,\n            are an efficient tool of maintenance management, and likely\n            to be useful to other countries looking for ways to increase\n            the effectiveness of their road maintenance management\n            systems; A road maintenance strategy should include a menu\n            of management options with maintenance carried out by the\n            private sector, thus improving efficiency and reducing the\n            extent of maintenance carried out by government personnel;\n            and project components which are fully locally-financed are\n            useful parts of a project as they provide a more complete\n            perspective of the sector assisted by a project, yet they\n            are difficult to monitor."}, "docdt": "2007-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
