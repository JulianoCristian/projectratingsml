Re:
Loan No. 4295-AR (National Highways Rehabilitation and 
Maintenance Project) Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Dear Sir:
Please refer to the Loan Agreement between International Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development (the Bank) and the Argentine Republic (the Borrower) dated October 20, 
1998 (the Loan Agreement) with regard to the above-captioned Loan.  We are pleased to 
inform you that, pursuant to your request and our recent discussions on the subject, 
the Bank agrees to amend the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1  to the Loan Agreement 
by replacing the figure "68%" in Category (1) thereof with the words "83% of 
expenditures incurred during the period beginning on January 1, 1999 and ending on 
June 30, 2000; 68% of all other expenditures".
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment by signing and dating 
this letter in the spaces provided below.  This amendment letter may be executed in 
two counterparts, each of which shall be an original.  Upon your confirmation, please 
return one fully executed original to us.  The provisions of this amendment letter 
will become effective as of January 1, 1999 upon receipt by the Bank of one fully 
executed original of this amendment letter.  This means, inter alia, that the Borrower 
may submit supplemental withdrawal applications to the Bank, to receive additional 
reimbursement for said Category (1) expenditures which were incurred after January 1, 
1999 and have already been reimbursed by the Bank at the original 68% rate.
Very truly yours,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
   AND DEVELOPMENT
