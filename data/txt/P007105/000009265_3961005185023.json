"versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "3730", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The central thrust of the Irrigation\n            Subsector Technical Assistance Project is to assist the\n            Government in undertaking the process of modernization of\n            the irrigation subsector, the major user of water resources\n            in the country. The required institutional reform will be\n            addressed sequentially, first by streamlining the normative\n            and regulatory role of the public sector in the development\n            of the irrigation subsector. This will be accompanied by\n            actions to initiate a process of decentralization and\n            privatization, in which existing regional institutions will\n            be strengthened to effectively assume the lead role in\n            assisting user organizations to take over the management of\n            existing public irrigation systems. Once these subsectors\n            reforms are underway, the project will promote the\n            incorporation of other subsectors (urban water supply,\n            hydro-electricity) in order to establish a sustainable and\n            integrated approach to water resource policies and\n            management in the country. From a legal standpoint, the\n            current Water Law does not restrict the implementation of\n            the proposed restructuring of institutions involved in\n            irrigation. If required, the reform process will thus be\n            carried out initially through administrative mechanisms, to\n            be later formalized within the revised new Water Law. Such\n            legislation will also complement the broader policy reforms\n            currently being adopted by the Ministry of Agriculture. A\n            second key element of the project will be the development of\n            a comprehensive set of technical, economic and environmental\n            criteria to be applied in the prioritization and selection\n            of future public investments in irrigation. These criteria\n            will form the basis for the analysis of all existing\n            irrigation works to determine those that objectively merit\n            investments for completion and/or rehabilitation. As a\n            result, an important output of the technical assistance to\n            be provided under the proposed project will be the full\n            preparation of a medium-term Investment Plan, to be\n            implemented within the legal and operational framework\n            developed during the project."}, "docdt": "1994-04-19T00:00:00Z"}
