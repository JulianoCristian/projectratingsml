institutional\n            development impacts were only modest. Lessons are as\n            follows. While the project focus was to provide technical\n            assistance (TA) for the irrigation sub-sector, the project\n            did nonetheless help in restructuring, organizing, and\n            strengthening institutions, in formulating policy, and\n            proposing, and drafting laws for the overall water sector.\n            Such program objectives are difficult to implement within a\n            TA project at the sub-sectoral level, but the requirement of\n            a sectoral project initiative does lead to successful\n            sectoral reform implementation. Moreover, the provision of\n            TA as part of the transfer (privatization) process - of\n            public irrigation systems to user groups (WUAs), as in this\n            case - was the critical ingredient, and catalyst for\n            motivating farmers, a success attributed among others, to\n            the TA in agricultural, and engineering aspects of better\n            farm management, combined with rehabilitation works,\n            interventions that significantly raised the value added of\n            small farm production units. However, given that existing\n            WUAs had been created specifically for the purpose of tariff\n            collection, most members did not consider them as legitimate\n            community organizations, and participation was thus low and\n            weak. But the key element in making the transfer process\n            effective was the adoption of WUAs democratic management\n            practices, enhancing an active participation which\n            contributed to the project's success. It is suggested\n            that reorganization of existing institutions should have an\n            education component, as well as incentive mechanisms."}, "docdt": "2001-12-26T00:00:00Z"}
