Project for Georgia were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: in projects\n            which involve public sector reform activities, such as\n            hospital restructuring, the importance of effective and far\n            reaching public information campaigns cannot be\n            underestimated. This is particularly critical before the\n            start of reform activities, in order to promote buy-in and\n            ownership of change activities. In this process, although\n            specific and targeted focus can rest on the stakeholders who\n            will be most affected by the change, an effort can also be\n            made to obtain buy-in from champions in key stakeholder\n            groups. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is essential in\n            order to track indicators and assess their performance. In\n            so doing, it will be possible to make necessary changes,\n            such as re-define indicator-targets in line with reality on\n            the ground, or modify indicators so that they are closely\n            linked with activities. In order for this process to take\n            place effectively, however, outcome and output indicators\n            must be tightly constructed and linked with both baseline\n            and target data. In addition, it is also very important that\n            due cognizance is taken of the information system that\n            underlies the M&E framework. Finally, supervision\n            missions must take their responsibility to monitor and\n            report back on progress toward attaining agreed indicators\n            during the life of a project very seriously."}, "docdt": "2007-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
