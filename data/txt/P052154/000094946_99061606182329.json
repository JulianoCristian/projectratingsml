sectors in delivering key services in\n            Georgia. The program provides support to the key reform\n            measures included in the Third Structural Adjustment Credit\n            (SAC 3) (report number P7316) and Energy Sector Adjustment\n            Credit (ESAC). The project has four main components. The\n            first component supports the establishment of a revolving\n            hospital restructuring fund, whereby the proceeds from the\n            sale of excess hospitals will be reinvested in the public\n            sector health system. The second component addresses private\n            sector development and the financial sector: it supports the\n            open, competitive, and strategic privatization of a few\n            large infrastructure enterprises by financing financial,\n            legal, and technical advisory services; strengthens the\n            capacity of the energy and infrastructure regulatory\n            institutions to enable strong private sector participation;\n            and strengthens the supervision department and monetary\n            policy capacity of the national bank. The third component\n            strengthens budget management, builds the institutional\n            capacity of the finance ministry, improves the license\n            regime, and supports the program of public information and\n            public relations on economic reforms. The fourth component\n            helps establish a credible and affordable safety net which\n            includes pension reform as well as targeted assistance to\n            the poor."}, "docdt": "1999-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
