                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The client should monitor completion of the remaining works carefully to ensure that as much as possible can be completed by June 30, 2013. If any works cannot be completed by
                         that date, the client should ensure that the necessary counterpart funding is available to make sure the works are completed in a timely manner.
