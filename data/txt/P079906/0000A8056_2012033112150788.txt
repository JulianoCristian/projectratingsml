                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Although the project made slower progress than expected during its first two years, the pace of implementation has improved and prospects for achieving the development objectives
                         are good. The procurement and implementation capacity of the Ministry of Public Works continues to increase, and civil works have now been completed to increase the capacity and
                         quality of 105 km of national roads. Improvements to an additional 140 km of national roads are currently underway.
