                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Investments are now nearly completed and the project is expected to achieve its main objectives with only moderate shortcomings. The capacity and transparency of the Ministry of
                         Public Works have been strengthened as reflected in its procurement practices, anti-corruption procedures, construction oversight, and complaints handling performance. Civil works
                         to increase the capacity and quality of the strategic national road network have already been completed on 89 percent of the 245 km of new, upgraded, or improved roads targeted

                         project is now fully operational and being expanded and upgraded. Improvement of about 100 intersections has also helped increase both traffic capacity and road safety.
