           development of private sector farming, agro-processing, and\n            strengthening agricultural institutions and services.  The\n            intermediate objectives of the project are to develop an\n            agricultural credit system and target the needs of small\n            farmers in agricultural research, extension and provision of\n            market information.  The project has three components:  a)\n            provide loans for working capital and investments to small\n            farms and business;  b) provide agribusiness training and\n            technical assistance in project finance to private\n            agricultural processing and marketing enterprises to assist\n            them in post-privatization restructuring;  and c) initiate\n            the restructuring of public services in the agricultural\n            sector by focusing on research and extension involving small farmers."}, "docdt": "1997-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
