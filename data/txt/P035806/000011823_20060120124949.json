Project ratings\n            are as follows: project outcome is satisfactory;\n            sustainability is likely; institutional development impact\n            is substantial; Bank performance is satisfactory; and\n            Borrower performance is satisfactory. Some of the lessons\n            learned from the project are : a) monitoring in a credit\n            program is essential, and the involvement of an experienced\n            international expert is highly recommended; b) flexibility\n            should be allowed regarding the terms, maturities and grace\n            periods for sub-loans; c) have in place an agreed overall\n            strategy and target outcome for the reform of a national\n            agricultural knowledge and information system (AKIS); d) the\n            research grant system might have been more responsive to if\n            it had been open also to non-governmental institutions and\n            individuals with their different perspectives; e) fertilizer\n            distribution to smallholders suggests that one-time\n            interventions with a highly visible immediate production and\n            income effect, effectively targeted at large numbers of\n            beneficiaries, can be extremely effective in demonstrating\n            the benefits of improved technology; f) finally,\n            institutional development takes time, especially so in a\n            newly independent transition economy attempting to move from\n            central planning to a market economy."}, "docdt": "2005-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
