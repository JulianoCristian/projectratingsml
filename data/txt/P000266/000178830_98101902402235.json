Specifically it aims to: (a) encourage\n            improved manual cultural techniques among traditional\n            farmers; (b) promote the integration of livestock and\n            agriculture, and the use of organic fertilizer and animal\n            traction; (c) promote and monitor measures which may lead to\n            cheaper alternative chemical fertilizers; (d) encourage the\n            use of inputs including selected seeds to allow further\n            production increases by more advanced farmers; and (e)\n            foster further development of village groups, and test a\n            small literacy program for some of these groups."}, "docdt": "1982-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
