PROJECT CONPLETION REPORT
BURKINA FASO
BOUCLE DU MOUHOUR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Credit 1284-UV)
1.       This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Volta Noire
Agricultural Development Project in Burkina Faso.   The administrative
region of Volta Noire was renamed Boucle du Mouhoun in 1989 and this latter
name is used throughout this report.   Credit 1284-UV in the amount of
US$6.8 million (SDR 6.1 million) was approved on July 27, 1982.   The
project was cofinanced by the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IhAD), US$7.9 million and France, US$4.4 million.  The IDA
Credit was closed on June 30, 1988 on schodule. The Credit was not fully
disbursed and SDR 3,813,055 (US$5.0 million) were cancelled as of January
31, 1989.
2.       The PCR was prepared principally by project staff, with the
assistance of staff of the Bank's Resident Mission in Burkina Faso and the
Africa Regional Office.
3.       Preparation of this PCR was begun during the Bank's last supervi-
sion in June 1988, and is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report,
the aide-m6moires of the supervision reports, correspondence between the
Bank and the Borrower, and the project's technical documentation.
4.       This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
A copy was sent to the Borrower and cofinanciers on December 14, 1990,
for comments by February 1, 1991. Comments from the Ministry of Agricul-
ture and Livestock in Burkina Paso, the Ministry of Cooperation in Prance
and the Caisse Centrals de Coop6ration Economique (CCCE) are appended
(Attachments 1, 2 and 3).

PROJECT COMPLTION URPORT
BURINA FASO
BOUCLE DU MOUHOUN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CredLt 1284-UV)
EVALVAT'ON SU2OQRY
Obiectives
1.       The Boucle du Mouhoun Agricultural Development Project (PDABM) was
a follow-up to the West Volta Agricultural Development Project (PDAOV) and
supported the activities of the Boucle du Mouhoun Regional Development
Authority over five cropping seasons as originally planned, albeit with a
year's delay. The project's broad objectives were to increase agricultural
production and rural incomes through more effective and more cost-effective
extension, integration of agriculture and livestock to increase the
production and t-je of manure which would thwart the reduction in soil
fertility, and further promotion of village groups which would undertake
activities previously performed by civil servants.
Project Execution
2.       Project execution vas somewhat disrupted by factors beyond its
control such as: (i) the Government's phasing-out of the regional develop-
ment organizations (ORDs) in May 1987, which put the executing agency in an
uncertain legal situation, preventing it from assuring certain services
(credit supply of inputs, etc...), (ii) unduly frequent movements of senior
project staff, and (Lii) the complexity of the financial set-up which flar-
ther burdened the already long and complicated procurement procedures.
Project Results
3.       Production goals were reached and even surpassed.  At the end of the
project period, project-induced incremental cotton production reached 33,000
tons, about five times the appraisal estimate. Incremental, project-induced
cereal production reached 15,000 tons, in line with the appraisal estimate.
A total of 250 additional village groups were established under the Project,
compared to the 200 anticipated. This brings their number to 664, or 73% of
the total number of villages in the project area. Similarly, the functional
literacy program tralned 7,000 farmers, 2,500 of whom are village group
officers, in 131 centers equipped for this purpose.
4.       Other objectives were only partially attained.   Integration of
agriculture with livestock, and the intensification of agriculture were not
fully achieved, due to (i) this compor3nt's late start-up, (ii) the low
distribution of improved seeds, and (iii) the leveling-off of demand for
medium-term credit, in particular for the purchase of draft oxen.  Other
components, such as the construction of village warehouses, lagged behind
(with only 30% of goals achieved).



- vi -
5.       The actual cost of the Project was only 67% of the appralsal
estimate and t1Ae actual disbursement of the IDA Credit reached only .27% of
the Credit amount (in US$) and only 38% in SDR terms. The main reason for
these changes was the much lower-than-expected demand for medium-term cred'.t
(financed by IDA), which was not offset by higher-than-expected demand for
seasonal credit (financed by local banks).
6.       The ex-post economic rate of return is estimated at 22%, similar to
the ex-ante return of 21%. This similarity is a coincidence, however, since
ex-post output was much higher than ex-ante estimates, but this difference
was largely offset by lower economic prices.
Sustainability of Project Results
7.       In spite of very good project results in terms of incremental
production, one major concern is the possible degradation of natural
resources due to the extensification of cultivation practices and the lack
of integration of agriculture and livestock, and, therefore, of the
insufficient organic matter i.l the soil.
Lessons and Conclusions
8.       In terms of agricultural output as expressed in the economic rate
of return, this project was clearly successful.   It was implemented by a
government line agency that was subject to all the normal problems of such
agencies. Despite these problems, the project was well executed and higher-
than-axpected results were obtained.
9.       Further improvements can nonetheless be obtained, and one set of
lessons bears on institution-building.   First,  the management of human
resources should be strengthened, in particular senior staff turnover should
be limited. Second, if technical assistance is needed, it should be targeted
to specific needs, and the terms of reference clearly defined to ensure
national staff training and the implementation of viable procedures. Third,
the relation between the CRPA and otner national institutions, such as the
Livestock Department, has to be clarified so that effective collaboration can
be achieved in the field.
10.      The second set of lessons bears on the adequacy and sustainability
of the technical approaches.   In the process of strengthening the linkage
between agricultural research and extension, programs should be desigred Ro
resolve producers' constraints on their production systems.   Furthermore,
priority should be given to maintal.a and improve the management of natural
resources to halt the degradation caused by extensification and unsustainable
crop and livestock husbandry practices. Part of the solution will be to find
ways of improving the management of individual assets, but it will also have
to include the more difficult task of improving the management of common
assets.



PROJECT CCK?LK?ION UPORT
BUEXnA FASO
BOUCLE DU MOUHOUN AGURCULTURAL DEVELOPHENT PROJECT
(Credit 1284-UV)
I. IEIfgZECIQN
A. General
1.01        In Burkina Faso, the agricultural sector plays a fundamental role
in the country's development because of the share of the population involved in
this sector (80-90 percent) and because of its contribution to the GNP (40
percent) and to exports (90 percent). Irrigation prospects are poor since the
majority of crops can only be grown under rainfed conditions, with family-
operated farms using relatively simple and inexpensive techniques. Conditions
for rainfed crops vary from one region to another according to the rainfall, soil
quality and demographic pressure. In the Northern area, the low and uncertain
rainfall and the poor soil quality on the central, densely-populated plateau have
resulted in a low level of agricultural production, close to subsistence level,
and massive population migrations towards the West and South-West areas of the
country.   In this area where crop conditions are more favorable (good, less
uncertain rainfall, better quality soil, lower population density), agricultural
production, generally speaking, shows a surplus and is more diversified and more
market-oriented. These areas produce the majority of cereals and almost all of
the cotton.
1.02        In recent years cotton production has seen unprecented development.
Due to an increase in producer prlces, national production of seed cotton has
more than doubled since 1984, and now stands at 150,000 to 170,000 tons. The
Western area contributes 90% of this amount, 40% to 45% of which comes from the
project area. Cereal production, which accounts for 90% of the land cultivated,
has also increased, although the long-term cereals growth rate is lower than that
of the population.
1.03        Cotton yields have continued to increase and now reach 1,000 kg/ha.
This growth is largely due to the use of fertilizer and insecticides. Cereal
yields have increased, though to a lesser extent, under the direct and indirect
effect of fertilizers: millet - 730 kg/ha, sorghum - 930 kg/ha, maize - 1,000-
1,200 kg/ha.   In recent years there has been a faster increase in the area
cultivated under cotton than under cereals, cotton being financially a more
attractive crop. This has posed collection and particularly processing problems,
given SOFITEX's ginning capacity during the project implementation period.
Following the drop in world cotton prices in 1985/86, the cotton sector incurred
an operating deficit for two years. The policy packages implemented have only
partially reduced this uu.icit.
1.04        Demographic pressure, which results in pressu-e on natural resources,
makes it necessary to consider the relationship betweer, agriculture and livestock
from the point of view of space and fertilizer use. The complementarity between
agriculture and livestock has been accompllshed through increased animal
traction; in the project area, there are at present nearly 22,500 farmers
equipped with animal traction ploughs.



- 2 -
1.05        The  present agricultural production  systems  are no  longer  in
equilibrium.  Dekographic pressure in the Western area, the result of %Assive
migration, has resulted in agricultural land occupation rates which ate too high
(with an annuial growth rate of 9! to 10% in the South of the project area) and
in a considexable decrease in the fallow period x7hich is lncompati.ble with the
replicability of the systems.
1.06        To  deal  with  this  situation,  the  Government's  agricultural
development strategy is:
(a)   to increase the productivity of rainfed crops;
(b)   to  encourage  and  channel  migration  towards  fertile,  spazsely
populated zones;
(c)   to promote irrigated crops;
(d)   to ensure food security; and
(e)   to promote new types of management of rural areas.
1.07        In line with this strategy, Bank policy was to emphasize rural sector
development in general, and intensified rainfed cropping in the better-watered
and more fertile south-western areas in particular.
B. Origin and-preopration
1.08        The PDABM (Boucle de Mouhoun Agricultural Development Project) was
a follow-up to the PDAOV (West Volta Agricultural Development Project) which
was completed on June 30, 1982. This project consolidated the previous project
in order to expand agricultural production by means of important innovations.
1.09        IDA identified the project in 1979 following receipt of a request
from Government for a fcllow-up project, and ilaving recognized the untapped
potential that would still exist on compl-etion of the PDAOV.  The PDABM was
prepared in 1980 on behalf of Government by consultants firianced by the FAC and
the CCCE who submitted their report in February 1981.
C. Appraisal and Signature of the Credit Agreement
1.10        A joint IDA/CCCE/FAC mission pre-appraised the Project in May 1981
and appraisal followed in Septem'-- r/October.  The Project was to be c4rried out
over a period of five years, between 1982/83 and 1986/87.  Tct estimated total
cost was US$22.1 million, to be financed by IDA, IFAD, CCCE and FAC with a
contribution from Government. The prii&cipal project design features formulated
following this missivn were:
(a)   reinforcement of the extension program by improving linkages betweeLl
farmers, extension agents and research institutes:
(b)   a more adaptive applied research program, creating bases of support

1.11        Negotiations took place in April 1982 in Washington, during whiich
several issues were discussed: input subsidies, Special Account prefinancing,
technical assistance, margins on the supply of veterinary products, recurrent
charges. The Project was approved on July 27, 1982. The Credit Agreement with
the Government was signed on August 26, 1982 and became effective on June 22,
1983. The first expenditures were, however, incurred in September 1982 and the
1982-83 cropping season is considered as Year 1 of the Project. Given the delays
in effectiveness of the Credit Agreement and in the appointment of a Financial
Coordinator, the Project was executed over six years instead of the five
intended. The closing date as regards IDA-IFAD financing was June 30, 1988.
The follow-up projects are the followir.g:  for IDA, the Agricultural Support
Services Project (Cr.1979-BUR); for CCCE, an integrated rural development project
in the Kossi province (one of the three provinces covered by the PDABM) recently
appraised. Meanwhile, financing continued through the transitory period under
the IDA-financed Koudougou Pilot Project (Cr. 1293-BUR) until March 1989.
D. Ploject gbic  ves and DAscriRloQn
1. IhsL ect area
1.12        The region covered by the project is the same ac; that covered by the
Boucle du Mouhoun Regional Center for Agro-pastoral Promo tion (CRPA) in the West
of Burkina Faso (see map). It includes the 1.ouhoun, Kossi and Sourou provinces,
and stretches over an area measuring 33,100 km2, with a population of about
910,000 (source: 1985 population census), a density of 27 inhabitants per km2.
The majority of the population is rural and there are 89,328 farming cnits
distributed among 904 villages
1.13        The project area is divided into two climatic zones with rather stark
differences:
- the Southern area, with annual rainfall of 660-960 mm, covers three
agricultural sectors (Boromo, Dedougou and Solenzo), with q surface area
of 16,570 km2;
- the Northern area, with annual rainfall of 530 740 wim, also comprises
three agricultural sectors (Nouna, Kougny and Touga:n) and has a surface



4-
area of 16,530 km2.
Although the Southern area is suitable for all crops (cereals and cotton), the
Northern area is essentially a cereal-growlng area.   Rainfall is unevenly
distributed over the project area during the crop year; one year in three is
unfavorable. The agro-climatic conditions in the Southern area are such that
the Boucle du Mouhoun CRPA remains among the country's leading producers of the
major crops (sorghum, millet and cotton).
2. Prolect goall
1.14        The principal goals of the project were:
(a)   to encourage the adoption of improved manual farming techniques;
(b)   to promote the integration of livestock and agriculture;
(c)   to promote the application of less expensive fertilizers (organic
matter and natural phosphates);
(d)   to encourage the use of agricultural inputs, in particular selected
seeds; and
(e)   to foster and reinforce the creation of village groups and to test
a literacy program.
3. Description of the groject
1.15        The project, estimated to last five years (1982-1987), was to
continue the progress made under the PDAOV while seeking to increase production
and to emphasize group action at the village level in order to make the villages
more autonomous and to relieve the CRPA of some of its traditional tasks.
1.16        The program also included activities relating to the prevention of
soil erosion and to the construction of a village infrastructure.  Extension
services were to reach 22,000 of the 60,000 farmers in the region, and the 24,000
farmers already reached were to follow a complementary program.
4. Project costs
1.17        Project costs were estimated at US$ 22.1 million  (CFAF 6,630
million), of which 45% in foreign currency.   Principal financiers were the
following:

A. Effectiveness and start-up
2.01        Although the Project was to have become effective in June 1982,
effective Project start-up was not achieved until September 1982, right in the
middle of the 1982-83 crop season, considered as Year 1 of the project. Credit
effectiveness was delayed until June 1983.
B.  Modifications to the Project Description
2.02        The original content of the project underwent no changes.  Under the
heading 'studies and elements to be approved", a trial program concerning the
management of village lands was initiated, starting from the 1986/87 cropping
season.  A study on the cotton sector was also carried out under the same
heading.
C. Technical Develogments
1. Extension and Training
2.03        One of the project goals was to reduce the number of extension
workers to about 100 by the end of the execution phase. This goal was achieved
(cf Annex 1, Table 1). However, the related objectives of improving the links
between extension and research, and of integrating livestock and agriculture
(para 1.10) were only partially met.
2.04        The results of the project, although they cannot easily be compared
to the original goals owing to modifications to the extension system during the
course of the project, are given in Annex 1, Table 1.
2.05        The principal difficulties encountered were:
- the initial T&V (Training and Visit) system: this was interpreted by
project management as well as by the resident expatriate extension specialist



- 6 -
as requiring a strong, top-down extension force; this proved to be of little
relevance to the more advanced farmers' preoccupations, and the intention of
having contact farmers train their fellow villagers did not work.
- the subsequent T&V system that was introduced in 1987:
. with regard to the organization of the extension service: an imbalance
in the distribution of land area between CRPA subsectors and extension centers;
weak extension agents; staff turnover; insufficient transport; the dispersion
of agents' activities; a lack of coordination between extension services and
livestock services;
. with regard to farmer training: an inadequate selection of extension
themes; a lack of adaptation of training themes to the different technical levels
of the producers participating in the same training session; the exclusion of
livestock producers;
. with regard to the training of extension agents: the weak educational
and technical background of certain teaching staff; insufficient monitoring of
agents; insufficiently adapted, often too theoretical, training;
. with regard to the links between research and extension: a lack of funds
for research; insufficient on-station training materials; a lack of preparation
and adaptation of research data; insufficient integration of research and
development.
2.06        The initial "top-down" approach, still very much anchored in the
project staff, limited their ability to apply the principles of the subsequent
T&V system. Furthermore, the Monitoring and Evaluation system established by
the project was unable to provide feedback to the extension services.   The
agricultural statistics were too static and general to be useful, and their
publication untimely to fit into the design of extension programs.
2.07        In general, as generally seen in other ORDs, the extension services
were less concerned with understanding and adapting their messages to producers'
needs and constraints in the dynamic management of their production system, than
with the promotion of elementary themes and the volume of activity per extension
agent. Regarding livestock, most of the extension work was limited to animal
traction, although the adoption rates have remained low.
2.08        In the follow-up project, the National Agricultural Services Project
(Credit 1979-BUR), the following changes have been made:
(a)   the ratio of extension agent per farmer has been improved, and the
number of tasks adapted,
(b)   farmers and extension agents have been interviewed to appreciate the
further needs for improving the extension approach;
(c)   tests are underway to integrate livestock breeders in the program
of the extenuion agents;



- 7 -
(d)   work is underway with a pilot team to improve the links between
extension and research;
(e)   a survey of producers' technical level is underway in order to adapt
extension themes, programs and approaches to needs, including to the
producers' priorities in the management of his production system;
(f)   work focussed on animal husbandry, including forage crops, is being
tested;
(g)   a feed-back system between the monitoring and evaluation unit and
the extension staff is being designed; and
(h)   training opportunities for the technical staff are being diversified
to take advantage of the national and regional capacity (e.g. in Mali
and Ivory Coast).
2. Fertilizers and insecticides
2.09        Mineral fertilizers.  Table 1 of Annex 2 shows global fertilizer
consumption compared to project estimates. It can be seen that achievements have
largely exceeded goals: 42,138 tons of NPK and 6,908 tons of urea compared to
23.422 tons of NPK and 4,883 tons of urea (+ 180 percent and 141 percent,
respectively). Despite the fact that subsidies were discontinued, fertilizer
use continued to increase.   Distribution between cotton and cereals was as
follows:
COTTON       CEREALS        TOTAL
NPK (t)       29,340         12,798      42,138
Urea (t)        4,294          2,614       6,908
In PY6, average use per hectare for cotton was 140 kg of NPK and 58 kg of urea.
For cereals average usage amounted to 80-90 kg of NPK and 57 kg of urea. A large
part of NPK (70%) and of urea (62%) is used on cotton.  The application of
fertilizer on cereals, although fairly substantial, principally concerns maize.
2.10        Insecticides (Annex 2, Table 1)    The growth in consumption of
insecticides is closely linked to the expansion of cotton growing, the principal
beneficiary of such insecticides. However, in PY6 usage dropped no doubt due
to the discontinuation of subsidies which resulted in prices doubling. More
and more, traditional products were replaced by ULV products. This increased
the effectiveness of treatment.  Quantities consumed per hectare amounted to
seven to eight liters. Few farmers carry through to six treatments; the majority
stop at three to four.   This is a reasonable optimum, given ths price of
insecticides and the level of insect infestation in the region.
3. Selected seeds
2.11        Seed production.  To alleviate shortages in selected seeds, and in
order to ensure regular supplies of seeds to the farmers in the project area,
the PDABM reinforced the seed production component at two complementary levels:



- 8 -
the K1i seed farm and seed farmers. The combination of these two levels was in
response to a dual concern: (a) in the short term, to increase seed production
to satisfy the growing demands of producers and (b) to ensure that the seed
farmers would take over those kinds of seeds whose production costs added too
much to the operational costs of the Kib seed farm and those which could not be
produced there owing to restrictive ecological factors. The principal crops
concerned are sorghum, maize and groundnuts.
2.12        As regards the Kie seed farm, the project goals were more than
achieved during the last two years for sorghum and the last year for maize.
However, this is far from being the case for groundauts. Other plant species
have been multiplied in response to specific requev,ts (cf Annex 2, Table 1).
2.13        As regards the seed farmers, only groundnuts have been multiplied,
and then only in Year 5 of the project and with results well below targets.
2.14        Seed production costs are known only for the Kie seed farm.  There
were variations according to crop but a favorable overall development. Sorghum
production costs dropped from 180 CFAF per kilo in 1983-84 to 33 CFAF per kilo
in 1986-87. over the same period maize seed cost dropped from 244 to 102 CFAF
per kilo, and groundntut seed cost from 508 to 370 CFAF per kilo.
2.15        In spite of this very encouraging trend, the experiences of groundnut
seed production by farmers have shown that these farmers had costs which were
much more competitive than those of the seed farm. It would no doubt be more
judicious if the CRPA's role were limited to:
(a)   the production of first generation seeds only, to respond to the
local varietal demand;
(b)   the dissemination of information on seed specificity (production
and use recommendations); and
(c)   the provision of assistance for critical cases.
2.16        Selected seed use.   In general, demand did not match estimates.
Except in the case of groundnuts, demand was much less than available production.
2.17        In short, there is a real wastage of selected seeds.  There are many
reasons for this, among which:
- set-up delays and a lack of coordination between the crcp forecasting
system (established by the on-site extension agent and often not
communicated to the village groups) and the distribution system;
- a lack of interest, occasioned by the lack of training of a major part
of the extension agents on this relatively new subject;
- the limited performance of certain varieties;
- the rigidity of selected seeds in the face of climatic uncertainties,
which was not the case for local production where the farmer has a whole



9
range of varieties adapted to the different variations in climate;
- the major role played in distribution by farmers;
- over-estimates for extremely high-ris'% regions (the Northern area of the
CRPA) or for those which were already producing a surplus of cereals (the
Southern area of the CRPA).
2.18        However, the tonnage of second- and third-generation seed far exceeds
the tonnage of certified seed utilized, and only about 8 percent of farmers turn
to selected seeds (1987 survey on the usage of improved seeds).
2.19        The following tables summarize the production, cost and consumption
aapects of selected seeds.

4. Agsearch and development
2.20           Three major objectives were assigned by the project to the
applied research program, an element of tne extension component:  to test
recommendations concerning new varieties and techniques, to try to develop
less costly alternative fertilizers and to improve links with research
institutes.   The program was assigned no quantitative goals.   It was
established, witi the assistance of the research institutes, on the basis of
project concerns, i.e.: to encourage the transfer of research results to the
rural areas, to assess priority needs and problems of rural areas according
to the different agro-ecological situations, to keep the organizations
responsible for research informed by providing the necessary feedback from
the rural world.
2.21           To this end, two bases of support for pre-extension and multi-
site trials (PAPEM) were created in the two major agro-ecological zones. The
trials were carried out at two levels which are connected, the PAPEM level
and the farmer level, and were based on the following research themes (Annex
3, Table 1):
(a) At PAPEM level:
Mi)     varietal trials and testing of cereals  (sorghum, maize,
rainfed rice), pulses (cowpeas and groundnuts), cotton, sesame
and soya beans. The plan was to test and then utilize those
varieties adapted to the different climatic zones;
(ii)      "fertilization"  trials to measure the effect of Burkina
phosphate (natural phosphate) and organic fertilizer and to
suggest less costly types of fertilizer which are adapted to
the different crops;
(iii)      "soil preparation" trials centered on water harvesting to
develop techniques to combat water runoff and encourage the
infiltration of rain water;
(iv)      "plant health treatment" trials on cotton plants and cowpeas
to devise formulae which are effective, less costly, and less
harmful to the environment;
(v)      "preservation of soil fertility" trials; "cropping pattern"
and "binomial" trials were to be carried out with a view to
developing a group of coherent technical solutions which would



- 12 -
enable increased production, while confirming that they would
conserve soil fertility;
(vi)      "fodder" trials.
(b)   At the farmer level:  This involved extending the PAPEH level by
trials and demonstrations in rural areas.
(i)      FAO demonstrations aimed at showing the effects of organic
fertilization, alone or combined with Burkina phosphate
supplemented by urea the first year, than to show the
secondary effect of these base fertilizers on cereals in the
second year;
(ii)      trials of fertilizers for food crops on maize and sorghum
ained at developing a fertilizer formula adapted to cereals;
(iii)      varietal tests on sorghum, maize, rainfed rice, groundnuts,
cotton, sesame and soya beans;
(iv)      "soil   preparation"   tests   using   ridging/partitioning
techniques.
2.22           The following results were obtained:
- varietal trials:   from an average of six varieties per crop in
competition with local varieties in different climatic areas, a certain
number of varieties were retained, multiplied at the seed farm level and
distributed (cf Annex 3, Table 2). The sorghum varieties, IRAT 204, GNOFING
and ICVS 1001, had limited success; GNOFING because of its relatively long
cycle in face of climatic regressions observed since 83/84, the two others
because of their organoleptic qualities (taste, in particular) which do not
conform with local eating habits. The ISA 205 cotton variety turned out to
be slightly less productive in seed cotton than did L299-10-75, but it did
have a higher ginning yield (45.4 compared to 43.2).   In t.c case of
groundnuts, the varieties retained have short cycles and are thus less risky,
particularly since the farmers sow first cotton, then cereals and finally
groundnuts. As for cowpeas, only KN1 is being distributed. Testing of the
TVX32-36 and IT82E-32 varieties is being finished in the rural areas. For
rice, the IRAT-144 and 147 varieties are being distributed, while IDESA7 is
still being tested.
- fertilization trials:  results obtained confirm the effectiveness of
Burkina phosphate combined with organic matter; yields obtained are the same
as those for compound fertilizer. The principal constraint from the farmers'
point of view is the increased work time required to manufacture manure
(Annex 3, Table 3).
- plant health  treatment trials:   these trials have permitted the
development of a standard method of protection for cotton plants which is
technically and economically profitable (Annex 3, Table 4). For cowpeas,
these trials revealed that two treatment products put into competition (DECIS
and DIMETHOATE + KARATE) are equal.



- 1 :. -
- soil preparation trials: the technique of ridging plus partitioning was
found to be relatively effective in improving water retention (Annex 3, Table
4). This can be used for areas which are low in rainfall, but it should be
tested in areas, or at times, of excess rainfall. There are a great number
of possible combinations between the different partitioning techniques: the
choice of any one of these depends on the local context.
- preservation of soil-fertility trials:   the binomials set up have
demonstrated  that  combinations  of  techniques  (soil  preparation  +
fertilization + management of harvest waste) depend on the level of equipment
a farmer may have and on the capacity to manage harvest waste.   Yields
obtained have shown that animal traction and organic fertilization are most
effective on maize and cotton.
- "cropping pattern" trials have shown thtat the production and the usage
of organic fertilizer based on harvest waste may allow the settlement of
farming units while maintaining a good level of overekl production and yields
which are slightly higlher than the regional average.   These trials also
permitted total control of Strlga and lower consumption of mineral
fertilizers.  The principal constraints observed is their requirement for a
certain amount of equipment, and a plan for mineral and organic restoration
with progressive integration of livestock and agriculture.
- the FAC demonstrations showed farmers that organic matter in any form
(compost, animal manure) makes excellent fertilizer, and that using rock
phosphates results in increased yields.
2.23           The research and development link was reinforced by means of
annual visits when researchers, extension agents and farmers met within the
framework of the training sessions organized by the project.   The PAPEM
received an average of three visits by groups of researchers and producers
per crop season.
2.24           In short, the results of the research and development program
were generally conclusive. Two major directions for action can be suggested
for a future research and development program:
(a)   improve links between research and development through better
adaptation of research themes to the needs of development and
through training those responsible for research and development in
data collection and analysis;
(b)   increase orientation of research and development towards developing
methods  likely  to  increase  production  in  an  agriculture
characterized by low monetary input. The agronomic problems which
should be the subject of research are the following:   water-
harvesting, preservation of soil fertility by emphasizing organic
fertilization and the management of harvest waste, and erosion
control techniques.

5. Integration of agriculturg and livestock 11AR)
2.25           The general goal set. by the project for the IAE component was
to increase the potential for village-level cattle husbandry in the project
area. This was to be achieved by training producers in animal healtih and
production in order to: (a) generate a stock to supply farming units with
draft oxen, the demand for which continues to increase and often exceed
supply, and (b) increase soil fertility potential by producing and using
organic matter.
2.26           The activities envisaged are the following:
- activities in the animal health area, aimed at guaranteeing satisfactory
health coverage for sedentary cattle by educating producers in aspects of
animal health and steps to be taken against infectious diseases, such as
trypanosomiasis and internal and external parasites;
- cattle feeding, aimed at satisfying the mainteaance and production
requirements of the animals by building up fodder reserves based on natural
hay, harvest waste, agro-industrial by-products and mineral supplements;
- the production of organic matter, in order to increase soil fertility
by the production and usage of farm manure;
- the cul'ing of draft animals, by bringing the culling age down to nine
years, the age deemed optimal for a better final fattening;
- activities concerning genetics, in order to obtain viable variable-
growth products by choosing well adapted animals for reproduction.
2.27           The following results were obtained:
- Development in the cattle population is shown in Annex 4, Table 1. In
the absence of reliable data, the number of draft oxen was arrived at by
means of extrapolation, although in fact only the data arising from the
utilization of medium-term credit are known. This being the case, the table
shows a great difference between start-up numbers (Year 1) of draft oxen.
The difference between annual increases in stock does not, however, seem
significant.   The increase in draft oxen numbers is, for the most part,
related to that of cotton production. It is estimated that 64 percent of the
increase is due either to acquisition through purchase or to cattle being
taken from herds on other farms.
- On animal health, the project made a major contribution to the running
of the Provincial Livestock Services:   the acquisition and running of
vehicles, the fitting-out of seven livestock substations, participation in
the anthrax and cattle pleuropneumonia campaign, initiation and financing of
the special draft oxen campaign, and financing of training for villagers
responsible for livestock.
2.28           Unfortunately this contribution was still not large enough.

Apart trom major campaigns, the project intervened only on demand.   In
addition, the insufficient number of adequate facilities, such as vaccination
yards, and sometimes their location, limited the participation of a good
number of producers and thus affected the results of certain operations. In
the project area, only 46 regrouping centers (eight percent) were equipped
with permanent facilities (metal, concrete).  Temporary facilities, which
could rot withstand bad weather, represented 49 percent. This is the context
in which the results of animal health activities undertaken by the project
should be reviewed. The outreach ratio was as follows (Year 6):

2.29           The relatively satisfactory results of operations against
rinderpest and contagious pleuropneumonia, with a coverage rate higher than
project goals, *;an be explained by the fact that these two diseases were
treated annually in four to five-month campaigns by veterinary services.
The importar-o of these diseases, the low treatment cost (CFAF 35 per dose)
and widespr.4ad sensitization resulted in broad participation in this campaign
by producers.   Ihe proportion of draft oxen immunized against these two
diseases in 1987-88 is estimated at 81 percent. Other activities remain well
below targeted levels. For breeding cattle, coverage rates are much lower
than project goals. These poor results can be explained by the distance from
vaccination centers, the high treatment cost (CFAF 390 per dose) and the fact
that treatments took place in May-June when agricultural activities were
under way.
2.30           In parallel to these activities, the training of producers in
primary health of &tnimals was initiated by the project through the training
of Volunteer Village Vaccinators (VVV), and Volunteer Village Pharmacists



v 16 -
(VVP) in the management of village-level pharmacies. A total of 103 VVV and
124 VVP were trained. The impact of this training is difficult to measure
at present due to poor monitoring.
2.31           Regarding  animal  feeding,  the  project  provided  for the
dissemination of information, and the acquisition and distribution of
supplements (agro-industrial by-products and salt licks). The t ices eovered
were: the harvesting of brush hay, the storage of harvest wante, fodder
crops, and the usage of by-products and salt licks.  As concerns the first
three topics, it is difficult to quantitatively assess the degree to whicb
they have been adopted. All that can be said is that they have begun to be
put into practice by a good number of producers who own animals.   Tne
quantities stored or produced, however, remain insufficient compared to
requirements. The quantities of by-products (cotton seed, bran cubes, CITEC
feed, cotton cakes) and salt licks in place are far from meeting goals (Annex
4,  Table 2).   Reasons  include the high cost of the by-products,  the
inefficiency of distribution channels, the absence of warehouses, and
inadequate transport.
2.32           In spite of the existence of real potential at the level of
a good number of farming units (presence of cattle and availability of
harvest waste), the production of organic matter remained inadequate.
Processes for organic production, although proven at the farm and PAPES
level, have not yet been widely disseminated.   The lack of training of
extension agents, and the way village animals were managed, were among the
factors which hindered their adoption.
2.33           As regards the culling of draft animals, sand activities in
genetics, no real action was taken. The difficulties arose from the staff's
total unfamiliarity with these subjects.  In addition, producers were not
familiar with marketing channels for culled animals.
2.34           In short, the major constraint experienced in the program's
execution is institutional in nature: technical staff should have been made
available to the project at the beginning but were not.  Execution of the
program was entrusted to the Provincial Livestock Services (SPE), under the
control of another directorate,  the Directorate for Livestock.   These
servicss, with insufficient staff and limited means of intervention, did not
facilitate execution of the project. As a result some goals were not met,
activities were not monitored, there was a lack of statistical data, and
extension workers' schedules were not balanced (with animal health activities
taking up more than 90 percent of their time).
6. Land and Infrastructure Development
2.35           Soil protection and restoration (DRS)  The project included
the execution of DRS works over a total of 3,000 ha at a rate of 600 ha per
annum. Actual performance, although uneven, exceeded these goals (3,190 ha)
as can be seen from the following table:

2.36           The maintenance and sustainability of the earth bunds were not
ensured and, as a result, capital works deteriorate rapidly. Only an
estimated 60 percent of sites were maintained.   The reason for this poor
maintenance is the choice of sites in relation to the motivation of the
people, who have, for the most part, exhibited little interest in the program
due no doubt to the..'j. lack of awareness and the costs.   There were also
problems with maintenance arrangements. Only recently (86/87) have program
officials encouraged the creation of Village Committees for the Maintenance
of Developments (CVEA - Comlt6s Villageols d'Entretlen des Am6nagements)
whose role is the management and maintenance cf sites already developed and
the identification of new sites. There are at present 20 such committees.
They include representatives from all organizations in these villages.
2.37           FEER's development technique uses a tractor to make earth
bunds to combat soil erosion. The present cost of such a procedure is high
(CFAF 100,000 per ha).
2.38           The impact of these developments measured on sample sites was
-Loticeable in increased productivity (+ 30-60 percent according to the 1985-
86 PEER summary report). Trial operations concerning agro-forestry and on-
site gully treatment carried out in certain areas also rebulted in improved
!Bsoil protection and conservation and in increased agricultural production.
The major constraint which no doubt severely impeded the impact of these
development schemes is the lack of coordination between development and
extension activities; the farming techniques advocated by the extonsion
system did not always conform to regulations concerning site preservation
(crops wera not J.ways grown on the contour).
2.39           In short, soil conservation activities, which have been proven
to be necessary, should be reinforced along the following lines:   more
attention should be paid to raising the awareness of the people; only those
sufficiently motivated should be employed; an alternative to the present
costly development technique should be tested. Certain support measures,
such as agro-forestry, gully treatment, vegetative bunds and the planting of
hedges should be promoted.
2.40           The building of village warehouses.  The project provided for
the construction of 200 village warehouses at a rate of 40 per annum. Actual
output is as follows:

Number     Stage of construction
61       completed
60       under construction
40       construction not yet begun, but materials purchased
Performance is nowhere near the original goals. The reasons for this are
many, among which are:
- the lack of motivation of the people concerned, who refuse to participate
in the work, an indication that the choice of villages may not have been
appropriate;
- the length of the bidding process for the purchase of construction
materials;
- the failure of certain sub-contractors;
- misappropriation of, and damage to, materials (cement) resulting from
inadequacies in construction programming;
- gaps within the project as regards the coordination of tasks for the
execution of the construction program;
- insufficient construction monitoring;
- project incompetence in construction.
2.41           Other building work carried out.    Building work carried out
includes the construction of housing, warehouses, training centers, etc. at
Directorate headquarters and in the sectors. All construction work provided
for was carried out (Annex 5, Table 1), but with considerable delays with
respect to housing and training centers.
2.42           Maize cribs.   Tr6ditional drying methods could constitute a
bottleneck if maize production were to increase.  With this in mind, the
project provided for the constrt,-.tion of 1,250 maize cribs.  However, little
action was taken and this activiry was eventually abandoned. It should be
noted that this activity was initiated by the preceding project (PVOV -
Projet de Vulgarlsatlon Ouest Volta), for demonstration purposes, and that
the results obtained were well below target: 37 achieved, or 15 percent of
the 250 originally foreseen. Sor. of the reasons for this were: inadequate
training and bad planning of off-. vason worker schedules, and difficulties
in the shipping and supply of matur!als.
7. VY11r*e gsrouns (VG'
2.43           The number of male village groups (MVG) created during the
project period was higher than targeted: 250 as opposed to 200:

PY6         664                8
In 73 percent of the villages, male village groups were set up. Similarly,
202 FVG (female village groups), 18 farmer groups and 6 artisan groups were
created.
2.44           Village groups have really proliferated.   The number of
officially recognized MVG is 570. The number of VG members represents only
16 percent of farming units, which is low. However, it should be noted that
many farmers benefit from the advantages (annual inputs) of the VG without
truly belonging to them.
2.45           At present there are 346 self-managed cotton markets and 382
self-managed cereal markets, or 52 percent and 57 percent respectively of the
groups (Annex 7, Tables 1, 2 and 3). The quantity of products collected at
project end (PY6) by the self-managed cotton markets represent 90 percent of
total seed cotton marketed.
2.46           Remuneration  received from marketing cotton are used for the
following collective undertakings:
- cereal banks and                 - wells              111
village warehouses  245          - pharmacies          28
- mills                53          - maternity clinics  63
- dispensaries         18          - schools             85
- water reservoirs     14
The VGs manage short and medium-term credit and organize activities of common
interest such as collective fields and marketing of produce (cotton, cereals,
karite, etc.).
2.47           The number of established functional literacy centers comes
to 131, which is well over the 36 initially targeted by the project. The
number of farmers taught to read and write is 6,636; 2,458 of these are
village group officers. Here too project targets, which provided for the
training of 1,200 officers,  were clearly surpassed.    Project  targets
regarding the training of literacy workers were also more than met, with 144
trained for only 26 targeted.   The substantial difference between actual
achievement and objectives is largely due to a mass literacy operation
("Commando" literacy).
2.48           Finally, the situation of the village groups gives rise to a
certain number of questions: Would it be a good idea to have the project
area totally covered by the village groups? Is the role of the CRPAs or



- 20 -
other institutions to promote such a step or is it not rather to accompany
it with an on-site training effort to consolidate those already in existence?
Should the grouping coincide with a geographical or a social reality? What
development is possible and desirable for the groups: union? federation?
What should be done about the Jrawbacks once present possibilities are
exhausted?  What is to be done with the funds collected by the Group?   A
study financed by the CCCE, the recommendations and results of which are not
yet available, will no doubt answer at least some of these questions.
8. Aericultural credit
2.49           Short-term Credit. This credit relates to inputs (fertilizer,
insecticides, seeds) and cotton insecticide sprayers.   Annex 2, Table 1,
gives the quantities of inputs furnished within the framework of the project
compared to project estimates. The inputs were supplied directly by SOFITEX,
while the project assessed the demand. (Since the 87/88 crop year SOFITEX
has been progressively developing its own delivery system.) The distribution
and the delivery of these inputs have generally been carried out efficiently
without any major problems.
2.50           There has been major progress in the volume of short-term
credit, which increased fivefold between Years 1 and 5 of the project, with
very good, although slightly decreasing, recovery rates.
Short-term credit extended within the framework
of the Project (CFAF million)

Medium-term credit
2.51           A comparison of project achievements comiared to estimates may
be found in Annex 2, Table 1. The cumulative results are as follows:

Seeders                                25
The worst results were those obtained for draft oxen and plows. The reasons
for this are known and include, inter alia:
- the excessive emphasis put on loan guarantees by agents responsible for
loan request appraisals;
- the limitation of the volume of credit granted by the V.G. 's themselves
and by the agents responsible for the appraisals;
- the increase in prices of materials and the decrease in cereal prices,
which limits the farmers' profit-earning capacity, particularly in non
cotton-growing areas;
- the inadequate extension support to recently-equipped farmers for
optimal usage of equipment;
- for cereal producers, the difficulty experienced in renaying credit as
a result of insufficient yield in bad years and marketing problems in good
years;
- the cattle mortality insurance fund deemed by farmers to be too
restrictive when it was first set up.
2.52           Having begun at CFAF 150,000 (PYl), the average indebtedness
per credit beneficiary stabilized at CFAF 130,000 and then dropped to CFAF
100,000 in PY5 (cf Annex 6, Table 5). This debt level corresponds to one
pair of oxen or one cart. Among credit beneficiaries, one farmer in two
purchases a cart, two in five purchase plows, one in three purchases a weeder
(triangle), one in four purchases a ridge-plow, and three in ten purchase
pairs of oxen.
2.53           The present -edium-term credit system severely penalizes
farmers in the Northern ai - of the project, as is shown in the following
table:

Recovery rates are generally good, but mask an extremely pronounced regional
disparity (North/South) (see Annex 6, Table 1).
Recovery rates (%)

PY5                99
Cash purchases are increasing.   They involve in particular inputs and
agricultural implements.
2.54           The present situation of the Cattle Mortality Insurance Fund
(Fonds de Garantle Mortal lrtd Btall - FGMB) reveals that instructions and
procedures for the extension of this fund are generally not closely followed,
so that the real situation is difficult to assess. In spite of the effective
establishment of necessary support measures (the operation of FGMB
commissions, vaccination, animal marking), operation of the FGMB remains very
unsatisfactory. The higher the cost of this insurance and the greater the
inadequacy in the replacement of animals, the more difficulty the
beneficiaries of this credit have had in understanding its usefulness.
Delays in the examination of cases discredit this fund in the eyes of farmers
who, since they are skeptical about how it works, refuse to continue to
contribute to it.
2.55           The mortality situation varies from area to area, but efforts
in health coverage and care provided by farmers remain, all in all, at an
acceptable level. After five years the mortality rate was 2-3 percent, which
is lower than the national average (3-4 percent) and the rate (10 percent)
upon which the fixing of premiums is based (Annex 6, Table 10).   The
imperfect monitoring of the fund and its inadequate application in the field
would seem to indicate the .eed for caution, particularly since the
statistical data available are incomplete.
2.56           The recovery situation is not very good (Annex 6, Table 6).
Recovery rates have dropped alarmingly from one crop year to another. The
same trend can be observed for the payment of premiums from one crop year to



- 23 -
another. The deterioration in recovery arises from:
- a lack of awareness on the part of farmers who are not always convinced of
the usefulness of this fund and who become lax about it;
- the poor operation of the fund on the ground, with mortality cases not
always being investigated and settled with sufficient diligence, which makes
the system lose credibility;
- the relatively high amount of the premium despite a reduction in FCMB rates
in 1987/88 and the reduction in the number of payments from five to two,
which comes in addition to the credit coming due, in an economic situation
which is sometimes rendered difficult in certain areas by climatic
conditions.
2.57           The project had envisaged lines of medium-term credit for
vegetable crops (for the purchase of motor-driven pumps) and milling
equipment. This component was quickly abandoned as a result of catastrophic
recovery rates. The equipment purchased was largely abandoned because it was
inappropriate (Annex 6, Table 6a).
9. Studies-and groiects tR be approved
2.58           These studies and projects come within the framework of
possible future studies and actions not explicitly provided for in the
project, the aim of which is to overcome any possible obstacles to the
execution of the project and to make it more effective:
(a)   reinforcement of the functional literacy program by means of support
for the national mass literacy program ("Commando" literacy);
(b)   a study on the cotton sector necessitated by the financial deficit
in this field of activity;
(c)   the launching of a test management program for village lands, to
develop a methodology for futuro intervention in the rural milieu
while taking account of the management of natural resources as a
wlhole,  with  the active participation of  the people.    These
activities were carried out from the end of 1986.
2.59           "Commando"  literacy,  which  in April  1985 mobilized all
outreach personnel, FJA, anlmateurs, and almost all extension workers (188
people in all), helped teach about 2,100 producers out of 3,500 participants
to read and write (60 percent). This can be termed a success, in light of
the difficulties encountered as this campaign unfolded - problems of an
organizational, sociological, and pedagogical nature. Although this mass
literacy program undoubtedly reinforced the project's functional literacy
program, it did nevertheless create a major problem which the project was not
able to solve, i.e. the rapid provision of post-literacy educational
materials so that the newly-literate could maintain the skills acquired.
2.60           The study on the cotton sector.  The objective of this study,
which was carried out in September-October 1986 by a consultant mission, was
to propose recovery measures for the cotton sector which was operating at a
loss following the collepse of world cotton prices.   It resulted in



- 24 -
recommendations based on a strategy   involving the improvement of the
competitiveness of producers and of the subsector during the crisis. These
recommendations, which were to be applied immediately, included the
following:
(a)   full-scale application of a first series of measures (reduction of
variable costs, reduction of fixed costs, increases in sales prices
of seeds and oil seeds, increase in sales of improved fiber by the
introduction of a new variety);
(b)   a provisional limitation of production as from 1987/88 in the
peripheral and marginal areas, so as to level off national
production at 130,000-140,000 tons;
(c)   reinforcement of 1987 ginning capacities to a level of + 10 percent
(126,000 to 150,000 tons);
(d)   revision of the producer price for a twofold readjustment of the
variable cost/cotton sales price ratio, and of cotton price/cereals
price ratios;
(e)   the carrying out of an in-depth study on improving uechanisms for
stabilizing the prices of agricultural products;
(f)   creation of a unit to monitor the cotton sector.
These recommendations were not totally implemented, given the political
problems posed by some of them. However, application in part, in particular
the reduction in the producer price and the cost reduction, has already
permitted a reduction in the cotton sector deficit. It has not, however, led
to a levelling-off of cotton production which is close to 170,000-180,000
tons.
2.61           Test management program for village lands.    This program
which was entrusted to the Monitoring/Evaluation department, is part of
research into the methods of intervention which takes into account management
of the natural resources of the village lands as a whole with the active
participation of the people. The following conclusions can be drawn:
- Although it was necessary and possible in the beginning to give priority
to production activities and to promote the increase in agricultural
production by means of modern techniques with no regard for environmental
problems, this now appears not only dangerous but impossible. The situation
as a whole, from an ecological and particularly demographic point of viev,
has changed and the population in certain project areas in the South has
doubled. Space, once considered infinite, is now limited. Demographic and
land pressure have resulted in the fragility of agrarian systems where
conditions for maintaining the natural resources (regeneration of fertility
by leaving land fallow, mobility of herds, preservation of wooded
groundcover) are no longer assured.   From the North to the South of the
project area, the appearance of land problems characterizes this increasingly
tense situation in a disputed area:



- 25 -
(a)   competing pressure from farmers and breeders over pastoral land;
(S)   population migration resulting in a frantic race for land.  Local
villagers rush to clear new land in order to be able to have a claim
on land reserves which gives today's land management a 'mining"
character.
The lesson learned can thus be expressed in terms of the need to protect
productive land capital. This is a basic requirement for all agricultural
production which is threatened and must be preserved. On that account, the
concept of "manarement of natural resources" has resulted in major efforts
on the part of the Government; the N.itional Program for Village Land
Management currently being prepared bears witness to this. The test programs
initiated at the project level and in other regions of the country form the
base of this national program.
2.62           Within the established limits, the objectives of the Test
Village Land Management Program (PGTV - Programme Test de Gestlon des
Terroirs Vlllageols) were the following:
(a)   to acquire a better knowledge of the human and physical environment
centered on land problems which would enable the main lines of
intervention to be defined;
(b)   to encourage the emergence of local decision-making and management
capacities by means  of a concerted  approach;  to   establish
contractual obligations with the village communities in order to
establish a village management contract closely linking Government
and villagers for the implementation of a plan for the management
of natural resources; and
(c)   develop  and test village  land development  measures  based on
inexpensive techniques, easily accepted and mastered by the people
themselves.
2.63           The program, planned for two years, comprises activities and
studies, with priority given to action. The study and research program was
principally composed of a phase involving the study of the human and physical
environment with a view to identifying test zones and villages, an
environment diagnosis phase to ensure adequate resources, a phase involving
study of the production systems to devise simplified schemes for developing
land and village contracts. The action program planned for three (3) test-
villages  comprised:    the setting-up of village  institutions  for land
management (management committees), boundary-marking, zoning and the
implementation of management contracts.
2.64           Results obtained after two and a half years of trials are
encouraging:  at the action program level, th, management committees have
been created, and land boundaries have been marked. Zoning is being carried
out.  The entire program was to have been completed by end March 1989.  The
study and research program are winding up, and most of the program has
already been carried out.



- 26 -
2.65           Lessons to be learned at the present stage of the program are
the following:
(a)   awareness on the part of the population of problems concerning the
deterioration of their ecosystem;
(b)   the need for a concerted approach, with the population, integrating
all the activities of the environment (agriculture, forestry, animal
husbandry);
(c)   the capacity of the people to organize themselves;
(d)   the complexity of the land situation, difficult to straighten out
without an appropriate legal and land framework;
(e)   institutional problems linked with the separation of technical
services involved in the rural environment which results in
uncoordinated and sometimes contradictory actions; and
(f)   technical problems related to:  the change in scale of application
of activities compared with the classical approach; the diversity
of operating methods; the necessity to take account of all the
branches of production; and the absence of adapted technical
standards.
D.- Pxrearation of tRQorsM onitoXingnd Evaluation. Accounts
2.66           During project execution, quarterly and annual reports were
prepared fairly regularly. Monitoring and Evaluation suffered considerably
from delays in the appointment and establishment of national and expatriate
staff. Only in the fourth year of the project did the M/E service become
operational. During the fourth and sixth years of the project, this service
achieved the following:
(a)   a survey involving monitoring of farming units:  data collection,
processing and analysis over four years (PYs 1, 4, 5 and 6);
(b)   internal project monitoring:   setting-up of a mechanism for the
monitoring and appraisal of project activities with choice of
indicators, allowing an appraisal of the performances of activities
undertaken; the results were published in periodic reports;
(c)   support  to  different  offices  for  the  creation  of  different
monitoring documents and training of agents responsible for data
collection;
(d)   support for the identification and formulation of small subprojects;
(a)   studies of cereal production to assess surface areas and yields of
cereal crops. This study, initiated by the Studies Department of
the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, comes within the



- 27 -
framework of the monitoring of agricultural crop years.   Three
studies were carried out in YYs 4, 5 and 6;
(f)   specific studies on fertilizer use and on selected seeds; and
(g)   initiation and implementation of a test program for management of
village land.
The Monitoring and Evaluation office was equipped in 1987 with micro-
computers which have improved its data processing performance.
2.67           The project's accounting service suffered from understaffing.
The  absence  of  a  qualified  financial  coordinator  was  especially
problematical, and explains tile delays which occurred in accounting. Despite
the recommendations of the supervision mission staff, recruitment, which
would have strengthened this service, was not successful for reasons
essentially linked to the availability, on a national level, of qualified
senior staff. Recruitment of a team of national accounting experts with the
dual goal of catching up on delays and developing a plan for reorganizing
the accounting process was not without its ups and downs:   a first team,
recruited in September 1987, proved to be unsatisfactory, and a second team
was recruited just weeks before the end of the project period. The auditing
of accounts was carried out satisfactorily, despite delays in the submission
of reports. The delays were essentially due to the complicated procurement
procedures involving the above-mentioned team. At present the accumulated
delays in disbursement have mostly been made up. All in all, in spite of the
constraints mentioned, the performance of the accounting service can be
considered satisfactory.
E. Procurement and Works
2.68           Overall, the terms of the Agreement were abided by.   As
experience has shown, however, there were numerous irregularities in the
execution of procurement: poor quality in the realization of certain works;
delivery deadlines not met; the reduced maneuverability of the CRPA. This
has resulted in:
-     delays in the delivery of residential housing at  headquarters;
-     delays in the delivery of construction materials, miscellaneous
other materials, and vehicles;
-     delays in the Monitoring and Evaluation coordinator's taking up
service.

F. Costs, Financing and Disbursements
2.69           Detailed data on actual costs compared to initial estimates
are presented in Annex 13 for the 13 categories by which project accounts
were kept. The overall outcome is as follows:
Appraisal        Actual Costs       MA/E s/
Estimate  A/   Annex 13  Adjusted g/  %
----------(CFAF million)---------
Agriculture and Livestock         1636.0          953.6     953.6       58

TOTAL                             6866.0        8835.9    4480.5        65
a/ From Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), page 15, with contingencies allocated
to components. The total cost shown in the SAR in CFAF was 6,636 million,
in contrast to 6,866 million above; the difference comes from a small CCCE
supplementary project that was integrated into project accounts.
1/ The adjustment is for the treatment of annual inputs.   In the project
accounts at Annex 13, the annual cost of all inputs is included. In the
SAR, however, only the incremental cost of annual inputs was included.
The "Adjusted" column, therefore, includes the actual incremental cost of
annual inputs, on the simplifying assumption that pre-project input use
was CFAF 100 million/year.
./ Adjusted Actuals/Estimates.
Using the adjusted actual costs to provide a basis comparable with the
appraisal estimates, the four main project components had similar realization
rates (5C-75%), the only outlier being the small "Studies and Projects to be
Approved" component, at 20%. These numbers conceal one important difference:
within the broad Supplies and Credit component, expenditures on medium-term
credit were only 32% of appraisal estimates, whereas expenditures on annual
inputs (adjusted) were 169% of appraisal estimates. Higher-than-anticipated
annual input use is a reflexion of the spectacular increase in cotton
production, but lower-than-anticipated demand for medium-term credit has no
simple explanation except perhaps over-estimation at appraisal.
2.70           In dollar terms, actual disbursements reached only 26% of the
Credit amount. This is partly attributable to the higher CFAF/dollar rate
over the di.bursement period than at appraisal (350 instead of 300). It is
also due to the large share of the Credit that was provided for funding
animal traction and milling equipment (Category 3) and credit for oxen and
cereal banks (Category 4). These two categories included 40% of the Credit
amount net of unallocated, and disbursements clearly suffered from the lower-
than-expected demand for medium-term credit cited above.

III. IMPACT MS AGRICULTURE AND RATE OF RET
A. ImDact on Agriculture
1 - Production
Project estimates
3.01           At appraisal, the project was intended to offer complete
extension services directly to 22,000 farmers and a complementary program to
24,000 farmers already reached. The principal advantages expected of the
project were increases in annual agricultural production (for cotton and
cereal) of a net value estimated at US$8.8 million at the end of the fifth
year, and an improvement in income from agriculture which would increase from
US$36 to US$41 per family.
3.02           As regards cotton, the amount of land used for cotton growing
would increase from 26,000 ha in PYO to 29,200 ha in PY5, i.e., an increase
of 11.5 percent.   Average yields would increase from 920 kg/ha to 1,050
kg/ha, i.e., 14 percent.  Production would increase from 24,104 to 30,660
tons, or by 27 percent.
3.03           As regards cereals and groundnuts, the project included three
groups of complementary techniques which would allow farmers to improve
production:
- the first group comprises basic techniques:  improved seeds, the usage
of organic matter, plowing, seed processing, sowing in drills, thinning
out and ridge-plowing, weeding;
- the second group, in addition to these, includes the usage of
fertilizers;
- the third group adds improved seed varieties.
In addition, the project recommended animal traction. The impact of these
recommendations was assessed in terms of expansion and crop intensification.
The following table summarizes this expected impact.



- 30 -
(surface areas, in hectares)
- improved seeds               2,100
- animal traction expansion   1,368            780
- intensified (rotation and
excluding rotation)         2,866        41,028           5,365
The increase estimated in yields would be, according to the recommendations
envisaged:
(kg/ha)
- basic techniques                     142        180
- addition of fertilizers           + 314       + 550
- addition of improved seed         + 100       + 150
- animal traction                       90        220
Total                     646       1,100
Additional cumulative cereal production estimated in PYS would be:
sorghum            9,336 tons
maize              5,325   n
groundnuts           884   n
millet               588
Performance
3.04           It is difficult to compare performance with estimates since
actual outputs reflect weather and migration into the project area, both
being exogenous factors for the project, but of great importance in the
project area. In the following sections, therefore, a careful attempt has
been made to determine project-induced production net of weather and
migration. The detailed assumptions are in Annex 9, and the detailed results
in Annex 10.
3.05           Cotton production.  Cotton production is as follows:
pgroduc          y        surface  are    roduction  X±I1l
Rri£2 (CFAF)                    .(ha)         (t)      (kg/ha)
62        81/82 (PYO)      26,200        22,248       849
62        82/83 (PY1)      28,025        29,222    1,043
70        83/84 (PY2)      30,680        33,230    1,083
90        84/85 (PY3)      34,040        36,661    1,076
100        85/86 (PY4)      38,590        49,627    1,290
100        86/87 (PY5)      48,600        77,667    1,598
95        87/88 (PY6)      55,420        58,157    1,050



- 31 -
The surface area employed in cotton protuction more than doubled between the
beginning and end of the project (+ 111 percent). It was from Year 4 that
growth was greatest. The principal factors contributing to this spectacular
increase were:
(a)   the increase in producer price which went from 62 in PY1 to 100 CFAF
per kilo in PYS. A slight drop was registered in PY6;
(b)   a massive transfer of cereal surface areas to cotton following a
slump in cereals, particularly in PY4. Yields continued to increase
until PY5, reaching 1,600 kg/ha. As a result of low rainfall in
PY6, yields dropped to 1,050 kg/ha which was the amount estimated
by the project.
Production had reached 58,000 tons by the end of the project period, i.e. an
increment of 36,000 tons over Year 0, in contrast to the appraisal estimate
or 6,800 tonsl
3.06           The specific project-induced growth in cotton production
results from the adoption of the technical themes proposed by the project,
i.e.:
(a)   expansion of surface areas due to animal traction;
(b)   increased yields due to soil preparation by non-manual means
(plowing);
(c)   increased yields due to mineral fertilizer usage (NPK and urea);
and
(d)   increased yields due to cotton insecticide treatment.
Adoption rates and corresponding production increases are specified in Annex
9, and were derived from a data cross-check from the survey on the monitoring
of farming units and from specific studies, and data from extension agents
and from recent results obtained by the Agricultural Research Institute
(INERA). On this basis, project-induced cotton output is estimated at 33,000
tons in PY6.
3.07           Cereal production.  Da.a relating to cereals are less reliable
and complete than those for cotton.   In addition,  procedures for the
collection of statistical data by extension have not followed the technical
stratification adopted during appraisal. The data used were derived from the
survey on the monitoring of farming units, from specific studies, and from
results obtained by INERA.
3.08           The growth factors adopted are:
(a)   an increase in surface areas due to animal traction;
(b)   an increase in yields due to soil preparation;



- 32 -
(c)   an increase in yields due to selected seeds.
The assumptions on which these calculations are based can be found in Annex
9. Annex 10, Table 4, illustrates project-induced production.
3.09           On these bases, project-induced cereals production was 15,000
tons in PY6.   This figure would be even higher if the direct impact of
mineral fertilizers were included, but the data are incomplete.
ADRraisal Estimates and Actual Performance Compared
3.10           The estimated incremental output at appraisal (SAR, Annex 8,
Table 2), actual incremental outputs (Annex 10, Table 1) and the calculated
"project-induced" incremental output for cotton (Annex 10, Table 3) and
cereals (Annex 10, Table 4) are as follows:
1982/3   1983/4   1984Z5   1985Z6   1986/7   198718

Project-induced     4         6       10       11        15       15
Project-induced outputs are similar to appraisal estimates on cereals but
much higher on cotton. In both cases, actual outputs are higher still, and
much higher on cereals. For rate of return purposes, project benefits are
taken to be the sum of project-induced cotton and cereals outputs. A further
proviso is that the carry-over effect of earlier projects in the area has to
be netted out. This is done (page 38) by ascribing PY1 incremental output
to the earlier projects and subtracting that value from the benefit stream.
This reduces the benefit stream by 27% in PY6 and beyond (and by much higher
percentages in the earlier years).
2 - Technological development
3.11           Globally,  through the increase in consumption of inputs
(fertilizers, insecticides) and the development in yields, an improvement in
farming techniques with relation to both cotton and cereals (sorghum, maize)
can be seen. A more in-depth analysis quickly came up against a lack of
basic data which was supplied by the extension system only.
3.12           The  data used  for  this  analysis  are  thus  general  and
qualitative and, in most cases, derived from survey results and from direct
on-site observations.   The technological development attributable to the



- 33 -
project was analyzed by means of the various indicators set out below.
Develogment of crop distribution in the _gniect area and at farx level_
3.13           Annex 10, Table 1, shows the development of cultivated areas
for the principal crops (cotton, sorghum, millet, groundnuts). Development
of the relative breakdown of the crops is as follows (in %):
erops               yQ              tf6
cotton              10              14
maize                5               3
sorghum             51              40
millet              30              40
groundnuts           4               3
TOTAL              100             100
3.14           Relative data reveal progress in cotton, a drop in maize, a
balance between millet and sorghum, and stagnation in groundnuts. Globally,
food crops represent 80-85 percent of cropped surface areas and cash crops
15-20 percent. These data mask regional disparities; in reality, there is
a much greater proportion of cotton and maize in the South of the project
area than in the North.
3.15           At farm level, the following can be noted between PYO and PY5
(Annex 11, Tables 1 and 2):
- major expansion, in particular with respect to those using non-manual
methods, of the surface areas cultivated, particularly in the Northern area
where possibilities for intensification are limited relative to the Southern
area;
- a substantial increase in the number of plots of land, for both
mechanized and non-mechanized farmers;
- the increasing share of cotton and maize in the South (in PY6, 27
percent for cotton and 12 percent for maize for non-manual farmers).
3.16           In the development of yields  (Annex 10,  Table  1),  the
following are noted:
- a drop in cotton yield in PY6 due to unfavorable rainfall conditions,
but as demonstrated by PY5 results, this drop is not irreversible;
- a substantial and continuous growth in maize yield;
- a stagnation in sorghum yield;
- a slight upturn in PY6 for groundnuts,

3.17           Development of global fertilizer consumption  indicates a
substantial growth which exceeds project goals (Annex 2, Table 1).  This
consumption occurs essentially on cotton and, to a lesser extent, on maize.
Sorghum, in particular, seems to benefit at present only from the secondary
effects of fertilizer applied on cotton. In Project Year 6 consumption per
hectare stood at 143 kg/ha of NPK and 57 kg/ha of urea for cotton, 80-90
kg/ha of NPK and 55 kg/ha of urea for maize (A mex 10, Table 2). Between
Year 0 and Year 6, the proportion of cotton surface areas fertilized with NPK
and urea increased, respectively, from 67 tc P5 percent, and from 8 to 40
percent. For maize, tnis proportion increased from 45 to 80 percent for NPK
and from 5 to 12 percent for urea.
3.18           In conclusion, NPK was applied over nearly all cotton areas
and over four-fifths of maize areas. In spite of marketing problems which
limit ite expansion, maize is increasingly, and almost to the same extent as
cotton, considered a cash crop. The addition of urea is also generalized on
cotton and maize, in practically the same quantities per hectare.
3.19           Insecticide  consumption  dropped  in  Year  6  following  a
substantial increase in prices due to the removal of subsidies (Annex 2,
Table 1).  This consumption is closely linked to the expansion of cotton
areas. The impact of the project can be seen in:
- an increase in the quantity per hectare from 4.5 liters in Year 0 to 7
liters in Year 6. Before the removal of subsidies, this quantity was 8.5
liters/ha; and
- the replacement of conventional produces by ULV (ultra low volume
spraying) products  (75 percent ULV compared to 25 percent conventional
products in Year 6).
3.20           Proportions of cotton areas treated in Year 6 are 79 percent
for the first treatment and 21 percent for the sixth. In Year 5, before the
removal of subsidies, they were 98 percent and 7 percent respectively.
Development of organic fertilizer use
3.21           No improvement can be seen in the usage of organic fertilizer
following execution of the project, owing to the delay experienced in setting
up the Agriculture/Livestock Integration component. The problem of organic
restitution thus remains unsolved, as does that of the preservation of soil
fertility; hence the necessity to emphasize production and farmers' use of
organic matter.
3.22           Crop rotation.   This subject has shown little development
since 1981/82. However, the following points can be noted:
- a progressive replacement of sorghum by maize in a system of triennial
rotation.   In the 150 sample farming units regularly monitored during the



- 35 -
project period, the following was observed:
- in 55% of plots: maize, preceded by cotton
- in 26% of plots: sorghum, preceded by cotton
- in 28% of plots: maize, preceded by maize or sorghum
- in 48% of plots: sorghum, preceded by maize or sorghum
- in  2% of plots: maize, following a fallow period
- in  7% of plots: sorghum, following a fallow period.
In spite of the increase in the price of fertilizer, the usage of NPK and
urea has not dropped substantially.
3.23           Quantities of NM  per hectare, which were 152.5 kg/ha in
1982/83, had stabilized at about 140 kg/ha by the end of the project.
3.24           The usage of urea has fluctuated.  This can be explained by
the amount of rainfall.
3.25           Nevertheless, the average dose for the project peri.d was
about 40 kg/ha, which is fairly close to the 50 kg/ha recommended by the
extension service.
-   a   progressive   movement   away   from   triennial   crop   rotation
(cotton/cereal/cereal) in favor of biennial crop rotation (cotton/cereal),
particularly in the Southern area.
3.26           This preference for maize over sorghum in crop rotation is
encouraging for future self-sufficiency in food, since maize is a crop with
high yield potential. However, there is a problem with organic restitution
as sorghum is more likely to furnish an appropriate quantity of harvest
waste.
Development and use of agricultural equipment:
3.27           Annex 2, Table  1 shows  the development of agricultural
equipment acquired within the framework of the project.  Only the  targets
concerning draft oxen and plows were not met, and the reasons for this were
analyzed in Chapter II. The majority of this equipment was acquired in the
Southern area. It should be noted that farmers found the credit conditions
offered by the project via the CNCA too restrictive and thus acquired their
equipment outside the project.   The acquisition of carts has progressed
significantly.  This equipment is the easiest to make profitable since it
can transport anything (inputs, manure, harvest, harvest waste, fodder,
people, wood, bricks, etc). The proportion of surface areas plowed (cotton
+ cereals) went from 26,104 ha in Year 0 to 135,419 ha in Year 6, i.e. from
10 to 35 percent of total areas cropped in cotton and cereals.   The
proportion of weeded areas increased from 5 to 15 percent between Years 0 and
6.
3.28           On average, only one weeding by animal traction is done.  This
low proportion can be explained by the low usage of weeders and by the fact



- 36 -
that farmers have not sufficiently mastered their equipment. The number of
equipped farming units is estimated as follows:
type of material    farming units equipped (%)
draft oxen                  25
plows                       31
weeders                      7
carts                       35
ridge-plows                  2
A real effort to distribute equipment remains to be made. Extension workers
should play a more important role in the optimal use of the equipment. The
extension system should place greater emphasis on the mastery of the
techniques of weeding and ridge-plowing by traction. The cost of ridges may,
however, prohibit a broader rate of adoption.
3 - PQoulation migrations
3.29           Over the last two decades, the project area has experienced
enormous population surges from the North and the central plateau (Nossi
plateau). These are the result of three major factors:
(a) the economic inequality between the various regions, accentuated at
times by unfavorable climatic conditions;
(b) the existence of an environment favorable to migrants; and
(c) the nature of the insertion mechanisms for migrants within host
areas.
3.30           These population movements follow a North-East - South-Vest
gradient in stages, and vary in quantity:
(a) a direct flow deriving in particular from the central plateau which
is the transit point for the greatest number of migrants (80
percent);
(b) an indirect flow from the same area but with movements taking place
from the North to the South of the project area;
(c) a local flow with movements from one village to another.
3.31           An assessment of these flows based on general population
census data from 1975 and 1985 shows a positive migratory balance of 59,600
people in 10 years, or an average of almost 6,000 people per annum (Annex 12,
Tables 1, 2 and 3):

arrivals                 4,579           89,845       95,425

Total (difference)       30,243          89,845    + 59,602
3.32           Although the three development projects which have taken place
within the project area (the cotton project, the PDAOV and the PDABM) did not
trigger the migratory movement, they certainly intensified it. On a basis
of 6,000 people per annum, the migratory contribution during the execution
of the PDABM can be estimated as 36,000 people, or 6,000 families.   The
impact of this migratory phenomenon can be seen in:
(a) a rejuvenation of the population in the host area by an influx of
working-age migrants;
(b) area expansion of cotton, which no doubt explains the cotton "boom'
in the area;
(c) demographic pressure resulting in land pressure in certain areas
which leads to an ecological imb7lance.
This impact shows a need to find means of reducing the negative effects of
migration on the environment. Since immigrants do not own the land they
work, they tend to exhaust the soil without making the 'nvestment necessary
to improve it. What is needed are means to help and motivate migrants to
adopt farming methods which will protect the environment, without the
Government having to intervene too forcefully (see Chapter II, c).
B. Rate of Return
3.33           All internationally-traded goods and services were valued
either at c.i.f. price (port of destination for imports) or at f.o.b. price
(port of origin for exports), with allowances made for any charges likely to
arise for handling, storage, and distribution to the site of consumption or
production.    Other, non-tradeable, goods and services are adjusted where
necessary to eliminate fees and subsidies. Prices were calculated on the
basis of Bank price projections until the year 2000, with all prices
expressed in constant 1985 dollars.
3.34           Since it is not possible to quantify all project benefits,
only those benefits derived directly from the increase in agricultural
production were included. The benefit stream was determined from project-
induced incremental cotton and cereals output, as explained in para. 3.10.
3.35           Labor  costs  are  assessed  at  their  opportunity  cost.
Additional labor was estimated at 500 CFAF per man-day over the project area
as a whole. Recurrent costs needed to maintain the current level of after-
project activities, including extension costs, input costs and administration



- 38 -
costs, are assessed at 30 percent of the costs of the last project year.
3.36          Given the costs and benefits shown below, the rate of return
over a twenty-year period is 22%.

4.01           The project wa.s executed by the ORD (Organlsatlon Rdglonal de
Ddveloppement - Regional Development Organization) which in April 1988 became
the CRPA (Centre R6glonal de Promotlon Agro-pastorale - Regional Center for
Agro-pastoral Promotion). Between 1982 and 1988, various unprecedented
events occurred which severely disturbed the operations of this organization,
and hampered its performance.
4.02           First internal staff turnover affected all levels of the
hierarchy. The following table shows the amplitude of this turnover.

- 40 -
4.03           Some staff who transferred to other agencies were replaced:
five (5) new agents have just been assigned to the CRPA.   Absences for
training, which particularly affected extension agents, were completely
compensated for by the transfer of outreach workers to extension work and the
recruitment of new agents. There have, however, been considerable delays,
and in general, replacements have not kept up with departures.
4.04           The slowness of the processes for recruitment and assignment
means that posts generally remained vacant for at least six months. The post
of Agriculture/Livestock Integration Officer remained vacant until 1986.
As a consequence, of eight technical offices, only four were headed by senior
staff (at the engineer level). The four others were headed by extension
agents, outreach workers or middle management staff (at the senior technician
level).
4.05           The  requisitioning  of  vehicles  and  workers  by  the
Administration for political-administrative tasks was frequent and upset the
normal evolution of the agricultural cycle. In just one case, 20 project
workers (extension agents and investigators) were requisitioned in December
1985 for a period of three weeks for the general population census. Non-
statutory holidays, often announced very late, disturbed the programming of
activities.
4.06           The winding-up of the ORD in May 1987 only served to aggravate
an already difficult situation. The ORD remained without legal status during
a period of 10 months, i.e., the 1987/88 crop year, which had a significant
effect on its relations with its external partners, in particular SOFITEX,
CNCA and the suppliers. The last Board of Directors meeting dates back to
June 1986.
4.07           At present four statutes now regulate ORD staff:
1) the collective agreement for basic extension workers;
2) Decree 72 AST for laborers, chauffeurs, employees;
3) Decree 540 for contractors;
4) The Civil Service State for civil servants.
This diversity of statutes makes staff management particularly difficult.
4.08           In such a situation, the performance of executing agencies has
certainly suffered, which no doubt explains the poor results obtained for
some project components.
V. INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES
5.01           It is clear that agricultural development depends on a complex
group of institutions whose management and coordination need to be improved.
As can be seen in Chapter IV, the problems encountered by the project during
its execution for the most part exceed the strict framework of the project
and require that the Government find a more workable approach to rural
development.



- 41 -
A. TheExecuting Agency
5.02           The executing agency was strongly affected by its unstable
staff situation (regarding both national and expatriate staff) which
sometimes seriously compromised the smooth running of the programs. This was
true at all levels of staffing. The major event was the noticeable decrease
in the number of senior management staff in key project posts. This negated
the usefulness of the training of senior staff carried out by the project.
The role and the place of technical assistance should be better defined in
the future, in particular with a view to the effective involvement of the
local staff in the conception and implementation of programs and to a real
transfer of knowledge.   With this in mind, the terms of reference of
technical assistants should be better planned and more concise as to their
contents.
B. Relations with Agricultural Research
5.03           In the area of agronomic research, by their participation and
their capital outlay, numerous international donors and research institutes
made it possible to set up local research organizations for most of the
principal basic products, but made very little effort to study problems
resulting from the present farming systems or to apply research results to
certain products under real farming conditions.   For the last decade,
measures have been taken to orient research in this direction in order to try
out, on-site, improved farming practices which have been developed by the
research organizations.
5.04           Within the framework of the project, links with INERA have
been much strengthened due in particular to the creation of the PAPEM and of
the new extension system which involves researchers in its training. To make
these links productive, there should be real coordination between research,
the extension services and the ;eneficiaries of the research, i.e., the
producers.   A more precise strategy for agricultural research should be
defined so as to avoid a proliferation of overlapping research programs
centered on farming systems which, through lack of support, will bring no
improvement over the past. This issue is being addressed under the National
Research Project (Cr. 1896-BUR) approved in 1988.
C. Extension
5.05           The re-organized extension service no doubt represents a step
forward in the quest for better extension staff productivity by structuring
their work by means of a system of training and monitoring of farmers, and
of on-the-job training. However, at the end of several years' experience,
the system has revealed some weaknesses which must be corrected if it is to
become more effective. First, the choice of technical themes is not always
appropriate since account is not fully taken of the heterogeneity of the
groups to whom messages are addressed.   Secondly, field workers receive
insufficient direction and the intermediate-level supervisory staff are
poorly  trained.    Finally,  the  system does  not  include  an effective
Monitoring-Evaluation component which would make it possible to measure the



- 42 -
real impact of extension activities. These weaknesses are being addressed
under the National Agricultural Support Services Project (Cr. 1979-BUR) of
1989.
D. Cerel Marketirg
5.06           Until now the role played by the OFNACER was limited to buying
no more than 30 percent of surplus cereal marketed in the project area (Annex
7, Table 4). OFNACER remains limited in its field of action by the lack of
marketing funds and transport, and its inefficiency.
5.07           Data on marketing are insufficient but it would appear that
private trading and the practice of storage at the farmer level give fairly
good results, given the restrictions imposed by the inadequate transport
infrastructure. Monitoring of cereal marketing in the project area reveals
the following:
(a) cereal purchases by OFNACER do not exceed 30 percent of the area's
cereal surplus. The major share of these purchases is carried out
through traders and purchasing centers (Annex 7, Table 4);
(b) purchases through village groups rapidly came up against problems
of coordination between OFNACER and CRPA and of logistics;
(c) the inadequacy of transport of cereal surpluses from one region to
another means that the Northern project area still suffers from food
shortages;
sd) this situation, which forces cereal producers to dispose of their
produce on the market at prices often 50 percent lower than official
prices, limits the potential for implementing the cereals
intensification studies.   In effect,  after replenishing their
stocks, producers turn away from cereal production and favor cotton.
E. Livyestock
5.08           The livestock question was approached by the pro;ect from the
angle of its integration with agriculture.   The principal problem during
execution of this project component is an institutional one. Even though,
officially, the Provincial Livestock Services (SPE - Services ProvIn2i1auz
d'Elevage) are under the control of the CRPAs, in reality they still operate
as autonomous services with specific programs. It was not easy to associate
these services with the execution of the component relating to the IAE
because of the difficulties experienced in harmonizing policies and programs
of activities on the ground.  Another difficulty lies in the absence of
training for extension workers in animal husbandry.
P. CWCa- SQFITEX
5.09           When CNCA and SOFITEX took over all the medium-term credit,
the distribution of inputs, and the marketing of -otton in 1988, the CRPA



- 43 -
underwent short-term financial difficulties and lost any possibility of self-
financing and was obliged to turn to the State budget. This situation should
be remedied: the CRPA should have its previous privileges restored if the
actions accomplished by the project are to be continued, or the budgetary
transfers have to be ensured.
G. Co-financing
5.10           The complexity of the project's financial package did nothing
to facilitate the rapid release of funds. Different closing dates meant that
it was not possible to complete certain activities. Certain differences in
sti%tegies surfaced during the project period which at times slowed the
execution of certain components.
H. Procurement
5.11           The complexity of procurement procedures seriously disrupted
the schedule for execution of the investment programs (cf Chapter II, C -
Construction). The first construction works were not carried out until the
third year of the project.
I. Higration
5.12           The extent of migration resulted in both demographic and land
pressures which created a dangerous situation of ecological imbalance and
whtich, in time, risk seriously deteriorating the land capital on which
production activities are based. Therefore it is urgent that a new approach
be developed which would permit this trend to be controlled by including it
in a long-term program of rational management of natural resources.
VI. FOLLO-UP PROJECTS
6.01           Three follow-up projects are in progress.   The National
Village Land Management Project (PNGTV - Projet Natlonal de Gestlon des
Terrolrs Vlllageols) was appraised in June 1990; the Agricultural Support
Services Project (PRESAP - Projet de Renforcement des Services d'Appui aux
Producteurs) is under supervision; the Rural Development Project for the
Kossi Province has been appraised by the CCCE. In line with the Bank's new
intervention strategy, the first two of these three projects are national
projects. The third is a regional project.
VII. CONCLUSIa
7.01           In general the PDABM has performed well in reinforcing the
activities of the preceding project and in stimulating the pattern of
agricultural development in the area. Results obtained in the growth in
agricultural production are satisfactory.
7.02           From the technical point of view, the majority of objectives



- 44 -
have  been  met  and  even  exceeded;    project-induced  cotton  production
dramatically surpassed appraisal goals while that of cereals met the
objectives set. Other activities did not meet project goals; in particular
the construction of village warehouses (where only 30 percent of goals were
met), improved seed, and medium-term credit.
7.03           From the institutional point of -:iew, the project contributed
to:
- the reinforcement of the T&V system by improving its performance and
adaptability;
- the promotion of village groups which participate actively in the marketing
of agricultural products, in the management of inputs and credit, and in
general in all village activities.
7.04           The following lessons can be drawn from the principal problems
encountered during execution of the project:
From the institutional Roint of view:
(a)   improvement of the performance of the execution agency through
better management of available human resources and, where possible,
by avoiding staff turnover. Should technical assistance prove to
be indispensable, its role should be better defined;
(b)   continuation of the strengthening of ties with research institutes
with more adaptive programs;
(c)   clarification of relations with the other partner institutions by
a division of responsibilities and a better coordination of
activities;
(d)   simplification of lengthy procurement procedures which handicap the
schedule for investment execution.
From the technical Roint of view:
(e)   the necessity,  or even urgency,  to preserve and better manage
productive land capital by means of a technical program emphasizing
the preservation of soil fertility and a real integration of
productive activities (agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry);
(f)   the redeployment of extension agents from the present, technical,
approach towards a global and integrated approach by using a
management council system;
(g)   the need to improve financial management by:  appointing qualified
staff; devising a plan for the reorganization of the accounting
system; and introducing cost accounting.

ASSUMOTIONS FOR THE CALCMLATION OF
PROJECT-INDUCED PRODUCTION
Working hypotheses and calculation methods
II - Workins hmotheses
- the growth in production due to the increase In land surfaces and to
intensLfication (increased yields)
- within the framework of the PDABM, factors of production growth, directly
or indirectly linked to production factors installed, are the followings
- the increase in surface areas due to animal traction;
- the increase in yields due to soil preparation by non-manual means
(plowing);
- the increase in yields due to the use of mineral fertilization (MMZ or
urea);
- the increase in cereal yields due to the secondary effects of cotton
fertilizer;
- the increase in yields due to the use of selected seeds
- the increase in yields due to cotton lnsectlcide treatments.
The effect of seed treatment on coreals and groundnuts has not been included,
firstly because the quantities sold by the ProSect are small in relation to
the areas cropped, and secondly because the distrlbution of these products
by crop is not known. In addLtion, most of these products. were sold off.
Project.
Since 1982183, the data concerning the cereal surface areas having been
treated with NPM and with urea are incomplete.
II - Calculation methods
1 - increase in surface areas due to animal traction
A cross-check of data from the survey/monitoring of farming units and of
those drawn from a sample of data from extension centers reveals that wlth,
a pair of oxen it was possible to increase the surface area of the farming
unit by 2 ha the first year (0.5 ha of cotton and 1.5 ha of cerz2l); and by
3 ha the following years (0.75 ha of cotton and 2.25 ha of cereals). Thesi
results should be weighted to take into account animal mortality and the
culling of draft oxen acquired in the first years. For examplet

2 - Increase in yields due to soil preparation by non-manual means (plowing)
- The increase in yields due to non-manual plowing is estimated by research
CINVEA) to be 10-15 percent.  Conservatively, and taking into account the
fact that the farmers have not fully mastered the techniques of non-manual
agriculture, we have chosen rates of 5 percent for cotton and 10 percent for
cereals  in the case of cereals, the surface area plowed was divided between
maize and sorghum. The study/monitoring of famin4g revealed that rtarly the
total surface area in maize (96 percent) of those farmers so equipped is
plowed by non-manual methods, compared to barely 28 percent for sorghum.
Hence we have included all maize-sown areas and the rest in sorghum. for

Taking into account hybrldizutLon and seed msitures (storage, re-swing), we
have included only first and second generation seeds. Agrlcultural research
among farmors shows an estimted increase ofs
- 20 percent for mllet and sorghum compared wLth the tradltlonal

It is taken for granted that the farmer will keep S percent of the harvest
from the first year for the next year's seeds. The calculations are based
on the followings
- mllet and sorghum * average yLeld for the year increased 202
- maize * average yield for the year Lncreased 30S.

6 - Increase in yield due to insectlcide treatments on cotton
The minimm number of treatments for maximum effectlveness is four.  This
being the case, an lncrease in productlvLty of 30 percent of average yLeld
is obtained.
For the purpose of our calculation, we wvill lclude surface areas whLch have
received four treatments, vith a productlvity coeffLcLent of 15 percent. For
exampleI

COMMENTS FROM CCCE (CAISSE CENTRALE DE COOPERATION ECONOMIQUE)            Page 1 of 2
Division Chief, Agriculture,
Infrastructure and Human Resources
Operations Evaluation Department
Ref.: Your letter of February 14, 1991
Dear Sir:
I read with interest the project completion report on the Boucle
du Mouhoun Agricultural Development Project that you sent me with your above-
referenced letter.1
The Caisse Centrale de Coop6ration Economique, for its part, had
evaluated the agricultural development projects for the West Volta ORDs during
a mission conducted at the beginning of 1990. The relevant report was sent to
you on October 9, 1990 (BE 544).
You will not fail to observe that our conclusions differ at times
quite considerably from those in your project completion report.
The quantitative amendments that I would suggest be made include
toning down of the project's impact on agricultural production. The increase
in production appears to be due mainly to the considerable demographic
pressure and migratory movements. Moreover, for cotton, the intervention of
SOFITEX in supplying producers with inputs and purchising their output was
decisive.
Furthermore, the project's qualitative objectives, which were to
develop replicable production systems and to persuade producers to organize
themselves into groups, were not achieved.
The chief lesson to be learned from this project is, as we see it,
that the setting up of heavy intervention mechanisms with a view to increasing
agricultural production through the introduction of new techniques, is
probably not the most effective approach in view of the complexity of the
situations. A different approach, based more on the rural populations as
responsible partners working in association with the project in the devising
1/    This letter did not reach CCCE until February 25, which made it
impossible for us to reply by the date you would have liked.

of new aolutions, appears desirable for instituting a development process that
will be replicable over the lonI term. However, this would presume review of
the methods used in rural areas and of the human resources that would have
to be mobilized.
Sincerely,
Isl ... Deveze
/    The project did not promote a method that took into account the needs of
the farms (agricultural and management advisory services), development
of the groups (support services for them) and the requirements of
management of the village lands.
