Description:     The Second Poverty Reduction Support Credit and Grant (PRSC-2) will
                 support the implementation of Tanzania's Poverty Reduction Strategy
                 (PRS). The financial support providedthrough the PRSC-2 will narrow
                 the gap betweenthe cost of implementingkey elements of the PRS and
                 resources available from government's own domestic revenue and other
                 donor support.      A policy dialogue and performance assessment
                 framework under the PRSC-2focuses on the following cross-cutting and
                 institutional actions which will facilitate progress towards the PRS
                 objectives:
                 (i)Sustainand accelerateeconomic growthand broadenitsimpact:
                 Reducing income poverty is one of the key focus areas of the PRS.
                 Privatesector and rural developmentare the two areas where reforms are
                 expected to have the biggest impact on reducing income poverty in
                 Tanzania. Reforms inthe areas of agriculturaland rural development are
                 intended to improve producer incentives and raise agricultural
                 profitability and thus enhance incomes in rural areas, where poverty is
                 most widespread and most deeply entrenched.           Measures include
                 improving export crop quality, reducing marketing cost and the tax
                 burden on farmers and improving access to markets and finance. With
                 respect to private sector development, the focus will be on strengthening
                 of the business environment, in particular for SMEs, and legal and
                 administrative reforms to enhance the functioning of land, credit, and
                 labor markets.
                 (ii)Supportresultsorientationofpublicservicedelivery:Thesecond
                 area of impact is through monitoring and leveraging progress in the
                 implementation of sectoral programs to reduce poverty, covering the
                 priority sectors identified in the PRS, Le., primary education, basic
                 health, water, rural roads, agricultural research and extension, the
                 judiciary, and HIV/AIDS. The PRSC-2 policy dialogue focuses on the
                 establishment of a robust monitoring and evaluation system that allows
                 an assessment of the impact and results o f sectoral programs. The
                 information derivedfrom the monitoring and evaluationsystem will then
                 feed into the assessment of progress towards the PRS objectives, on
                 which future PRSC support will be contingent. Finally, the resources
                 provided through the PRSC-2 complement government and other donor
                 resources infinancing priority programs for poverty reduction. The well
                 developed participatory Public Expenditure Review and Medium Term
                 ExpenditureFramework(PER-MTEF) process provides a mechanismfor
                 the monitoring ofthe use ofresources.

                  (iii)Enhancepublicsectorperformance: Measures inthis areawill
                  have a direct impact on poverty reduction as they enhance public sector
                  capacity to implement poverty reduction programs in the priority sectors
                 and generate additional funds for poverty reductionby reducing leakages
                  in the form of low allocative or operational efficiency of public
                 expenditures. Key areas of reform include strengthening of financial
                 management through the implementation o f the public financial
                 management reform program, strengthening o f the national audit office,
                  implementation of pay reform coupled with improved performance
                 management in the public             sector,  procurement     reform,  the
                  implementation of anti-corruption strategies, and enhanced efficiency in
                 the use of development assistance.
                  (iv) Strengthenenvironmentalmanagement: Finally, the PRSC-2 also
                  supports   government's      efforts  to   enhance   the environmental
                 sustainability of Tanzania's development program. The PRS identifies
                 this as an important element of efforts to improve the quality of life and
                 social well-being.

Benefits:        The proposed PRSC-2 will help the United Republic of Tanzania to
                  implement the PRS and reach the goals set out in the strategy. The
                 reforms supported by the operation will help to raise growth, make
                 progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals and
                  strengthen the institutional infrastructure needed to improve the public
                  sector's capacity to carry out its role more effectively, as envisioned in
                 the PRS. Improved delivery of public services is essential ifthe United
                 Republic of Tanzania is to reach its goals for poverty reduction and
                  improve the quality of life inTanzania.

Risks:            There are several risks associatedwith PRSC-2: (i) o f the reforms
                                                                       many
                 supported by the credit and grant mightencounter resistance from vested
                  interests, but government has in the past shown determination to
                 overcome such special interests; (ii)government tries to build broad
                  consensus for reforms through consultative processes which sometimes
                 tends to slow down the pace o f reforms, however, the benefits of this
                  approach clearly outweigh the risk; (iii) utilization of PRSC-2 funds
                                                            the
                  is determined by the budget process and there is a risk that resource
                  allocation and use is not fully consistent with the PRS, however,
                  government has adopted an open and participative budget process
                  including an annual PER process which helps to align and monitor
                 resource allocation and its consistency with the PRS; (iv) the CFAA and
                 the CPAR identified significant fiduciary risk, which the proposed
                  reform agenda is meant to address; and (v) capacity for program
                  implementation and service delivery at both the central and district level
                  is weak, however, in key areas programs are in place to strengthen
                  capacity.

Estimated
Disbursements:    SDR 102.6 million (US$l50 million equivalent) will be disbursed upon
                 PRSC-2 effectiveness.

                              I. INTRODUCTION

1.      This program document presents a single-tranche Second Poverty Reduction Support
Credit and Grant (PRSC-2) to the United Republic of Tanzania in the amount of SDR 102.6
million (US$150 million equivalent).        The proposed operation selectively supports the
implementationof key priority areas of Tanzania's poverty reductionstrategy (PRS), as set out in
the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) prepared in 2000 and its subsequent updates in
three annual PRS progress reports. PRSC-2 is the second of a series of three annual PRSC
operations.

2.      The implementation of the program supported by PRSC-1 has been satisfactory. All
triggers for PRSC-2 have been satisfied with the exception of the preparation of a prioritized
strategic plan and a corresponding program to strengthen the administrative capacity for
implementationof the LandAct and Village Land Act. The outstandingtrigger is expected to be
completed by the end of 2004. Overall, the satisfactory progress made since the approval of
PRSC-1fully warrants a moveto PRSC-2. Subjectto satisfactoryprogress inthe implementation
of the PRS, it is envisagedthat in2005 there will be athird singletranchePRSC.

3.      PRSC-2 will focus on the following cross cutting and institutional issues: (a) reducing
income poverty through private sector and rural development; (b) improving poverty monitoring
and evaluation through continuous development of the PRS process and implementation of the
poverty monitoring master plan; (c) sustaining macro-economic stability; (d) improving the
effectiveness of the delivery of public services and the overall incentive environment; (e)
minimizing resource leakages and strengthening accountability; and (0 fostering environmental
sustainability. Sector-specificissues will continue to be dealt with inthe context of sector-wide
programs.

   11. TANZANIA'S POVERTYREDUCTIONSTRATEGY

4.      Tanzania launched the participatory PRS process in 1999 with the preparation of an
interim PRS, which was followed by the approvalof afull PRS (PRS I) 2000. Endorsement by
                                                                         in
the Bank and IMF Boards ofthe PRS andthe first progress report enabledTanzaniato reachthe
completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative in December 2001 and thus gain access to
irrevocable debt relief. The second progress report was preparedin2002/03 and submittedto the
Bank's Board together with the PRSC-1. The third progress report was submitted to Board in
June 2004. A new PRS (PRS 11)will be preparedduring 2004, including a comprehensivereview
of experience andPRS achievements to date.

                               A. THECURRENTPRS(PRS I)

5.      PRS Ifocuses onthree main areas of outcomes and actionsfor realizing them. The first is
reduction inthe breadthand depth of income poverty. The outcome targets include reductionof
basic needs poverty and food poverty, with a particular focus on rural areas, where poverty is
most prevalent. The second area is improving the quality of life and social well-being. This
entails improved human capabilities, enhanced longevity and survival, social inclusion and
personalsecurity, improvednutrition, and containmentof extreme vulnerability (mainly through
social safety nets). The third broadarea concerns sustaining an environment that is conduciveto
development,which encompassesmacroeconomicstability and good governance.

6.      The first and third areas entail cross-sectoraland institutional measures, and the second is
primarily dealt with through sector-specific interventions in areas such as health, education, and
water, which are designated as priority sectors. As part of the PRS process, the government has
prepared, realigned, and approved sector development programs for health, basic education,
agriculture, and water. These now provide the framework for supporting the implementationof
the PRStargetsthat are specific to these sectors.

      B. PRS1REVIEWDURING2004 AND PREPARATIONOFA NEWPRS (PRS 11)

7.      During 2004, the government will prepare PRS I1and a first draft is expectedto become
available by the end of September 2004, which will be finalized by the end of 2004. The
preparationprocess will include a comprehensivereview of the adequacy and impact of the PRS
I,underpinnedbynewanalyticworkandconsultationswithawidearrayofstakeholdersin
Tanzania. Government intends to undertake future comprehensive revisions every fourth year to
have arevisedPRS ready for the fifth year when anew PRS cycle would commence.

8.      During the planning process for the comprehensive PRS review, it was agreed that the
three overarching pillars of the PRS I1should remain those of PRS I.However, the review is
expectedto yield a sharpened focus on growth, and re-examine the macro-meso-micro linkages
between economic growth and poverty reduction. Another objective of the review is to improve
the integrationofcross-cuttingissues such as HIV/AIDS,environment, gender, andage (young&
old) into the PRS I1and ensure that sufficient attention is given to governance, security, and
peaceas fundamentals to the enabling environment for povertyreduction.

9.      Furthermore, the PRS updatewill also review the definition and scope of priority sectors
and areas within the PRS to ensure that the PRS I1provides appropriate guidance for budgetary
allocations. It would seek to strengthen the poverty monitoring system (PMS) institutional
framework, including revision of PRS indicators and targets especially for environment,



                                               2

governance and agriculture.        It would also provide the opportunity to further integrate the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) into the PRS. Other areas o f focus within the PRS
update will aim at strengthening the awareness and ownership o f the PRS across all levels
(especially sub-national) and sectors o f government.         The exercise will also be designed to
increase the participationo fthe public and grassroots organizations inthe PRS.

                           C. INTEGRATIONOFMDGSINTOTHE PRS

10.      The MDGtargets are a subset o fthe PRS objectives, however, the PRS and MDGtargets
have yet to be fully harmonized with respect to quantitative targets and time horizons. While the
MDGtargets are definedover the periodupto 2015, PRStargets are upto the year 2010.

11.      As indicated inTable 1,the PRS targets for income poverty reduction and access to safe
water are clearly more ambitious than the MDGtargets. On the other hand, with respect to the
reduction in maternal mortality the PRS target is significantly lower than the MDGtarget. Other
targets lie broadly on the same trajectory for both MDGs and PRS.                    Efforts are currently
underway to fully integrate the MDGtargets into the PRS and the results o f which are expected to

                 PROGRESSINPOVERTY REDUCTION

                           A. MACRO-ECONOMIC          DEVELOPMENTS

12.      Since the mid-l990s, Tanzania has made substantial progress in macroeconomic
stabilization and structural reforms of the economy. At the beginning of the reform process,
economic growth was slow to pick up, but over the last five years or so it has averagedmore than
five percent and reached 6.3 percent in 2002. Tanzania's economy has also become more
resilient to economic shocks and real growth in 2003 is estimated at 5.6 percent despite the
impact of the drought on agriculture. Inflation remained below five percent in 2003, but
increased slightly to 6.4 percent by May 2004, on account of increases in food prices and the
price of oil.

13.     Fiscal consolidation has been central to the success in macroeconomic stabilization.
Improved budget formulation and management together with strict adherence to cash budgeting
have allowed Tanzaniato refrain from domestic and non-concessionalborrowing. This has ledto
lower interest rates and stimulated private sector growth. At the same time, in support of
Tanzania's reform program, donors have provided sizable financial assistance which allowed a
rapid expansionofexpendituresinthe priority sectors.

14.      Domestic revenue has increased from 12.1 percent of GDP in FY03 to 12.9 percent in
FY04. The budget for FY05 projects a further increase in revenue to 14 percent of GDP. The
improved revenue performanceis attributable to improvedtax administration, measuresto curtail
smuggling of petroleumimports, removalof tax exemptions, and the impact of strongcollections
of income tax. Public expenditure increased from 19.8 percent of GDP in FY03 to 22.5 percent
of GDP in FY04. In February 2004, Parliament passed a supplementary budget which covers
additional drought related expendituresinthe power sector and for restockingthe strategic grain
reserve, but also for the purchase of a new government aircraft. The additional expenditure of
about TSH 187 billion is to be financedthrough a combinationof higher than budgetedprogram
support inflows, lower than budgeted debt service payments, as well as additional domestic
borrowing from the Bank of Tanzania. The budget for FY05 foresees a further increase inpublic
expenditure, made possible by improved revenue performance (including the impact of the new
Income Tax Act which was passed by Parliament in April 2004) and increased inflows of
development assistance.

15.      The discussionof the macroeconomic framework inthe last PRS Progress Report points
out that the continued low revenue yield is a major challenge for Tanzania. The projected
medium-term revenue targets are achievable, with implementation of a comprehensive strategy
for reform of tax administration and policy. In this respect, the report notes appropriately the
importance of eliminating exemptions, as well as of a review of tax laws. In addition, the
organization of the national tax administration, the strengthening of the Large Taxpayer
Department, and the integration of VAT and income tax departments will be of particular
importance.

16.      The Bank of Tanzania (BOT)maintaineda tight monetary policy with a view to meeting
the establishedreserve moneytargets. Increasedcompetition andefficiency inthe sector have led
to a decline inthe interest rate spreadfrom 15.5 percent in2001to 11.4 percent in2003. In2003,
credit to the private sector increased by 43 percent, fueled in part by increased competition inthe

banking system, and the reduction in interest rate spreads. The rapid increase in credit to the
private sector continued in2004 with antwelve months increaseof 42 percent inMarch 2004.

17.         Tanzania's overall balance o f payments position improved in 2002 because of larger
inflows of donor assistance and the impact of debt relief under the HIPC Initiative. The current
account deficit, excluding official transfers, also declined to 7.5 percent o f GDP as a result of
increasing exports and stagnant imports. In2003, the current account deficit (excluding official
transfers) increasedto 11percent o f GDP, on account of large increases in imports o f petroleum,
capital and intermediate goods, and food. Exports increased by about 11 percent on account of
increased exports o f gold. International reserves substantially exceeded projections, as scheduled
debt-service payments to Japan and Brazil were not made and the BOTsold less foreign exchange
than anticipated. The exchange rate against the US.dollar depreciatedto T Sh 1110per dollar by

end-January 2004, and since has remainedstable. Inreal effective terms, it depreciatedby about 2
percent, which combinedwith a modest recovery of the terms oftrade, improvedthe environment
for exports. The exchange rate is now close to what the IMFhas estimated as an equilibrium real
exchange rate.

18.      The government has made further progress in implementing reforms in the public
enterprise sector. At end2002, a concessionfor the Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority
(DAWASA) was grantedto a British-Germanconsortium. Meanwhile, the financial position and
managerialcapacity of the TanzaniaElectricity Supply Company (TANESCO) have continuedto
improve following the introduction of a new management team in mid-2002. High level
consultations held in March 2004 resulted in broad agreement on a strategy to restore financial
sustainability of TANESCO and to reform the power sector. The sale of 49 percent of Air
Tanzania to South African Airways was completed in November 2002. In December 2003,
government offered 49 percent of the shares of the National Microfinance Bank (NMB) for sale
to a strategic investor. This will be followed by the sale of a further 21 percent of shares to
domestic investors.

                      B. GROWTH POVERTY REDUCTION
                                      AND                          OUTLOOK

19.      A household budget survey carried out in 2000/01 showed a rather modest decline in
poverty over the preceding decade. Basic needs poverty decreased from 38.6 percent to 35.8
percent and food poverty from 21.6 percentto 18.7 percent between 1991and 2001. The survey
also revealed important differences between urban and rural areas. In Dar es Salaam poverty
declinedquite significantly from 28 to 18 percent. Poverty in rural areas is considerably higher
than in urban areas and declined only marginally from 41 percent in 1991to 39 percent in 2001
(Figure 1, ChartsA and B).

20.      The rather modest decrease in poverty is the result of low average per capita real
economic growth of only 0.6 percent annually during the same period. However, as Figure 1,
Chart C shows, this low average growth rate masks important economic developments during the
decade. During the first half of the 1990s, per-capita incomes actually declined, mainly as a
result of poor economic management. Once Tanzania startedto implement economic reforms in
the mid 1990s, economic growth startedto accelerateandreached 6.2 percent in2002. However,
because of the contraction during the first half of the 1990s, per capita income in 2000 was as
high as it was in 1990. Inassessingprogress it is importantto keep this is mind, because it means
that in2000 the per capitaresource envelope was as big (or as small) as it was in 1990. Only after
the year 2000 didmore resourcesbecome available. Expressedinconstant US$per capitaincome
in 2003 is 13 percent higher than that in 1990. Reforms underlying the economic turn-around
include macro-economic stabilization through prudent monetary and fiscal policy, the
liberalization of prices, interest rates, and the exchangerate during the 1990s, andthe withdrawal
of the state from economic activities throughthe privatization of parastatals.

21.      The simulations of poverty incidence shown in Figure 1, Chart D illustrate how the
specific pattern of economic growth observed during the 1990s is likely to have led to an initial
increase in poverty followed by a decline in poverty. According to these simulations, negative
per capitaincome growth ledto an increase inpoverty from 38.6 percent in 1991to 40 percentin
1994. After 1994, as per capita income growth started to accelerate, income poverty also fell
more rapidly, leadingto an estimateddecline of poverty from 40 percent to 35.8 percent between
1994 and 2001. The simulations also indicatethat during 2002, poverty may have droppedby a
further 1.5 percentage points to 34.3 percent. The simulations show that most of the poverty
decline took place in Dar es Salaam and other urban areas. In rural areas poverty remained
virtually unchanged, though in2001 and 2002 it starteddropping by about 1.5 percentagepoint a

determined by changes inrural areas.

22.      This implies that if Tanzania is able to maintain or increase the growth rates achieved
during the past few years, a significant further decline in poverty can be expected. The only
caveat to this is the fact that in the past, urban areas and in particular Dar es Salaam generated
higher growth rates andsaw more rapidreductioninpoverty than rural areas. Progress inpoverty
reduction will thus also depend on the pattern of growth and require attention to rural and
agricultural development.

23.      Facilitating sustainedand acceleratedgrowth of agriculture, which contributes 45 percent
o f GDP, is a key element of Tanzania's efforts to reduce poverty. Limitedaccess to agricultural
credit, highlevels of agriculturaltaxation, insecurity with respect to property rightsto land and its
use as collateral for credit, as well as limited access to markets as a result of poor transport
infrastructure, have been identifiedas key constraints to agriculture sector growth to be addressed
under the PRSC. Other key constraints such as poor technologies are currently beingaddressed
by project interventions. These measures are expected to allow the agriculture sector to grow on
a sustainedbasis by 5 percent annually.

24.     In addition to agriculture sector growth, achieving the above poverty reduction targets
will also require accelerated growth in the industrial and service sectors, with a particular focus
on strengthening the backward linkages to agricultural production through agro-processing. The
government has withdrawn from most economic activities, and the private sector is now
unequivocally recognized as the main player inthese sectors. As a result of the liberalization of
the economy and sustained macroeconomic stability, the industrial and service sectors have
grown between 5 and 6 percent annually in recent years. However, high cost and limited
availability of infrastructure services, human resource and labor market barriers, and redtape in
the public sector arethe principal constraints to evenhigher growth rates(Table 3). Infrastructure
bottlenecks and human resource constraints are primarily addressed through sectoral
interventions.   The PRSC focuses thus primarily on further improvements in the business
environment and PSD, with particular attention to SMEs. Implementation o f these measures,
which are leveraged by the PRSC, should allow a scaling up of growth in industry to between 8
and 10 percent per year and to between 6 and 8 percent per year inthe service sector. Sustained
strong performance inthe miningand tourism sectors, which have been important contributors to
economic growth in recent years, will add to the overall positive outlook for sustained growth
performance and poverty reduction.

inthe PHDR2003 andthethirdPRSprogressreport.

26.      Education. Government has sustained its commitment to increasing access to and the
quality and equity of the education system. Key measures inthe achievement of these objectives
include the abolition of primary school fees in 2001, significant increases in budgetary funding
for primary education, and the implementation of the Primary Education Development Program
(PEDP).       As a consequence, primary education witnessed a further increase in the gross
enrollment ratio from 100.4 percent in 2002 to 105.3 percent in 2003 and a parallel increase in
net-enrollment from 80.7 percent to 88.5 percent. A key challenge in the education sector is to
sustain and improve the quality of education as enrollments increase. Progress in this area
includes the recruitment of 10,7 19 new grade "A" teachers, construction o f 13,396 classrooms
and 7,732 teacher houses inFY03, increase inpre-service teacher training from 9,728 in2002 to
15,285 in 2003, and subsidies for the purchase of teaching and learning materials through a
capitation grant which amounted to almost US$ 5 per pupil in FY03. Indicators of education
quality and efficiency showed some modest improvements. The primary school drop out rate
stood at 3.8 percent in 2003 as opposed to 5.5 percent in 2000, the pass rate in standard 7
examinations increased from 24.9 percent in2001 to 27.1 percent in2002, and the transition rate
from primary to secondary education has marginally risen from 21 percent in 2001 to 21.7 in
2002.

27.      Enrolment in secondary schools increased by 8 percent in 2003 and the number of
secondary schools increased from 937 in 2001 to 1,024 in 2002.                       A Secondary Education
Development Program has been preparedwhich aims at increasing the proportion of the relevant
age group completing secondary education, especially underserved groups who are now getting
better opportunities to complete primary education through the PEDP, improving learning
outcomes of students, especially at the lower secondary level, and enabling the public
administration to manage secondary education more effectively through the devolution of
authority to lower levels and the strengtheningof managementcapacities.

28.      HIV/AI.S. UNAIDS estimates that at the end o f 1999 about 8.1 percent of all adults
were infected with HIV and data from blood donors suggest an increasing trend in HIV

Tanzania's fight against HIV/AIDS include the establishment of the Tanzania Commission for
AIDS which has a fully staffed secretariat since January 2003, and the appointment of members
o f the commission including representatives from civil society.          A multi-sectoral strategic
framework was launched in May 2003, which addresses some of the previous weaknesses and
provides strategic guidance for the planning of programs, projects, and interventions by various
stakeholders in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Government ministries, departments, and agencies
are developing plans for mainstreaming HIV/AIDS interventions into routine activities and
receive regular budgetary allocations for the implementation o f these activities. The government,
in collaboration with the Clinton Foundation, has formulated a draft Care and Treatment
Programme that aims to provide care and treatment to about 400,000 people living with
HN/AIDS with an estimatedcost of about US$535 million over five years.

29.      Health. In 1999, the GOTembarked on a health sector reform program to focus on
implementing the essential and most cost-effective health interventions given the burden of
disease, and to transform financing, management and delivery roles by emphasizing quality,
empowerment o f local authorities and the beneficiary, and greater use of non-government agents.
A three-phase, long-term (2000-2011) Health Sector Development Program (HSDP) was jointly
developed by the GOTand development partners and is supported through a Sector-Wide
Approach (SWAP).         The first phase of the Program (2000-2003) concentrated on initiating
reforms within the health sector and putting systems in place, in particular those related to
decentralization. Progress has been made in key areas, including (a) better availability of health
services at the district level, (b) rationalization of the health work force, (c) strengthened central
support systems such as the pharmaceuticals and commodity management system, (d)
establishment o f the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) and expansion of the Community
Health Fund(CHF), (e) expansion of district block grants and district planningto all districts, and
(0improvedsectorbudgetingandbudgetexecution. PhaseI1(2003-2008) was recently launched
and aims at improving the provision of quality health services by continuing to support the
reforms, capacity development and improved management of resources, while focusing on
quality.

30.      The availability of up to date quantitative indicators o f healthsector service delivery and
outcomes is limited. However, the forthcoming census analysis and the demographic and health
survey in 2004 will provide updates for most indicators. Fertility rates are on the decline, the
number of outpatient visits has increased, and so has immunization coverage. Nonetheless there
appears to be nothing short of a health crisis. A PRS objective is to ensure that life expectancy
returnsto the level of 1988 of 52 years. This is, at best, a very modest objective considering that
it is 25 years less than life expectancy inthe EU, 20 years less than that inChinaand 10years less
than that in India. Nonetheless, even this objective may be very difficult to obtain.            HIV
prevalence rates are still rising, increasing in its wake the fraction of children that are orphans.
The health crisis is not solely attributable to HIV/AIDS. It goes beyond that as is illustrated by
the facts that child mortality is stagnant (and high), 44 percent of children under five are severely
stunted, and 29 percent o fchildren under five are severely underweightfor their age.

31.      For the health sector, human resources is a significant challenge. Delivering health
services requires sufficient staff, yet the staff per population ratios have dramatically decreased,
while demand for services (especially with HIV/AIDS) has gone up. Staff salaries have not
significantly increased, and the international demand for medical professionals results in both
attrition and low morale, which translates into poor quality o f care. Because decentralization
does not (yet) allow districts to modify compensation packages, less attractive districts are at a
particular disadvantage in recruiting staff.       To complicate the situation further, given the
employment freeze, which was only partially lifted in 1998, the health workforce is
predominately comprised o f older staff. This has implications for both performance and the
anticipated loss of a largeproportionof staff due to retirement.

32.       Investment in infrastructure has been limited over the past decade and resulted in
deteriorating facilities. Capital investmentwill be requiredfor facilities and equipment, together
with budgets andplans for improvedmaintenance.

33.       Water. Governmentcontinuedthe rehabilitationand expansionof urban and rural water
supply schemes, which led to enhanced access to safe and clean water. Achievements in the
water sector include an increase inrural water supply coverage from 50 percent in June 2002 to
53 percent in June 2003. Access to safe and clean water in urban areas was sustained at 73
percent, while sewerage service coverage intwo cities and seven municipalities increased from
10 percentinJune 2002 to 17percent inJune 2003. The divestiture ofDAWASA was completed
and City Water Services Ltd. has taken over DAWASA operations since August lst,      2003 with a
ten year mandate to improve technical efficiency of existing water and sewerage systems and
ensure reliable services to about three million beneficiaries. In March 2003, a new National
Water Policy was launchedand preparationof a Water Sector DevelopmentProgramis underway
to harmonizesector activities by government, donors, NGOs, andthe private sector.

34.       One of the key elements of Tanzania's PRS is increased budgetary funding for the
priority sectors, which are defined as (a) education (notably at the primary school level); (b)
health (primary health care); (c) agriculture (research and extension); (d) roads (in the rural
areas); (e) water; (0 the judiciary; and (g) HIV/AIDS. As Figure 2 shows, per capita public
spendingabout doubled inmost of the priority sectors over the past five years and is budgetedto
increase further in FY05.      However, the figure also indicates that for sectors for which
international spending norms exist, Tanzania's expenditures are still significantly below these
norms. For example, the cost of a minimum health care package has been estimated to be
betweenUS$9 andUS$ 12, while spending inTanzaniawas only US$5.9 inFY04.

35.       The PRS contains estimates of the cost of its implementation, which are annually refined
and updated inthe context of the preparationof the MTEF and the budget. Taking into account
absorptive capacity and resources available from all sources (including IDA and PRSC support),
the budget guidelines indicate an annualfinancing gap of aboutUS$ 285 million inFY04 and of
about US$107 million in FY05, if programs were to be funded as per the sectoral requirements
(Table 6). A recent review of these estimates indicates several weaknesses in arriving at these
figures.  Targets are sometimes not sufficiently operationalized,costing does not cover all inputs
to achieving the targets, and for some sectors there appears to be only a weak relationship
between the PRSMDG targets and the costed strategy. Preliminary results of a study carriedout
by the UNMillenniumproject suggest significantly higher resource requirementsfor reachingthe
MDGs thanthe estimates cited above.

36.      Government's strategy to narrow the financing gap includes enhancements in strategic
resource allocation, increases in expenditure efficiency, an expansion of domestic revenue and
enhanced access to external concessional resources in the form of grants or concessional loans.
Domestic borrowing or commercial external borrowing are not considered as financing sources in
the medium term. Domestic revenue increased to 12.1 percent of GDP in FY03 and to an
estimated 12.9 percent in FY04. The budget for FY05 has an ambitious revenue target of 14.0
percent of GDP and in the medium term the revenue to GDP ratio is targeted to increase to 15
percent. Removal of tax exemptions as well as a revision of the Income Tax Act are key
measures on the tax policy side. The Bank supported Tax Administration Project (TAP) aims at
enhancing tax administration. Concerning access to external concessional resources, government
is keen to enhance aid effectiveness through better aid coordination, better integration of aid into
government systems, and increased use of programmatic and budget support facilities. While
finance is clearly a key constraint to the implementation o f the PRS, there are also a series of
other absorptive constraints that will needto be tackled to ensure the efficient use of resources.
                                   C. ABSORPTIVECAPACITY

37.     Macroeconomic constraints. One of the key concerns about increased aid flows to
Tanzania is their effect on the exchange rate and Tanzania's international competitiveness.
However, recent analysis carried out by the Bank and the IMF indicates that while the real
effective exchange rate has been appreciating during the second half of the 1990s, coinciding
with increasedgold exports and aid inflows, it has in fact depreciated by about 30 percent since
2000. Partial sterilization of aid inflows, an increase in imports, and the fact that the mining
sector operates in relative isolation from the rest of the economy explain the recent depreciation
despite continuing increases in exports of gold and foreign aid. According to the IMF, the real
exchange rate is now broadly inline with its equilibriumvalue.

38.     Debt sustainability. After receiving HIPC debt relief in 2001, Tanzania's NPV debt to
export ratio had declined to about 130. Updates o f the debt sustainability carried out by the IMF
in2002 and 2004 and by the authorities in 2003 show that Tanzania's debt remains sustainable.
The latest update of the debt sustainability analysis carried out by the IMF shows a significantly
strengtheneddebt sustainability situation as compared to the assessment at the time o f the HIPC
completion point. Taking into account bilateral relief beyond the enhanced HIPC initiative, the
original projections of the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio were between 115 and 118 for the period
FY04 to FY12. Preliminary results of the update carried out by the IMF in 2004 estimate this
ratio at 97.0 in FY03 and project it to decline to well below 90 by FY12, mainly on account of
stronger export performance than anticipated at the time of the HIPC completion point. These
updates also suggest that Tanzania can absorb its full IDA allocation without exceeding



                                               13

"sustainable" debt to export ratios, provided that export performance and growth remain strong.
Inaddition, progress insecuringdebt relieffrom non-Paris Club creditors is critical to ensure the
continued sustainability o f Tanzania's debt.

39.     Public expenditure and_financial management. Tanzania has developed a solid track
record of sustained fiscal stability, with the virtual elimination of domestic and non-concessional
borrowing.    It has also undertaken significant reforms in public expenditure and financial
management, including the implementation of an Integrated Financial Management System,
revisions of the Public Finance and Procurement Act, and adoption of a participatory MTEFPER
process. Work on strengtheningprocurement systems is underway.

40.      While public expenditure and financial management at the central government level is
fairly well developed in Tanzania, capacity in local authorities is generally much weaker and
shows much variation across districts.       At present, most government expenditure, including
spending by local authorities funded through central government transfers, is under fairly tight
control of the central government with only limitedscope for leakages at the district level. The
public finance managementreform program as well as the local government reform program are
the principal mechanisms for strengthening financial management systems and capacities at the
local levelto ensure that as decentralization progresses adequate capacities are beingput inplace.

41.      Quality of public administration. Tanzania has been implementing a public sector
program since the early 1 9 9 0 ' ~which has contributed significantly to the rationalization and
                                     ~
strengthening o f the public administration. Nonetheless, various factors still constrain the quality
of public administration, including low pay levels and a generally low level of education in the
population which is reflected in the level of education found among civil servants. Capacity
constraints are generally larger at the district than at the central government level. The Local
Government Reform Program is intended to strengthen the capacity o f local authorities to plan
and execute programs as under the fiscal decentralization program responsibilities are shifted to
them.

42.      Increasing low pay levels in the public sector is seen as one of the pre-conditions for
creating an environment in which other reforms to enhance public sector performance can
become effective. The medium term target is to implement a pay reform which would increase
the wage billfrom currently about 4.2 percent of GDP to about 4.9 percent of GDP.

43.      Governance. Duringthe past few years, Tanzania undertook a wide range of governance
related reforms.    Governance indicators prepared by Kaufmann et. al. show that in most
dimensions of governance (voice and accountability, political stability, government effectiveness,
regulatory quality, and rule of law) Tanzania is now above the 25 percentile rank among
countries.    In addition, on all dimensions except political stability (possibly reflecting
developments in Zanzibar at the time of the survey) Tanzania's rating improved compared to
1996. The main weakness inthe area of governance refers to the control of corruption, where
Tanzania appears to be among the worst performing countries. Government has put in place an
Anti-corruption Strategy which is currently under implementation. Systemic reforms of public
financial management and procurement systems, tax administration, the public sector
management system and incentive structure, and the regulatory framework are important
elements of Tanzania's efforts to reduce corruption.

44.          Policy and institutionalframeworks at the sectoral IeveL As a low income developing
economy, the policy and institutional capacity of Tanzania is modest. While in some of the
priority sectors under the PRS the institutional capacity is reasonable, in others it remains weak.
Sector development programs are an important instrument for putting appropriate policy and
institutional frameworks in place. Sectors that already have operational sector development
programs in place, such as the education and health sectors, are able to use available resources
reasonably effectively, and could absorb additional resources. In other sectors such as roads,
power, or water, major increases in budgetary funding will only be effective as policy,
institutional, andcapacity constraints are addressed.

45.          With the change in the role o f government in many sectors from implementer to
regulator, the capacity of the private sector is a factor. In the water and roads sectors, for
example, there are not enough private contractors with adequate expertise and necessary
equipment who can handle tasks or deliver services ontime. The weakness is again acute inrural
areas. However, experience from other countries indicates that the private sector is quick to
develop adequatecapacities once business opportunities become available.

46.          Human resources. The share of Tanzania's population with post-primary education is
among the lowest inthe world. This i s a legacy of policies that put emphasis on achieving basic
literacy, but paid little attention to post-primary education. However, inrecent years government
has recognized the need to raise educational levels inthe population as a necessary condition for
enhancing economic growth and appropriate programs for primary and secondary education are
beingput inplace which are intendedto enhance access and increasethe quality of education.

47.          As the private sector and its demand for qualified labor expands, the public sector finds it
increasingly difficult to attract and retain qualifiedpersonnel. Public sector pay reform as well as
the "strategic accelerated salary enhancement'' scheme are important elements of government's
strategy to enhance public sector capacity. In addition, since the overall supply o f qualified
human resources in Tanzania is very limited, it is also critical to limit the role of government to


                                                               15

activities for which there is a clear rationale for public sector involvement to avoid crowding out
o f private sector activities.

48.      The large donor community in Tanzania and the large number of donor supported
projects add significantly to the competition for human resources. Donor supported projects also
often create distortions by biasing incentives for civil servantstowards a focus on narrow project
activities rather than on the overall public sector objectives. The move to programmatic donor
support such as the PRSC or sector programs which support government systems instead of
setting up parallel systems is intended to reduce distortions and the demand for a very limited
supply o fspecialized skills.

49.      Finally, HIV/AIDS poses a major challenge to Tanzania's efforts to strengthenits human
resources and has ledto significantly increasedlevels of attrition inthe public sector and imposes
binding constraints on sectors such as health, where it further exacerbates the shortage of
qualified nurses.        Sustained government attention to combating HIVIAIDS and the
implementation of HIV/AIDS programs is thus critical to prevent debilitating erosion of human
resources, both inthe private and public sector, inTanzania.

                V.      WORLD BANK GROUPSTRATEGY

50.      The proposed PRSC-2 for Tanzania is a core operation to support the implementation of
the Tanzanian PRS.It will be the second ina series of three single-tranche PRSCs to support the
implementation of policies and institutional development programs for sustainable growth and
poverty reduction.     These policies and programs are contained in the country's own PRS.
Through coherence and stronger coordination with other externally assisted programs,
particularly the PRBS, the proposed PRSC-2 will help to further integrate Bank support into the
overall strategy under the Tanzania Assistance Strategy (TAS)2for raising the effectiveness of
development assistance andreducingthe transactionscost of aid deliveryto Tanzania.

5 1.     Incoordinationwith other external assistanceprograms, the PRSC-2 supports Tanzania's
effort to scale up growth, broaden the impact of growth on reducingpoverty, and improve access
to and quality o f public services. To these ends, the proposed credit and grant will support
actions to foster rural and private sector development, sustain macro-economic stability,
strengthen public sector performance through public sector and public expenditure reforms,
enhance accountability and minimize resource leakages through reforms of financial
management, procurement, and aid management, and foster the sustainability of poverty
reduction efforts through reforms of the institutional and policy framework for environmental
assessments. Schedule 2 presents the performance assessment matrix for the medium-term
program and for the PRSC-2. The matrix also shows the harmonizationwith the PRS targets.

52.      The design of the PRSC takes into account requirements for coordination and
harmonization with other development partners, particularly the PRBS donors. The motivation
for this effort derives from the clear desire of both GOTand the development partners to ensure
that all operations adopt:

    e    a clear poverty focus guidedby the homegrown PRS,
    e    coherence inpolicy dialogue at cross-cutting levels and insector-wide programs,
    e    enhancedefficiency inpolicy dialogue and performance assessment, and
    e    enhancedflexibility and predictability of resource flows.

53.      To that end, the PRSC-2 has been harmonized with the PRBS with respect to both
substance and process. A common Performance Assessment Framework (PAF)/policy matrix,
includingthe set of prior actions for PRSC-2 and triggers for the PRSC-3, has beendeveloped in
close cooperation among the government, the PRBS donors, andthe World Bank.

     A. CONSISTENCYOFTHE PRSCWITH THE COUNTRY ASSISTANCE                        STRATEGY

54.      The high case scenario of the CAS for fiscal 2001-03 envisaged a Public Expenditure
Reform Credit (now PRSC) to support Tanzania's efforts in combating poverty, spurring rural
development, and promoting protection of the environment as a basis for sustainable
development. It was planned that the PRSC would be the instrument through which the Bank
would systematically addressthe issues o fpoverty reduction across sectors that were identifiedin
the PRS. The triggers for moving to this scenario were specified inthe Tanzania fiscal 2001-03
CAS and all actions under the triggers have been implemented, which paved the way for the
launch of the PRSC program and the preparation and Board approval o fthe PRSC-1.

55.     Preparationof a new CAS has beendelayedto allow full alignment and consistency with
the new PRSP, which is expected to be ready towards the end of 2004. In order to achieve
greater donor harmonization and coherence among donor support and the PRS, it is envisaged
that the Bank together with interested donors will prepare a Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS)
instead of the traditional Bank CAS. It is expectedthat the JAS will be presentedto the Bank's
Board during the first half of 2005. To supportthe implementationof Tanzania's PRS, efforts to
maintain macroeconomic stability are continuing, but the focus is increasingly shifting to sector-
level and cross-cutting public sector management issues. The key challenge is to replicate the
excellent macroeconomic policy and implementationrecordat the sector level to facilitate overall
economic transformationandpoverty eradication.

56.      One of the key themes of the JAS will be the full alignment of Bank instrumentswith the
principles of local ownership and leadershipof development efforts as set out in the PRS and,
more specifically, inthe TAS. Because government policies and the government budget are the
key instruments for implementing the PRS, the Bank will increasingly provide general budget
support, a shift that has already beeninitiated under the current CAS. Over the mediumterm, the
PRSC will become the main instrument for the transfer of financial resources and policy
dialogue. A shift in lending modalities is considered necessary because sector interventions
through investment projects have been characterized by variable local ownership and have not
always been well integrated with other sectoral activities, leading to low sustainability. Also,
development of government systems has received limited support, because most donors have
tended to focus on their own aid delivery mechanisms. The shift to programmatic lending was
precipitated by the government's call for a change in donors' lending modalities, and was
justified on three grounds: (1) the PRS has evolved to be the overarching framework for policy
dialogue and formulation, both within Tanzania and between government and the donor
community, (2) progress on the macroeconomic front has lessened the need for traditional
adjustment lending, and (3) progress in planning and budget management provides confidence
that public resource allocationsare consistentwith PRS priorities.

57.      It is envisaged that the transitionwill be a gradualone. InitialPRSC supportwill coexist
with budget and investment support to well-articulated sector programs and technical assistance
for the strengtheningof government systems and capacities necessary for increased reliance on
program support. This approach, in which the PRSC initially covers primarily cross-cutting
issues and policy dialogue and only gradually embraces sectoral support, provides scope for
learning for both the Bank and the government as well as continued evaluation of the
appropriateness ofthis approach.

58.      Supportto the healthand educationsectors will be folded into the PRSC over the coming
years and current Bank support to these sectors is being designed to facilitate this transition from
sector-specificfinancial support to generalbudget support. Currently, bank support to the health
sector is in the form of an APL, the second phase of which has been approved by the Board on
December 4, 2003. The proposedstrategy is to gradually shift IDA financing for health to the
PRSC through the period of the proposedPhase I1APL. Disbursementswould decrease over the
life of the project (3.5 years) while the PRSC would increase, and MoF allocations for health
would be closely monitored to ensure that the total health sector budget does not decrease as a
result ofthe moveto the PRSC (a fear inmany Ministries of Health inthe Region). Inaddition, a
larger share of the crediugrant will be disbursedthrough the basket to foster improved planning
and budgeting. It has been agreed with the MoH that certain items which were previously
financed off-budget will, as of FY05, be financed through the basket or the government budget.
The health project will also focus particular attention on the institutional issues required to
confidently    shift away from sectoral investment financing, including procurement capacity,
financial management, intrasectoralbudget allocations andbudget execution, and M&E.



                                                18

59.     Bank support to the Primary Education Sector Development Program (PEDP) is currently
in the form of an education sector adjustment credit which provides sectoral budget support of
US$ 50 million per year. It is envisaged that after its closure in FY05, financial support to this
program will be channeled through the PRSC. A sector development program for secondary
education has beenpreparedand its implementation will be supported by an Secondary Education
Sector Adjustment Credit for three years, before switching to support provided through the
PRSC.

60.     The proposed PRSC-2 is a blend of a credit and an IDA grant. The fiscal 2001-03
Tanzania CAS provided for HIPC debt relief to enable the country to increase spending for
poverty-focused programs. The government intendsto use the IDA grant component to protect or
increase allocation of resources to sectors with the largest impact on poverty and human
development. Within each sector, poverty priorities are being specified in the context of the
Tanzania PRS and its annual updates. Domestic support for reforms is particularly important at
this stage to cushion against a potential backlash from privatization of the large utilities and
infrastructure and ensure continuance o f the focus on supporting poverty reduction beyond the
tenure of the current reformist president. IDA grants will therefore enable and sustain a virtuous
cycle of reforms.

                                B. ANALYTICUNDERPINNINGS

61.     Poverty analysis:     An elaborate poverty monitoring system (PMS) is in place in
Tanzania. Four technical working groups (TWGs) underpin the PMS structure, viz., the (i)
Surveys and Censuses; (ii)Routine Data Systems; (iii)Research and Analysis; and (iv)
Dissemination, Sensitization and Advocacy.         The establishment of the PMS has resulted in
significantly improved availability of data and analytics which provide feedback on the overall
progress in the government's poverty reduction agenda and inform the policy and financing
decisions of the authorities. The PMS is also underpinningthe results focus of the PRSC by
providing information as to whether PRSC supported reforms and PRSC financing yield the
expected poverty reductionoutcomes.

62.      The second annual Poverty and Human Development Report was launched in October
2003 and provides an overview o f the status of poverty in Tanzania, as well as more detailed
analysis on topics such as vulnerability and social protection, benefit incidence, the relationship
between governance and poverty reduction and vulnerability containment, and agriculture.
Results of a comprehensive household budget survey carried out in 2001 were publishedin 2002,
and a participatory poverty assessmentwas completed and a report publishedin2003. Inview of
the poverty work being carried out by the research and analysis group, the Bank has refrained
from carrying out a separate poverty assessment and has focused primarily on supporting local
efforts.

63.     Poverty and social impact assessments (PSIAs): Specific to the PRSC reform agenda in
the area ofrural development, the Bank is carrying out a PSIA ofthe reform of crop boards. The
objective of the work is to examine options for reform of the coffee, cotton, cashews, and tea
boards with close attention to the impact of reform options. Aside from this PSIA supported by
the Bank, Tanzania can draw upon significant work by local researchinstitutes as well as studies
carried out inthe context of donor supported projects or international researchefforts that analyze
the social andpoverty impactofa large variety ofpolicy and institutionalreforms.

64.      Country Economic Work: In 2000, government and the Bank prepared a CEM which
focused primarily on economic growth, with particular attention to the agricultural sector and
contained a detailed analysis o f poverty and its linkages to economic growth inTanzania. During
FY04, the Bank started work on a new CEM, which focuses on the linkages between growth and


                                               19

poverty and vulnerability. The analytic findings of the CEM will feed into the preparationof a
new PRSP for Tanzania.

65.      Related to the focus of the PRSC on private sector and rural development, the Bank is
supporting several pieces of analytic work that complement the analysis done by government,
donors, and research institutes. This includes an investment climate survey carried out by the
regional program on enterprise development (WED), a rural investment climate survey and a
supply chainanalysis for selected agriculturalproducts.

66.      Fiduciary work: Inthe contextof Tanzania's government led, participatory PERprocess,
a wide variety of analyticalactivities are carriedout everyyear. This includesthe annualexternal
evaluation of budget performance and management led by the Bank (the most recent one was
published in October 2003); sector PERs carried out for the priority sectors, and more recently,
also for selected non-priority sectors; and thematic PER studies on issues such as environment,
governance, or gender. A CFAA was prepared in 2001 jointly with DfID and a CPAR was
completed in 2003. Technical assistance for the implementationof the recommendationsof the
PER, CFAA, and CPAR will be provided through a Public Finance Management Reform
Program, while policy dialoguetakes place inthe context or the PER and PRBSPRSC program.
It is foreseen that updates of the CFAA will be combined with the PER external evaluation in
FY05.

                         C. ALIGNMENT OFPRS, CAS,AND PRSC

67.      The Bank's assistance to Tanzania is geared towards supporting the implementation of
the PRS. On the substantive side, this implies that Bank assistance is consistent with priorities
identified in the PRS. Inaddition, Bank processes need to be properly sequenced with the PRS.
As showninFigure4, the first PRS(PRS I) the period from FYOl-FY04 and government
                                             covered
intends to undertake a comprehensivereview and update of the PRS every four years. In the
interveningyears, government is committedto preparingannualPRS progressreports. The third
progress report was presented to the Board on June 2, 2004, and a comprehensive review and
update of the PRS are being carried out during 2004 with, as mentioned earlier, the objective of
publishing a new PRS (PRS 11) inSeptember2004.

68.      The Bank's current CAS covers the period FYO1-FY03. It was originally planned to
prepare a new CAS during 2003. However, to ensure complete alignment with the PRSP it was
decided to delay the preparation of the CAS. A Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS) covering the
planned assistance by the Bank and other participating donors will be prepared in 2004105,
synchronized with and drawing on the preparationprocess of the new PRS. The time period
coveredby the JAS will also be alignedwiththat ofthe PRS.

69.      The current PRSC programcovers the periodFY03 - FY05. Since the new PRSP andthe
JAS are only expectedto become available in late 2004 or early 2005, it is appropriate that the
current PRSC Program covers FY05 to ensure continuity in financing. The new PRBSPRSC
program will be launched in FY06, and it is expected that policy actions to be monitoredunder
the new PRBSPRSCwill be asub-setofthe actionsidentifiedinthe new PRSactionplan.

70.      One ofthe objectives of providing supportthroughthe PRSC instrument is to enhancethe
predictability of program support to Tanzaniaand its full integrationinto the budget process. To
this end, the PRSCFRBS review process is fully aligned with Tanzania's budget process.
Tanzania's fiscal year runs from July to June. The assessment as to whether prior actions have
been met takes place inthe context of the PRBSPRSC mid-year review in April. At that time,
government would get a firm indication of how much program support will be available for the
coming fiscal year and this can thus be factored into the budgetary decision process. Enhanced


                                                20

       predictability andmakingthe Bank's programsupport available at the beginningof the fiscal year
       also provides the basis for improved budget execution as it allows for better cash flow planning
       andthus more predictableexpenditurereleasesto the spendingunits.

       71.     The last area of alignment concerns analytic work.                      The Poverty and Human
       Development Report as well as the PERwork are carriedout on an annual basis, closely linkedto
       the government's PRS and budget/MTEF process. It is envisaged that CFAA updates and
       monitoring will be integrated into the PER process. The CEM's role is to provide analysis on
       growth and poverty related issues as inputs to the comprehensive PRS update. A CEM is

       72.     Government, the donor community, and other stakeholders are currently engaged in fine
       tuning the alignment of a variety of processes, including the PRS, the PER/MTEF, sector
       development programs, the PRBSPRSC, and the PRGF with the budget process. The objective
       is to enhance the effectivenessof these processes while reducingtransactioncosts.

                                  D. COORDINATIONWITHOTHER DONORS

       73.     Tanzania receives development assistance from a large number of bilateral and
       multilateraldonors andNGOs. For the past five years, enhancingthe effectivenessandefficiency
       of foreign aid and the establishment of a conducive relationship between government, domestic
       stakeholders, and donors has been an importantelement of Tanzania's developmentagenda. The
       Tanzania Assistance Strategy lays out principles governing the government-donor relationship.
       Key elements for rationalizing donor assistance include the move towards sector development
       programs (already inplace for education, health, and agriculture and under preparationfor water
       and roads) and general budget support. These aid modalities are seen as appropriatemechanisms
       for increased donor coordination, better integration of donor assistance into government systems
       and processes, enhanced ownership, and reduced transaction costs. The local Development

Partners Group, facilitatedby the UNDP and a bilateraldonor, is the principal mechanism for
ensuringoverallcoordinationamongdonors insupportof governmentprograms.

74.      With respect to the proposed PRSC-2 operation, the key areas of coordinationare (a)
other donors providingbudget support, (b) sector development programs supportedby the Bank
andother donors, and(c) the IMF.

75.      The PRBS donor group. The government has reached agreement with 11 donors3,
accounting for more than 60 percent of official development assistanceto Tanzania, to establish
the PRBS facility to support the implementation of the PRS. Using this facility, donors have
agreedto seek improvedflexibility, reporting, andpredictabilityof flows throughthe budget. To
ensure impact, the government and donors have agreed on an annually reviewedand updated
Performance Assessment Framework with a three year horizon for monitoring progress in
implementingagreed reforms under the PRBS. These reforms target improvedeffectiveness of
public services, a better incentive environment, minimizedresource leakage, and strengthened
accountability. To unify policy dialogue and minimizecosts associatedwith multipledialogues,
the PRBS donorsandthe governmenthave decidedto use existingprocessesfor policydialogue.

76.      Duringthe preparationof PRSC-1, it was agreedthat the Bank's PRSC programandthe
PRBS PAF should be harmonized and integrated. To this end, a draft Partnership Framework
Memorandumhas beenagreeduponamongthe development partnersandwith the government as
a basis for harmonizing the PRBS and PRSC instruments. It lays out the principles for
coordinationoffinancingto ensure predictable andsmoothflows, andpaysparticularattention to
anchoring support, dialogue, and monitoring in the implementation of the PRS, minimizing
transactions costs, andensuringconsistency ofpolicy dialogue.

77.      A three-year PAF has beenagreedupon betweengovernment, the PRBS donors, andthe
Bank as the framework for monitoring progress and decisions on budget support. The PAF
serves as framework for this operation andis reviewedanddevelopedjointly by the PRBSgroup,
the Bank, andgovernment. As is the case for other participatingdonors, within the framework of
the PAF, the Bank retains flexibility to determine specific benchmarks and form an independent
judgment as to whether significantprogresshas beenmade. The individualfinancingagreements
under the PRBS provide for different judgments of performance assessment and any other
additional considerations. However, all involvedparties encourage minimizingsuch differences
which, if left unchecked, would undermine efficiency objectives and predictability of resource
flows. The only substantivearea where the Bank's policymatrix deviates from the PRBS PAF is
environment, where support and dialogue of PRBS donorstakes placeoutside the budget support
mechanism.

78.      The M E After successfully implementing reforms supported by the last PRGF
arrangement, a new three year PRGF arrangementwas approvedby the IMF BoardinJuly 2003.
Reflecting Tanzania's improved external position and to highlight the authorities' progress
toward an exit from the PRGF, access under the new arrangement is only 10 percent of quota.
The new PRGF-supported program focuses on a three-pronged strategy aimed at mobilizing
revenue, in order to strengthen domestic savings and reduce aid dependency; continuingtrade
liberalizationin order to enhance efficiency and strengthen the tradables sector; and improving
the economy's supply response by removing impediments to growth, including measures to
improve the eficiency ofthe financial sector andpromoteprivatesector development.

79.     The reform program supported by the PRSC and the new PRGF arrangement are
complementary and mutually reinforcing. The PRSC i s closely coordinated with the PRGF
according to the agreed institutional division of labor, with the IMF taking the lead on macro-
economic sector issues and the Bank taking the lead on structural and social issues. Ina number
o f areas where the mandate of the two institutions overlap, there is close coordination and
collaboration to ensure that consistent advice is provided to the authorities. Maintained macro-
economic stability is part of the performance assessment framework and the IMF Article IV and
PRGF reviews are an important input into the assessment o f the macro-economic situation by the
Bank. With respect to the timing of operations, the PRGF and PRSC are aligned with the PRS
reviewprocess, includingthe work onthejoint staff assessment.

80.     Sector development and thematic programs.           Another area o f close coordination
between the PRSC and other donors is inthe area of sector development and thematic programs.
At present, the PRSCPRBS is the principle instrument for resource transfer in the form of
general budget support and for policy dialogue on cross sectoral issues, including private sector
and rural development.     Sector development programs, which are in place for primary and
secondary education, health, and agriculture and under development for roads and water serve as
instruments for sector specific policy dialogue and tied resource transfer.     The role of the
PRBSPRSC vis a vis these sector programs is to (a) ensure alignment of sector development
programs with the PRS; (b) monitor outcomes and focus on adequate monitoring and evaluation
systems; (c) foster cross-sectoral resource allocation and prioritization through the budget
process; (d) strengthen service delivery through public service reform; (e) reduce resource
leakagesthrough strengtheningfinancial management and accountability systems, and (0provide
resources for the implementation of sector programs through general budget support. It is
envisaged that resource transfers will increasingly take place through the PRBSPRSC
instrument, while policy dialogue will take place in the context of the sector development
programs.

81.     In addition to sector development programs, there are also several "thematic" donor
supported programs that are closely linkedto the PRBSPRSC. These include the Public Sector
Reform Program, the LocalGovernment Reform Program, the Legal Sector ReformProgram, the
Public Finance Management Reform Program, the Public Expenditure Review process, and the
tax administration programs, which are supported by various donors through harmonized basket
funding arrangements. These thematic programs relate directly to areas of policy dialogue and
monitoring under the PAF. Here the role of the PRBSPRSC is primarily that of leveraging
reform and monitoring progress, while the thematic programs provide the necessary technical
assistance for the implementation of reforms.

       VI. THE PRSCSUPPORTEDREFORMPROGRAM
                                           A. OVERVIEW

82.      The focus ofthe PRSC is on cross cutting issues falling under the first and third pillar of
the PRS, i.e., "reducing income poverty" and "achieving and sustaining a conducive environment
for sustainable development". Specific areas covered by these two pillars and supported by the
PRSC include sustaining macroeconomic stability, rural development and export growth, private
sector development, and governance.

83.      Support to the second pillar of the PRS of "enhancing human capabilities, survival, and
well being," is provided by the Bank and other donors in the context of sector development
programs and specific projects and thus not directly part of the policy dialogue under the PRSC.
However, the PRSC monitors resource allocationto and outcomes inthese areas which form part
o f the overall assessment as to whether PRSC resources contribute to the achievement of poverty
reduction results.    The only area under the second PRS pillar covered under the PRSC is
"environment" reflecting the cross-sectoralnature of environmental issues.

84.      Inaddition, as the PRSC provides fundingfor the implementation of Tanzania's PRS, it
pays particular attention to poverty monitoring systems which allow an assessment as to whether
poverty reduction objectives (including income and non-income dimensions of poverty) are
indeedachieved. Figure 5 shows the three PRS pillars and the PRS priority areas ineachpillar. It
also illustrates areas which form part of the PRSC performance assessment framework and policy
dialogue and those areas where the role of the PRSC is limitedto monitor resource allocation and
outcomes.

85.      Sustaining macro-economic stability. The PRS recognizes sustained macro-economic
stability as crucial for accelerating economic growth and providing a conducive environment for
the implementationofthe PRSinTanzania. The PRSC acknowledges the institutionaldivision of
labor between the Bank and the Fund and implementation o f the PRGF supported program is an
important indicator inthis area for overall macro-stability. Specific issues targeted and monitored
under the PRSC include (a) broadening o f the tax base and enhanced efficiency in tax



                                               24

administration, (b) a simplified and efficient local revenue structure, and (c) improved debt
management.

86.      Rural development and export growth. The focus on rural development in the PRS
derives directly from the poverty profile o f Tanzania, with poverty being still very much
concentrated in rural areas, and with the urban rural gap widening during the past decade.
Reforms in agricultural and rural development are intended to improve producer incentives and
raise agricultural profitability and thus enhance incomes in rural areas, where poverty is most
widespread and most deeply entrenched.

87.      Private sector development.       Reforms related to private sector development and
strengthening o f the business environment, as well as legal and administrative reforms to enhance
the functioning o f land, credit, and labor markets, are intended to foster economic growth and
enhance employment opportunities. Access to formal and informal sector employment has been
identified as one o fthe key areas for sustainable poverty reduction inthe PRS.

88.      Environment. The PRSC also supports government's efforts to enhance environmental
sustainability o f Tanzania's development program. The PRS identifies this as an important
element o f efforts to improve the quality o f life and social well-being.

89.      Governance. The two governance areas targeted by the PRSC are (a) improving the
effectiveness o f public services and (b) minimizing resource leakage and strengthening
accountability.   Actions in this area will have a direct impact on poverty reduction as they
enhance public sector capacity to implement poverty reduction programs in the priority sectors
and generate additional funds for poverty reduction by reducing leakages in the form o f low
allocative or operational efficiency o f public expenditures.          Key areas o f reform include
strengthening o f financial management through the implementation o f the public financial
management reform program, strengthening o f the national audit office, pay reform coupled with
improved performance management inthe public sector, procurement reform, the implementation
o f anti-corruption strategies and action plans at both central and local government levels, and
enhancing efficiency inthe use o f development assistance.

90.      Monitoring and Evaluation. Appropriate domestic systems that allow the monitoring
and assessment of tangible results in the implementation o f the PRS are the basis for greater
results-orientation o f public policy in Tanzania.       The PRSC program thus focuses on the
monitoring o f poverty indicators and the strengthening o f Tanzania's poverty monitoring system.
The PRSC policy dialogue focuses on the establishment o f a robust monitoring and evaluation
system that allows an assessment o fthe impact and results o f sectoral programs. The information
derivedfrom the monitoring and evaluation system will then feed into the assessment o f progress
towards the PRS objectives, on which future PRSC support will be contingent.                The well
developed participatory PER-MTEF process provides a mechanism for monitoring the use o f
resources.

                                  B. PROGRESS        SINCEPRSC-1

91.      Overall Progress. The assessment o f progress has three core elements. Firstly, progress
inthe implementation of the PRS is assessed inthe third PRS progress report with a focus on
outcomes. To monitor results, government has developed a list o f key indicators which are also
part of the PRSC assessment framework (Schedule 3).            Progress in this area has already been
discussed earlier in this document.        The second area relates to budget formulation and
implementation, which is assessed in the context o f the PER process through the external
evaluation. Finally, Government, PRBS donors, and the Bank reviewedjointly progress in the



                                                  25

implementation of the PRBSDRSC supported reform agenda during the Annual Review in
November 2003 andthe midyear review inApril 2004, which is the focus ofthis section..

92.      The Annual Review assessed progress inall areas and concludedthat overall progress as
of November 2003 was moderately satisfactory. Subsequently, the mid-year review which was
carried outjointly with the other PRBS donors concludedthat progress is satisfactory.

93.      Progress in the areas of private sector development, rural development, macro-economic
stability, improved budget management, public sector performance, and environmental
sustainabilitywas assessed as beingsatisfactory.

94.      Progress in the area of public financial management was assessed as moderately
satisfactory as there have been delays in finalizing the institutional arrangements for
implementingthe Public FinancialManagement Reform Program. Similarly, there was also only
limited progress instrengtheningthe National Audit Office.

95.      Progress in the area of reducing corruption was judged as being moderately
unsatisfactory. The key factors behind this assessment are delays in issuing quarterly reports
depicting progress in the implementation of anti-corruption plans and in the preparation and
funding of anti-corruption action plans by local government authorities. However, there is
improvement in the publication of the quarterly reports with the third and fourth quarter 2003
reportsnow available.

96.      Finally, progress in improving poverty monitoring and evaluation was assessed as not
satisfactory, as at the time of the annual review inNovember 2003 the third PRS progress report
hadnot been finalized. Subsequently, government issued the first draft of the progress report in
early December2003.

97.      An detailed assessment of progress in implementing the PRSC supported reforms is
presented inthe discussion of the individual focus areas of the PRSC. This section discusses in
more detail progress against the PRSC-2triggers.

98.      Review of progress againstPRSC-2 triggers. Overall, government has made satisfactory
progress in implementing actions defined as triggers for PRSC-2. Out of the six triggers, only
one trigger has not yet been met, namely the preparation and issuance of a prioritized strategic
plan anda correspondingprogramto strengthen the administrativecapacity for implementationof
the LandAct andVillage LandAct. The preparationofthe land sector strategicplanwas initially
expected to start in October 2003 and be completedby March 2004, with financial support from
EU-EDF. The start of this activity was delayed as agreement on the work plan, scope of work,
and budget for the preparationof the strategic plan betweenthe Ministry of Lands and EUtook
longer than originally envisaged. The work is now underway. Table 7 summarizes progress
against the triggers.

The Land (Amendments) Act, 2003 Bill was submitted for first reading to the November 2003
Parliamentary Session. (Bill Supplement No: 20 of October 17, 2003 published inthe GovernmentGazette
No. 42 Vol. 84 dated 17" October 2003). Subsequently, the bill was passed and executed by the President
April 14,2004.
Prepared and issued a prioritized strategic plan and a corresponding program to strengthen the
administrativecapacityfor implementationof the Land Act and Village Land Act.
Agreement on the work-plan, scope of work, and budget for the preparationof the strategic plan between
the MinistryofLandsandEUtook longer thanoriginally envisaged. The work is now underway.
Progress in strengthening and sustaining capacity of the VPO secretariat to support and monitor
implementationof the PRS accordingto an updated action plan to be aIlprovedby Government.
An action plan for building capacity in support of the PRS was submitted to the PRS technical committee
and approved in August 2003. A full-time poverty monitoring officer has been recruited inthe PRS/PMS
secretariat and the Poverty Monitoring Advisor has been replaced. Local area network including purchase
o f new computers and internet services have been upgraded. Outsourcing is also used to cover internal
human capacity gaps. In order to ensure the sustainability of capacity building efforts, a VPO medium-
term strategic plan has been developed with technical support from PWC and was finalized in February
2004. The plan is expected to enable VPO to access the SASE scheme, in order to provide the minimum
incentivepackage necessaryfor sustainability ofthe growing capacity.
Progress in strengthening and sustaining capacity of the coordination and monitoring unit in PO-
RALG for collecting, collating, and analyzing administrative data according to an updated action
plan to be approved by government.
Senior programmer recruitedto lead MISunit inPO-RALG; two senior staff permanentlyassignedto RDS
TWG; report by consultanton MIS strategy for PO-RALG completed; Database on LGA Social Economic
Profile was to be completedby end Oct 03; local Area Network installed and domain registeredto facilitate
e-communication with Regional Secretariats and LGAs; purchased 11 additional (on top of 8 previous)
computers for Regional Secretariats for storing and managing data. In addition, The President's Office
Public Service Management approved PO-RALG's Medium Term Strategic Plan 2004-7. The Permanent
SecretaryPO-RALG also endorsedthe MIS Strategy.
Progress in the implementationof the recommendationsof the national debt strategy according to a
    -
work plan (includingactivities, timeframe, and responsibilities)to be approved by government
The PAD debt Section has developed a work plan to guide their operations. Commitment to implement
NDS recommendationsis strong, ind various NDS proposals havebeen, and continue to be, enadted (for
example, prolongation of the debt maturity profile through the introduction of 5-,7- and 10- year Treasury
bonds; amendment ofthe 1974 Loans, Guarantees and Grants Act to grant sole authority to the Minister of
Finance to authorise new loans; preliminary establishment of the National Debt Management Committee;
production of Quarterly Debt Reports; lowering the external debt component of debt stock through
continuednegotiationswith PC and non-PC creditors; etc).
Progress in the implementation of the revised Public Financial Management Reform Program
(PFMRP), includingdevelopment of a monitoringsystem and regular reportson progress.
Progress has been made inthe implementation of most of the components of the PFMRP, but in particular
in areas where there are supporting projects already inplace, such as the further development of the IFMS,
external resource managementand procurement. Further efforts are requiredon other components in order
to address fiduciary concerns related to budget support. Establishing the PFMPR as a coordination
mechanism, which ensures that reforms address fiduciary concerns in a comprehensive manner, and are
well coordinated and sequenced, took more time than expected. The action plan and budget for the first
year, an operations manual, and a Memorandum of Understanding for coordinated donor support to the
programhavebeenpreparedand endorsedbythe PFMRP Joint SteeringCommittee.

99.      The PRSC-2 reform program covers the second year o f a three year program in support
of the implementation of Tanzania's PRS and reforms supported under PRSC-2 build on reforms

                            D. PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT

100.     Issue. For the governmentof Tanzaniato reach its objective of reducing poverty it must
provide a basis for the creation of sustainable income for households, which will also secure
present social expenditures and investments by strengthening the revenue base. The primary
issue for government is to create an environment in which households can participate in viable
productive activities of their choice by responding to labor or product markets opportunities.
Thus as a major priority, governmentmust revamp its operating environmentwhich is rooted ina
state controlled economy and dated to an environment which is better able to support its
productivesectors to succeed ina globalizedeconomy.

101.     Reform Strutegy. The PRSC supports government in building a competitive operating
environment by working on two major pillars (1) establishing effective services of public
institutions interfacing with the private sector and (2) establishing the foundation for efficient
factor input markets in starting with land and labor. Pillar 1: the government has started
reviewing regulations, focusing onremovingobstacles andre-organizingthe most importanttasks
of government. Inpractical terms this means (1) harmonizationof local governmenttaxation to
remove excessive tax burdenon private enterprise; (2) resolution of outstanding issues emanating
from the LandAct; (3) review and amendment of labor laws constrainingbusiness operations; (4)
streamlining of work permit procedures; (5) review and amendment of licensing legislation to


                                              29

reduce the cost o f business establishment and continuation; (6) review and revision o f export-
import procedures to reduce time costs and corruption-related costs; and (7) design and
implementation o f a program for enhancing access to commercial courts by SMEs. Pillar 2:
efficient factor markets are critical for efficient resource allocation and competitiveness o f the
Tanzanian economy. The government has already embarked on two critical areas (a) the labor
laws and (b) the land and village act. Complementing these actions supported by the PRSC, the
government is also focused on enhancing the efficiency in infrastructure services, ports and
harbors and inutilities such as electricity and water.

102.     Progress under PRSC-2.          (Pillar 1) The government has appraised the business
environment strengthening (BEST) programme in collaboration with donors and agreed on the
implementation framework, by establishing a Better RegulationUnit (BRU). Work plans for the
first year have beenproduced and an adequate budgeto fU S D l million provided for. Currently, 3
government staff have been seconded to BRU and they have started to execute some o f the
activities stipulated inthe first year plan. BRUis currently working on Phase I1o f the labour laws
reform, BRELA as well as elements related to land reforms. The recruitment process o f CEO is
ongoing. The recruitment o f the Lead advisor will follow thereafter. The Ministry o f Industry
and Trade has prepared a draft government position paper to guide business licensing reform. In
the budget speech for FY05, important measures to rationalize business licensing were
announced. These include the abolition o f business license fees for health facilities operated by
religious organizations and small businesses. Inaddition, business licenses have to be issued only
at the time o f the establishment o fthe business and no longer annually.

103.     (Pillar 2) The government started the review and reform o fthe labour laws intwo phases.
Phase Icovers employment relations, collective labor relations, dispute resolution and labor
market institutions. A new Labour Act has been submitted to Parliament in November, 2003.
Phase 11, which includes occupational safety and health, workers compensation act, and
employment and skills development has already started and scheduled to be completed under
PRSC 3.

104.     Regarding land, the government has submitted amendments to the Land Act (1999) to
Parliament. Government has put in place a quick procedure for the acquisition o f title deeds and
other related documents. During2002/03, budgetary provisions were made for the surveying o f
20,000 new plots in Dar es Salaam. By June 2003, 76,000 plots had been established out o f
which 46,670 were allocated and owners o f 36,470 surveyed plots were issuedwith title deeds.

105.     Monitorable Actions under PRSC-3.              The Better Regulation Unit will begin
implementing a first year action plan to improve the efficiency services o f key institutions
interfacing with the private sector.      This includes the implementation o f the new business
licensing framework and the design o f a new civil procedure code. To help focus its role, the
government plans to develop a private sector strategy which will be completed under PRSC 3.
Government also intends to revise the land policy and formulate and issue land regulations in line
with the amendment to the Land Act. Furthermore, the Government will be implementing the
second phase o f the reforms o f the labour laws. As these are completed, issues relating to the
efficiency o f other factors i.e. energy will be included inthe programme.

106.     Expected Results of Program The actions implemented under the PRSC program are
expected to leadto four key mediumterm outcomes, namely:

     0   Improved efficiency o f public institutions interfacing with the private sector, these
         include the Business Registration, Customs and Tax administration;

     0   Improved efficiency o f factor inputmarkets starting with land and labor;



                                                  30

    0    Enterprise creation and growth; and

    0    Increased value addition of production and competitiveness of Tanzania based
         production.
107.     Monitoring Indicators. Specific quantitative monitoring indicators underthis component
of the PRSC include4:

    0    Employment law index' (currently 61 on a scale of 0 to 100 with a higher value meaning
         more regulation);

    0    Cost to register a business (currently 199percent of per capita income); and

    0    Time to enforce a contract (currently 127days).

                                      E. RURALDEVELOPMENT

108.     Issues:    The PRS highlights several causes of income poverty, particularly in the
agriculture sector, identified by groups consulted during its preparation. The highest priority
items identified were poor technology, non-availability of farm inputs, poor roads, limitedaccess
to markets, and non-availability of credit. Inaddition, recent researchshows that rural poverty is
associated with lack o f access to land, particularly by women6. Addressing these constraints
requires reforms of crop boards particularly with respect to input supply, product quality, and
competitiveness; micro-finance legislation; the institutional arrangements governing rural roads;
local government taxation; property rights; and overall co-ordination of public interventions in
the agriculture sector.

109.     Policies governing export crops - crop boards: Crop boards play a significant role in
determiningthe regulatory and institutional environment for crop export and investment growth,
and are key determinants in reaching Tanzania's ambitious agricultural growth targets.
Performance among boards has varied significantly, beingset up to address concerns of declining
quality o f exports, uncompetitive private buyer behavior, and a breakdown o f input supply
systems. There are, however, concerns about the inadequate accountability of the boards to
traders and farmers whom they are supposed to serve, disruption o f marketing and exports,
distortion o f inputmarkets, and insome casesthe exclusion ofthe private sector from marketing.

110.     Micro-finance legislation: Access to finance in rural areas is low. The 200011 H B S
shows that only 3.8 percent of rural households with one or more members have a savings
account, 2.8 percent participate inan informal savings group, and 1.3 percent innon-bank formal
savings groups. Only 0.4 percent took a bank loan in 199912000. Access to finance was
highlightedby about one-third o fthe groups involved inthe PRS consultation as a key constraint
in agriculture. While some farmers have access to credit through contract farming arrangements
(e.g. tobacco), or through various input schemes operated by the boards (e.g. the voucher and
passbook programs), more attention is needed on the legal and regulatory framework governing
formall savings institutions - particularly micro-finance.           In addition, raising the overall
profitability of agriculture will raise the demand for these financial services.

111.     Institutional arrangements governing rural roads: Rehabilitation and maintenance of
rural roads are key requirements for reducing agricultural marketing transaction costs, with

improved market access essential for the transformation from subsistence to commercial
agriculture. The district road network continues to be in generally poor condition with ninety
percent of district and feeder roads being impassableto vehicles during the rainy season. Current
institutional arrangements for the maintenanceandrehabilitation of district roads remainweak.

112.     Local government taxation: Prior to the implementationof PRSC supportedreforms in
this area, rural Tanzanians paidan array oftaxes, levies, fees and cesses which inmany cases had
a negative impact on producer incentives and incomes. Direct taxes on agriculturalexport crops
for example amounted to about 20 percent, inclusive of localtaxes and levies. While the revenue
generated from some of the taxes and levies is rather small, they are perceivedto be a significant
constraint to economic activity and create opportunities for abuse and corruption. As local
governments are increasingly called upon to deliver more services and maintain more
infrastructure, it is critical for government to develop a strategy on financing local governments'
responsibilities, including the role of own-sourcerevenues and transfers, that is consistent with a
supportive incentiveframework for economic activity.

113.     Property rights: Lack of access to land is associated with poverty, particularly among
women. With the change in land use and increasing population over time, the demand and
competition for land for cropping and grazing has increased.           Conflicts between different
categories of land users, rapid urbanization leading to establishment of unplanned settlements,
increased demand for surveyed land for industrial and commercial investments and poor land
administrationwere key drivers for the development of the National Land Policy and subsequent
1999 Land Act and Village Land Act. The Acts provide the legal framework for strengthening
property rights. While there has been some progress in the implementation of the Acts,
implementationremains largely uncoordinated,respondingto un-prioritized demands.

114.     ASDP co-ordination: The Agricultural Sector DevelopmentProgram(ASDP) provides a
framework for the implementation of the sector strategy, however, co-ordination of the three
main agriculture ministries (Ministries of Agriculture and Food Security; Co-operatives and
Marketing; and Livestock and Water) remains a challenge for implementation. Efficiency of
resource use and effectiveness of service delivery remain key concerns.            The fixed costs
associated with the creation of multiple structures is high, with concerns about the lack of
coordinationandduplicationof activities.

115.     Reform Strategy: The governmentreform strategy which the PRSC supports includes:

116.     Improving policies governing crop boards: Options for reform of the coffee, cotton,
cashew and tea boards will be examined by reviewing existing institutional arrangements for
these crops and evaluating the effectiveness of the boards' functions in relation to existing or
potential alternative arrangements - particularly in the area of quality control, input supply, and
private sector competition. Based on the findings of the review, relevant amendments to the
respectiveCropBoardActs will be made.

 117.    Improving micro-finance legislation: In an effort to ensure the emergence of more
efficient and sustainable financial intermediaries, a legal and regulatory framework for micro-
finance is to be establishedand enforced.

118.     Strengthen the institutional arrangements governing rural roads: Work is underway to
revisethe Roads Act which will establishappropriate financial and management arrangements for
the road network in Tanzania, including rural roads. As part of the preparation, options to
strengthen the institutional arrangements for district road maintenance and rehabilitation will be
developed. Followingthis work, the revisedRoads Act will be submittedto Parliament.



                                                32

119.     Local government taxation: Government is developing an overall strategy on financing
local governments' responsibilities, including the role of own-source revenues and transfers.
Measures to simplify and rationalizelocal government taxation will be undertakenand the design
of a new intra-governmental transfer system covering both recurrent and development
expenditures is at an advanced stage.

120.     Improving property rights: A prioritized strategic plan for implementation of the Land
Act andVillage Land Act will be developed. This will providepriority focus to areas which are
likely to have the highestreturnwhile fitting into the overall budgetresource envelope.

121.     ASDP eo-ordination: Co-ordination arrangements for the implementationof the ASDP
will be established, including a National Steering Committee (NSC). The NSC will oversee
implementation, comprising the permanent secretaries of key ministries involved in
implementation, and will endeavor to ensure co-ordination and resolve impasses and disputes
across the agriculture sector ministries. In addition, the overall budget allocations to the
agricultural sector line ministries will be monitoredto ensure that an increasingshare is going to
ASDP priority areas.

122.     Progress under PRSC2: Uneven progress has been made on these elements of the
program. Work on the crop boards, drafting of micro-finance regulations, streamlining local
government taxation, and improving ASDP co-ordination has advanced with slower progress on
landand ruralroads.

123.     The reviews of the cotton, coffee, cashew, and tea boards are nearing completion and
stakeholder workshops on the options for reform have been held. The regulations supporting
micro-finance legislation are at an advanced stage of preparation. Nuisance taxes at local
government level have been removedand the National SteeringCommittee to provide oversight
for the implementationof the ASDP is inplace.

124.     While significant progress has been made, in a commendably transparent manner, on
delivering surveyed plots in Dar es Salaam, there has been slow progress on developing a
prioritized strategic plan to better guide broader implementation of the Land Act and Village
LandAct. Delays have been caused by lack of timely funding to undertakethe work. This has
now been resolved and the work is currently underway. In addition, progress on strengthening
the institutional arrangements for road maintenance and rehabilitation has been slow with initial
lack of clarity over responsibilities on policy and institutional strengthening for districts roads
betweenthe Ministry and Works and the Presidents Office - RegionalAdministration and Local
Government. This has now beenresolvedandthe work is underway.

125.     Monitorable actions under PRSC3:          There are several monitorable actions under
PRSC3: (i)commencing implementation of the recommendationsof the crop board review; (ii)
the approvalofnew regulationsfor the micro-financelegislation; (iii)   finalization ofthe RoadAct
and its tabling in Parliament; (iii)development of an overall strategy on financing local
governments' responsibilities, including the role of own-source revenues and transfers; (iv)

stabilization, resultinginsustainedgrowth, low rates of inflation, and the buildup of international
reserves. Tanzania has also refinedits monetary and fiscal instruments and institutions to provide
a solid basis for sustained macro-economic stability. Weaknesses remain in the areas of debt
management and tax policy and administration. The PRSC supports efforts to eliminate residual
weaknesses inthese areas.

129.     Tanzania's public and publicly guaranteed external debt is assessed as being currently
sustainable after obtaining irrevocable debt relief under the enhancedHIPC Initiative (amounting
to US$ 2.026 billion in NPV terms). However, continued sustainability of Tanzania's external
debt is contingent on the sustained implementation o f macroeconomic and structural reform
policies, as well as prudent managementof external debt.

130.     Tanzania's revenue performance has increased in recent years from 11.3 percent in
1998/99 to 13.0 percent in 2003/04 but is still low compared to other countries in the region.
Improving Tanzania's comparatively low revenue effort is a key element o f government's
strategy to ensure sustainable financingfor the implementationofthe PRS.

131.    Reform strategy. Tanzania's reform strategy for debt management is spelled out in the
national debt strategy, the implementation of which is monitored under the PRSC program. Key
elements of this strategy are actions to (a) ensure fiscal sustainability and an optimal debt
structure, (b) deal with domestic contingent liabilities, (c) develop financial markets, (d)
strengthenthe institutional arrangement for public debt management, and (e) strengthenthe legal
framework for borrowingand debt management.

132.     Tanzania's strategy to enhance government revenue focuses on broadening the tax base
and improving tax administration.       Technical support for improving tax administration is
providedby the Bank and other donors.

133.     Progress under PRTC-2.         Government continued prudent debt contracting and
management and close monitoring of the debt situation. A work plan for the execution o f the
recommendations of the National Debt Strategy was prepared and will be further refined.
Government has continued to implement the National Debt Strategy, including furthering debt
negotiations, improving public accessibility o f debt data, reform of the legislative framework for
debt contracting, preparation of an updated debt sustainability analysis and an inventory of
domestic contingent liability as well as presentation of an annual borrowing and repayment plan
(concessional and non-concessional loans and attention to limits) to Parliament, together with the
budget for 2003/04. Provisional results of the annual debt (domestic and external) sustainability
analysis for the period ending inJune 2003 indicate that debt is sustainable with a debt to export
ratio o f about 126 in 2003104. However the analysis also indicates that if agreement on debt
relief from non-Paris Club creditors is not reached or if GDP and export growth are less than
projected, Tanzania's debt is likely to be unsustainable. Contingent liabilities amounted to about
T.Shs. 375.2 billion(about 3.8 percent ofGDP) as of endNovember 2003.

134.     Concerning government revenue and taxation issues, the authorities revoked, effective
October 2003, all government notices granting tax exemptions that were issued before 1997 and
discussions are on-going about extending similar treatment to post 1997 government notices.
With technical assistance from the IMF, government has prepared a revised income tax act which
is expected to enhance revenue mobilization. The income tax act was presentedto Parliament in
February 2004. Following approval of the five-year corporate plan for the Tanzania Revenue
Authority (TRA) at endJune 2003, organizational and personnel steps were taken towards its
implementation. A new Customs Code for the EastAfrican Community (EAC) is currently being
drafted with the aim to establish a Customs Union. Amendments to the EPZ regulations are
being prepared and the EPZ (Customs) regulations will be amended to be in line with this new
code.
135.     Monitorable actions under PRSC-3. The implementationof several measures foreseen
to be implemented under PRSC-3 already commenced under PRSC-2 and is expected to be
continued or completed during PRSC-3. This includes the establishment of a National Debt
Management Committee which meets quarterly to advise the Minister of Finance on all proposals
for new credit and to monitor the implementation o f the National Debt Strategy. Government is
committed to strengthen the debt data management system by improving institutional
arrangements and coordination between all departments generating and hosting debt data.
Government will also issue circulars to ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) to
reinforce adherenceto the Loan, Guarantees, and Grants Act and refine and update the work plan
for PAD'S debt department. Progress on the implementation of TRA's new corporate plan, the
publication of revisedregulations for customs under the EPZ act as well as the submission o f tax
laws including clear provisions for tax exemptions are actions to strengthentax administration.
136.     Expectedresults of theprogram. The key results o fthe macroeconomic reforms pursued
under PRSC-2 are (a) prudential debt contracting and management consistent with the annual
repayment and borrowing plan presentedto Parliament together with the annual budget and with
maintaining macro-economic stability and (b) an equitable and efficient tax system that supports
an increase inthe revenueto GDP ratio without impingingon economic growth.
137.     Monitoring indicators. The following indicators will be usedto assess the effectiveness
of reforms inthis area:

                           G. PUBLICEXPENDITURE        MANAGEMENT

138.     Issues. The budget is a key instrumentfor the implementationof the PRS. An effective
budget process which can translatePRS priorities into budgetary allocations and execute these is
critical to ensure that both domestic resources and program aid are used effectively. At the
central government level, Tanzaniahas established fairly robustsystems for budget allocationand
execution as documented inthe annualPERexternalevaluationreports, IMFmonitoring, and the
HIPC expenditure tracking exercise. While initial reform efforts have rightly and successfully
focusedon strengtheningbudgetmanagement at the centrallevel, budgetmanagementat the local
government level has received less attention and still displays considerable weaknesses. The
ongoingdecentralizationprocess which gradually gives greater responsibility for the management
of fiscal resources to local governments, makes reformsofthe intra-governmentaltransfer system
and of budget management at the local level an important focus of current reform efforts.
Progresshas also beenmade inintegratingdonor resources into governmentsbudgetmanagement
systems. However, an estimated 20 to 30 percent of donor support are still provided to
governmentoutsidethe budgetarysystem.

139.     Reform strategy. The PER and MTEF processes are the main instruments to align
budget allocations with the PRS. In March 2004, the PER external evaluation reviewed
Government's approach to strategic decisions on medium-term resource allocations and
developedproposalson how the process could be strengthened.

140.     The PRSC monitors that resource use is consistent with PRS priorities and supports
reforms which are aimedat maintaining fiscal discipline and enhancingallocative and operational
efficiency.  While initially the focus has been on increasingand monitoring the share of budget
allocations goingto the priority sectors defined inthe PRS, there is now need for greater attention
to the efficiency of public spending and intra-sectoral resource allocations both in priority and
non-priority sectors. The PER process is the primary instrument to carry such reforms forward.
Performance budgeting as well as the focus of public sector reforms on improved performance
management are critical complementsof efforts to strengthenthe results orientationof the public
sector.

141.     The reform of the intra-governmental reform system has at its core the adoption of a
formula based and incentivized fiscal transfer system, covering both recurrent and development
expenditures. Local government budget management is now a key focus of budgetary reforms,
which includes capacity building at the local levelthrough the local governmentreform program,
the phased roll-out of the Integrated Financial Management System, and improved budget
classificationandreporting.

142.     Progress under PRSC-2. The budget for 2003104 and the budget guidelines for the
period 2004105 - 200617 continue to support the implementationof the PRS. The reporting of
expenditures based on clearly identified budget codes for priority sectors and items allows for
improved monitoring of poverty reducing expenditures. The budget for 2003104 shows an
increase in budget allocations to the priority sectors by about T.Shs. 235 billion or 25 percent
comparedto actual spending in2002103. The allocation going to the priority sectors remainedat
around 46 percent of total government spending. A major increase outside the priority sectors
occurred in the energy sector relatedto the Songo-Songo natural gas development project. The
budget guidelines indicate further increases in real spending in the priority sectors in 2004105,
however their share in total spending is projected to remain constant. However, the fact that


                                              36

around US$ 200 million of resources have been left unallocated inthe budget guidelines leaves
some uncertainty as to the final budgetallocations for 2004105.

143.     Budget execution in 2002103 and the first half of 2003104 was consistent with the
approved budget and the PRS, as allocations to the priority sectors remained protected and
expenditure releases were provided at a quarterly basis. In 2002103, the application of the new
procurement act led to delays inthe implementation of the expenditure program with a bunching
o f expenditures in the last quarter of the fiscal year.       The first half of 2003104 showed
significantly less delays in expenditure execution, suggesting improvements in procurement
planning and implementation. InFebruary 2004, Parliament approved a supplementary budgetto
finance drought related expenditure in the power sector and for the re-stocking of the strategic
grain reserve as well as for the purchase of a government aircraft and additional transfers to local
authorities to compensatefor revenue losses after the abolition ofthe development levy.

144.     With respect to reforms of local government budgeting, recurrent and development
budgets have beenprepared usingthe GFS classification. A new format for the reportingof local
government expenditures to PO-RALG and the Ministry o f Finance has also been developed and
was usedfor the preparation o f quarterly budget execution reports inthe third quarter of 2002103.
Transfers from the central government to local governments, which currently account for about
85 percent o f their spending, are also classified according to the GFS. Cabinet has approved the
introduction of formula based transfers to local authorities for recurrent expenditures in the
education and health sectors. This is expectedto enhance the transparency, fairness, and poverty
orientation o fthe intergovernmentaltransfer system.

145.    Expenditure tracking work in the education sector, foreseen to be completed under
PRSC-2, has been delayed and only a draft report which still requires substantial revisions has
been prepared to date. It is expected that the approach and methodology o f that study can be
replicated inother sectors. The Ministry of Finance confirmed the strategic importance it intends
to give to expenditure tracking studies inthe future, especially through its Technical Audit Unit.
However, some more limited expenditure tracking took place. A pilot for the education sector
supported by the Bank indicated that there are virtually no leakages inthe flow of funds from the
center to schools. The study also suggested that large-scale tracking of the per-capita grants
should only take place once the grants have increased from around US$ 2 at the time o f the
survey to the target of US$ 10per pupil. The technical audit unit of the Ministry of Finance with
EUsupport carried out anexpenditure tracking study for the roadsector.

146.    Monitorable Actions under PRSC-3. The budget for 2004105 and the budget guidelines
for the period 2005106 - 200718 are expected to reflect PRS priorities and support the
implementation o fthe PRS. Furthermore, budget execution for 2003104 and the first six month of
2004105 should be consistent with the approved budget.

147.    As PRSC-3 coincides with the preparation of a new PRSP for Tanzania, there is a
particular focus on strengtheningthe linksbetween the PRS and the budgetprocess. To this end,
government will complete the medium-term costing o f priority policies and actions contained in
the new PRSP inrelation to the annual and medium term performance targets. Furthermore, an
important aspect o f strengthening intra-sectoral resource allocation and operational efficiency is
the implementation of recommendations from the sector PERs.

148.    Government is also committed to implement the recommendations of expenditure
tracking studies and develop appropriate action plans based on the findings of various tracking
studies. LGAs are expected to display the receipt of central government on notice boards and in
newspapers.



                                                37

  149.     Finally, to further enhance the capture o f donor funding in the budget, ministries,
  departments, and agencies will prepare quarterly reports that show the amount o f foreign
  assistance receivedby donor. This is intended to allow for the checking o fconsistency o f data on
  donor spending by the MDAs, the Ministry o f Finance and the donor agencies and the
  identification o f any systematic differences inreporting.

  150.     Expected Results of the Program The key result o f these actions is to ensure that
  budgetary allocations and spending are consistent with the objectives and strategies set out inthe
  PRS.     Furthermore, the actions are also intended to yield greater transparency in budget
  formulation and execution both at the central and local government level.

  151.     Monitoring Indicators. There are three broad indicators that are used to monitor
  progress inthis area. The first is spendingon the PRSP priority sectors, which tries to capture the
  extent to which outcomes of the budget process are consistent with the PRS. Recent discussions
  in Tanzania have put in question the usefulness and possible moral hazard problems in
  monitoring budgetary inputs to priority sectors instead o f focusing primarily on outputs o f
  government activities and the integrity o f the budget process. Inaddition, since the definition o f
  priority sectors in the PRS focuses primarily on social sectors and excludes important spending
  categories related to economic growth such as infrastructure expansion, operation, and
  maintenance, the usefulness o f focusing on expenditure shares o f the priority sectors has also
  been questioned. The second indicator thus focuses on the integrity o f the budget process by
  monitoring to which extent budgets are executed as approved. The share o f budgetary votes for
  which the deviation between budgeted and actual expenditures is more than five percent captures
  this aspect o f public expenditure management. The last indicator is the number o f benchmarks
  met inthe HIPC expenditure tracking assessment, as a composite indicator covering many aspects
  of budget formulation,. execution, andreporting.

  152.     The external evaluation under the annual PER process, which also includes an update o f
  the HIPC expenditure tracking exercise, serves as the main monitoring tool inthis area. As part
  o f the PRBSPRSC annual and midyear review, a detailed budget review is also carried out and it
  is intended to mainstream PRBSPRSC monitoring requirements, both with respect to substance
  and timing, with the PERexternal evaluation function.

                                     H. PUBLIC SERVICE REFORM

  153.     Issues. Despite good achievements in structural reforms in the mid-nineties, much
  remains to be done to translate these results into improved service delivery to the people o f
  Tanzania. Although substantial progress had been made inreducingthe size o fthe public service
  and implementing other cost containment measures, GOTfelt that it needed to focus on the
  transformation o f the public service into an institution that will play a pivotal role in economic


                                                 38

growth and reducing poverty.       It believed that, under severe budgetary constraints, it was
important to put inplace a work force that would become more accountable for its performance.
It is against that background that GOTopted for a more comprehensive public service reform
program launched in2000. The PRSC supports this comprehensive program.

154.     Reform Strutegy. More specifically, the PRSC supports government's effort to improve
the performance o f the public service by: (i)   institutionalizinga strategic process to sustain the
structural reforms; and (ii) strengthening the capacity for improved delivery o f public services.
The PRSC supports the government's long-term process o f sustainable capacity building and
transformation o f the public service to result-orientation. Under this process, the public service is
learning to utilize strategically the limited public resources available towards service
improvements.     Within this framework, key capacity requirements are identified and so are
appropriate institutional incentives for performance. Key components o f the program include the
acceleration o f pay reform, the installation o f performance management in the MDAs, the
monitoring o f performance and decentralization o f human resources management closer to the
people. A key constraint to public service performance is low public sector wages. This has led
to difficulties in attracting, motivating and retaining qualified staff.      However, government
recognizes that pay alone will not improve performance o f the public service and that there is a
need for wage increases to be linked to improved performance.                  Thus government is
institutionalizing in MDAs the implementation o f a range o f performance-focused instruments
including annual plans, performance budgets, service delivery surveys, and open performance
appraisal as part o f performance monitoring. Performance improvement is at the core o f GOT'S
public sector reforms and its plan to build sustainable capacity in the public service. Inorder to
ensure that the program is truly contributingto delivery o f better services, GOTis puttinginplace
a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system.

155.     Progress under PRSC2. The overall implementation o f the "improved performance of
the public sector" component o f the PRSC is satisfactory.        The Public Service Management
Office (P0:PSM) has moved steadily with the reform agenda. One o f the key achievements has
been pay enhancement in line with the approved budget for FY 2004. Salaries have been
increased between 6 and 10 percent with the minimum wage rising from T.Shs. 35,000 in 1999 to
T.Shs. 55,000 hence up by 57 percent. P0:PSM would like to accelerate the implementation o f
its pay reform strategy. However, since pay reform is dificult to implement and there could be
some wavering o f commitment, it will be important to continue to monitor closely the
implementation o f this element o f the PRSC matrix. A key issue to be considered is the use o f
the selective accelerated salary enhancement (SASE) as a tool to accelerate salary enhancements
particularly for professional, technical and managerial staff.     Although Cabinet approved the
principle o f accelerating implementation o f the pay reform strategy, it remains uneasy about the
mechanism presently being used (SASE) and would like to see more thoughts being given to
other options. This will continue to be monitored closely since any back tracking on that front
could jeopardize the implementation o f the overall PSRP. This will continue to part o f the
ongoing dialogue with government.

156.     P0:PSM also supported the completion o f strategic plans for 23 MDAs during the past
year out o f a total o f 33 MDAs. Of those, 13 have completed their annual operational plans and
action plan exceeding the target o f 11. These operational and action plans were based on self-
assessments and service delivery surveys (SDSs).

157.     Therefore, the overall installation o f performance management in the MDAs is
progressing as envisaged and 80 per cent o f the exercise is now completed. The key challenge i s
making it a sustainable feature o f the management o f the public service with genuine ownership
by the MDAs with a clear link to resource requirements and allocation. P0:PSM is considering
preparing on a yearly basis a report on the "state o f the public service", which would make use o f


                                                39

the information generated through the performance management process and more specifically
from the M&E system installed inP0:PSM and the MDAs. Close linkages between the strategic
plans and resource allocation are crucial to success since MDAs can only be held accountablefor
their performance ifresources are aligned with the plans. Progress is beingmade in integrating
strategic planning and budget preparation.

158.     To date, the M&E system has been piloted satisfactorily in 8 MDAs and the roll-out is
proceeding in 19 MDAs. An elaborate system has been developed and training is ongoing in
MDAsto ensurethe quality of informationthat it generates. The importance ofhaving inplace a
strong result-based M&E system can only be emphasized if performance of the public service is
to be assessed in terms of improving service delivery and ultimately to have an impact on
poverty. However, P0:PSM has to re-assess which instruments are the most appropriate to
monitor the latter and how it needs to collaborate with other parts of government who are actually
deliveringthe services, i.e., local governments.

159.     A Public Service Act has been approved by Parliament, forming the basis for a more
meritocratic process of human resourcesmanagement. However, the new Act is inconsistent with
Government's decentralization policy, reducing local government authorities' control and
management o f staff employed at the local level. Although P0:PSM claims that government i s
operating within the framework of the Public Service Management and Employment Act, and
thus is committed to decentralizing the managementand control of human resources, it appears
that this might not be the case. P0:PSM and relevant ministries have initiated the process to
launch an independent study to review issues requiring"harmonization". The lack of a clear and
unified position with respect to decentralization of human resources managementraises concern
and it is hoped that the study will provide a clear direction for the way forward.

160.     Monitorable actions under PRSC3. It is expected that for the PRSC3 period, the GOT
will have approved updated annual plans and performance budgets for all MDAs taking into
account results of service delivery surveys (SDSs).        It is also envisaged that SDSs will be
completed for the remaining MDAs. However, it will important that P0:PSM addresses the
issues raised by the implementation of SDSs and seeks to find an appropriate mechanism to
assess regularly the client satisfaction. Close collaboration with local governments will be key.
In addition the M&E performance monitoring system will have been rolled out in all MDAs.
More importantly, pay enhancement in line with the pay reform targets and approved budget for
FY05 and implementation of accelerated salary enhancements will yield improvements for
professional, managerial and technical staff. It is also hoped that a study on the decentralisation
of human resources will have beentranslated inan action plan indicating how the harmonization
of the public service act and local government service act and regulations will take place.

161.     Expected results of the program.        The PRSC actions are expected to lead to the
following outcomes:

     0   Improvedpublic service capacity and performance to support the delivery o f services;

     0   Improvedclients' awareness of what they can expect from the public service and
         increasedsatisfaction; and

                      I.FINANCIALMANAGEMENT                ANDACCOUNTABILITY

163.      Issues. The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) that was carried out
in 2001 indicated that inadequate financial accountability systems both at central and local
government levels poseda major fiduciary risk. The specific weaknesses include: (i)              Central and
local government accounting and financial reporting is constrained by a shortage o f qualified and
experienced accounting and internal auditing personnel due to unattractive civil service salaries;
lack of effective sanctions against violation o f fiduciary procedures; and, weaknesses in
government IT policy and records management. (ii)Public Sector auditing i s inadequately
resourced, interms of bothfinancial and human capacity.

164.      A Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) was carried out during fiscal year
2003 as part o f PRSC-1 preparation. This second CPAR (first CPAR was carried out in 1996)
undertook a diagnostic review of all areas of public procurement systems inTanzania, including:
the legislative framework; the performance of regulatory functions; the enforcement regime; the
capacity o f public sector institutions to conduct procurement; and the effects of corruption on
procurement.       Recommendations of the CPAR include: (a) separating the operational and
regulatory functions of the Central Tender Board and transforming the Central Tender Board into
a regulatory authority responsible for procurement policy and monitoring of public procurement;
(b) fully decentralizing procurement operations to MDAs; (c) establishing a new cadre of
procurement specialists and a system of certification for the same; (d) restructuring the
composition o f the District Tender Boards to exclude councilors; (e) abolishing the Government
Stores and introducing framework contracts for common items that will be managed by a slim
government agency; (f) abolishing the Materials Management Board and establishing a new
Procurement Professionals Body (PPB); (g) publishinga weekly Procurement Journal where all
procurement opportunities will be advertised; (h) establishing a whistle-blowing mechanism to
curb corruption inprocurement; and (i)     replacingthe system of pre-shipment inspection(PSI) by
destination inspection (DI).

165.      Reform strategy. The CFAA and the CPAR have identifiedkey actions that need to be
taken forward over the short and medium term. The government is now taking measures to
address some of these gaps and weaknesses. Inthe past, financial managementreforms had been
undertaken in a piecemeal fashion which could not ensure that reforms are comprehensive,
properly coordinated, and well sequenced. To address this weakness in the reform process,
Government has developed a revisedPublic Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP)',
which serves as a coordinating framework for financial management reforms and associated
technical assistance. It sets out a methodology to mitigate the associated fiduciary risk and
strengthen the country's financial accountability framework. It also incorporates the findings of
the recent HIPC tracking and IMF Fiscal ROSC studies. The thirteen main output targets of the
revised PFMRP have been sequenced to reflect the logical progression from macroeconomic
forecasting through revenue mobilization and resource allocation to expendituremanagement and

 The originalPFMRPhadbeendevelopedin2000 as a conceptby SIDA but itwas notyet completelydevelopedand
only partially fundedby SIDA. However, MoF was keen to use the existingframework to avoidduplicationwith

oversight. It recognizes the need to address constraints to improve public financial management
beyond as well as within the MoF and it will take forward existing public financial management
reform initiatives and address outstanding weaknesses.          The revised PFMRP provides an
analytical underpinning for design of the financial managementcomponent o f the PRSC-2 and in
particular to establish appropriate targets and output indicators/measures.

166.     There is ongoing donor collaboration in designing a common set of benchmarks for the
"Financial Management-pillar" for the PRSCPRBS. The medium term policy matrix for the
PRSCPRBS now combines revisedbenchmarks in the PAF and supports the critical ones from
the PFMRP. Under PRSC-1 the government has made steady progress in strengthening its
financial management arrangements. It also supported Tanzania in furthering the steps it has
already taken inputtinginto place a sound financial management system with the introductionof
an Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS), and the enactment of the new Public
Finance Act No. 6 of 2001 and the Public Procurement Act No. 3 o f 2001. The speed of
implementation and integration of the IFMS and the legislative changes have, however, left a
number of gaps, which unless filled, will negate the benefits of the recent achievements. Also,
under the PRSC-1, the government had approvedthe revisedPFMRP and submitteda final copy
of the program to all development partners. The government undertook a number of actions to
strengthenthe accounting and financial reportingfunction within MDAs. Audit committees have
beenestablished inall MDAsandtraining for the committees have commenced. The government
has approved the implementation of improved terms the conditions of service of staff of the
National Audit Office (NAO).        All the high level staff of NAO have received training in the
application of IFMS.

167.     The government's vision of the future for Local Government Authorities (LGAs) is well
articulated inthe reform agenda, which is being implementedthrough Local Government Reform
Programme (LGRP). The LGRP includes activities on financial management reforms. The
functions, resourcing, reporting requirements, and other mandates o f LGAs are clearly stated in
the various laws and regulations. Inevitablythe processof change is slow as the concept of local
participation is still in its formative stages in Tanzania. Currently 28 LGAs are fully using the
IFMS as of January 2004. The LGRP is inthe process of identifying an additional 29 LGAs to
start implementingthe IFMS.

168.     ProgressunderPRSC2.

Establishment of the revised PFMRP. Establishing the PFMPR as a coordination mechanism,
which ensures that reforms address fiduciary concerns in a comprehensive manner, and are well
coordinated and sequenced, took more time than expected. The action plan and budget for the
first year, an operations manual, and a Memorandum o f Understanding for coordinated donor
support to the program have been prepared and were endorsed by the Joint PFMRP Steering
Committee on June 24, 2004. A Public Sector Working Group has been established and is, inter
alia, responsible for ensuring that key implementation strategies o f PFMRP and PSRP are
explicitly linkedand complement each other.

Financial accounting and reporting. The IFMS is at the core of Tanzania's efforts to strengthen
financial accounting and reporting. The system has now been operational for several years.
During 2003/04, progress included a substantial upgrade of the hardware, training of a large
number of staff, and direct access to the system by regional administrations. An IT-consultant
assisted and advised on the implementation of a disaster recovery pladsite which is now at an
advanced stage.      A task force has prepared draft recommendations on the revised MoF
organization structure while approval for the change in structure is vested with the President's
Office -Public Service Management and may take some time to be confirmed.



                                                42

Internal audit. Audit committeeshave been established and are operational inMDAs. Currently
training sessions are being conducted in order to sensitize the MDAs on the effective use of the
committees. An Internal Audit Manual has been preparedand will be issued soon while training
will be conducted over the next few months. A draft staffing report on the review of internal
audit staffing levels andassessment of skills and other resource requirementshas been issuedand
reviewedby the Accountant General's Department.

External audit. The disparity insalaries betweenaccountingandauditing staff has beenremoved.
The NAO carried out ajob evaluationexercise and is awaiting approval of more generalpolicies
inthe area of staff retention and salary structure. Access to the IFMS by the NAO has not been
achieved due to infrastructureand funding limitations. This will be addressed inthe coming year
with the support of a SIDA. Training is expected to take place in2004. Following the approval
of an organizational restructuring plan in May 2002, the NAO carried out a job evaluation
exercise and has recruited additionalstaff which were deployedby November 2003. Only a few
(about 5) senior positionsneedto be finalized, pendingapprovalby the PO-PSM.

Local Government Authorities. At the local government level, a recent PRBS review indicated
problems with the plannedroll out of the IFMS at LGAs and a need to set up a central support
mechanismto providethe necessaryback up for following up the rollout process. Inaddition, an
important issue that will be addressedis the identification of legal inconsistenciesbetweencentral
and local government financial regulations

Procurement. An action plan for the implementation of the CPAR recommendations was
preparedinJuly 2003. Amendments to the Public ProcurementLaw have been finalized and the
Attorney Generalhas informedthe Ministryof Financethat said amendments will be submittedto
Parliament during the June/July/August 2004 budget session. Initially it was expected that the
amendments would be submitted by March 2004. However, the need for more extensive
consultations than originally anticipated has led to a delay in the submission. The government
has issued the new Local GovernmentAuthority ProcurementRegulations in line with the Public
ProcurementAct of 2001. Subsequently, local GovernmentAuthority Tender Boards have been
establishedand Councilors are no longer involved inthe procurementprocess. This is expected
to have asubstantialpositive impact on corruptionat the local government level.

169.    Monitorable Actions under PRSC3.            Government is committed to complete the
following actions under PRSC3:

Operationalizationof the PFMRP. The major challenge over the next few months will be to set
up a small Secretariat under the supervision of the Program Coordinator. Consequently the
development of a more focused phase one program should be a priority -the revised program
document shouldreflect the coordinatedand sequencedprogram activities, outputs and outcomes
over time. Also, the        basket-funding arrangements as defined in the Memorandum of
Understanding and Operations Manual (covering the Institutional arrangements, Reporting
arrangements, Financial Management & Procurement arrangements, and Monitoring &
Evaluation) shouldbecomeoperational.

Financial accounting and reportinv. The MoF and Civil Service Department are currently
preparingimprovementsto the payroll systemwhereby ministries will be requiredto enter payroll
changes themselves. The foreign and local debt had been consolidatedand also the debt data is
regularly reconciledwith that of the BOTwho runs a parallel system. Tax and non-tax revenue
will be captured in the IFMS and an IFMS disaster recovery plan and site will be implemented.
Also, the government plans to have at least 30 percent of all financial management positions
filled with qualified staff.



                                               43

Internal audit. Relevant training materials have been developed(based on the new Manual) and
negotiations are underway with local training institutions to provide the required Internal Audit
(IA) training. In addition, the new proposed IA structures will be agreed with CSD by March
2005. Also, the Accountant Generalwill monitor the performanceof the audit committees in all
MDAsby reviewingtheir minutesofmeetings.

External audit. The NAO will develop a computerisationstrategy followed by the procurement
and installation of computer equipment that will eventually allow access to IFMS. The CAG
plans to submit to parliament the audit report for fiscal year ending 30 June 2003 during the
June/July 2004 parliamentarysession onthe budget. This would reduce the time lagby 8 months
and allow the Office to movetowards compliance with the statutory requirementof nine months.

Local Government Authorities. The legal inconsistencies between Financial Regulations (for
Central Govt.) and Financial Memorandum (for Local Govt.) will be resolved. With regard to
preparation for the eventual roll-out of the IFMS to additional LGAs, the Accountant General's
Departmenthas beguntraining of fresh graduates on the IFMS, and sponsoredtraining invarious
institutions in and outside the country in the areas of information technology, accounting and
materials management for several staff members who will be posted in LGAs. Increasedeffort
has also been put on strengthening support systems for the implementation of the IFMS. A
Systems DevelopmentUnit for LGAs housed inthe Accountant General's Department is now in
place -25 specialists are being trained in the EPICOR software and are to be deployedto the
zones starting July 01, 2004. Other support includes defining a chart of accounts for LGAs, and
supervisionof 5 LGAs support zones. Also, it is expected that EPICORsoftwarewill be installed
and training started for the extension of IFMSto another 29 Local Authorities inaccordance with
the revised strategic plan of the IFMS Implementation and Coordination Committee (this
committee is a new co-operationbetweenMoF andPO-RALG).

Procurement. Government will continue the implementation of the CPAR recommendations
within the PFMRP framework. A key action is the establishment of a Regulatory Authority for
Procurementandthe decentralizationof procurementto procuringentities.

170.     Expected results of the program Linkage betweenthe PRSC and PFMRP is achieved
by ensuringthat the following proposedPRSC outputs and outcomes are consistentwith the main
objectives ofthe PFMRP. Over the course of the PRSC program, Tanzaniaexpects to, inter alia,
achieve the following:

         Improve completenessand quality of financial information,accountingrecords and
         reporting.
         Effective cash planning& managementmechanism.
         Accountability ofAOs andAudit Committeesimproved.
         Role, responsibilitiesof MOF and accountingfunction inline ministriesprofessionalized.
         Timely submissionof governmentannualaccountsto parliament.
         Increase number of clean audit reports.

         Externalaudit capacity developedto enhance quality andtimeliness ofreporting.
         Enhancethe independence of the NAO.
         Financialmanagement capacity at Local Government.level enhancedto sufficiently
         carry out responsibilities.



                                              44

        More efficient procurement of goods, works, and services.
        Harmonizedprocurement proceduresthroughout all of government.

171.    Monitoring indicators. Specific quantitative monitoring indicators under this component
include:

    b   NAO issues its report oncentral government for the fiscal year ended30 June 2003
        within a periodof 12months subsequentto year end.

    b   Audit reports for central governmentMDAsshows an improvement inPAC
        recommendations beingfollowed up -fewer cases of audit queries carried forward from
        year to year.

    b   Audit reports for localgovernment authorities are submitted inatimely manner (within
        the statutory requirements).

    b   AOs confirm inwritingthat audit committees have beenestablished and are meetingona
        regular basis in 100percent of MDAs.

    b   30 percent of all financial managementpositions inMDAsshould be filled with qualified
        staff. For NAOthe target is proposed at 10percent (up from the present level of about 5
        percent).
                              J. ANTI-CORRUPTIONACTIVITIES

172.    Issues. The 2002 Report on the State of Corruption in Tanzania, commissioned by the
Prevention of Corruption Bureau (PCB) and carried out by ESRFRACEIT, indicates that the
level of corruption has declined somewhat between 1996 and 2002 with some variations among
sectors. Since 1996, considerable groundwork has been done on the institutional framework (the
National Anti-Corruption Strategy and Action Plan--NACSAP, Public Finance Act of 2001 and
Public Procurement Act o f 2001) and inraising the awareness o f the public on the need to fight
corruption. However, the perception of the public is that the decline inthe level of corruptionhas
at best been modest. The report cited the incidence o f experiences with corruption as highest
within health services followed by police, business licensing, the judiciary, tax authorities,
education and public utilities. From a statistical point of view, the health sector ranked highest,
perhaps as a reflection o f providing services to a large population compared to the other sectors.
Therefore muchremains to be done to move beyond the plans to actually curb corruption.

173.    Reform strutegy. An important element of Tanzania's overall reform agenda is to fight
corruption to eliminate resource leakages, ensure equitable access to public services for the poor,
and strengthen the business environment.        In addition to specific actions related to punish
corrupted practices, the NACSAP underlines the need to tackle crosscutting reforms, namely
public service, public finance including procurement, and local government reform, in order to
put inplace transparent systems of accountability. The NACSAP puts the onus on all MDAs to
demonstrate how they intendto improve their performance in the fight against corruption within
their own premises. This is also supposedto be cascadeddown to localgovernments so that each
level of government is responsible to implement its part of the NACSAP.

174.    Progress under PRSCZ. Unfortunately, progress has been rather slow compounded by a
lack of institutionalised dialogue on anti-corruption issues, thus making it difficult to have a
concerted approach to monitoring performance in this area. At the same time, it is fair to
acknowledge that, since the crosscutting reforms mentioned above are underway, it is likely that
improvement inthese areas will help strengthenthe accountability framework, hence contributing
to implementGOT'Santi-corruption agenda.



                                               45

175.     Government has produced quarterly reports depicting progress made in the
implementation of the MDAs' anti-corruption action plans. These reports are useful to get an
overview of the seriousness o f MDAs in implementingNACSAP. Since there are no obvious
sanctions for non-compliance, it is not clear that due attention is paid by all MDAs to fulfilling
this requirement. It is envisagedto strengthenthe dialogue betweenGGCU and MDAsto foster
greater ownership and also to ensure that the anti-corruption action plans are receiving
appropriatefollow-up from the MDAs.

176.     GOThas commissionedwork on more quantitative and qualitative data particularly inthe
areas of monitoring and controlling public procurement, public finance and legal and judicial
processingin future reports, which has now been incorporated in the last two published reports
(last two quarters of2003). These indicatorswill provide a more meaningfulmeasureof progress
inthe fight against corruptionintwo areaswhere there is great scopefor malpractice.

177.     Ithad been anticipatedthat Anti-Corruption Action Plans would have been rolled out to
local government authorities by now and would have provided the necessary link to the central
government level action plans. This will not be done untilFY05/06. However, sensitisationand
training is underway and draft plans shouldbe available by November 2004. Since corruption is
widespread at the local level, this is a cause for concern. The contributions of PO-RALG to the
Quarterly Monitoring Reports also reflect what seems to be a low level of commitment to the
anti-corruption agenda.

178.     The capacity to monitor the implementationof NACSAP is rather limited. Nevertheless,
through the strategic plan developed for the President's Office in the context of the PSRP,
capacity building measures to support the Good Governance Coordination Unit will be
concretised. Without additionalsupport it is unclear how GOTintendsto coordinatethe efforts to
address the problem and more so to have a comprehensive picture of these efforts. More
importantly, there does not appear at this stage to be a clear result-based orientation to this
quarterly reporting system although discussions are underway to strengthen the dialogue and
ensure greater ownershipby the MDAs.

179.     The revision of the code of conduct for the public service has been completed, including
comments from three stakeholder workshops. Its implementation will be piloted in several
MDAsand will require strong support from senior management. Inaddition, it will be important
that the revised code be widely publicised. A mechanism for complaint and grievance to deal
with unethicalconduct is expectedto be inplace by November2004. A complaints officer, most
likely the same officer dealingwith anti-corruption, will be inplace ineach MDA.

180.     Monitorable actions under PRSC3. The NACSAP has been revised and will be
launched jointly with the 2002 Annual State of Corruption report, which has already been
published. The GOTis considering giving these reports a high visibility launch and indicating
how it intends to implement the recommendations of the report and the frequency of future
assessments.

181.     A draft Anti-Corruption bill to replace the current Public Corruption Act of 1971 was
preparedby the Prevention of Corruption Bureau (PCB). The revision widens the definition of
corruption, gives greater protection to whistleblowers and places the onus on those being
investigatedto provethat assets have not be amassedthrough corrupt or unethicalbehaviour. It is
only recently that the Law Reform Commission (LRC) was asked to take this process further.
Such a legislation requires broadconsultation with a wide range of stakeholders. Inthat context,
it is likely that the process leadingto the preparationof a new Bill will take some times despite
the preliminary work that has already been carried out. It is envisaged that this will not be
completeduntil2006.


                                               46

182.     Expectedresults of theprogram. The programis expectedto yield the following results:

    0    MDAs will show improvementintheir fight against corruption.
    0    Joint effortsfrom the various partsofthe public service will show positive results.
    0    There will be an increasednumberof complaintsadequately addressed.
    0    LGAs will improvetheir performanceinthe fight against corruptionat local level.

183.     Monitoring indicators. The PRS Second Progress report recommends that governance
be given more attention under PRS I1with specific measures and progress indicators. A set of
revised indicators is proposedto be mainstreamedinto the PMS system. These indicators will
also serve as monitoring indicators for the PRSC. MDAs quarterly reports contain quantitative
and qualitative data, particularly in the areas of monitoring and controlling public procurement,
public finance and legalandjudicial processing, that will help assess progress. It is also expected
that LGAs will have inplaceactionplans and will prepare quarterly reports.

                   K. MANAGEMENT         OF DEVELOPMENTRESOURCES
                                                             AID

184.    Issues. Official development assistance finances more than 40 percent of government
expenditures in Tanzania and the efficient management of aid resources thus plays an important
role in the implementation of the PRS. The management of aid provided by a large number of
donors, each with it own procedures and monitoring and reporting requirements, is a formidable
task for government, given its very limited and already overstretchedcapacities. Improved aid
management and reduced transactions costs in the utilization and delivery of foreign aid are
spelled out in the PRS as key elements of creating an enabling environment for its
implementation.

185.     Reform Strategy. Tanzania has put in place two complementary process to enhance the
management of aid resources. The first is the TAS process, which serves as the platform for
dialogue between government and donors on enhancing aid effectiveness. The TAS lays out
principles for the effectiveprovisionanduse of foreign aid, includinga move towards sector wide
approaches and generalbudget support. Under PRSC-1,government finalized a TAS actionplan
which sets out concrete steps for improving aid management. The second element of Tanzania's
aid reform strategy has the PERprocess at its core. Its objective is to foster more comprehensive
integration of donor support into government processes and in particular into the budget. The
PRSC program supports this strategy and monitors progress in the development and
implementation of the TAS as well as progress in integrating official development assistance in
the budget.

186.    Progress under PRSC-2. Tanzania issuedthe first annualTAS implementationreport in
November 2003. Improvementsinconsolidatingand integratingprojectionsof external resource
flows into the budgetpreparationbenefited from the externalfinance data base establishedby the
External Finance Department in the Ministry of Finance. However, there is clearly scope for
improvement requiring efforts by both government and the donor community. Information on
donor disbursements is still not fully captured inthe external finance data base and some donors
continue to experience difficulties in routing aid monies through the exchequer system. While
previous efforts of integrating aid into the budget focused almost exclusively on the central
government budget, under PRSC-2 PO-RALG launched an initiative to improve reporting on
donor support to local governments. Initial results of this initiative indicate that although the
system has been developed, operationalizing the system so that monies flowing directly to
projects are indeed captured and reported remains a key challenge for both PO-RALG and the
MoF, particularly for area based programs supported by donors through private agents and
NGOs.



                                               47

187.     Monitorable actions under PRSC-3. Government attaches highpriority to implementing
the TAS and integrating donor assistance into the budget. Actions to be implemented under
PRSC-3 include continued efforts to integrate projections o f external resource flows into the
budget, to fully operationalize the system for both MDAs and LGAs to report on levels of direct
external assistance budgetedand disbursed, to integrate data on levels of direct foreign assistance
from MDA quarterly reports to the budget department into the External Finance database, and to
issue a 2ndannual TAS implementation report.

188.     Expected results. The key result inthis area is the better integration of donor assistance
in the budget, which in turn would facilitate the coherence between government and donor
financed expenditures and thus enhance the effectiveness and efficiency in the use of domestic
and foreign funds.

189.     Monitoring indicators. Two indicators will be used to assess progress in this area,
namely the share o f official development assistance captured inthe budget estimatesand the ratio
between donor assistance shown in the budget estimates and the amount of donor assistance
captured in the appropriation accounts. The TAS implementation report and the PER external
evaluation monitor these indicators.      In recent years, these indicators have shown steady
improvement with the first indicator increasing from 57 percent in1999to 58 percent in2002 and
the second indicator displayingan increasefrom 42 percent in2000 to 67 percent in2002.

                            L. ENVIRONMENTAL          SUSTAINABILITY

190.     Issues. The poor inTanzania are heavily dependent on the environment both for income
generation and consumption.       The primary issues thus relate to Tanzania's high resource
dependence, the close linkages between poverty and environment, and government's ability to
address these within a modern institutional framework that concurrently promotes environmental
protectionand improved livelihoods, especially among the most vulnerable populations.

191.     Reform strategy. The PRSC supports government's efforts to address these issues
through a three-pronged strategy involving (a) mainstreaming o f environmental concerns into the
PRS, the budget process, and sectoral policies; (b) improved understanding of poverty-
environment linkages, and options for reducing vulnerability o f the poor; and (c) strengthened
institutional capacity to integrate environmental assessment (EA) procedures into sectoral
strategies and policies and specific activities at the district and local level. Many of these efforts
were spurredby the National EnvironmentalAction Plan (1994) and the National Environmental
Policy (NEP) adopted in 1997. The goals of the NEP are to ensure sustainability, security and
equitable use o f resources. InDecember 2002, the Cabinet approved an Institutional and Legal
Framework for Environmental Management Program (ILFEMP), which provides the basis for
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), cross-sectoral coordination, and integration of
environment management into local government planning processes. The Vice President's Office
(VPO) and the National Environmental Management Council (NEMC) within the VPO remain
the lead agencies for implementing the EA efforts. The Poverty Eradication Division has also
been involved in efforts to help address the poverty-environment linkages. All of these efforts
are also complemented by line ministry cooperation. A number o f key sector policies and
strategies reflect an increasing focus on environmental sustainability objectives.          Poverty-
environment linkages are also identified in several sectoral policies including tourism, rural
development, agriculture, forestry, fisheries and coastal management. DuringPRSC-1, the VPO
developed initialsectoral EA guidelinesfor roads and agriculture activities.

 192.    Progress under PRSC-2.           Following the approval o f appropriate institutional
arrangements under PRSC-1, the Cabinet endorsed in April 2004, the draft Environmental
Management Act, which is expected to be submitted to Parliament in October 2004. An action


                                                48

plan for implementation of the new institutional framework has also been completed in April
2004. In addition, a study has been completed on the role and applications of strategic
environmentalassessments (SEA). Training programs have been initiated to raise awareness of
SEA. Advancing the process further, a consultant has been engaged to prepare an SEA of the
PRSCDRBS process. Staff from the VPO are serving within "environmental units" within
sectoral agencies to develop capacity within these sectors for mainstreamingthe environmental
assessmentprocess.

193.    Government has completedaction plans for mainstreamingenvironment into the poverty
monitoring system as well as plans for building capacity within the VPO. These action plans are
already under implementation with a coordinator engaged to integrate environment into PRS;
equipment procured and some awareness workshops conducted. A "Sustainable Development"
network has been initiated and "Environmental Champions" are in place within the working
groups in the poverty monitoring system. In April 2004, the VPO engaged a consultant to
undertake a study which will propose an improved set of poverty-environment indicators for
inclusion in the poverty monitoring system. Under the guidance of the environment working
group, a PER for environment andnaturalresourceshas also beencompleted, providing inputs to
the budgetformulation process.

194.    Monitorable actions under PRSC-3. Severalactions originally expectedto be completed
under PRSC-3 have already beencompletedunder PRSC-2. This includesthe formulation of the
framework legislation on environmental management and endorsement of the same by Cabinet.
Submission to Parliament of the draft Act is to take place in October 2004. The Public
EnvironmentalExpenditureReview has also been completedand reviewed. The process has led
to a deeper understanding of priority issues and linkages to other sectors. Government is
committedto: (a) formulating the regulationson environmental assessments as well as guidelines
for integrating environmental assessments into sectoral and district planning processes, (b)
deepening current understanding of the use of economic instruments for environmental
management, (c) developing environmental standards for monitoring and compliance; (d)
carrying out pilot SEA inpriority areas and training in EA and SEA within sectors and districts
and (e) strengthencapacity at the district and local level for environmentalmanagement. While
increased capacity is a priority in all districts, emphasis will be given to those districts with the
highest poverty levels and environmental vulnerability. The Government is also committed to
building capacity within VPO for poverty-environment monitoring. It is hopedthat the ongoing
efforts to enhance the information and monitoring systems will provide an important policy
guidance tool to inform decision-makers. There is in particular, a need to better monitor and
integrate vulnerability indicators relating to environmental risks such as droughts, flooding or
fluctuations in renewableresource availability due to global change. Mainstreamingof poverty-
environment indicatorswithin the NationalPovertyMonitoring System is expectedto be finalized
in 2004. It is expected that environment continues to be mainstreamedwithin the PER process
and budget guidelines on the environment submitted to MoF in a routine manner. Sectoral
guidelines for mainstreamingenvironmental issues within sector PER studies are expected to be
developedand disseminatedduring 2005106.

195.    Expected results of theprogram. The actions implementedunder the PRSC program are
expectedto leadto five key mediumtermoutcomes, namely:

    0   Improved institutional capacity for environmentalassessments (including environmental
         impact assessments and strategic environmental assessments) and their integration into
        sector and district plans;

    0   Harmonized environmental management and increased compliance with environmental
        impact assessments;



                                                49

     0   Increased environmental information will contribute to the effectiveness o f the poverty
         monitoring system and strengthen the feedback required for the PRS;

     0   Enhanced knowledge and awareness about environment and poverty linkages to ensure
         the sustainability o f poverty reduction and environmental management efforts; and
         reduce the vulnerability o fthe poor to environmental risk; and

     0   Improved understanding o f the role and use o f economic instruments in environmental
         management.

196.     Monitoring indicators. Specific quantitative targets to be reached by 2005 under this
component o fthe PRSC include:

     0   90 percent o f sectors with environmental units

     0   80 percent o fthe districts have officers with environmental functions

     0   60 percent o fthe designated environmental officers at the district levels trained

     0   Committees o f environment established in 75 percent o fthe districts inthe country

     0   Activities underway to implement 50 percent o f obligations under international
         environmental conventions and agreements.

197.     Poverty-environment indicators monitored under the PMS include (a) the mean distance
to firewood and (b) the proportion o f smallholders with a planted area o f less than 2 ha for staple
crops (maize, sorghum, rice). However, as part o f the actions under the PRSC these indicators
will be further developed and refined.

                   M. MONITORING         PROGRESS     ONPOVERTY REDUCTION

198.     Issues. Results orientation and a focus on outcomes that benefit poor Tanzanians are a
key characteristic o f the PRS. To these ends, an elaborate poverty monitoring system (PMS) and
a related national level framework is in place in Tanzania. The data and analytics generated are
critical to assessing overall progress in the implementation o f government's poverty reduction
agenda, gauging the effectiveness o f macroeconomic policies and sectoral and cross-cutting
structural and institutional reforms, and shedding light on related cost efficiency and resource
allocation questions. This composite set o f results is necessary for informing the policy and
financing decisions o f the authorities, and providing assurances to development partners on the
efficacy o f public resource utilization and the direction o f reforms. While the institutional design
o f the Tanzania PMS is sound, further work is needed to strengthen its operations. A number o f
challenges (medium to longer term in nature) affect the optimal functioning o f the poverty
monitoring system.      The four overarching issues which government is attending to, are as
follows:

     (i)WhileasoundPMSframeisinplace,thecapabilitiesofcorePMSentitiesneedtobe
         strengthened further;
     (ii)The linkages and coordination between various PMS components (and particularly,
         between the local government and central levels) needs to be improved; the interface
         between the sectors and the PMS also needs to be strengthened significantly;
     (iii) quality,
         The              timeliness   and relevancy      o f the    data  generated through the
         routineladministrative data system needs to be enhanced; and,




                                                50

    (iv) Enhanced use of the PMS' outputs by government (including local government levels) is
         necessary, to better inform the strategic planning function, and policy and resource
         allocation decisions.
199.    Reform strutegy. The first set of actions relatesto addressingcapacity weaknesses intwo
of the PMS linchpin areas, Le., the Poverty Eradication Division in the VPO and the units
responsible for coordination and monitoring in PO-RALG. While improving their capabilities
will allow these units to operate more effectively inthe context o fthe PMS, it should also leadto
overall improved coordination and strengthened interactions among the various PMS
components. Secondly, there is a focus on developing and refining sectoral and cross-cutting
indicators and related targets in core areas; this effort includes the localization and integration of
MDGs. Work is continuing on the development of medium-termtargets, and refinement of the
cohort of indicators as well as development of robust annual / intermittentindicators inareas with
gaps.    As such, set indicators for policy responses in governance, gender, agriculture,
vulnerability, roads and the environment need to be developed or refinedfurther. Inthis respect,
the PRS review process offers the opportunity to review the PMS including reviewing the manner
in which planned survey, census or routine data will supply the information needed to supply
indicators.

200.    Progress under PRSC-2. The Household Budget Survey and other data sources, as well
as specialized studies of vulnerability, urban poverty, and the geographic distribution of poverty
have been presented in a comprehensive second Poverty and Human Development Report
(PHDR) which was launched during the poverty policy week inNovember 2003. Subsequently,
government issued the final version of the thirdPRS ProgressReport end-March 2004 and posted
it onthe nationalwebsite.

201.    Progress has also been made in strengtheningthe capacity o f VPORED on a sustainable
basis. The Action Plan for Building Capacity in Support of the PRS was presented to the PRS
Technical Committee and approved in August 2003. A full-time poverty monitoring officer has
beenrecruitedinthe PRSRMS secretariatandthe Poverty Monitoring Advisor has beenreplaced.
In an effort to improve the management and exchange of poverty related information and data,
the local area network has been upgraded. Outsourcing is used to cover internalhuman capacity
gaps. In order to ensure the sustainability o f capacity building efforts, a VPO Medium Tem
Strategic Plan was developed with external technical support and finalized inFebruary 2004. The
plan is expected to enable VPO to access the SASE scheme, in order to provide the minimum
incentive package necessaryfor sustainability o f the growing capacity. Inthe meantime, the VPO
budget/MTEF will remainthe main instrument for achievingthis.

202.    The mainthrust of the action related to strengthening and sustaining the capacity of PO-
RALG for collecting, collating and analyzing administrative data, is to promote improved
performance o f the routine data system. The long-term aim of government is to establish an
overall system for data collection at the local level. This includes further coordination and
collaboration between sectors and PO-RALG in synchronizing approaches, developing uniform
data collection formats, clear reporting and feedback channels, unified data storage centres,
analysis and dissemination. Issues identifiedas influencing the capture of data included multiple
and unsynchronized mechanisms, weak technical skills of data collectors, not recognizing
existing data already collectedand collection mechanisms and lack o f incentives to collectors. At
the same time, it is recognized that there i s a great deal o f current activity aimed at capturing and
using routine and administrative data including a variety of Management Information Systems.
Progress in this area is evident from the overall robust performance inhealth and education data
capture and analysis. At a more specific level, the following action have been taken: a senior
programmer was recruited to lead the MIS unit in PO-RALG; two senior PO-RALG staff have
been permanently assigned to the Routine Data Systems TWG; a report on the MIS strategy for



                                                51

PO-RALG has beencompleted; the database on LGA socialandeconomic profile is now ready; a
Local Area Network was installedand the domain registeredto facilitate e-communicationwith
Regional Secretariats and LGAs; and I T equipment has been procured for several Regional
Secretariats for storing andmanagingdata.

203.     In the area of indicators and analysis, the government has completed comprehensive
analytical work on poverty, and developeda more complete set of indicators. Efforts to integrate
the MDGs into the PMS beganwith the revision ofthe PRS indicators, which ledto the definition
of indicators in several priority areas (and the number of indicators increased from 39 to 60).
Beginning in FY04, the Poverty and Human Development Report 2003 and the PRS Progress
Report track progress using the revised list of indicators, which include progress towards the
MDGs.

204.     Monitorable Actions under PRSC-3. With a view to making further progress on the
challengesdiscussed earlier, the following PRSC3PRBSsupportedPAF actionsare proposed:
         Present a new PRS 2004 and issue a Progress Report that includes a review of
         performanceagainst all monitoring indicators andtargets contained inthe precedingyear
         PRSProgressReport.

     e   Develop and finalize a set of indicators for policy responses in governance, gender,
         agriculture, vulnerability, roads and the environment by November 2004. Explicitly link
         the set indicators to action plans which specify the structure, process, timeline and
         performancecriteria by which datato inform these sets will be gathered.

     e   The RoutineData Systems Technical Working Group finalizes a position paper detailing
         key actions taken or plannedto improve the collection of routine and administrative data
         insupportofthe PovertyMonitoring System. This will requiresubstantialengagementby
         Ministries responsible for Health, Education, Water, Agriculture and Roads. The
         implementationof action proposedinthe position paper is expected to allow government
         to demonstrates improvements from a baseline of November 2003 inthe performance of
         data collection and analysisof healthand educationdata to inform the PMS.

     e   Approved the Medium Term Strategic Plan for VPO including the structure for
         VPOIPED, staffing and financing to meet planned requirements anticipated in
         FY2004105budgetand MTEF.

     e   Conduct a review of the PMS, to include reviewing (a) how survey, census or routine
         data defines and report indicators, (b) the potential for addressing harmonisation and
         rationalisation of data systems, and (c) the way in which PMS-related institutions
         collaborate for most effective working. This review should feed into the revision of the
         PMS inthe context ofthe preparationofthe new PRSP.
205.     Expected Results of Program. The overarching objective is to improve the utility and
utilization of the PMS' outputs, such that it leads to strengthening the linkages among cross-
cutting and sectoral policies and programs, budgets, and poverty monitoring to enhance the
cogency among policies, expenditures, and delivery of services. This in turn translates into the
following set of realistic intermediate results to be achievedover the nexttwo years of the PRSC
program:

     e   Improved institutional capacity within PO-RALG and VPOPED for better delivering on
         their roles within the PMS, leading to overall improvements in the collection of
         administrative data, enhanced monitoring, evaluation and analysis of poverty related
         information.




                                                52

    0   Preparationof an updatedlist o f indicators(including the localizedMDGs) and definition
        of the process/modalitiesfor annuahtermittent reportingagainst these indicators.

    0   Wider disseminationof poverty data and analysis (e.g. via the PHDR) and abroadbased,
        high quality, discussion of its implications as part of the PRS monitoring process (e.g.,.
        during PovertyPolicy Week).
206.    In the medium term, strengthening of the poverty monitoring system is expected to
achieve the following results:

    0   Comprehensive, consistent, and upto date administrativedata;

    0   Strengthenedcivil society participationinthe PRS monitoring and feedback process; and

    0   Enhanced, databased, decisionmakingandresults-orientedgovernance,

207.    Agreed prior actionsfor PRSC-2. The set of prior actions for PRSC-2 is based on the
triggers identified under PRSC-I.      The prior actions emphasize the strategic focus of the
operation on enhancing pro-poor economic growth and public sector financial management.
Comparedto the original list of six triggers, sevenprior actionshavebeen addedto strengthenthe
focus of the operation and to give more specificity to the triggers. Table 10 shows how the
agreed prior actions for PRSC-2 have evolved from the triggers identified under PRSC-1. All 13
prior actions identified during pre-appraisal in November 2003 have been satisfactorily
completed.

208.     PRSC-2 Prior Actions. Beforepresentationto the Board, Tanzaniahas achievedseveral
key program benchmarks in the areas of sustaining macro-economic stability, rural and private
sector development, governance, environment, andpoverty monitoringand evaluation. As part of
the implementation of the PRS supported by the proposed PRSC-2, the United Republic of
Tanzania has carried out the following prior actions and provided documentary evidence of the
completionof the agreeduponactions to IDA:

210.     PRSC-3 Triggers.8 The decision as to whether IDA will proceedwith the PRSC-3 will
be contingent on satisfactory progress in the implementation of the PRS, including progress
towards quantitative targets. Progress inthe implementationof the PRS includes implementation
and continuation of reforms spelled out in the letter of development policy.             In addition,
completion of actions satisfactory to IDA in the following areas by March 2005 will serve as
triggers for proceedingwith PRSC supportto Tanzania:

   1.    Finalised and obtained Government approval of the strategic plan for operationalisation
         ofthe LandandVillage LandActs.

   11.

         of the pay reform strategy.
   vii.  Progress inthe implementationofthe PFMRP.
   viii. The Government establishes the Regulatory Authority for procurement and decentralises
         procurementto ProcurementAuthorities.

                                B. IMPLEMENTATIONANDMONITORING

211.    Monitoring arrangements. The poverty monitoring master plan and various other
processes described in this document provide a robust and highly participatory framework for
monitoring, and the PRSC will facilitate the implementationof these monitoring arrangements.
The expectedbenefits from using the IDA grant is that it will help to galvanize popular support
for difficult reforms through greater impact on the improvement of the social well-being and
livelihoods of the poor and maintain debt sustainability achieved after reaching the HIPC
completion point. The grant component will also enable stronger collaboration with bilateral
donors and the European Union (EU), who-through                    the PRBS facility-have emphasized
protecting and raising budget allocations to such priority sectors as education, health, and water.
The effects of IDA grants will be monitored by tracking expenditure allocation to these sectors
and assessing the impact of public spendingthrough the annual reviews of PRS progress reports.
Regular updates of the debt sustainability analysis will enable monitoring the impact of the grant
componentinmaintainingdebt sustainabilitystatus.

212.    Supervision and subsequent PRSCs. Supervision and preparation of the subsequent
credits and grants will take place in close collaboration with other donors and be consistent with
the PRS review mechanism. A joint PRBS-PRSC review will be conducted semiannually to
review progress made ineach ofthe programareas. Inaddition, the achievement of PRSC targets
will be assessedannually inthe context of the PRS review that will document the progress made
in the PRS implementation and analyze the outcomes of reforms. The reform program sets out
clear quantitative and qualitative benchmarks for three years. The PRSC targets are filly
consistent with the PRS. Given satisfactory progress, Tanzania's reform program will be

 supportedthrough subsequent PRSCs under the programmatic lending framework, subject to the
 approvalofthe Boardof ExecutiveDirectors.

                                   C. PRSC-2 Credit and Grant Administration

 213.      Borrower and credit amount. The borrower is the United Republic of Tanzania. A
 single-tranche credit of SDR 41 million (US$90 million equivalent) would be made available
 upon credit effectiveness, anticipated for August 2004. The closing date of the operation would
 be June 30, 2005. It is envisaged that there will be another further single-tranche, annual PRSCs
 to supportthe implementationofthe PRS inFY06.

 214.       GrantAmount. Additionally, there would be grant of SDR 61.6 million (US$90 million
 equivalent) that would be made available upon PRSC-2 effectiveness, anticipated for August
. 2004.

 215.      The proposedfinancial structure for the PRSC-2 is as follows:

           PRSC-2:             US$ 60 million equivalent (IDA credit)
                               US$90 million equivalent(IDA grant [debt vulnerability country])
                               ..........................
            Total              US$150millionequivalent


  216.     Disbursement, reporting, and auditing arrangements'. The operationwill follow IDA'S
  simplified disbursement procedures for adjustment operations".                    Accordingly, the PRSC-2
  proceeds will be disbursed in compliance with the stipulated single-tranche release conditions.
  Disbursement will not be linked to any specific purchases, and no procurementrequirementsare
  needed. Once the PRSC-2 is approved by the Board, the borrower will open and maintain a
  dedicateddeposit account inU.S. dollars for the borrower's use. As the singletranche is released
  on PRSC-2 effectiveness, IDA will disburse the proceeds of the credit and grant into the deposit
  account. Thereafter, at the request of the Ministry of Finance, the U.S. dollars amount will be
  convertedto Tanzaniashillings at the Bank of Tanzaniafor the credit of the government account
  (consolidatedfund account, to be used subsequently for public expenditures. If after deposit in
  the deposit account, the proceeds of the credit and grant or any parts thereof are used for
  ineligible purposes, as defined in the development financing agreement, IDA will require the
  borrower to either (a) returnthat amount to the depositaccount for use for eligible purposes or (b)
  refundthe amount directly to IDA.

  217.      Throughthe Ministry of Finance, the borrower will (a) reportthe exact sum received into
  the deposit account; (b) indicate to IDA details of the consolidated fund account to which the
  Tanzania shillings equivalent of the PRSC-2 proceeds will be credited; (c) ensure that all
  withdrawals from the deposit account are for budgetedpublic expenditures, except for purposes
  such as military expenditures or for other items on IDA's negative list; (d) report to IDA the
  equivalent in the local currency of the U.S. dollar amount withdrawn from the deposit account,
  producingevidence that the local currency sum was paid into the ConsolidatedFundAccount and
  disbursements from that account were for budgeted public expenditures other than those on
  IDA's negative list; and (e) submit a report on receipts and disbursements for both the deposit
  account and the consolidated fund account to enable IDA to review the consistency of the
  withdrawal with the developmentfinancing agreement andthe objectives of operation.

218.    These controls are intended to provide assurance that IDA funds have arrived at their
intended destination and are being used for their intended purpose of funding budgeted public
expenditures, subjectto the borrower's rules andregulations.

219.    The following summarizes the externalaudits:

        Deposit account: At IDA'Srequest and within six months of credit and grant disbursement,
        the depositaccount will be independentlyauditedonterms ofreference acceptableto IDA.
        Public (government) accounts: The controller and auditor general (CAG ) is required by
        law to producehis or her annual report on the public accounts of the central governmentto
        parliament within nine months of the financial year-end. A copy of these accounts should
        be submittedto IDA.

    0   Bank of Tanzania: The annual entity financial statements of the Bank of Tanzania, audited
        in accordance with International Auditing Standards promulgated by the International
        Federationof Accountants, are publicly available.

220.    Governance aspects. Aside from the measures supported by the PRSC that aim at the
strengtheningof governance, various processes are in place that aim at improved accountability
and transparency for the use of public resources. The Preventionof Corruption Bureauand the
National Audit Office have been significantly strengthened during recent years, and the Bank is
preparing a project that would support further strengthening of accountability mechanisms. The
participatory PER-MTEF process provides for an open review of budgetary performance. The
CFAA on Tanzania concluded that the central and local government financial management
systems represent high fiduciary risk. The major recommendationscontained inthat report have
been reflected in the reform program supported by the PRSC.                To ensure effective
implementationof the reform, the governmenthas developedthe PFMRP, the implementationof
which will be monitoredunder the PERprocess.

221.    Environmental Sustainability. The proposed PRSC-2 has been classified as structural
adjustment credit governed under the Operational Directive 8.60, and does not require an
environmental assessment rating. In an effort to mainstream the environmental sustainability
dimension into the PRSC process the Bank supported various analyses with the objective to
identify linkages betweenkey macro and structural reforms policies and the environment. This
analysis, undertaken under PRSC-1, identifies measures at both national and local government
levels to reduce poverty and enhance environmental sustainability of policy reforms. The
analysis concluded that environment and poverty are linked in three major ways: (a) poverty
reduction programs should not irreversibly affect the resource base upon which the poor depend
for their livelihoods; (b) improving environmental conditions can help to reduce poverty and
promote sustainable pro-poor growth; and (c) mitigating measures may be necessary as part of
policy dialogue.

222.    The URT has made significant achievements in building and institutionalizing
environmental management capacity at the national level during the past year. Accomplishments
include formulation of environmentalframework legislation; initiation of strategic environmental
assessments; launch of a Public Environmental Expenditure Review and steps to mainstream
environmental indicators into the poverty monitoring system. The Bank supported the
formulation of the environmental framework legislation through funds from an ongoing credit
and the strategic environmental assessment through the PHRD grant to prepare the PRSC2. The
environmentalagenda for the PRSC2andPRSC3 focuses onthe following priorities:




                                             60

     a)       While continuing efforts to strengthen national institutional capacity for
              environmental management, to focus on capacity enhancement at the district and
              local level with a priority for those districts with highest poverty levels and
              environmental vulnerability.

     b)       Improve the understanding o f economic instruments and voluntary methods for
              environmental management. This is in recognition that while a sound framework is
              being developed for regulatory management, reliance on economic incentives can
              decrease compliance costs, improve environmental quality, and reduce social
              inequities. Strategic environmental assessments can be used to help identify
              appropriate instruments.

     c)       Continue the support for Public Environmental Expenditure Review to provide
              environmental sustainability inputto the Budget Guidelines; and

     d),      Support for developing and mainstreaming poverty-environmental indicators within
              the poverty monitoring system. It is hoped that this work will result in providing an
              important policy guidance tool to informdecision-makers.

                                      D. BENEFITSANDRISKS

223.     Benefits. The PRSC-2 is designed to help the government implement its homegrown
PRS and reach the goals articulated in the strategy. The reforms supported under the program
will helpraise growth and strengthenthe institutionalinfiastructure needed to improve the public
sector's capacity to carry out its role more effectively, as envisioned in the PRS. A stable
macroeconomic environment, improved budget execution, strong economic governance, an
environment conducive to private sector and rural development (especially enhanced agricultural
productivity and profitability), and a well-performing public sector offering the improved
delivery o f public services are essential if the government is to reach its goals for poverty
reduction and improve the quality o f life in Tanzania. A vital related element would be the
effective monitoring and assessment o f the progress and pitfalls related to the implementation o f
the PRS.

224.     Risks and efforts to mitigate them            Because the proposed PRSC-2 supports the
implementation o f Tanzania's PRS, there are two interrelated and overlapping sets o f risks. The
first set covers all risks that may interfere with the achievement ofthe objectives o fthe PRS. The
second is narrower and concerns risks to the successful implementation o f actions covered in the
PRSC policy matrix. The following risks can be identified at this stage:

         As the next round o f elections approaches in 2005, concerns about the durability o f
          commitment to reforms will mount. To mitigate this risk, it will be essential to implement
          legal and institutional changes to underpin reforms by the current government. This will
         reduce the risk o f policy reversals and root these reforms more deeply in both attitude and
          practice. Inspiringinvestors' belief that the changes made are durable is a major challenge
          in scaling up investor response. An important means to sustain reform and limit the
          possibility o fpolicy reversals is the buildingo f domestic constituencies for reform.

     0   As policymaking has become more inclusive-with          a greater role for stakeholders beyond
         the executive and, in particular, for parliament-decision     making processes have tended to
         become more drawn out.          This poses a risk primarily with respect to the speed of
          implementation of agreed actions, while the risk for significant policy reversals is
          considered to be reduced. The key mitigating measures contain two elements. The first is
          dissemination and knowledge sharing with a wide range o f domestic constituencies on the
          rationale and benefits o f reforms. The second relates to using the process leading to the



                                                  61

definition o f the PRSC policy matrix (PAF) to gauge the extent to which there is consensus
onreforms among key constituencies andthen sequence reforms accordingly.
The utilization o f PRSC resources is determined by the domestic budget process with the
possibility that resource allocation is influenced by other factors than pursuit o f the PRS
objectives. The principal mitigating measure derives from strengthening the role o f
domestic stakeholders in budget formulation and budget review. Government's continued
commitment to an open and participatory PER and budget process is an important and well
established tool to support and monitor consistency o f budget formulation and execution
with the PRS. It is worth notingthat due to fungibility o f resources, the allocative risk also
exists for other aid modalities andthe PRSC is explicitly designed to address this risk.
Both the CFAA and the CPAR identify significant fiduciary risks.              In recent years,
government has implemented measures to eliminate fiduciary risks, including the approval
and application o f new public finance and procurement acts, the full operationalization o f
the Integrated Financial Management System, and strengthening o f the National Audit
Office.    The PFMRP and actions monitored by the PRSC are designed to address
weaknesses in government's financial management and procurement systems.
Another risk for the achievement o f PRS objectives arises from the ongoing
decentralization process, which shifts responsibility for key poverty reducing programs in
education, health, the water sector, and agriculture to the districts. Preliminary assessments
indicate great variations inthe quality and capacity o f financial management and reporting
systems across districts, in addition to often limited capacities to manage and implement
poverty reducing programs.          The local government reform program focuses on
strengthening the capacity o f local authorities. However, a residual risk remains, especially
inthe initial phases o f the PRSC, that capacity-building efforts may lag behindthe scaling
up o fprograms. All phases o fthe PRSC support actions to strengthenthe watchdog role of
beneficiaries at the community level through disclosure o f the flow o f resources to various
activities at the grassroots level and expenditure tracking o f financial flows from the central
government throughthe annual PERs. These actions will help to assess and mitigate risk.

Although systems and capacities at the central level are generally stronger than at the local
level, limited human resources capacity to implement andmanage the PRSC reform agenda
at the center represents another risk in the Tanzanian context, especially in the areas o f
public expenditure management, procurement, and financial management.              To mitigate
these risks, the proposed PRSC focuses appropriately on the strengthening o f oversight
arrangements. A large number o f capacity-building efforts are in place.          Most reform
programs have capacity-building components embedded, including the PFMRP, the local
government reform program, and the public sector reform programs. Similarly, sector
programs and projects typically also contain capacity buildingcomponents. The challenge
for Tanzania is to enhance the effectiveness o f capacity-building efforts by shifting from
supply-driven to demand-driven efforts and address capacity building in a holistic way, in
which the incentive structure, education system, and specific capacity-building efforts are
organized in a mutually reinforcing manner. In the medium term, it is expected that the
shift from project to budget support by the Bank and other donors will release staff who are
currently tied up in project management to play a greater role in overall public sector
management.

    Dear Mr. Wolfensohn,


                               RE: LETTER OF DEVELOPMENTPOLICY


     1.        On behalf of the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania, Iam
     writing to request for the approval of the second Poverty Reduction Support
     Credit (PRSC 2) of US$ 150 million (SDR equivalent). The proposed credit will
     assist in the implementation of our Poverty Reduction Strategy by supporting
     Government's own financial resources directed at PRS priority sectors and items,
    The credit will also support complementary reforms in the PRS including: private
     sector and rufial development; macroeconomic stability; budget formulation and
     execution; public service reform, public financial management, anti-corruption
     and environmental sustainability.

     I. BACKGROUNDANDRECENTDEVELOPMENTS

     A.        MACRCIECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

     2.        Overall, Tanzania's macroeconomic performance in 2003 continued to be
     in line with projections.                However, shortfalls in rain adversely affected
     agricultural production in certain regions and led to localised food shortages with
     an impact on GDP growth and inflation targets.              Preliminary National Accounts




                                                 64

for 2003 indicate that GDP grew at 5.6 percent in 2003, and the overall annual
inflation rate increased slightly from 4.4 percent in June 2003 to 6.4 percent in
May 2004. t h e increase in the inflation rate resulted from pressure on food
prices and the sharp increase in oil prices. The increase in prices was moderated
by imports of cereals and other foods. Gross official reserves of the Bank of
Tanzania at end March 2004, reached USD 1,973.2 million, staying well above
projections OF imports of goods and services by 1JSD 39.5 million.           Given
Tanzania's improved external position, the country is moving towards an exit
from the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, hence a new low access three-
year arrangement at 10 percent of quota was approved by the IMF in July 2003.
The first review of the arrangement was concluded successfully in February
2004, while the second review is due for conclusion in July 2004. Government
continues its efforts to maintain progress in macroeconomic and financial stability
in order that the above achievements can be translated to tangible results in
Tanzania's overarching goal of poverty reduction.


B.     TANZANIA          POVERTY         REDUCTION          STRATEGY         AND
        I MPLEIMENTATION

3.     Tanzania remains committed to the goal of eradicating abject poverty set
out in the Development Vision 2025, the framework for which is articulated in
the National Poverty Eradication Strategy (NPES - 1997), the Poverty Reduction
Strategy 2000 (PRS), and the Zanzibar Poverty Reduction Plan (2002). The PRS
 Progress Reports including updated data from the Poverty Monitoring System are
the main tool For evaluating progress in this effort and for guiding policy reform.
The third and final Progress Report under the first PRS was published in January
 2004. We have embarked on a comprehensive review of the Poverty Reduction
 Strategy through broad stakeholder consultations, including at grass roots levels.
The process will be completed within 2004, and will establish revised areas of
 focus that have potential tangible links to poverty reduction and pro-poor
 growth.

 C.     BUDGET SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE FOR, THE GOVERNMENT'S
        OWN REFORM PROCESSES

 4.     Budget support continues to be the preferred and main instrument to
 channel aid flows in support of implementation of the PFG, primarily as it
 strengthens the Government's own systems and reform processes and reduces
 transaction costs related to aid management. I n addition to the IDA, the current
 budget support facility continues to be supported by Denmark, Finland, Ireland,
 the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Canada, the United Kingdom,




                                     65

Germany, Japan, the European Union and the African Development Bank. The
common Policy Assessment Framework (PAF) matrix currently used by all
participating development partners' to assess Government's progress remains
linked to the objectives in the PRS.           The Government would favour further
harmonisation of the budget support facility given the upcoming review of the
PRS and formulation of monitorable actions, by shifting the focus of the PAF
matrix to the action plan contained in the updated PRS itself.


11.       REFORM PROGRAMME UNDERTHE PAF 2003/04                         -2004/05

A.        IMPRCWEDINVESTMENTAND BUSINESSENVIRONMENT

5.        Several reforms have continued to take place in the area of private sector
development.          The promotion of an attractive ijnd supportive business
environment, which also encourages members of the informal economy to
establish and run small and medium sized enterprises, is seen as a key to long-
term growth, on top of boosting employment and income generation. The SME
policy was launched in August 2003 and some financing is provided in the
2003/04 and 2004/05 budgets, Implementation is currently underway, through
two sets of measures including: working with UNIDO support to develop a
document on "Implementation Programmes"; and working with ILO on the
aspect of gender mainstreaming into the "Implementation Programmes". The
objectives of these Programmesare:
      a. To improve national performance in the agro industry by improving
          capacity in policy and governance, with specific focus on strengthening
          national policy objectives;
      b. To improve industrial institutions and support systems, with focus on
          enhancing support to entrepreneurs and SMEs, enhancing technology
          diffusion as well as quality and standards;
      c. To promote global linkages in trade and investment.

 The Government has also developed guidelines and procedures for the SME
 Credit Guarantee Scheme, and will ensure continued financing for this sector
 through provision of security in the budget. To streamline the operation of the
 various guarantee schemes already established, the Government has also sought
 advice from the Bank, the IMF and UNIDO.

 6.        Preparation of the Private Sector Developmerit (PSD) Strategy which
 mainstreams Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) development is currently

   Except the African DevelopmentBank which to date has used separate performanceassessment
  criteria.




                                        66

underway. The Government expects to formulate and approve the strategy in
consultation with stakeholders by November 2004.

7.     Followiiig the approval of the Business Environment Strengthening for
Tanzania (BEST) programme in July 2003, a Better Regulation Unit has been
established by the coordinating Government institution, the President's Office -
Planning and Privatisation. The Unit will serve as a supportive unit for the
monitoring of implementation of the BEST programme. It is resourced and
operational and the process of recruiting a CEO, expected to be in post from July
2004, is at an advanced stage.


8.     Reform in property rights has also been seen as crucial to private sector
development, Hence the Government committed to the following PRSC 2 prior
action:        I
       Drafted amendments to the Land Act and presented them to
       Parliament.
This has been completed as the Land (Amendment) Act 2003 was first read in
Parliament in November 2003 and was approved in February 2004. Following
the approval, it is expected that individuals and businesses will now be able to
use land as collateral, hence encouragingcapital flows and investment.


9.     Recognisingthe importance of flexibility in the labour market and the need
to reduce constraints on business operations, the Government is undertaking a
review of the labour legislation in two phases. The Government committed to
completion of ,thefirst phase as a PRSC 2 prior action a!; follows:


       PhaseI[legislation (Employment Relations, Collective Labour
       Relations, Dispute resolutions, and Labour Market Institutions)
       presentedto Parliament.


This was achieved in November 2003 and the legislation has been approved in
April 2004. Preparation for Phase I1 of the reform, which includes Occupational
Safety and Health, Worker's Compensation/Social Security, and Employment
 Promotion), is now underway. The task force governing this reform process will
ensure that sufficient technical work is carried out in order to guide the
 preparation. I




                                   67

10.    Reform of the business licensing system has been carried out with the aim
of reducing the cost of establishment and running of businesses. Two reviews of
the current licensing system and its implications were carried out (including:
Revenue Implications of Business Licensing and R.egu1atot-y Implications of
Business Licensing) in order to inform the policy reform. The objective is to
respond to the demand for a system that is transparent and efficient rather than
being focused on revenue generation and control. On this basis, a PRSC 2 prior
action was agreed as follows:

        Reviewed the business licensing system (after consultation with
        stakehiolders, prepared a position paper on business licensing
        reforms, and submitted to Parliament amendments to the
        BusinessLicensingAct, 1972, introducingreforms of the business
        licensingsystem.

This had been delayed mainly due to the need to build stakeholder consensus
and support given that the new system has revenue losing implications.
However, the government has taken measures through Finance bill, 2004 that
have least fiscal implication. From July 2004, license fees will be abolished for
small businesfjes, health service delivery organisations and those regulated by
other laws, and applicable only upon establishment rather than on an annual
 basis, in order to reduce costs for businesses. Following approval of the proposal
 by the government in July, 2004, it is expected that further implementation of
the proposed business registration system will be carried out through a phased
 approach, including a pilot phase that is necessary to develop the training
 manuals and information necessary for a successful shift from licensing to
 registration. ,


 11. As part of the BEST programme's Commercial Oispute Resolution (CDR)
 component, the Government is making efforts to enhance access to commercial
 courts by SMEs. Work is being carried out to develop detailed work plans for
 priority issues under the CDR component, which will form the basis for
 redesigning the civil procedure code.      At the same time, Government will
 continue consulting stakeholders on the best ways for dealing with the two main
 challenges envisaged in this process: the possibility of separating the commercial
 component from the entire CDR component, and integration of the civil
 procedurecode reform into the legal reform process.




                                     68

B.     AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT

12.    The PRS identifies agriculture as a priority sector due to its role as a lead
sector in the economy and its strong contribution to poverty reduction. In order
to increase agricultural trade in the medium term, the Government has started a
review process of the roles and funding arrangements of Crop Boards in order to
limit their functions to regulation and service. The Ministry of Agriculture and
Food Security (MAFS) and the Ministry of Cooperatives and Marketing (MCM), in
cooperation with the World Bank and the EU, are conducting Crop Boards studies
on the rationalisation of roles, functions and management and organisational
capacities, as well as the financing of Crop Boards. The review aims to update
and empower the Boards so that they live up to stakeholders' expectations under
the current market economy. The review has been conducted in phases,
beginning in September 2003. The first phase began `with the review of Coffee,
Cotton and Tea Boards. The review for Cotton and Coffee is almost complete
and recommendqtions of the reviews have been made awaiting the stakeholders'
workshop which will be held in August or September 2004.                        Draft
recommendations to be discussed on the design of regulations of cotton and
coffee board involvement include the following:

           a. For the coffee industry: removing controls on the scope of activities
              of various stakeholders, particularly to permit vertical integration;
              using compulsory auction to facilitate credit recovery; devoting
              greater efforts to institution building, particularly enabling producer
              organisation to make use of auction; and working with the private
              sector to promote quality coffee in increasingly competitive markets,
              particularly promoting options for branding and appellations.
           b. For the cotton industry: developing effective arrangements for seed
              rriultiplication and developing a viable agenda for research;
              involving the private sector and stakeholders in the management of
              input delivery systems; and offering incentives for improving quality
              and possibly introducing regulations that may facilitate coordination.

The data analysis for the Cashewnut and Tea Boards study is underway. Phase
 two of the review has begun with the institutional mapping for tobacco, sugar,
 pyrethrum and sisal industries. Analysis of the data will be conducted. In the
 coming year, the Government expects to build on the results of the Crop Boards
 review by preparing a strategy to reform two Crop Boards, consistent with the
 ASDS.




                                    69

13.    Following the completion of the Agricultural Sector Development
Programme (ASDP) framework and process document in December 2002,
monitoring benchmarks for assessing the effectiveness of coordination
coordination and monitoring benchmarks which have been developedThe
mechanisms for ASDP implementation have been prepared.                          key
                                                                           include:
effective functioning of various coordination fora; timely reporting and
monitoring of the sector in accordance with the ASDP monitoring and evaluation
framework; and ensuring an increasing share of Agricultural Sector Line
Ministries' (ASLMs) budgets and actual expendituresgo to ASDP priorities. In the
coming year, the Government will increase the share of ASLMs budget going to
ASDP priorities. Other efforts to improve coordination include the establishment
of the Inter-Ministerial Coordinating Committee (ICC), the Food and Agricultural
Sector Workirig Group (FASWOG) and the National Steering Committee, which
are chaired by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food
Security. The monitoring and evaluation officer had been recruited and ASDP
Program officers in each of the Agricultural Sector Lead Ministries have been
appointed.     ,
14.     In February 2003, the Parliament approved amendments to the law for
establishing the legal, regulatory and supervisory framework for micro-finance
institutions in order to improve access to essential agricultural and rural financial
services. Related regulations have been prepared and reviewed by a Steering
Committee.       Following Government approval, during 2004/05 the Bank of
Tanzania will' put in place the regulatory and Supervisory framework for
microfinance institutions. During 2003/04, the Government has initiated a
process to introduce, by June 2004, a more diverse range of products available
to borrowers by putting in place an enabling environment for the provision of
 long-term finance to the productivesector.

 15.     The Government remains committed to improving tenure security in order
 to promote rural development. While there have been delays in preparing a
 prioritised strategic plan and a corresponding program to strengthen the
 administrative capacity for implementation of the Land Act and the Village Land
 Act, due to funding delays, work is underway to complete this reform.

 16.     Market accessibility is    an important component of            agricultural
 development. Development of rural roads is therefore part of the Government's
 reform programme, as in the PRS.         An element of the reform includes a
 programme to strengthen institutional arrangements for district road
 maintenance and rehabilitation, which is currently being developed through a
 capacity building task team. Government is also aiming to put in place a Road
 Act by November 2004 in order to ensure clearly defined institutional




                                    70

responsibilities. This will allow the development of modalities for strengthening
capacity at district level, as well as indicatorsfor monitoring performance.

C.     POVERTYMONITORING AND EVALUATION

17.    The third annual PRS Progress Report was published in January 2004,
including results from Tanzania's second Poverty and Human Development
Report (PHDR). The report was discussed by stakeholders during the Poverty
Policy Week, held in November 2003.             Newly researched areas that were
included in the PHDR include urban poverty, vulnerability and the geographic
distribution of poverty, which are important in informing Government's policy on
poverty reduction.      Sustained economic growth remains the underpinning
condition for better implementation of the PRS, particularly ensuring that the
benefits from growth are realised for the poor in rural areas where the majority
of the population live. Some of the main findings in the third PRS Progress
Report are that constraints facing agriculture require actions with regard to
financing mechanisms, investment and provision of support services; regional
diversity and inequality should be addressed through appropriate budgetary
allocation mechanisms as well as provision of an enabling environment for
domestic and foreign investment; and for sectors like roads, more effective
coordination pachinery between the central and local governments in the
maintenance of roads needs to be developed with clearly assigned
responsibilitied. Sectors like education need a greater focus on quality and
public-private partnership in provision of post-basic education and in health,
provision of services to the rural population as well as HIV/AIDS need greater
focus. Furtheirmore, data on cross-cutting issues such as vulnerable groups of
society and the environment need to be further developed.

 18.   Continued poverty monitoring and data collectioriand analysis is important
in guiding future policies. The Government therefore recognises the need to
support this function. The following PRSC 2 prior action has been successfully
completed during the past year:

       Progress in strengthening and sustaining capacity of the VPO
       secretariat to support and monitor implementation of the PRS
       according to an updated action plan to be approved by
       Government.

 The Action Pla for BuildingCapacity in Support of the RRS was presented to the
 PRS Technical Committee in August 2003. A Medium Term Strategic Plan 2004-
                r
 2007 for VPO has been approved and finalised in February 2004. It includes
 enabling access of staff to the Selected Accelerated Salary Enhancement(SASE)




                                        71

scheme in order to provide the minimum incentive package necessary for
sustainability of the growing capacity. In addition, a full-time Poverty Monitoring
Officer has been recruited in the PRS/Poverty Monitoring System (PMS)
Secretariat and the Poverty Monitoring Advisor has been replaced. A training
programme for members of the Poverty Monitoring Secretariat and for members
of the PRS Technical Committee has been initiated.        IT systems including the
local area network (IAN) have been upgraded in order to facilitate improved
organisation of poverty data and information. Outsourcing is also used to cover
internal human capacity gaps.

19.    Collecting, collating and analysing administrative data is critical in poverty
monitoring.The President's Office-RegionalAdministration and Local Government
(PO-RALG)     i!; therefore an important institution for data management,
particularly the Routine Data System (RDS). The Government has successfully
completed the following related PRSC 2 prior action:

       Progressin strengthening and sustaining capacity of PO-RALG for
       collecting, collating and analysing administrative data according
       to an updated action planto be approved by government.

Achievements in this area include recruitment of a senior programme officer to
lead the MIS unit; assignment of two senior staff permanently to the RDS
technical working group; completion of a report on MIS strategy for PO-RALG
which is now operational; development of a database on the Local Government
Authorities' (LGAs) Social Economic Profile; installation of a local area network
and registration of the domain to facilitate e-comrnunication with Regional
Secretariats and LGAs; and purchase of IT equipment for Regional Secretariats
for storing and managing data. In addition, a Medium'Term Strategic Plan 2004-
 2007 has beer1prepared which includes plans to establish a Monitoring Unit.

 20.   The Government is conscious of the need to integrate the international
 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) into Tanzania`s Poverty Monitoring
 framework, which is part of the PRS action plan. This work began with the
 revision of the PRS indicators, leading to an increase of indicatorsfrom 39 to 60.
 The PHDR 2003 and the third PRS Progress Report have tracked progress using
 the revised set of indicatorswhich include progress towards the MDGs.

 D.     MACROECONOMICSTABILITY

 21.   The Government will continue to maintain arid build on the positive
 developments in macroeconomicstability. GDP growth in 2004 is projectedat 6.3
 percent and at 6.5 percent in 2005, expected to be driven by a revival in the




                                     72

agricultural sector following the drought, as well as in manufactured products
and exports. The short term increase in inflation that resulted from drought and
related food shortages is expected to be reversed to 4 percentduring 2004/05 as
per earlier projections. This remains our medium term target in order to be
consistent with our main trading partners and those with whom we compete in
exports. Maintaining fiscal and debt sustainability continue to be the key areas
of focus for macroeconomic reform. Monitoring of the macroeconomic framework
is currently under the IMF Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) programme.
The first review of the Low Access PRGF was successfully completed by the IMF
Board in February 2004, while the second is due for completion in July 2004.

i ) Debt Sustainability

22,    Public domestic debt developments have been broadly on track. Domestic
debt market developments continued to be favourable with the yield curve which
spans from 35-day Treasury bills to 10-year Treasury bonds, continuing to serve
as a reference rate for lending and deposit rates in the market. The Government
continues with its endeavour to convert unsecuritised debt into marketable
securities and to streamline the domestic debt maturity profile. With a view to
strengthening the legal and institutional framework underpinning debt
contraction, the Government Loans, Guarantees and Grants (Amendment) Act
 2003, consolidating such powers in the Minister for Finance, became effective on
 1 July 2003.    A new institutional structure has also been put in place to
 implement the National Debt Strategy and the Act. In this regard, there have
 been regular meetings of the National Debt Management Committee and
 publicationof quarterly debt reports.

 23.   In light of a large stock of parastatal debt, the Government has prepared
 an inventory of parastatal debt contingent liabilities and agreed on a strategy for
 monitoring their migration to actual debt. In addition, the Government has
 completed the following PRSC 2 prior action in June 2003:

        Prepared     annual borrowing and              repayment     plan    (both
       concessional and non-concessionalloans), inclusive of borrowing
        limits, and presented it to Parliament as part of the annual
        budget.

 24.    Regarding external debt, the Government has concluded bilateral
 agreements with all Paris Club VI1 creditors (except Brazil and some Japanese
 government agencies, with which negotiations are continuing). The Government
 has continued its efforts to negotiate with Non-Paris Club creditors for debt relief
 on terms comparable to those under the Enhanced HIPC framework. Recently,




                                     73

Bulgaria has joined Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in providing relief under the HIPC
framework, and some debt relief dialogue has been initiated with India, Iran, and
the Abu Dhahi Fund. The Government appreciates any assistance that the World
Bank can provide in encouraging participation of the Non-Paris Club in the debt
relief initiative.

ii) Fiscal Policyand Budgetary Reform

25.     The Government has achieved encouraging results in its revenue
mobilisation effort in order to improve revenue collections and hence sustain
financing of the PRS.       Government revenue remained consistently above
estimates during fiscal year 2002/03, at 12.8 percent of GDP, and while
estimated to be 13.3 percent of GDP in 2003/04, it has also remained above
estimates to date during this fiscal year. The revenue yield is projected to rise to
13.8 percent of GDP in 2004/05.

26.     The results to date have been aided by recent fiscal reforms. The
Government introduced new revenue measures in 2003/04 aimed at curbing tax
evasion and reducing distortions, such as: administrative measures to reduce
smuggling and tax evasion on petroleum products; expansion of the Treasury
Voucher system to include religious NGOs, on top of ncm-religious NGOs and civil
 servants; removal of impediments in the fisheries sub-sedor and problems of
smuggling of fish by reducing the withholding tax on sale of fish; and eliminating
 nuisance taxes, particularly at the local government level, in order to encourage
 development activities, which Government committed to as a PRSC 2 prior
 action:          I


        Local government taxes and levies rationalised.

 Only those levies and fees which can be collected efficiently without causing
 economic disbxtions and undermining the national policy of reducing poverty
 have been retained. In addition, to further remove revenue leakages, the
 Government will revoke all government notices granting tax exemptions issued
 prior to 1997, and incorporatethe remainingexemptions in the relevant tax laws.
 Government has engaged development partners on this reform, and intends to
 continue disciission with them on the possibilities for improving current
 exemption practices surrounding donor funded projects.

 27.    Further developments in tax administration include the adoption of the
 second Corporate Plan for 2003/04         - 2007/08 for the Tanzania Revenue
 Administration (TRA) in June 2003 and operational since 1July 2003. The plan
 is the driving force behind the objective of ensuring that TRA becomes an




                                    74

efficient and effective modern tax administration supportive of economic growth,
and which promotes voluntary tax compliance by providing high quality, fair
customer seniice.

28.    The Government is reviewing the Export Processing Zones (EPZs)
legislation to limit the scope of exemptions. Amendments to the EPZ Regulations
are being prepared, and will be undertaken after a reasonable period of time to
avoid discouraging the initial inflow of EPZ operators. ,4 main provision will be to
bind EPZs sales into the domestic market to a maximum of 30 percent of
turnover. Implementation of the EPZs, which are targeted exclusively to
exporting firms with proven markets, is expected to support the development of
manufactured exports. A protocol for establishing an East African Community
(EAC) Customs Union was signed in March 2004 with agreement on a three tariff
bands common external tariff (0,lO and 25 percent) i3nd on amendment of the
EPZ (Customs) regulations to be in line with the regional code.

E.     IMPRCWEMENT I N THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DELIVERY OF PUBLIC
       SERVICES

i) Budgetformulationand execution

29.    The Government remains committed to financing and tracking the
expenditures for implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy. Hence the
following PRSC 2 prior action has been completed:
       Approved budget 2003/04 in line with PRS objectives,
       delineating budget codesfor priority sectors and items.

All PRS sectors have seen absolute increasesin resources. In view of unforeseen
developments, particularly the drought, a supplementary budget was approved
 in February 2004. Emergency expenditure items included: provision of a liquidity
 constraint enhancementto the Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO) to
 avoid a power rationing crisis; replenishment of the Strategic Grain Reserve
 (SGR) and transportation of relief food;     compensation of Local Government
 Authorities (LGAs) for the revenue lost following the abolition of nuisance taxes;
 expansion of secondary education; preparations for the permanent voters
 register for elections in fiscal year 2005/06; and procurement of a replacement
 Government aircraft. Given limited resources to finance the Supplementary
 budget, plans were made to make recurrent expenditure cuts in all expenditure
 votes, particuhrly on items such as workshops, seminars, travel allowances and
 vehicle purchases. While this initially included PRS sectors, the Government has
 reinstated the original budgets of the priority sectors in order to protect the
 sectors and priority items which are critical for implementation of the PW. This




                                     75

is due to savings made in the Consolidated Funds Services budget, particularly
lower than estimated payments made to date on foreign amortisation and
interest. The PRS sectors have seen a net increase in allocations compared to
the approved budget, mainly due to reallocations to the agricultural sector in
order to purchase food imports to replenishthe Strategic Grain Reserve.

30.     The Bcdget Guidelines for 2004/05 - 2006/07 were published in January
2004 and issued to the Ministries Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and Local
Government Authorities (LGAs). The Government has ensured further increases
ongoing PRS review will be completed during fiscal year 2004/05Givenprovide a
in resources to the priority sectors for the coming fiscal year.           that the
                                                                     and
new strategic policy framework, the Government iwill continue to use the
priorities from the original PRS as guidance on strategic resource allocations until
fiscal year 2005/06.

31.     At the local government level, the recurrent and development budgets
have been prepared using GFS classification. This is a positive move towards
 using international budgeting standards at all levels of Government. I n addition,
a formula-based recurrent expenditure transfer system has been adopted in
order to faci itate greater strategic resource allocation of intergovernmental
grants to LGA.5. For 2004/05, the formula has been used to make allocations for
the health and education sectors. Local development expenditure budgets have
 also been similarly allocated for all sectors. The formula is expected to be rolled
 out fully in 2005/06.

 32.    Budget execution in 2002/03 and the first half of 2003/04 has been
 broadly in line with estimates. The following PRSC 2 action has therefore been
 completed successfully:

        Budget execution for 2002/03 and 2003/04 (FQ 1and FQ 2), in
        line with the approved budget and with PRS priorities,
        consistently reported as per identified expenditure budget codes
        for priority sectors and in 2003/04 also by identified codes for
        priority,items.

 The quarterly Budget Execution Reports on fiscal performance continue to be
 published on the national website in order to ensure transparency on
 government operations.       For 2003/04, reports of priority item expenditure
 (recurrent and development) are provided based on actual expenditure data
 from the Integrated Financial ManagementSystem (IFMS).




                                      76

33.   The Government has completed an expenditure tracking study on
education to1 assess the accountability and efficiency of the infrastructure to
deliver funds to councils for the intended purposes. The study had been delayed
due to delays in securing a consultant, however a draft report is now available.
A tracking study on the roads sector has been completed.

34.    Budget:execution reports from Local Government Authorities are currently
being improved following the setting up of a software system for expenditure
planning and reporting at the Local Government level. The system will allow
better generation of performance reports by LGAs and their review at the centre.

35.   The Government recognises the need to maintain consistency between
different policy commitments and budgetary provisions. The Budget Guidelines,
which are the main instrument for translating policies into resource allocation,
will be improved in the next MTEF cycle through careful consideration of
recommendations from the update of the PRS, the PER sector studies, and the
PER external evaluation for 2003/04. The Guidelines will continue to be broadly
discussed by stakeholders, including development partners.


F.     IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND THE
       OVERALL INCENTIVEENVIRONMENT

36.    The Government remains committed to the Public Service Reform
Programme (PSRP) in order that public service delivery is improved and can
contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction. The reform strategy
involves attracting and retaining better qualified staff and strengthening human
resource capacity so that the sustainability of overall Government reform
programmes is ensured. This will be achieved through the Government's long-
term plan of capacity building as well as pay reform which is performance
orientated. The public service reform is thus focusing on efficient and effective
utilisation of the limited public resources to improve services. In addition to the
13 percent increase in the budget for public sector wages in 2003/04 from the
previous fiscal year, another 19 increase has been approved in the 2004/05
budget.

37.    As part of performance monitoring and evaluation, the Government is
implementing a range of performance based instruments including annual plans,
performance budgets, service delivery surveys (SDSs) and open performance
appraisals. The annual operating plans and action plans for 5 ministries and 8
executive agencies are finalized based on self-assessment and service delivery
surveys. Twenty one more plans are expected to be approved soon. Self-




                                     77

assessments have been completed for all MDAs and 34 SDSs have also been
completed. The results of the surveys are expected to be disseminated to the
public, prior to assessing client satisfaction in the future. The Government aims
at approving updated annual plans and performance budgets for all MDAs taking
into account results of service delivery surveys by March 2005.

38.    The Government recognises the importance of having in place a strong        '
result-oriented monitoring and evaluation system in assessing the performance
of the public :service.The performance monitoring system has been rolled out in
19 MDAs, and is installed and functional in 3 independent departments and 1
ministry.   Sobare has been developed and training carried out in MDAs to
ensure the quality of information generated.        The Government aims at rolling
out and ensuring the functioning of the performance monitoring system in all
MDAs by March 2005.

39.    The pay reform policy entails improving performance of the public sector
by enhancing public servants' salaries towards market rates. One key
achievement has been the observance of the PRSC 2 prior action:

        Pay enhancement for civil servants in line with the approved
        budget for FY04.

Salaries have been increased between 6 and 10 percent with the minimum wage
rising from 35,000 in 1999 to 55,000 which is up by 57 percent. Furthermore,
the Government will maintain the pay enhancement in line with the approved
budget for the next fiscal year and following re-evaluation by the Cabinet in
January 2004, the mechanism for accelerated salary enhancement has been
reinstated in four ministries (Ministry of Health, Ministry of Finance, President's
Office - Public Service Management and President's Office - Planning and
 Privatisation). Other mechanisms for enhancing salaries in the remaining MDAs
will be explored so that the medium term objective of enhanced professionalism
of the public service through improved motivation and retention of staff can be
 addressed.

 40.    Following the approval of the Public Service Ad: No.2 (ZOOZ), work is in
 progress to harmonise the Act and the Local Government Service Regulations by
 considering management of staff in the Public Service Regulation (Part X Section
 C) which stipulates the whole process of appointment of staff in LGAs. By 2005
 a study of results and action plans will be available and will indicate how the
 harmonisation of the PublicService Act and Regulationwill take place.




                                      78

G. MINIMISATION           OF      RESOURCE         LEAKAGES         AND       THE
   STRENGTHENING OF ACCOUNTABILITY

i) PublicFinancialManagement

41.   The Government has continued its efforts to secure effective and
sustainable financial management arrangements that support an equitable
delivery of public services. Such support is intended to reduce and minimise
resource leakages as well as strengthen accountability of public funds. The
agreed PRSC 2 prior action has been:


       Joint PFMRP SteeringCommittee review (I)establishmentof
                                                          the
       a man'agementstructureand (2) the detailed annual work pian
       and budgetfor the first phaseof implementation of the PFMRP.

These actions had been delayed, mostly because it took longer than anticipated
to prepare plans in some components, but notable reform progress has been
achieved in others. The programme's organisation structure has been agreed, a
Programme Manager appointed, and a ProgrammeCoordinator identified. These
will now work with Component Managers to finalise outstanding work.             The
plans for the first phase have been reviewed by the Joint PFMRP Steering
Committee in lune 2004.

42.    The review of the improved security of the IFMS system, including the
disaster recovery plan/site, is currently under implementation. An TT consultant
under the programme is currently in place, assisting and advising on the
implementation. In the short term, it is also planned to pilot changes to the
management of the payroll system by enabling at least 3 ministries to enter
payroll changes themselves.

43.    In order to improve the internal auditing functions in Government, audit
committees are in place and operational in all MDAs. Training sessions are being
conducted in order to sensitise the MDAs on the effective use of the committees.
The Internal Audit Manual has been prepared and circulated to stakeholders for
comments.      Upon finalisation, the Manual will be issued and followed with
training. A draft staffing report on the review of internal audit staffing levels and
assessment of skills and other resource requirements has also been prepared.

44,    Improvements in the National Audit Office (NAO) have included the
 equation of pay between audit and accounting staff. A review of organisational
 and staff strud:ure




                                    79

has also been completed in May 2002. Following a Performance Management
Systems exercise which was carried out in all MDAs in 2003, strategic plans with
respect to core functions of departments are being prepared. Key positions in
the NAO are soon expected to be filled. Access to IFMS and training for the NAO
has been delayed but has been addressed through the securing of funding for
the project.
                ~




45.    On procurement reform, following the Country Procurement Assessment
Report (CPAR), an action plan for the implementation of its recommendations
was prepared in July 2003, As regards the amendmerits to the Procurement Act,
the following PRSC 2 prior action was agreed to be completed:

       Prepared a draft bill amendingthe Public ProcurementAct of
       2001reflectingthe CPAR recommendations,and submitted a
       letter Fromthe Attorney Generalconfirming that said bill will be
       presentedfor parliamentaryapproval duringthe 2004 budget
       session.

Completion of this action took longer than expected due to human resource
capacity constraints experienced in the Central Tender Board in preparing the
Bill. However, progress in this area includes the establishment of the Central
Tender Board as an executive agency, appointment of the Executive Secretary to
the Board, and establishment of the Procurement Appeals Authority.            The
amendments to the Public Procurement Act, No. 3 of 2001, are now due for
consideration in the current June 2004 Parliament session. The main elements
of the procurement reforms firstly include capturing all bodies dealing with public
finance under the Act, Secondly, the amendments will involve decentralisation of
tendering activities to ministerial level in order to reduce the burden on the
central authority and to facilitate quicker procurement procedures. Thirdly, the
 reforms include establishment of a Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (an
 autonomous body of the Ministry of Finance) which would replace the current
 Central Tender Board. The Authority would perform only regulatory functions
 such as: setting standards on procurement systems; providing guidelines on
 procurement planning and methods; ensuring improvements in publicity of
 procurement, specifically advertisement of tenders; establishing systems of
 project monitoring and audit; and building procurement capacity across
 Government.

 46.    At the local government level, reforms include the issuance of the Local
 Government Regulations, 2003, following which Local Government Authority
 Tender Boards have been established in compliance with the Regulations. Hence
 the agreed PRSC 2 prior action has been completed:




                                    80

        Local Government Authority Tender Boards constituted and
        establishedunderthe new Regulations.

In addition, 21 manual to assist the implementation of the Regulations has been
prepared and training in councils carried out. The Government continues to
work on identifying legal inconsistencies between the Financial Regulations for
the central government and the Local Authorities Finance Memorandum (LAFM).
In the effort to roll out IFMS to LGAs, a central support mechanism for those
LGAs which are already implementing the Epicor software has been launched
and will soon be provided for all other LGAs.

ii) Reductionof corruption

47.      As part of a strategy to reduce resource leakages, and in line with the
Poverty Reduction Strategy, the Government continues with its effort to promote
good governance. Since the approval of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy
and Action Plan (NACSAP) 2003-2005, the Government has continued to improve
transparency in its implementation through the production and publication of
quarterly reports depicting progress in the implementation of the MDAs' anti-
corruption plms. There has been significant improvement in MDAs' reporting
and current gaps are expected to be improved on in future reports. The Good
Governance Coordination Unit (GGCU) in the President3Office has commissioned
work on including more quantitative and qualitative data in areas of monitoring
and controlling public procurement, public finance and legal and judicial
processing. This data is expected to provide guidance for future policy reform.

48.     Other reforms include the revision of the code of conduct for public
servants. The revision took place in consultation with stakeholders and has been
published. This has been carried out to ensure that complaints from the public
are adequately addressed. The human and financial resources capacity to
coordinate and implement the NACSAP is being addressed under the Public
Service Reform Programme. Under this, the role of the GGCU is expected to be
expanded and strengthened. Proposals for new roles and structures, including
staffing are expected to be completed by June 2004 and the restructured unit is
 expected to be completed by August 2004. In order to improve LGAs' fight
 against corruption, the Government has ensured that anti-corruption action plans
 for all LGAs are included in the budget for fiscal year 2004/05. While there have
 been delays in achieving this to date, it has been due to the difference in fiscal
 years between central and local governments. Following the harmonisation of
 fiscal years in June 2003, local governments will complete a six-month budget




                                   81

period from Ianuaty to June 2004. The provisionof funding will be facilitated by
the harmonisationof the fiscal years from 2004/05.

iii) Improvements indevelopmentaid management

49.    Through the Tanzania Assistance Strategy (TAS) which was launched in
June 2002, the Government aims at minimising the transactions costs of delivery
and utilisatiori of external assistance. Substantialachievements have been made
in monitoring implementation, as the first annual TAS implementation report for
fiscal year 2002/03 has been issued. The report provides a clear overview of
progress made to date by the Government and the local Development Assistance
Community (DAC) in implementing the TAS priorities according to an action plan.
It also highlights some of the remaining challenges related to achieving the
principlesana objectives of "best practices" in aid coordination and efforts.

50.     Development aid management includes better integration of projections of
external rescurce flows into the budget.         This has been facilitated by a
comprehensive database on external aid flows established in the Ministry of
Finance. The challenge remains to better integrate project funds that are
disbursed directly to projects rather than through the Government's Exchequer
System, into the systems and to better capture their expenditure.             The
Government will continue in its efforts to improve the consolidation and
integration of flows in order to provide better data for the resource envelope of
the Government's budget. The Government will also continue to work on better
 reporting of disbursements to LGAs so that a comprehensive record of all aid
 flows is made,

 H ENVIRONMENTALSUSTAINABILITY
   .
 51.    The underlying thrust of the objectives as laid out in the Vision 2025
 (1999) is to attain sustainable development of the country's people. The
 Government therefore recognises that there are important implications for
 environmental policy, and that natural resource management is also part of the
 Rural Development Strategy (2001) and the ASDP (2002).              The national
 Environmental Action Plan (1994) and the National Environmental Policy (NEP)
 (1997) have initiated the mainstreaming of environmental concerns into
 Government policiesand processessuch as the PRS.

 52.    In order to provide Government with a framework with which to address
 environmental issues, a framework legislation on environmental management
 has been approved by Cabinet and will be presented to Parliament. Preparation




                                      82

of an action plan for implementation of the new institutional framework has also
begun in February 2004.

53.   A study on the use of strategic environmental assessments and training
programmes has been completed, and in order to promote awareness, staff in
the Vice President's Office are working within environmental units in sectoral
agencies by assisting to develop capacity for mainstreaming the environmental
assessmentprocess.

54.    In order to mainstream environmental issues into Government processes,
it was seen as important to mainstream environment by representation of
environmental experts in the technical working groups of the poverty monitoring
system. In March 2004, the Government launched a study on proposals for an
improved set of poverty-environment indicators to be included in the national
Poverty Monitoring System.      Furthermore, as an input into the budgeting
process, a PER study on environment and natural resources has been completed.

$5.    In the coming year, the Government will be committed to finalise the
regulations on environmental assessments as well as guidelines for (a)
integrating environmental assessments into sectoral and district planning
processes, (ti) economic instruments, and (c) environmental standards for
monitoring arid compliance. Implementation of priority activities in the new
institutional framework will begin in fiscal year 2004/05.       Government will
arrange for training on environmental assessment within sectors and districts
and carry out pilot Strategic environmental assessments in priority areas.
Implementaticm of the action plan for building capacity within the VPO for
poverty-environment monitoring will be initiated and ,the mainstreaming of the
poverty-environment indicators within the PMS will be completed.            The
Government remains committed to encouraging further mainstreaming of
environment as a cross-cutting issue into the PER process.


CONCLUSION


 56.   The Government remains committed to the goal of reducing poverty as
 encompassed in both the current Poverty Reduction Strategy and the upcoming
 update of the PRS as will be determined by all stakeholders in Tanzania. There
 have been achievements in reachingthe PRSC 2 prior actions. The agreed policy
 actions laid out for the coming year in the PRBS/PRSC Performance Assessment
 Framework will continue to guide Government in policy reforms that complement
 Tanzania's PFG objectives. The Government's efforts to increase own resources




                                   83

to support our reform path, are improving and evidenced in the continuous
better than projected performance of domestic revenue collections in recent
years and plans for continued tax policy and administration reforms in the
2004/05 budget. These are encouraging signs of achieving this long term goal.
In the meantime, the Government strongly appreciates IDA'S budget support
through the second PRSC tranche. This budget support is crucial in order to
facilitate the expenditures required in those sectors and items that are deemed
to have the strongest links to poverty reduction.

                                   1.      Main principles
The Government andthe donors considerthe PartnershipFramework16(PF) for budget support" as
the common instrument of support to the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) through the
Government's budget. The PF is an integralpart of the Government of Tanzania's public sector
budgeting and priority setting process and the PRS. The budget will be usedas a tool to reachthe
PRS objectives, and priority sectors as defined in the PRS will be protected in the budget. The
agreed priority allocations as well as indicators of achievements will continue to be monitored
through joint processes including the Public Expenditure Review (PER) and PRS process and
reviews as detailed in this PF. These joint processes will involve the Government and the PF
donors.
This PF Memorandum describes the common framework for the development grant and loan
agreements to fund poverty-oriented programme budget support to Tanzania. Together with the
attached Technical Annexes, it replaces the Memorandum of Understanding for the Poverty
Reduction Budget Support (PRBS) signed on 27' November 2001 and the Technical Note o f
October 2001. This PerformanceFramework Memorandumhas beenreviewed and agreedby the
Government and the PF donors during the joint Annual Review/pre-appraisalof general budget
support carriedout inNovember2002.
The PF Memorandumwill be supplementedby bilateralagreementsbetweeneach individualdonor
and the Government of Tanzania, and by a PRSC programme document and related legal
documents of the World Bank. The bilateralagreements will have the choice to focus on all or a
subset of the actions and targets,in the list of policy actions and targetsjointly agreed on in the
PAF. It is understoodby the parties that the contents in the individualfunding agreements take
legal precedenceover this Partnership Framework Memorandum. However, it is the intentionof
the parties to establish funding agreements that are compatible with the provisions of this
PartnershipFrameworkMemorandum.
The intention is to manage existing and future budgetary support from donors and financing
institutionsthroughthe PF facility. The objectives are to minimizetransactioncosts, to harmonize
performancebenchmarksanddialoguebetweenthe partiesandto link fundingcommitments by the
donors to achievement o f targets set. The Partnership Framework and the funding Facility is
therefore open for contributionfrom and participationby all donors and financial institutionsthat
are providingor consideringprovidingsuchbudgetary support.
The PF aims at increasing the predictability of donor flows. This will benefit overall economic
developments and the implementation and efficiency of programmes in priority sectors. The PF
facility will provide general budget support co-ordinated among the participating donors and
operated according to established government procedures and reportingrequirements agreed with
the partners.
                                     2.       Justification
Tanzania has implementedan economic reformprogramme that has shown a number of positive
results. Significant progress has beenmade in macroeconomic stabilisationand structuralreform
of the economy. Inflationhas stabilised below 5 percent and signs are that many of the elements
requiredfor a private sector ledgrowthare inplace.
In the first years of the reform programme, growth rates in the economy were slow to pick up,
however, and this led to lack of progress in poverty reduction and slow development of the

framework.

economic base neededto support the public sector. Growth rates inthe economy have improved in
recent years, but poverty is still prevalent.     It has been estimated that about one third of the
population cannot afford basic needs for livelihood. As many as 18 percent are living in abject
poverty, that is, in a situation where the income is insufficient to buy food to cover minimum
nutritional needs. Tanzania needs several years o f high per capita growth rates to reduce poverty
levels significantly.
Surveys o f poverty and living conditions in Tanzania show that there are important challenges in
the priority sectors that are detailed inthe PRS. These priority sectors (and priority items) may be
subject to change during the ongoing process o f reviewing and updating the PRS, but they
currently include: health (primary); education (basic); water; roads (rural); agriculture (extension
services); justice and HTV/ AIDS. There is furthermore a serious concern about the possibility of
large segments o f the population being left out o f the economic growth and income generation
process. In recognition o f the enormous challenge in combating poverty the Government o f the
United Republic o f Tanzania has refocused priorities towards social sectors and primary services
within them. Long-term targets for poverty reduction were articulated in the Vision 2025 and
elaborated further inNational Poverty Eradication Strategy (NPES) adopted by the Government in
November 1997. The Tanzania Assistance Strategy (TAS), which expresses the modalities and
coordination requirements for donor support and the PRS focus on how to combat poverty in an
effective manner, both in terms o f more effective use o f public resources and in improving the
possibilities for economic growth, employment creation and income generation.
Domestic revenue to the public sector inTanzania was 12,2 percent o f GDP inthe 2001/02 budget
year. The fiscal deficit before grants was 6,6 percent. In addition to the reforms carried out in tax
policy and administration, the Government recognizes that more measures are needed to enhance
domestic resource mobilization. However, a realistic assessment is that the tax base, which is the
monetized, non-governmental part o f the economy, needs to grow faster than overall GDP for a
number o f years to yield a significantly higher tax/GDP ratio. While efforts to increase revenue
mobilisation are being implemented, the poverty reduction programme is inneed o f external grants
or other concessional financing. Direct budget support provides a sustainable route to manage the
transition from aid dependency. It strengthens national ownership o f the development process as
well as Government institutions, and it facilitates the implementation o f democratically selected
sector strategies for growth and poverty reduction.
                   3.       The PerformanceAssessment Framework
The PF is linked to a common set o f policy and poverty reduction goals. These goals are agreed
between the Government of Tanzania and the participating donors and shall be based on the goals
o f the PRS. The goals, including the policies to reachthem and the indicators to monitor them, are
described in a Performance Assessment Framework (PAF)18. It is the intention o f the parties to
harmonize the PRS action plan and the PAF completely withinthree years.
The PAF is a results-oriented matrix o f agreed actions and indicators including timeframe for
reaching targets. The PAF sets out agreed key short and medium term actions to reduce poverty
such as macroeconomic stability and performance improvements inthe public sector together with
specific annual measures to be taken by the Government to achieve the PRS targets. The indicators
for the macroeconomic targets o f the PAF will be those elaborated in the IMF programme
framework discussions. Dialogue on these issues with a wider groups o f stakeholders will be
handled inthe appropriate common forum e.g. the PER macroeconomic group. The PF parties will
avoid introducing new targets, indicators or measures that are outside the PAF and the IMF
programme macroeconomic framework.



  The PAF will form apart ofthe loanagreementsunderthe PRSCprogramme with the World Bank and list
the actions and prior actions under that programme.


                                                 123

The parties will use the PAF and PRS Review process as a tool for dialogue on PRS
implementation and progress on PRS implementation and PAF actions will help to determine
appropriate levels of future funding for the General Budget. Through a continuous process, it will
allow the Government and the Donors to assess progress towards agreed medium term objectives
and the implementation status of specific measures. The PAF will be updated annually as part of
the Annual Reviewprocess.
                                    4.      ReviewProcess
The review process for PF will be common for all participating donors and based on the review
process for the PRS. The Government of Tanzania and the donors participating will maintain a
close dialogue regarding the PF. The parties shall meet on an agreed schedule to review
implementation and the attainment of objectives (see Appendix). The PAF matrix and PRS
Progress Report will form the basis for discussions on progress between PF donors and the
Government.
The timing of review meetings through the year will be decided in such a way that the budget
process is facilitated and that the PRSC requirements and the bilateral donors' need for inputs to
their decision-makingprocesses are accommodated. The table inthe Appendix lists the meetings
and actionsneeded.
Assessment of performance will be based on progress towards targets and measures identified
through the PRS and expressed inthe PAF matrix. Joint reviews of the PF Facility will be carried
out by Governmentand all participatingcontributors. These reviews will use information gathered
through ongoing processesto ensure that they do not set up a parallel review process. The review
processesshouldendeavour to minimize additional technical work. However, shouldthe quality of
regular information prove not to be satisfactory, the PF donors andthe Governmentwill agree on a
timeframe and on the possible support donors could offer to build the capacity neededto provide
this information.
The review processeswill draw together summary reports reviewing progress against relevantPAF
and PRS targets. Progress against the list of indicatorsof social well-being, derivedfrom the PRS
and attachedto the PAF matrix, shouldbe coveredinthe context of the PRS and discussed as part
of the Annual Review. The aimwill beto fully harmonisethe Annual ReviewReportwiththe PRS
progress report over time. This will ultimately depend on progress with harmonisationof the PAF
and PRS Action Plan.
At least two weeks prior to the reviews, the Government of Tanzania shall provide the following
informationto the donors:

    0    For each of the review meetings, statements showing the budget and the budget execution
         figures including tax revenues and presentationof priority expenditures as defined in the
         PRS progressreports;

    0    For the Annual Review, PRS progress report and a progress report on implementation of
        PAF actions;

    0    For the Mid-term and Annual Review, a statement of inflows and outflows from the PF
         accounts includinga statement of internalaudit; and

    0   As soon as available, the AnnualAudit Reportpreparedby the National Audit Office.
              5.       Responsibilitiesof the Government of Tanzania
The donor support towards the PF is based upon the understanding that the Government of
Tanzania will:

    0    Implement the key actions identified within the PAF and through the on-going PRS



                                               124

        Implementthe overalleconomic programme aimedat stabilisationand increasedeconomic
        growth as has been described in the context of the IMF programme macroeconomic
        framework.

    0   Ensure that total expenditures and sector allocations effectively reflect the poverty
        reductioncommitment and that extra budgetary expenditure is brought into the budget so
        that budgetcomprehensivenessis ensured; and

    0   Monitor and report on the effective implementation o f the budget and on progress in
        achievingPRSandPAFtargets.
                          6.      Responsibilitiesofthe donors
The development partners are committed to working in Partnership with the Government of
Tanzania and facilitating implementation of the PRS boththrough financing governed by this PF
and complementary support provided through development partners' wider development
cooperation programmes. To the best extent possible within existingadministrative and statutory
provisions including individual bilateral funding agreements with Tanzania, which ultimately
governdecisions ondisbursementsandcommitments, the donors committhemselves to:

    0   provide informationon future disbursements in advance of the budget year in a common
        financialframework for PF;

    0   disburse all of the commitments made within the Tanzanian budget year and attempt,
        where possible, to front loadtheir disbursements withinthe first quarter;

    0   as a general rule, change funding only for the next budget year by reference to the
        implementationof measuresinthe PAF, the PRSandIMF assessments of macroeconomic
        performance;and

    0   endeavour to co-ordinate their disbursements in line with the Government's budgetary
        requirementsas presentedby the Government.
The donors will endeavour to follow the principlesenshrinedin the PF and assess performanceon
the basis ofthe PAF andPRSprogressreport. Referenceto these key processesshouldbe included
in individualbilateralfunding agreements to the maximum extent. These agreements will mainly
provide further details on the obligations of both parties and the procedures for disbursing funds
together with any standard conditions for development cooperation that the individualdonor may
have.The parties agree to keepsuchgeneralconditions to a minimum.
                                       7.      Appendix
Dates for review meetings will be determined by taking into account the preparation of the
Tanzanianbudget andby the presentationofthe annual PRS report. The budgetyear is from 1stof
July to 30thofJune.
The Annual Review process of updating the PAF targets will involve focused technical working

                                  TechnicalArrangements
The technical arrangements for the bilateral donors and the European Commission are described
below:
        All donor contributions to the PRBS foreign exchange account and interest accrued, shall
        be usedto provide budget support to the Government o f Tanzania;
        The facility shall be managed by the Ministryo f Finance;
        The interest-bearing PRBS forex account shall be monitored by the Bank o f Tanzania on
        the authority o fthe Ministryo fFinance, Accountant General's Department;
        The donors shall provide updates at the mid-term and annual review meetings regarding
        disbursementsfor the PRBS facility (amounts and timing);
        The Permanent Secretary, Ministryo f Finance shall issue payment instructions to the BOT
        authorising the transfer from the PRBS account to the consolidated account;
        The Ministry o f Finance, Policy Analysis Department will co-ordinate the operations,
        advising donors when the balance inthe PRBS account is less than anticipated;
        Deposits inthe PRBS forex account, and transfers to the consolidated fund, will be subject
        to an annual external audit financed by Government o f Tanzania. (See Audit section below
        for further details);

        The Ministryo f Finance and Bank o f Tanzania shall keep detailed records inrespect o f the
        PRBS foreign exchange account as follows:
             9 Disbursements made bydonors;
             9 Balances inthe account atthe endofevery quarter;
             9 Withdrawalofthe PRBS account for payment intothe Consolidated Account.
                                    Audit Arrangements

The following audit arrangements shall be established:

   1) The National Audit Office (NAO) carries out an independent annual external audit o f the
        Government Accounts. The annual audit report by the NAO shall be presented to PRBS
        donors as soon as it becomes available;

        Given the current considerable time lag between the end o f the fiscal year and the
        availability o f the annual NAO audit report for that fiscal year, a more timely audit o f
        selectedflows in the Government Accounts would be undertaken annually. This audit will
        be carried out by the NAO, which may contract assistance from an internationally
        recognised audit company. This audit would be financed by the PRBS donors. The terms
        of reference for this selected external audit and a short list o f audit companies would be
        jointly prepared and agreed by the Government, the National Audit Office and the PRBS
        donors. The selection o f auditors and approval o fthe audit contract would be endorsed by
        the Government andthe PRBS donors;

   3) Internal audits of the PRBS account will be undertaken.              Contributing donors may
        undertake an independent external audit o f the PRBS account at any time at their own cost;

   4) The internal and external audit reports will be discussed as part o f the reviews (ref.:
        Appendix o fthe Partnership Framework Memorandum-schedule o f reviews).

                        PRSC-2 Credit and Grant Administration

1.       The technical arrangements and the steps to follow inrespect to the IDA Credit and Grant
administration are described below:

2.       Borrower and credit amount. The borrower is the United Republic o f Tanzania. A single-
tranche credit o f SDR 41 million (US$60 million equivalent) would be made available upon credit
effectiveness, anticipated for August 2004. The closing date o f the operation would be June 30,
2005. It is envisaged that there will be another further single-tranche, annual PRSCs to support the
implementation o f the PRS inFY06.
3.       Grant Amount. Additionally, there would be grant o f SDR 61.6 million (US$ 90 million
equivalent) that would be made available uponPRSC-2 effectiveness, anticipated for August 2004.
4.       The proposed financial structure for the PRSC-2 is as follows:
         PRSC-2:            US$60 million equivalent (IDA credit)
                            US$90 million equivalent (IDA grant [debt vulnerability country])
                            _____---_________-________
         Total              US$l50 million equivalent
5.       Disbursement, reporting, and auditing arrangements". The operation will follow IDA's
simplified disbursement procedures for adjustment operations.20                  Accordingly, the PRSC-2
proceeds will be disbursed in compliance with the stipulated single-tranche release conditions.
Disbursement will not be linked to any specific purchases, and no procurement requirements are
needed. Once the PRSC-2 is approved by the Board, the borrower will open and maintain a
dedicated deposit account in U.S. dollars for the borrower's use. As the single tranche is released
on PRSC-2 effectiveness, IDA will disburse the proceeds o f the credit and grant into the deposit
account. Thereafter, at the request o f the Ministry o f Finance, the U.S. dollars amount will be
converted to Tanzania shillings at the Bank o f Tanzania for the credit o f the government account
(consolidated fund account, to be used subsequently for public expenditures. Ifafter deposit inthe
deposit account, the proceeds of the credit and grant or any parts thereof are used for ineligible
purposes, as defined in the development financing agreement, IDA will require the borrower to
either (a) return that amount to the deposit account for use for eligible purposes or (b) refund the
amount directly to IDA.
6.       Through the Ministry o f Finance, the borrower will (a) report the exact sum received into
the deposit account; (b) indicate to IDA details o f the consolidated fund account to which the
Tanzania shillings equivalent o f the PRSC-2 proceeds will be credited; (c) ensure that all
withdrawals from the deposit account are for budgeted public expenditures, except for purposes
such as military expenditures or for other items on IDA's negative list; (d) report to IDA the
equivalent in the local currency o f the U.S. dollar amount withdrawn from the deposit account,
producing evidence that the local currency sum was paid into the Consolidated Fund Account and
disbursementsfrom that account were for budgeted public expenditures other than those on IDA's
negative list; and (e) submit a report on receipts and disbursements for boththe deposit account and
the consolidated fund account to enable IDA to review the consistency of the withdrawal with the
development financing agreement and the objectives o foperation.
7.       These controls are intended to provide assurance that IDA funds have arrived at their
intended destination and are being used for their intended purpose o f funding budgeted public
expenditures, subject to the borrower's rules andregulations.

8.      The following summarizes the external audits:

    e     Deposit account: At IDA'Srequest and within six months o f credit and grant disbursement,
          the deposit account will be independently audited on terms o f reference acceptable to IDA.
    e     Public (government) accounts: The controller and auditor general (CAG ) is required by law
          to produce his or her annual report on the public accounts to parliament within nine months
          o f the financial year-end. A copy o f these accounts should be submittedto IDA.
    e     Bank of Tanzania: The annual entity financial statements o f the Bank o f Tanzania, audited
          in accordance with International Auditing Standards promulgated by the International
          Federationo f Accountants, are publicly available.

9.        Governance aspects. Aside from the measures supported by the PRSC that aim at the
strengthening o f governance, various processes are in place that aim at improved accountability
and transparency for the use o f public resources. The Prevention o f Corruption Bureau and the
National Audit Office have been significantly strengthened during recent years, and the Bank is
preparing a project that would support further strengthening o f accountability mechanisms. The
participatory PER-MTEF process provides for an open review o f budgetary performance. The
CFAA on Tanzania concluded that the central and localgovernment financialmanagement systems
represent high fiduciary     risk. The major recommendations contained in that report have been
reflected inthe reform program supported by the PRSC. To ensure effective implementation o f the
reform, the government has developed the PFMRP, the implementation o f which will be monitored
under the PERprocess.
10.       Environmental issues. The proposed PRSC-2 has been classified as structural adjustment
credit governed under the Operational Directive 8.60, and does not require an environmental
assessment rating. In an effort to mainstream the environmental sustainability dimension into the
PRSC process the Bank has undertaken various analyses with the objective to identify linkages
between key macro and structural reforms policies andthe environment. This analysis, undertaken
under PRSC-1, identifies measures at both national and local government levels to reduce poverty
and enhance environmental sustainability o f policy reforms.            The analysis concluded that
environment and poverty are linked inthree major ways: (a) poverty reduction programs should not
damage the resource base and the environment o f which poor depend for their livelihoods (b)
improving environmental conditions can help to reduce poverty and promote sustainable pro-poor
growth; and (c) mitigatingmeasures may be necessary as part o f policy dialogue.
11.       Working with the government and other development partners, the analysis identified a
number strategic entry points for mainstreaming key issues of the poverty-environment nexus in
Tanzania into PRSC process and ongoing policy reforms in general. This included inter alia.
further support for EA activities, a comprehensive environmental review o f all taxes and levies
associated with the agricultural sector, and increased attention to removing land tenure
uncertainties.       Specifically, the Vice President's Office and the National Environmental
Management Council (NEMC) have been supporting the development and implementation o f
various sector-specific guidelines for EA (initially in roads and agriculture), and have more
recently pursued procedures for strategic and sectoral environmental assessment to permit
mitigation o f any adverse environmental impacts while taking advantage o f potential synergies
between poverty reduction and environmental protection efforts. In this regard the PRSC-2 and
PRSC-3 reform agenda has specific actions to be implemented by the Government o f Tanzania as
part o f the environmental component.

  TMF CompletesFirstReview UnderTanzania's PRGFArrangement and Approves
                                 US$4.2 Million Disbursement

The Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund(IMF)today completed the first review o f
Tanzania's performance under a SDR 19.6 million (about US$29.3 million) Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement (see Press Release No. 031127).         The completion o f this
review enables the release of a further SDR 2.8 (about US$4.2 million), which will bringthe total
amount drawn under the arrangement to SDR 5.6 million (about US$8.3 million).

Incompletingthe review, the Boardwaived the nonobservance ofthe performance criterionrelated
to the submissionto parliament of the new income tax law, which was delayed to February 2004.

The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported programs
are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory process
involving civil society and development partners and articulated in a Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP).    This is intended to ensure that PRGF-supported programs are consistent with a
comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural and social policies to foster growth and
reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent and are repayable over 10
years with a 5 %-year period on principal payments.

Following the Executive Board's discussion on Tanzania's economic performance, Agustin
Carstens, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, made the following statement:

"The Tanzanian authorities deserve credit for maintaining macroeconomic stability and making
substantial progress with structural reforms, which have paved the way for a steady but modest
increase in real per capita income combined with low inflation. Reflecting its good track record in
the implementation of its reform program, Tanzania has received steady financial support and
technical assistance from the donor community. Inparticular, debt relief under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative has helped Tanzania to undertake higher social sector spending and maintain debt
sustainability.

"Despite these achievements, poverty remains widespread, especially in rural areas, and economic
development has been uneven across the country. Thus, the authorities are committed to sustained
economic reform efforts inorder to make further progress toward the growth and poverty reduction
objectives articulated in the PRSP.      The strengthening o f the business environment and o f
agricultural performance, as well as measures to manage the macroeconomic impact o f high aid
flows, will be key elements o fthese reforms.

"Enhancing revenue mobilization and containing aid dependence will be critical to enhance the
robustness o f macroeconomic stability.      To this end, the authorities plan to achieve a
comprehensive reform of tax policy and tax administration. The forthcoming adoption o f a new
Income Tax Bill and the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRAYSimplementationo f a new three-year
corporate plan will be crucial measures inthis direction. Furthermore, rationalizing the tax regime
for mining companies, while imposing strict controls on tax exemptions, will be important steps to




                                             132

contain revenue leakages. Maintaining a sound fiscal position and debt sustainability will also
require firm control over nonpriority expenditure and prudent debt management policies.

"Continued reform in the financial sector, consistent with the recommendations o f the recent
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), will be crucial to improve access to bank lending
and strengthen the financial sector's contribution to higher economic growth. The newly passed
amendments to the Land Act are expected to facilitate bank lendingby permittingthe use o f land as
collateral. The privatizationo fthe National Microfinance Bank will also help to broaden access to
financial services.

"The authorities recognize the seriousness o f the rising fiscal pressures emanating from growing
subsidies for the energy sector. They intend to take swift action by formulating and implementing
a short-term action plan and a medium-term reform strategy, which will aim at providing reliable
power supply, while reducing the electricity utility's dependence on fiscal subsidies. In this
context, the authorities intend to hold high level consultations with the World Bank in the near
future.

"The authorities are committed to pursuing closer regional integration and further trade
liberalization, mainly in the framework o f the East African Community (EAC). As part o f these
efforts, the authorities are encouraged to work with EAC partner states to further reduce tariffs and
remove non-tariff barriers.

"Finally, the authorities have underlined their commitment to the full implementation o f their
updated national anti-corruption strategy and action plan for 2003-2005, which will be a crucial
step for strengthening governance and boosting business confidence," Mr.Carstens said.
