Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). A policy\n            dialogue, and performance assessment framework under the\n            PRSC-2, focuses on the following cross-cutting, and\n            institutional actions which will facilitate progress towards\n            the PRS objectives: 1) sustain and accelerate economic\n            growth, and, broaden its impact by reducing income poverty,\n            through private sector, and rural development, the two areas\n            where reforms are expected to have the biggest impact on\n            reducing income poverty in Tanzania. Measures include\n            improving export crop quality, reducing marketing cost, and\n            the tax burden on farmers, and, improving access to markets\n            and finance. With respect to private sector development, the\n            focus will be on strengthening the business environment, in\n            particular for small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs),\n            and, legal and administrative reforms, to enhance the\n            functioning of land, credit, and labor markets. 2) support\n            results orientated public service delivery, through\n            monitoring and leveraging progress, in the implementation of\n            sectoral programs, covering the priority sectors identified\n            in the PRS, i.e., primary education, basic health, water,\n            rural roads, agricultural research and extension, the\n            judiciary, and HIV/AIDS. 3) enhance public sector\n            performance, by strengthening the public sector capacity to\n            implement poverty reduction programs in the priority\n            sectors, and, generate additional funds, by improving the\n            allocation and operations of public expenditures. Areas of\n            reform include strengthening of financial management,\n            strengthening of the national audit office, procurement\n            reform, the implementation of anti-corruption strategies,\n            and. enhanced efficiency in the use of development\n            assistance. 4) and finally, the project also supports\n            government's efforts to enhance the environmental\n            sustainability of Tanzania's development program."}, "docdt": "2004-07-06T00:00:00Z"}
