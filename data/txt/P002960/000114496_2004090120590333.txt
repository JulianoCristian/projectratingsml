                         Credit Number 2190-UG
                         Amendment
Dear Mr. Minister,
     I refer to the Development Credit Agreement between the
Republic of Uganda (the Borrower) and the International Development
Association (the Association) dated December 19, 1990 for the above-
referenced Credit and to the Borrower's request to introduce
revisions to the Development Credit Agreement to reflect
developments in Uganda since the execution of the Development Credit
Agreement.
Having reviewed and approved the Borrower's request, we propose to
amend the Development Credit Agreement as follows.
1.   Section 1.02. (k) and (1) are renumbered as Section 1.02. (1)
and (m) respectively, and a new Subsection(k) is added to
read:
     (k) "SITC" means the Standard International Trade
     Classification, Revision 3 (SITC, Rev. 3) published by the
     United Nations in Statistical papers, Series M, No 343
     (1986);".
2.   Paragraph 2 (c) of Schedule 1 to the Development Credit
     Agreement (including the Annex to Schedule I referred to
     therein) is deleted and replaced by the following provision:
     (c) the term "eligible goods" means any goods imported during
     the execution of the Program other than goods included in the
     following SITC groups or sub-groups, or any successor groups
     or sub-groups under future revisions to the SITC, as
     designated by the Association by notice to the Borrower:
