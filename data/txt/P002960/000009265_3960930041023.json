        Sector Adjustment Credit Project are: (a) to facilitate\n            financial stabilization by controlling credit expansion\n            through improved institutional arrangements for financing\n            coffee crop procurement, and financial restructuring of\n            marketing intermediaries; and (b) to promote agricultural\n            growth and diversification by creating competitive systems\n            for processing and marketing of export crops through reform\n            of marketing institutions.  The project consists of two\n            components.  Under the adjustment component the credit\n            finances agricultural sector recurrent imports in support of\n            significant policy reforms in the sector.  Actions to be\n            monitored include transfer of the responsibility for crop\n            financing from the Central Bank to commercial banks,\n            restructuring of the Coffee Marketing Board (CMB) as a\n            commercial marketing organization, rehabilitation of\n            cooperative unions, broadening of private sector\n            participation in coffee exports, reforms of the export\n            taxation system to introduce trade incentives, and\n            establishment of a semiautonomous national agricultural\n            research organization.  Under the investment component the\n            credit finances: (a) a Head-Start Program for Agricultural\n            Research and Extension to implement high priority\n            activities; (b) support for a program for land policy\n            research; (c) a program to strengthen agricultural sector\n            planning; (d) technical assistance for coffee subsector\n            management; and (e) institutional support for\n            projectcoordination and monitoring."}, "docdt": "1990-11-27T00:00:00Z"}
