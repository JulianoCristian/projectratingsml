Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            are: (a) impressive achievements were made under the\n            project, particularly in the areas of policy reforms in the\n            liberalization of the coffee sub-sector, and in facilitating\n            the establishment of institutions for coffee development\n            (UCDA) and national research (NARO); (b) the survival of\n            Coffee Marketing Board (CMB) was necessary to avoid a total\n            collapse in the industry at the time of deregulation, and\n            this was reflected in the project's design. When market\n            reforms are being introduced, it is important that there is\n            a phased entry of private sector participation; and (c)\n            capacity building and gaining experience in procurement is\n            critical for smooth implementation and takes time.\n            Centralizing procurement for a multi-agency implemented\n            project helped in this area."}, "docdt": "1997-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
