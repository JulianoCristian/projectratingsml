INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR FOR A
DEVELOPMENT FINANCE COMPANIES PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$8.0 million to
the Republic of Ecuador.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        In March 1969, the Ecuadorian Government asked the Bank to con-
sider a loan for two development finance companies, Comision de Valores-
Corporacion Financiera Nacional (CFN) and Ecuatoriana de Desarrollo S. A.
Compania Financiera (COFIEC). The Bank/IDA has made loans and credits in
Ecuador for highways, electric power, livestock development, fisheries,
and education. The proposed loan would be the first Bank or IDA lending
in Ecuador for industry.
3.        Negotiations were held in Washington from April 7-17, 1970.
Ecuador was represented by Ivr. Carlos Mantilla Ortega, Ambassador of Ecua-
dor in lWashington; Mr. Jose Correa and Mr. Raul Paez, President and Manager
of the Technical Department of COFIEC, respectively; Mr. Cristobal Flores
and Mr. Raul Padron, Assistant Manager and Financial Adviser of CFN, re-
spectively; and Mr. Jaime Duirango, Commercial Attache, Embassy of Ecuador
in Washington. Important issues remained unresolved at the end of these
negotiations, however, and since there were several important developments
and changes within the Government during the ensuing months, it was not un-
til mid-November 1970 that agreemnent was reached on the outstanding issues.
4.        The proposed loan would bring the total of Bank and IDA lending
to US$95.9 million (net of cancellations). The following is a summary
statement of Bank loans and IDA credits to Ecuador as of October 31, 1970:

5.        The status of disbursements of loans is still as described in para-
graphs 5-8 of my Report and Recommendation on the credit for the Third Live-
stock Development Project (P-875) dated November 12, 1970.
6.        IFC has made two investments, one in 1965 of approximately US$2
million equivalent in equity and debt of La Internacional, a major Ecuadorian
textile firm, and the other in early 1969 of about US$250,000 equivalent in
equity of COFIEC, one of the beneficiaries of the loan now proposed.
7.        Several projects are being prepared for consideration by the Bank
and IDA.  However, except for a possible operation of US$5 million for the
Nayon Hydroelectric Project, it is not expected that any of these will be
ready for presentation to the Executive Directors before the end of fiscal
year 1972. IFC is reviewing a possible investment in a cement enterprise.



PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
8.        Borrower:                   Republic of Ecuador.
Beneficiaries:             Comision de Valores-Corporacion
Financiera Nacional (CFN) and
Ecuatoriana de Desarrollo S. A.
(Compania Financiera), called
COFIEC.
Amount:                    The equivalent in various curren-
cies of us$8.0 million, to be divi-
ded equally between the two com-
panies.
Purpose:                   To assist in financing industrial
development in Ecuador by enabling
CFN and COFIEC to cover the foreign
exchange costs of specific invest-
ment projects for productive pur-
poses.
Amortization:              In 17-1/2 years, including a one-year
period of grace, through semi-annual
installments, beginning January 1,
1972, and ending January 1, 1988.
Payments will be based on a composite
amortization schedule substantially
conforming to the schedules for the
individual investment projects. Terms
for the investment projects would be
up to 15 years.
Interest Rate:             7-1/4 percent per annum.
Commitment Charge:         3/4 of one percent per annum.
Relending Terms:           8-1/4 percent per annum to CFN and
COFIEC (including one percent com-
mission to the Central Bank for ad-
ministrative costs). The development
finance companies would have a minimum
spread of 3 percent.
PART III - THE PROJECT
9.        An Appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of Comision de Valores-
Corporacion Financiera lacional and Ecuatoriana de Desarrollo (Compania
Financiera)" - DB-54a - is attached.



10.       Although Ecuador's industrial sector is still at an early stage
of development it has grown rapidly over the past decade (about 6.5 per-
cent per annumS and has increased its contribution to GDP from 15.4 per-
cent in 1960-62 to 17.1 percent in 1966-68. There is room for considerable
expansion, and opportunities exist for industrial investment in the pro-
cessing of industrial raw materials and livestock products, and in textiles,
fisheries, and tourism. Furthermore, Ecuador's participation in the Andean
Group subregional arrangement opens up for its efficient producers a market
nine times as large as that of Ecuador itself, while forcing its less effi-
cient producers to rationalize to meet the competition of their neighbors.
Both are likely to need long-term financing on an increased scale. In-
creased capital for investment should provide more industrial employment,
a factor important in view of Ecuador's fast-growing labor force.
11.       About four-fifths of industrial financing in Ecuador is provided
by the commercial banks in the form of short-term loans. Long-term financ-
ing for industry has been achieved largely by renewing short-term loans.
CFN and COFIEC are virtually the only institutions providing long-term financ-
ing. Their importance is indicated by the fact that their share in industrial
financing since the mid-1960's rose steadily and reached a peak of 21 percent
of the total in 1968.
12.       The Bank loan would be made to the Government and relent through
the Central Bank of Ecuador to the two participating development finance
companies, CFN and COFIEC. As COFIEC is privately owned, the Government
prefers to be the borrower and relend to both companies.
13.       CFN is publicly owned.  It was organized originally in 1948 to
establish a market for government bonds and only began incdustrial lending
in 1964. Its management is competent. The general manager has held this
position since 1957 and most of its directors are members of the business
community. The quality of its appraisal work is generally satisfactory;
its project supervision, however, needs some improvement.
14.       CFN has been able to rely, to a great extent, on its large capi-
tal and earnings as the main sources of funds. It has also had some suc-
cess in obtaining long-term loans from foreign institutions. Total long-
term resources utilized as of June 30, 1970, in an amount of US$40.7 mill-
ionl/ equivalent were derived as follows: US$31.0 million equivalent from
paid-in capital and retained earnings, US$4.8 million from an AID loan,
US$4.5 million from an IDB loan, US$0.3 million equivalent from a loan from
European banks, and US$0.1 million equivalent from a loan from the Kreditan-
stalt fdr Wiederaufbau.
1/ CFN's figures have been converted at the official rate of S/18 per U.S.
dollar ruling on June 30, 1970. They take no account of the subsequent
devaluation of the sucre.



15.       CFNt's portfolio on June 30, 1970, consisted of US$13.5 million
equivalent in securities (mostly government and municipal bonds and loans
to Government), US$27.1 million equivalent in loans to industry, US$1.8
million equivalent in equity investments, and US$4.0 million in loans to
Government. The loans are well-secured by collateral, few clients are in
difficulty, and arrears are low. Reflecting in part a low leverage, CFN
earns only a modest return on net worth, but it is endeavoring to improve
its earnings position.
16.       COFIEC is privately-owned and started operations in 1966 as an
industrial finance company. It has competent management and a nucleus of
capable personnel, and has on its Board of Directors several prominent
businessmen. It needs to strengthen its capability for appraisal and super-
vision of long-term investments, although, in the past, when the volume of
these investments was small, management's close contact with clients has
compensated for this weakness. The company plans to improve these aspects
of its operations.
17.       Unlike CFN, COFIEC has not had access to substantial long-term
loan capital and has had to rely mainly on its paid-in capital and retained
earnings of US$3.0 million equivalent (including an equity investment by IFC
of about US$250,000) and the proceeds of loans from U.S. AID (US$2.9 million),
the Bank/IDA (US$0.5 million equivalent for livestock lending), and Eximbank
(about US$1.1 million) for a total at June 30, 1970, of US$7.5 million equiva-
lent.l/ To maintain its growth, COFIEC recently has had to depend more
heavily on short-term resources.
18.       COFIEC had a portfolio on June 30, 1970, of US$7.8 million equiva-
lent in loans, US$0.7 million equivalent investments, and US$13.0 million
equivalent in guarantees and acceptances. Operating on the basis of high
leverage, COFIEC has been able to attain a 16.1 percent return on net worth
despite high administrative expenses. It needs to build up reserves to a
more satisfactory level.
19.       Taking into consideration the reasonably favorable climate for in-
dustrial growth in Ecuador, and comparing the projected operations of CFN
and COFIEC with the resources they expect to obtain from other sources, they
will need an additional US$8.0 million equivalent over the next two years to
help them finance the cost of imported goods and services for their clients'
industrial projects. The proposed loan is intended to fill this gap and
would be split evenly between the two companies. The Bank's prior approval
would be required for projects utilizing US$100,000 or more of Bank funds,
1/ COFIEC's figures have been converted at the free market rate of S/22
per U.S. dollar ruling at the beginning of the company's 1970 account-
ing year.



and the aggregate limit for each company on the amount of loan funds which
could be utilized for projects not requiring the Bank's prior approval would
be US$1.3 million.
20.       The terms of sub-loans would be up to 15 years, including an ap-
propriate period of grace not expected to exceed 3 years. Repayments from
CFN and COFIEC would be based on repayments from their borrowers. The in-
terest rate to the borrowers is expected to be 12 percent and that to CFN
and COFIEC 8-1/4 percent, including a one percent commission to the Central
Bank. The loan documents specify a minimum spread of 3 percent for each of
the two companies.
21.       The proposed Bank loan would complement the Inter-American Develop-
ment Bank and U.S. AID loans, mentioned above, which have been directed, to
a large extent, towards promoting the growth of small industrial firms. An
earlier IDA credit (124-EC) for education will help to provide skilled workers
for industry.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
22.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Ecuador and the
Bank; the draft Project Agreements between the Bank and CFN and COFIEC,
respectively; the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Sec-
tion 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement; and the text of a resolution ap-
proving the proposed loan, are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
23.       The draft Agreements contain covenants normally included in agree-
ments for development finance company projects, including the full commit-
ment charge. Particular attention is drawn to the following provisions:
(i) CFN initially carries the exchange risk but an event of de-
fault would occur if the company is not reimbursed by the
Government or others for any loss derived as a result of
carrying such risk (Section 6.02(ix) of the draft Loan Agree-
ment); COFIEC agrees to take steps satisfactory to the Bank
to protect itself against the exchange risk (Section 2.06 of
the draft Project Agreement with COFIEC);
(ii) At the Bank's option, the Loan Agreement may be declared ef-
fective (Section 7.01), and an event of default established
(Section 6.01), with regard to only one of the development
finance companies.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
2h.       An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Pros-
pects of Ecuador" (WH-201a) dated August 21, 1970, was distributed to the
Executive Directors on September 4, 1970. The report indicated that the



- 7 -
most urgent and immediate issue of development policy was the necessity
to correct the severe fiscal disequilibrium which threatened the financial
stability of the country. Until recently, the Government did not effective-
ly limit the gioowth of its current expenditures, and the resulting deficit
and expansion of cr3dit led to a devaluation of the sucre in August 1970
from S/18 to S/25 per U.S. dollar.
25.       These developments induced the Ecuadorian authorities to adopt a
financial program which was worked out with the II-IF. A stand-by agreement
based on this program was made on September 11, 1970. The implication of
this program, combined with tax measures taken earlier in the year and the
favorable fiscal impact of the devaluation, is expected to reduce the 1971
budget deficit to a level consistent with a moderate expansion of credit
to the private sector and the maintenance of the new exchange rate. The
Ecuadorian authorities took the opportunity of the devaluation to simplify
the exchange system, eliminating the dual rate system and other multiple
exchange rate features; they also eliminated all restrictions on current
transactions, thus making the sucre a convertible currency under Article VIII
of the IMF Articles of Agreement. Already the devaluation has begun to have
a beneficial impact on the balance of payments as it has provided increased
returns to exporters and, especially significant at this time, has improved
the position of Ecuadorian producers vis-a-vis their Andean market competi-
tors.
26.       Ecuador's external debt management has been generally sound; the
debt service ratio on the public external debt is estimated at about 13 per-
cent of foreign exchange earnings in 1970. Provided relatively prudent
monetary and fiscal policies are maintained, Ecuador should continue to be
creditworthy for moderate amounts of additional external lending on conven-
tional terms. Nevertheless, even under conditions of sound economic manage-
ment, Ecuador's low per capita income and relatively high fiscal burden place
a limit on public sector savings that can be generated, and at least part of
the capital required frQm abroad siould be provided on concessional terms.
27.       A basic data sheet is annexed hereto.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMNT
28.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Arti-
cles of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VII - RECONIIENDATION

loan.
