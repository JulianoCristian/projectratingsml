proposed project aims at enhancing\n            the competitiveness of Uruguay's exports by increasing\n            labor productivity, improving product quality and promoting\n            the use of production technologies well suited to the\n            country's requirements. The project would support the\n            initiation of a national vocational training program to meet\n            the training needs of the export-oriented industrial sector,\n            assist the Government and the private sector in selecting\n            appropriate technologies and in improving and expanding\n            quality control services for exports. The project would\n            include construction of training/administrative buildings\n            for the Vocational Training Council (COCAP), laboratories\n            for LATU, and provision of equipment and furniture, as well\n            as technical assistance. The proposed project is expected to\n            make a substantial contribution to the Government's\n            efforts to rehabilitate the economy and to expand\n            non-traditional exports."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
