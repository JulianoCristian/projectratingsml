                         The project has contributed to improved governance in Moldova by achieving the following results:
                         •         A merit-based civil service has been institutionalized at the central and sub-national levels through the approval and implementation of the civil service law and enabling
                         regulations on human resource management. Presently, the State Chancellery plays an important role in civil service professionalization.
                         •         A policy coordination system has been established, with the State Chancellery playing the key role in supporting the Government with coordinating sector policies and

                         strategic planning, and ministries leading the design and implementation of sector policies within the national policy framework.
                         •         Policy prioritization and strategic planning has been closer linked with resource planning through the Medium-Term Budget Framework.
                         •         The structure of public administration has been streamlined through a restructuring implemented over a medium term, following the recommendations of the functional
                         review supported by the project. The legal basis for a well-functioning public administration has been approved and implemented.
                         •         A significant share of civil servants at all tiers of government has been trained in strategic planning, policy development, human resource management, internal control and
                         audit, and other public administration processes, thus laying a foundation for a better performing public administration.
                         •         A legal framework for administrative procedures has been designed, thus strengthening the foundation for an accountable and predictable public administration serving its
                         citizens on the basis of law.
                         •         An analysis of government administrative services delivered by the central government entities has supported a program of streamlining and digitalizing these services, thus
                         improving efficiency, access and service quality.
