Administration Reform (CPAR) Project for\n            Moldova were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Grantee performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: strong\n            government ownership and commitment to CPAR proved to be\n            essential for achieving results in the institutional reform\n            project. Institutional reform such as CPAR depends on staff\n            capacity to absorb and implement innovations: the importance\n            of a capacity building strategy supporting implementation of\n            CPAR reforms should not be underestimated. Long-term\n            commitment in supporting government's reforms\n            implementation process in the areas of institutional\n            reorganization and capacity building bear fruit and have a\n            greater chance to lead to more sustainable results. Linking\n            government policies with the budget proves to be a\n            challenging area and it is hard to make progress in\n            environment, where demand for evidenced based policy making\n            and budgeting is lacking. Advisory assistance in the design\n            of public administration reforms and implementation planning\n            is crucial when undertaking complex administrative reforms.\n            Effective donor coordination increases the impact of the\n            development assistance on the institutional reform and\n            reduces administrative burden on the government.\n            Transparency in institutional reforms implementation is\n            crucial for building consensus on new policies among\n            government and non-government stakeholders. Flexibility in\n            implementation has contributed to successful completion of\n            CPAR, but required a significant administrative effort by\n            the Bank team constrained by a modest supervision budget."}, "docdt": "2014-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
