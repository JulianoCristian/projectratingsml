1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

    1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. Following the April 2005 elections, the President, with the support of Parliament 1,
announced that public administration reform (PAR) would be one of the top priorities for
his administration. Focusing on PAR served to win the support of non-Communist
Parliamentary opposition 2 that saw improvements in the professionalism and
effectiveness of the public administration as an important political step toward European
integration. In response to one of the President’s original reform objectives (to increase
salaries of civil servants, while cutting 70 percent of staff), the Prime Minister requested
international development partners – the World Bank, United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP), Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida)
and other development actors - to provide technical assistance for PAR implementation.
UNDP and Sida provided immediate technical assistance that addressed initial PAR
management capacity building, and in coordination with the World Bank initiated the
first phases of the horizontal functional review and related analyses of the governance
system, civil service and decision-making systems. The Bank responded to the request
from the Government of Moldova (GOM) with a non-lending technical assistance
program to support the GOM with developing a credible agenda for public administration
reform. The effort of development partners was driven by a desire to help the
Government develop a PAR strategy before taking action on civil service cuts or other
administrative changes.

2. As a result of this initial support and advice, the GOM took a number of important
steps to advance the PAR agenda: (i) establishing an institutional framework for
management of the reform (including the Government PAR Council chaired by the Prime
Minister and the PAR Unit of the Government Office reporting to the Prime Minister);
(ii) conducting a high-level functional review of ministries and central government
agencies during July- November 2005; and most importantly (iii) drafting and approving
the Central Public Administration Reform Strategy (CPAR Strategy) and Implementation
Plan for the next three years 3 to guide future reforms. The CPAR Strategy identified the
following underlying challenges constraining public sector management and development
in Moldova: adjusting the institutional system to new policy priorities; developing
politically neutral professional civil service; strengthening systems for Government
decision-making; putting in place the fundamental legislation to govern public

  The Parliamentary majority belonged to the Communist Party, dominating since 2001 and staying for the
second term as a result of March 2005 elections.
2
  The opposition backed up President’s re-election in exchange for the promises of swifter reforms (UNDP
& UNFPA Moldova, Institutional Development Outcome Evaluation, February 2010).

administration and civil service; and improving efficiency in the allocation of public
financial and other resources 4.

3. Following the adoption of the CPAR Strategy, the Bank worked with the PAR Unit
and in consultation with the development partners to establish the CPAR Multi-Donor
Trust Fund (MDTF) (US$ 6.15 million5) in July 2006 with the support of DFID, Sida,
and the Government of the Netherlands. The CPAR MDTF was designed to support the
implementation of the CPAR Strategy and its duration was set to coincide with the
mandate of the government, through December 30, 2008.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

4. The original development objective of CPAR MDTF was to strengthen institutional
capacity of public administration for better policymaking, implementation and efficient
use of public resources.

5. Key Performance Indicators: While a formal Results Matrix was not required at the
project start according to the World Bank trust funds procedures, the key performance
indicators were identified in the Trust Fund Brief (henceforth referred to as Program
Brief). The components’ results were monitored by the Government using their own
M&E system, described in Section 2.3. In response to changes in Bank policies and
procedures, an initial Results Matrix was developed in conjunction with the preparation
of the first Implementation Status Report (ISR) in June 2008. The first Result Matrix for
CPAR MDTF contained the following PDO indicators 6:
         • The institutional system is streamlined and consolidated around key policy
              areas, with Ministries playing a leading role in policy development and
              coordination of implementation.
         • The GO and the MoF coordinate and control the quality of Ministries' policy
              proposals within a rolling MTEF; a policy management system established
              and functioning.
         • Legislation on civil service and public administration, compatible with EU
              practice, approved and implemented.


4
  These challenges have been acknowledged in key Moldova’s policy documents, including the Economic
Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (May 2004) and the EU-Moldova Action Plan (Feb. 2005).
5
  The total amount committed by the donors in the CPAR MDTF after charging administrative fee was
US$6,933,918.00. However, only 85% of the committed resources for Recipient-executed activities were
approved for disbursement under the Grant Agreement. As subject to exchange rate fluctuation, the
remaining 15% of the donor contribution adjusted for the exchange rate at the moment of disbursement
would determine the final amount of the grant (Side-Letter to the MOF from July 17, 2006).
6
  3 out of 4 PDO indicators, included in the first Result Matrix, were the same as the key performance
indicators in the Program Brief.
                                                  2
             •   Central civil service management instituted to enforce merit based
                 recruitment and to promote effective personnel management practices.

6.      The Intermediary Performance Indicators included:
           • The system of management of public administration reform is
                institutionalized.
           • Civil Service legislation drafted.
           • Reorganization of public administration has taken place in line with the
                principle of functional delineation and matching the role of government
                underpinned by national strategic documents.
           • Legal basis for organization and functioning of public administration has
                been developed and approved.

     1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
     and reasons/justification

     7. PDO remained unchanged from the Program Brief of 2006. PDO level indicators
     remained unchanged from the first Results Framework, where they were formally
     identified for the first time, until project closing in February 2014. However, several
     intermediary results indicators were added during MDTF restructurings:

     8. May 2011 restructuring: Funding was added for the expanded scope of activities and
     new Intermediary Result “Government policy management capacity strengthened” was
     added with the following intermediary indicators, associated with this result:
        • Strategic planning capacity in the Center of Government strengthened
        • Sector expenditure planning capacity at the line ministry level strengthened
        • Mechanisms for NPC operations developed and functioning

     9. December 2012 restructuring: Expanded scope of activities included a result and
     intermediary indicator:
         • A program for improving the quality, transparency and efficiency of
            administrative public services developed.

     1.4 Main Beneficiaries

     10. There was no requirement to identify beneficiaries or a “primary target group” in the
     original Program Brief. However, based on the context of project activities, the primary
     beneficiaries included:
         • Government Office (which became State Chancellery after 2010 Government
             restructuring), with emphasis on the Public Administration Reform Unit (later



                                                3
        transformed into Department for Public Policies and Foreign Aid Coordination
        and Central Public Administration Reform 7).
    •   Ministries and other central public administration authorities (CPAAs).
    •   Academy of Public Administration (APA).
    •   Individual civil servants.

11. The indirect beneficiaries of the project include civil society organizations, which
could contribute to policy development through consultations on draft government
policies and regulations by participating in the National Participatory Council (NPC) or
public consultations, organized by the Government. Finally, the citizens of Moldova were
also expected to be indirect beneficiaries of improved performance of public
administration, policy making, quality of public services and more strategic use of public
resources.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

12. CPAR MDTF was composed of Recipient-executed part and Bank-executed part.
Technical assistance under Recipient-executed part (Part A) Strengthening Institutional
Capacity was organized around five components:

    •   Institutional Reorganization (US$ 1,961,344.00): The component financed a
        government-wide functional review (phase II); redefining mandates and programs
        of central public administration entities; designing legal framework on the
        organization of the central public administration; and streamlining the system of
        planning and reporting.
    •   Government’s Policy-Making Capacity (US$ 557,600.00): The component
        covered revising and further developing a legal framework on legislative and
        policy development activity of the Government, providing the role for the
        Government Office as a policy coordinating center; institutionalizing policy
        function, developing policy analysis skills in ministries; developing mechanisms
        for linking policy and budget planning; and establishing institutional linkages
        between policy and budget planning.
    •   Merit-based Professional Civil Service (US$ 3,131,170.00): The component
        included designing civil service legislation; implementing competitive merit-

  Initially established in 2006 PAR Unit, has undergone multiple transformations. As a subdivision it
functioned only in 2006-2007. Then it was transformed in to two divisions: Policy and Foreign Aid
Coordination Division (names has been changed several times, for example: Division for Analysis of
Policy Coordination in 2007, Division for Policy and Foreign Aid Coordination in 2008, Division for
Policy Coordination, Strategic Planning and Foreign Aid in 2010) and Personnel Policy Division. In
December 2012 the divisions were combined into one Department for Policy and Foreign Aid Coordination
and Central Public Administration Reform.

   •   Change Management and Information and Communication (US$254,800.00):
       The component envisaged to fund establishing a dialogue with the main
       stakeholders and civil society organizations; mechanisms for involving interest
       groups in policy-making process; and mechanisms for monitoring & evaluation of
       CPAR.
   •   Trust Fund Administration (US$ 511,500.00): The component was planned to
       cover provision of financial management and procurement support to the
       implementing agency – the Government Office; tracking achievement of planned
       TF outputs; and conducting annual audits of the grant account.

13. The Bank-executed part of CPAR MDTF (Part B) Analytical Advice on Improving
Policy and Accountability Framework (US$ 160,000.00) was planned to finance
analytical and advisory services supporting public administration and civil service
reform, including support for Client Document Review (CDR) and Institutional
Development Plans (IDP), where needed, and the following thematic areas:
    • Strategic policy framework: piloting the preparation of a strategic policy
        framework by the Government Office; and developing capacity of selected
        ministries to develop sector strategies and budget programs linked to policy
        outcomes.
    • Managerial controls and accountability: designing the framework for delegation,
        central oversight and accountability for policy implementation (clarifying the
        system of management and accountability of implementing agencies).

1.6 Revised Components

14. The components under the Recipient-executed part remained unchanged until the
closing date of the project. Several new activities were added under subsequent
restructurings, with additional funding provided by the MDTF donors for the expanded
scope of components in recognition of project achievements.

15. May 2011 restructuring: Expanded the scope of Government’s Policy-Making
Capacity including technical assistance to continue work, previously supported under a
parallel DFID project, after the DFID program closed in 2011. These activities included:

   •   Strengthening capacity to apply a new methodology for improved elaboration and
       coordination of development of policy proposals and strategic planning
       documents, as well as building capacity in monitoring and reporting on policy

                                           5
        implementation at the center of government and across the line ministries, through
        expert advice, training and on-the- job coaching during two consecutive budget
        cycles; and
    •   Building capacity of the State Chancellery in supporting the National
        Participation Council as a key mechanism for stakeholder consultations on
        development of strategic planning documents of national importance.

16. December 2012 restructuring: Expanded the scope of Institutional Reorganization in
the area of public services review, undertaken in 2010, and included: technical assistance
to expand the service delivery strategy from services of CPAA to administrative services
provided by central and local governments; and developing a program for improving the
quality, transparency, and efficiency of administrative public services delivered at the
central and sub-national tiers of the government.

1.7 Other significant changes

17. Changes in political leadership and changes in project management on the
Government side: During the first years of project implementation, project managers on
the Government side changed five times, causing implementation delays 8 and affecting
project performance 9. Project performance improved only at the end of the Communist
Government term when a more reform-minded Prime Minister led the Government from
April 2008 until June 2009 10. In 2009, the political leadership of the country changed as
the Communist Party failed to win a parliamentary majority and a coalition of four non-
communist parties, the Alliance for European Integration (AEI), took power. The Bank’s
2010 MDTF Progress Review noted that the new Government had reconfirmed its
commitment to CPAR and included implementation of the CPAR in the Government
Action plan for 2010 11. Political change gave new impetus to the reform and to project
implementation.

18. Changes in closing date: The project has been extended four times. The first
extension for 24 months was approved in December 2008, the second extension of 24
months was approved in December 2010, the third extension of 12 months was approved
in December 2012, and the fourth extension was approved in December 2013 for 2
months. The total cumulative length of extension is 62 months (five years and two
months). Only the extensions of December 2008 and December 2013 were associated
with more time required for implementation of project activities and enforcing the new

policies by adopting relevant legislation. Extensions of December 2010 and December
2012 are explained by the additional funding and additional scope of activities.

19. Changes in funding: The total amount of Grant under CPAR MDTF was increased
from US$6.15 million at project start to US$ 11.45 million at project closing. Additional
funding was added under the following restructurings: US$ 3.75 million were added
under the restructuring in May 2011; US$ 1.55 million was added under the restructuring
in December 2012. In 2010, DFID decided to close its Moldova program and was unable
to provide the remaining undisbursed installment of GBP 528,565 to the MDTF. 12

20. Changes in scope: The project scope was extended with each increase in funding. In
May 2011, based on positive results of the project, Sida increased its contribution to
CPAR MDTF and added activities to strengthen the Government policy-making capacity.
The May 2011 amendment built on complementary activities started under a parallel
DFID project, before DFID closed its program in Moldova in February 2011, and
supported development of methodologies for policy planning documents. Additional
activities were introduced at the Government’s request in December 2012 to develop a
program for improving the quality, transparency and efficiency of administrative public
services, to follow up on the public services review. The additional activities are
described in more detail in Section 1.6.

21. Change of Personnel in the Office of Administrative Support (OAS): The OAS
supported the trust fund management and administration component, ensuring adequate
financial, procurement and contract management. During 2006-2012 OAS maintained
staff continuity. However, in November 2012, the Project Manager and the Accountant
passed away in a road accident. The State Chancellery and OAS team are to be
commended for assuring smooth project management under these tragic circumstances.
Temporary project management arrangements were put in place immediately. Eventually,
a new Head and full-time Financial Management Specialist were appointed in January
2013.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

22. In 2003, the Bank cancelled a lending operation in support of public sector
management reform, but continued to provide support through its non-lending TA
program which conducted institutional diagnostics and provided advice in areas such as


12
   This reduction in MDTF funds did not require an adjustment of the grant amount because exchange rate
fluctuations in the other donor currencies already transferred to the MDTF provided sufficient additional
funds to fully finance the original USD-denominated grant amount.
                                                   7
civil service ethics. Public sector management reform returned to the agenda following
the March 2005 elections as a trade-off between the ruling Communist Party and
Parliamentary opposition, motivated towards European integration. The Bank and other
development partners became concerned that the Government’s plan to reduce civil
servant staffing by 70 percent without conducting a functional review could lead to
disruptions in government operations, and they recognized that the new government
needed support 13.

23. In May 2005 UNDP, in coordination with other development partners, supported a
high level policy advisor who helped the Government identify and formulate its priorities
for technical assistance 14. The Bank team attended this workshop and contributed to the
process of identifying next steps in developing a Moldovan central public administration
reform agenda by advising on the initial diagnostic studies that would inform the CPAR
Strategy and Action Plan. Based on the agreement between development partners and the
Government, UNDP and Sida funded the first phase of the functional review. In July
2005, the Bank set up a non-lending TA program to support the development of a CPAR
Strategy and started the design of the MDTF, as a financial instrument to channel donor
resources under the leadership of the World Bank. The MDTF Program Brief emphasized
Government ownership, demonstrated by Government approval of the CPAR Strategy
and Implementation Plan, which formed the basis for the Trust Fund activities.

24. Project Instrument. The CPAR MDTF was established with contributions from
DFID, Sida, and the Government of the Netherlands, to be implemented by the
Government Office. The Government and CPAR donors asked the Bank to supplement
the recipient-executed TA with its own analytical work, policy advice and comments on
draft legislation and policy documents. This work was supported through a separate
Bank-executed portion of the MDTF.

25. The use of MDTF facilitated implementation for Government and development
partners but was much more complicated for the Bank team to manage than an
investment credit. The MDTF process allowed consolidation of donor resources into one
Bank-managed technical assistance operation, simplifying implementation arrangements
for a Government embarking on complicated central administrative reforms. However, at
the project start, the Bank’s trust fund procedures placed little emphasis on the
development of a results matrix and monitoring and evaluation framework. As a result,


13
   Though during ICRR interviews the World Bank task team and development partners referred to the
announcement of 70 percent staff reduction as a starting point of CPAR, they made it clear they had rather
a concern about this government objective and mentioned this fact to demonstrate high risk of government
crisis in case the development partners chosen not to respond to the Government request for support of
CPAR and the Government moved to massive staff cuts without prier functional analysis.
14
   UNDP & UNFPA Moldova, Institutional Development Outcome Evaluation, February 2010, p.12
                                                    8
these facets of the operation had to be developed and revised during implementation. The
MDTF structure also allowed for easier access to additional financing; development
partners were able to “vote with their wallet” by providing additional funds once they
saw that the project was able to produce positive results. For the World Bank team
administration of the MDTF required increased input in restructurings and reporting,
while the budget allocated for implementation support and supervision did not take into
account administrative complexity of trust fund management.

 26. Risks. While the Program Brief identified risks and mitigation measures there was
 no formal requirement to rate the risks at the project start. The Program Brief identified
 limited beneficiary capacity in the areas of policy coordination and civil service
 management as the main implementation risk. Activation of the MDTF was conditioned
 on the establishment of an adequately staffed unit with appropriate authority to manage
 and coordinate the implementation of the CPAR Strategy. This requirement was
 reinforced by a condition under a parallel development policy operation 15. This reflected
 lessons from past efforts to implement civil service reform in Moldova in 2001, when
 the creation of a Civil Service Agency failed because it suffered from the lack of
 authority within the Government 16. Stakeholder and implementation risks identified in
 the Program Brief were addressed in the project design through the coordination
 committee and allocation of resources for communications and training. After
 Operational Risk Assessment Framework (ORAF) was introduced as a requirement for
 trust funds in the middle of CPAR MDTF implementation, operating environment risks
 were added. Country risk was assessed as medium with high impact 17 due to politically
 unstable environment, however this risk was mitigated by high reputation of the World
 Bank in the country and continuous Bank’s team dialogue with the main political forces.
 Fraud and corruption risk was also considered in ORAF but in the context of
 implementing agency (rated low due to satisfactory project implementation
 arrangements and absence of issues in procurement and financial management) 18.

27. Donor Coordination. The agreement to merge resources into the MDTF
demonstrates the development partners’ intention to act in a coordinated manner in
support of the Government program. Donor coordination arrangement was formalized
through a Donor Coordination Committee that included representatives of development
partners and the Government representatives responsible for TF implementation 19. Donor

2.2 Implementation

28. Low capacity combined with the lack of political support to institutional changes
lead to slow start. Implementation of CPAR MDTF started well in 2006 but experienced
delays throughout 2008, putting the project at risk of not achieving the development
objective. The functional review of 5 government policy areas and some 110 central
government entities was completed in November 2006, but implementation of the
review’s recommendations was limited. Government entities resisted change and the
Presidency did not press for reforms 21. The first Implementation Status and Results (ISR)
rated development objective (DO) and implementation performance (IP) as “moderately
unsatisfactory”, noting that low salaries of the staff in counterpart agencies and general
scarcity of relevant skills made implementation difficult. Capacity constraints were
reflected in procurement delays leading to only 30 percent of the total grant amount being
disbursed by June 2008 22. The project was considered borderline at risk.

29. Capacity issues were addressed. Following the Bank team’s advice, the
Government Office (State Chancellery) started to pay attention to capacity development.
Preparation of functional reviews, drafting the law on civil service and the law on central
public administration provided an opportunity for the PAR Unit to interact with
international consultants, as well as the Bank’s implementation support team. This
facilitated PAR management capacity building 23 . Implementation capacity in line
ministries was gradually and deliberately enhanced through study visits to other countries
for key reform players, and eventually, through training organized by the Government
Office and the Academy of Public Administration (APA), brought into the project as a
beneficiary in 2007 24. APA trained 1,000 to 3,600 civil servants annually from 2007 to
2011. Following a restructuring of APA and introducing in its civil service curriculum
courses on the most critical CPAR topics, 15,230 employees or 59.8 percent of all public
administration staff received training in 2012. APA continues to facilitate professional
development required under the Civil Service Law that was adopted with support of the
project.

   Feedback from former DFID representative, SIDA and the World Bank team reinforced this view. The
list of development partners representatives interviewed is enclosed in Annex 9 to this ICRR, List of People

30. Political support and strengthened supervision helped accelerate CPAR MDTF
implementation. As noted in the 2010 MDTF Progress Review (substituting for project
mid-term review), “when a more reform-minded Prime Minister had led the government
of Moldova from April 2008 until June 2009, the implementation of reform was more
effective than before that” 25. Project performance improved still further when the project
has received greater political attention under the new Government starting in 2009.
CPAR came under the direct supervision of the Minister of State and was closely
monitored by the Prime Minister (before reorganization of the Government Office into
the State Chancellery, project implementation was supervised by the Head of the Policy
and Foreign Aid Coordination Unit). In June 2010, improved project performance was
reflected in the ISR rating, which was upgraded to “moderately satisfactory” both for DO
and IP.

31. Improved implementation performance led development partners to extend the
project and expand its scope. At the request of the new Government, and based on
conclusions of the Progress Review, the MDTF was extended for 24 months in December
2010 to expand the scope of activities and accommodate additional funding from Sida,
increasing the total amount of grant under CPAR MDTF by US$ 3.75 million, reaching
US$ 9.9 million 26 . Additional Sida financing supported development of strategic
planning capacity in selected sectors during 2011-2012 27 . A second expansion of the
project scope was approved in December 2012 28 to accommodate exchange rate gains
amounting to US$ 1.55 million. The Government requested that the exchange rate gains
be used to build on the review of public services and enhance improvement of public
service delivery agenda to sub-national level through piloting more efficient service
delivery approaches and developing a program for improving the quality, transparency
and efficiency of administrative public services.

32. There were delays in the implementation of the HRMIS Civil Service Registry.
The HRMIS encountered substantial procurement delays due to lack of relevant


25
   Project progress review substituted for the mid-term review (MTR) for this project. Since the formal
mid-point of project implementation was not compulsory under the World Bank TF procedures at the time
of the MDTF implementation in 2006-2009, it was decided to use the term “project progress review” rather
than MTR. The review was initiated during the team monitoring visit in February 2010 and completed
during the May-June 2010 mission.
26
   Restructuring, approved in December 2010, extended CPAR MDTF for 24 months, as MDTF closing
date was December 31, 2010. Additional Sida grant and expanded scope of activities was processed under
separate restructuring in May 2011, due to confirmation of Sida additional funding at the beginning of 2011.
However, decision on 24 months extension was taken, taking into account high possibility of additional
funding to be coming from Sida.
27
   This policy work was originally launched under a parallel DFID project which was closing in February
2011 due to closure of the whole DFID program for Moldova. World Bank Mission’s Aide Mémoire, May-

knowledge and skills in developing technical documentation in the PAR Unit.
Implementation did not start until 2011 and required additional capacity building in
ministerial HR Units. Further delays in operational acceptance of Registry due to
challenges in data entry in CPAAs in 2013 were one of the reasons for the final two
month extension of MDTF, approved in December 2013. The Civil Service Register was
finally completed and launched in February 2014 29.

33. Part of Bank-executed activities were cancelled. The Bank-executed portion of the
MDTF was 90 percent disbursed by the end of 2008. The remaining funds were to be
used to help the Government institutionalize management devolution but the Government
did not confirm their readiness for this assistance at that time. As a result, US$ 17,000
were cancelled from the Bank-executed child TF.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

34. Design: While the Program Brief only required the formulation of key performance
indicators, the Government designed a comprehensive M&E methodology to monitor
CPAR implementation in 2006. The instruments used and the M&E framework are
available on the CPAR website (www.rapc.gov.md/en/monitorizare/). Performance
indicators were designed to reflect components, objectives and actions of the CPA
Reform Strategy. The majority of results indicators were formulated in qualitative terms,
while some output level indicators were numerical and relied on administrative or
national statistics. The methodology also included a schedule of monitoring and
evaluation activities for the period of reform implementation. The official CPAR MDTF
Results Matrix, developed with the completion of the first ISR in June 2008, was
consistent with the Government’s M&E indicators 30.

35. Implementation: M&E indicators were monitored by the PAR Unit on a quarterly
basis, which completed both office and field monitoring in tandem with the working
groups within CPAA which monitored the implementation of their own action plans.
Semi-annual and annual CPAR reports and reports monitoring the implementation of the
Civil Service Law were posted on the CPAR web site. The CPAR MDTF provided
specific M&E assistance to the client on development of methodologies for monitoring
the application of HR procedures and other provisions of the regulatory framework. The
World Bank Task Team reviewed progress during implementation support missions and,
from June 2008, reflected progress in semi-annual ISRs.

   Only sub-set of indicators, relevant to CPAR MDTF activities, was reflected in the Result Matrix. The
indicators for the CPAR strategy were broader than the MDTF results.
                                                  12
36. Utilization of Monitoring Information: The M&E framework ensured transparency
of reform progress and its outcomes. It also facilitated better and more efficient data
collection and analysis. The Government’s Project Completion Report indicated that the
M&E procedures reduced the time spent on reporting by 70 percent. While the ICR team
did not conduct a stakeholder survey to assess project results, a 2013 evaluation of CPAR
implementation and results for the period of 2005-2012, conducted by international
consultants, did hold consultations and focus groups. The Evaluation Report has been
used to inform the new PAR Strategy for 2014-2020 and the Government’s Completion
Report for the project.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

37. The project’s environmental category was C and no assessment was required.
Procurement and financial management was managed by OAS, located in the
implementing agency, in compliance with the World Bank financial and procurement
procedures for recipient-executed activities. Implementing agency performance in
procurement has been rated Satisfactory. OAS organized 126 tenders under CPAR
MDTF 31 . No violations were identified by the Bank during supervision. Two large
procurements of consulting services have been implemented based on single-source
procedures:

     •   A contract with DAI Europe Ltd. (UK) for functional review, phase II (US$
         249,779.00), as a continuation of assignment, funded by UNDP, and implemented
         by the same consultant, competitively selected under UNDP procedures;
     •   A contract for services to strengthen policy management capacity (US$
         3,060,273.00) with ECORYS (UK), who had provided assistance under the DFID
         project that closed and whose activities were taken over by the Project.

38. Justification for both single source selections were reviewed by ECA procurement
and found in compliance with relevant sections of the Guidelines for the Selection of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers 32. Performance on financial management has
been also rated Satisfactory. The financial management arrangements were reviewed at
the project design and regularly supervised during project implementation by the World
Bank. The semi-annual unaudited interim financial reports (IFRs) were submitted to the
World Bank on time. The audit opinion in the audited reports and final Audit Report 33 is
unqualified.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

39.     Key improvements in government policy making and operations implemented
under the project have been institutionalized through adoption of framework laws and
relevant secondary legislation on public administration, civil service and transparency in
decision making. Dedicated units under the Department for Public Policies, Foreign Aid
and Central Public Administration Reform (responsible for PAR management and policy
coordination, including civil service management) continue functioning in the State
Chancellery. HR units from each public authority continue to implement the civil service
normative framework (personnel procedures) and develop their community of
professionals. Policy Analysis units have been established in CPAAs and continue
implementing the strategic planning and policy analysis approaches introduced under the
project 34 . APA has incorporated training modules developed under CPAR in its
curriculum which is now funded by the state budget 35. The public services modernization
agenda is addressed through a parallel, on-going World Bank-funded e-transformation
project and the Program for Public Services Reform (2014-2016) will be partly supported
by this project. The Government’s strong commitment to continue public administration
reform is evidenced by the new PAR Strategy for 2014-2020 that it is developing 36. The
Government has requested support of the next phase of PAR through a follow up
operation (indicatively Investment Project Financing (IPF)), to be delivered under the
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY14-17 37.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: High

40. The project objective and design were consistent with the Government’s CPAR
Strategy for 2006-2008 and the World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
for FY05-08. The CPAR MDTF was developed in response to the Government’s request
for donor support for the CPAR Strategy 2006-2008 38. The CPAR MDTF development
objective, key performance indicators and components closely reflected CPAR Strategy
key priority areas. The project also was consistent with the CAS for FY05-08, supporting

the pillar “Improvement of public sector governance, combatting corruption, and better
alignment of Moldova’s institutions and structures to European norms and standards”.

41. Driven by Moldova’s aspiration for joining the EU, the CPAR agenda and the
project’s focus remained relevant throughout project implementation, even after a
change in Government in 2009. Development partners’ consistent support for the
project’s objectives and CPAR more broadly, reflected in the additional financing that
they provided for the project’s objectives, is evidence of this continued relevance. The
project development objective, formulated broadly, did not change, emphasizing
relevance of the project to the Government’s CPAR objectives and priorities. Additional
activities and intermediary result indicators were aligned with the development objective
and helped maintain the relevance of the project as the situation evolved.

42. The initial three-year time frame for CPAR MDTF was based on the timeline in
the CPAR strategy and the Government’s term. This was considered reasonable by
the Government, development partners and the Bank. However, the initial lack of
experience and low capacity in the implementing agency revealed that this
implementation plan was too ambitious. The Government underestimated the level of
capacity and political support required for CPAR implementation 39 . As a result, the
implementation timeline was adjusted during the project to reflect the gradual
development of implementation capacity and to take into account additional activities
supported by additional funding provided by development partners. By the project
completion both the Government and development partners learnt a lesson, that
institutional reform is a long-term effort, however at the project start planning CPAR
strategy and CPAR MDTF beyond the Government electoral cycle was not feasible.

43. As was noted in the presentations at the project’s closing event and in interviews
with the government stakeholders 40 , the project’s objectives remain relevant for
Moldova. An outline of the Government’s PAR Strategy for 2014-2020 also confirms
that the Government is keen to continue public administration reform, with a focus on
improving effectiveness, efficiency and accountability of public administration, making
public service delivery more transparent and citizen-oriented while meeting European
governance values and good standards 41. CPS for FY14-17 identifies governance as a
cross-cutting theme and confirms relevance of the need strengthen institutional capacity

   The project underperformance and risk for not achieving the development objective was captured in the
World Bank Aide Mémoires and the first ISR, completed in spring and approved in June 2008, rated the
project performance “moderately unsatisfactory” both on achievement of development objective and
implementation performance.

have created a solid foundation for further reforms and a follow-on Bank-financed

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objective (Efficacy) 43

Rating: Substantial

44. The project achieved its development objective, contributing to strengthening of
institutional capacity of the public administration for better policymaking,
implementation and efficient use of public resources. The results and improvements in
Moldova’s central public administrative system, formulated as PDO level and
intermediary indicators, were fully or largely achieved. (Details on the outputs associated
with each indicator are provided in Annex 2). Achievements and constraints for each
dimension of the multi-faceted PDO are described below.

45. Strengthened institutional capacity for better policy making: At the project start
there was no formal policy coordination mechanism and responsibilities for policy areas
overlapped. New policies were introduced without calculating their fiscal implications
and without broad government and public consultations. Under the project, the
Government was able to restructure and consolidate the institutional system around key
policy areas; institutionalize policy coordination and strategic planning functions; and
introduce mechanisms for transparent decision making, and mainstreaming public
consultations on government draft regulation and policy documents.

46. Based to a large part on the functional review recommendations developed under the
project, the Government was reorganized in 2010-2012. A dedicated Policy Coordination
Unit was established in the State Chancellery, competent staff were hired and trained.
Capacity to develop policy at the sector level has been enhanced through setting up
dedicated Public Policy Analysis, Monitoring and Evaluation Units in line ministries and
training their staff in applying new strategic planning instruments. After these
institutional innovations were implemented, ministries primarily focused on developing
policy and concentrated on aligning policy development with the budget planning.

47.     The quality of strategic planning process has been improved with support of the
project. The Moldova 2020 Strategy developed in 2011-2012, was adopted as law and
now provides a policy framework for developing a medium-term expenditure framework.
A number of new strategic planning and policy analysis instruments were introduced as a

result of project support, including: strategic development programs (SDPs); ex ante
policy impact analysis; public policy proposals (PPPs) 44 ; and sector expenditure
strategies (SESs) for Medium-term Budget Framework (MBTF) and program budgets. If
in 2010 only 5 ministries used new strategic tools for SESs development on a pilot basis
under parallel DFID funded project, CPAR MDTF allowed methodological support to
implementation and roll out of new strategic planning tools in 13 ministries in the context
of preparing MBTF 2013-2015 45. SES development process continued after completion
of the project support: in 2014 11 ministries and 2 CPAA’s (Academy of Science and
Tourism Agency) developed 16 SES (Ministry of Environment has 2 SESs and Ministry
of Economy has 3 SESs) for the period 2015-2017.

48. A methodological framework for Ex-post Impact Evaluation was developed and
piloted in three ministries 46. The State Chancellery intends to use the impact assessment
methodology and guidelines to monitor implementation of Moldova 2020 National
Development Strategy.

49. The project supported the institutionalization of CPAR reform management and
significantly strengthened Government capacity to plan and implement PAR. From the
project start, CPAR MDTF supported the Chancellery’s PAR Unit by building the
capacity of its staff. The PAR Unit remained the focal point for CPAR implementation
before and after the change in Government in 2009 and the Government restructuring in
2010. The State Chancellery’s lead role in developing the policy priority framework has
been reflected in the CPA Law 47.

50. The Government introduced mechanisms to improve transparency in decision-
making, obliging ministries to undertake inter-ministerial and public consultations on
policy documents and draft legislation and establishing the National Participatory
Council (NPC) in January 2010 (www.particip.gov.md) 48. The NPC opened space for
civil society input into the policymaking process. As a result, there were significant
changes in Government culture: Government decision-making has become more

   With support of CPAR MDTF 31 PPPs have been prepared and used for sector reforms; 50 SDPs
developed in CPAAs and 450 civil servants trained in SDP development (Project Completion Report, State

evidence-based and more transparent. The Government could still improve the disclosure
of information and provide more time for discussion, particularly as regards the budget-
making process. Stakeholders note, for instance, that the revenue budget has yet to be
discussed properly, the 2012 budget was not presented in program format and in 2013 the
time for public discussion was insufficient 49. Nonetheless, significant progress has been
made: in 2013, Moldova received the UN Public Service Award, ranking first in Europe
and North America in the category “Fostering participation in the decision-making
process through innovative mechanisms” 50.

51. Strengthened institutional capacity for better implementation: Before the project,
implementation capacity was hampered by a politicized civil service, excessive staffing
levels, lack of focus on core functions, low salaries, low motivation and productivity
amongst personnel, a failure to attract the best personnel, high levels of corruption and
limited accountability 51.

52. The project addressed performance issues in Government agencies through a
thorough reform and modernization of Moldova’s civil service. Under the project new
civil service legislation 52 was developed and implemented. This separated political and
administrative positions and established the foundation for a merit-based professional
civil service. The project introduced a modern human resources management (HRM)
framework covering competitive recruitment, job descriptions, performance appraisal,
continuous professional development, methodology for developing staffing schedules,
and clarified rules for part-time employment. A Personnel Policy Division was
established in the Government Office (currently State Chancellery) in 2008 53 which
provides strong leadership and monitors implementation of the civil service law and
HRM policy. Based on monitoring data, collected by the Division, in 2012, 82.4 percent
of civil servants from senior management to specialists had their performance appraised,
with 38.7 percent showing “very good” and 57.1 percent showing “good” performance.

52
   The new legal framework on civil service and HRM includes Law No. 158-XVI of July 4, 2008 On the
Public Function and Status of Civil Servant (enforced starting January 2009) and amended in 2012 and
Government Statutory Act No 201 from March 11, 2009 (amended in 2010-2014), approving 11
regulations on new HRM procedures.
53
   In December 2012 Personnel Policy Division was transferred into Central Public Administration Reform
Unit and joined to the Department for Public Policies and Foreign Aid Coordination and Central Public
Administration Reform. The unit continues leading and monitoring implementation of HRM policy under
civil service law. In addition it has undertaken responsibility for coordination of institutional
reorganisations. Staffing has increased from 5 to 9 staff.
                                                  18
Out of 2,927 civil servants employed in 2012, 70.7 percent were hired based on merit
(50.8 percent were hired through competition and 19.2 percent vacancies were filled
through promotion). The number of merit-based recruitments has significantly increased
since 2009, when merit-based principles were applied only to 16 percent of personnel 54.
Through the project’s assistance, the civil service classification and grading system were
approved and a new unified salary grid was introduced in April 2012 55 . The MDTF
helped to create a more transparent and less arbitrary salary system in which base pay is
more closely linked to job descriptions. Before the project, about 80 percent of total pay
came from flexible elements, while the base element of remuneration, linked to job
requirements, constituted only 18-20 percent of the total salary. The new salary system
just reversed this proportion, with base salary accounting for around 80 percent of the
total remuneration. This is a significant achievement when compared with the situation in
other ECA countries 56.

53.     Following a delay caused by extended IT procurement process, the HRMIS Civil
Service Register has been developed and launched 57 . The Register optimizes the
maintenance of staff records by HR Units in ministries and CPAAs and ensures that data
is available for management decisions 58. Specifically, beyond creating personnel file for
each employee, the Register allows the following functions: modelling the structure of
public authority, public function (and positions); creation and modification of job
contracts; tracking records of competitions, organized for public administration
vacancies; establishing individual objectives for civil servants and filling in the
performance evaluation form; tracking leaves, trips, disciplinary misbehaviours and
disciplinary sanctions; creating annual planning professional development program in
each authority, tracking records of training for every person from public authority.
HRMIS has improved efficiency of reporting and management of decision making
process, as it allows search, notifications, reports preparation and distribution of
documents.

54. Most recently, the State Secretary position in for each ministry was introduced as the
top civil service position 59 in order to strengthen ministries’ organizational management
and implementation capacity.

55. Notwithstanding the HRM reforms supported by the project, the Government
recognizes that civil service remuneration remains uncompetitive and this has a negative
impact on the Government’s ability to retain staff 60 . Relatively high staff turnover
remains a serious issue (in 2012 turnover of civil servants was estimated 10.7 percent 61
and in key ministries) and has a negative impact on the Government’s capacity to sustain
public administration reform.

56. Strengthened institutional capacity for efficient use of public resources: A
parallel World Bank and donor-financed Public Financial Management Technical
Assistance Project (PFMP) has supported reforms aimed at enhancing efficiency in use of
public resources. However, CPAR MDTF has also contributed to this agenda.

57. The functional review helped the Government to reduce the number of CPAAs from
29 to 24 and the number of agencies from 16 to 8. The functional review also informed
the new Law on Central Public Administration in Policy Areas (CPA Law) 62 which
described the organization of the central public administration, clarified functional
responsibilities and accountability for policy implementation. Staff downsizing in 2006-
2008 was estimated at the level of 37 percent 63 , more modest achievement than the
originally planned target, but prospects of larger staff cuts raised serious concerns of
development partners 64 .Following recommendations from the functional review to
improve management planning, document management and reporting practices, the State
Chancellery introduced the Consolidated Action Plan (CAP) to serve as the central
instrument for Government planning and reporting. Following implementation of the
CAP, the production of ad-hoc reports was reduced from 60 percent in 2010 to 20 percent


59
   The amendments to the Law On the Public Function and Status of Civil Servant from 2012 laid the basis
for State secretary position. The position was introduced by Government Statutory Act No 155 from
February 28, 2014 On the State Secretary.

   The analysis of the staffing levels in the Moldovan public administration and countries of the former
Soviet Union, as well as some EU countries was done by the Bank staff and offered to an adviser to the
Prime Minister so as to demonstrate that Moldova was on the par with some countries and had less public
employees than other. Development partners expressed serious concerns of the ability to deliver their
programs when staff was being cut from the ministries making them dysfunctional (based on the interview
with Svetlana Proskurovska, TTL for CPAR MDTF in 2006-2009).
                                                  20
in 2012. The medium-term CAP has become an integrated operational planning
framework for all key government strategic planning documents.

58. Sector Expenditure Strategies (SES) have been introduced as a tool for linking the
budget with policy development: 13 out of 16 ministries developed SES in 2012 and 12
ministries submitted SES to the Ministry of Finance to consider in development of
MBTF. In 2014 16 SESs were developed by the ministries and CPAAs, covering the
period 2015-2017. It is however worth noting that, links between policy and budget
remain weak, because MTBF for several budget cycles have not been formally approved
by the Government 65.

59. Finally, efficiency in service delivery has become a central agenda in the reform on
public services modernization. As a result of a review of public services conducted under
the project, 568 services have been catalogued and recommendations on merging,
discontinuing or reorganization have been developed. Three pilots 66 on public
administrative service business processes reengineering and service reorganization led to
improved efficiency and reduced the administrative burden: reduction of administrative
burden after one year of reengineering was estimated MLD (-20.9) million, reduction of
economic costs in 5 years was estimated MLD (-107.95) million 67 . The Government
plans to apply the methodology piloted under the Program and Action Plan for the
Reform of Public Services for 2014-2016, setting targets to reorganize 10 percent of
public services in 2014 with further targets of 30 percent reorganized in 2015 and 50
percent in 2016 68.

   The pilots were conducted in cooperation with the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Health and Ministry of
Agriculture. The pilot services included ‘apostyle’ certification (about 100,000 applicants in 2012),
issuance of birth certificates and one time child benefit (41,991 applicants in 2012); payment of agricultural
subsidies to farmers(4,698 service recipients in 2012). The pilot projects involved reengineering of the
entire process of delivery of respective services and revision of the principles of setting tariffs for those
services.

61. Other Measures of Cost-Effectiveness: While the project struggled through a mix
of implementation issues in the first years and the closing date was extended four times
cumulatively for 62 months, implementation performance did improve and was sufficient
for donors to support expansion of activities and provide additional funding to MDTF.
The initial design evolved to accommodate changing demands on the political and
administrative leadership of the country, demonstrating high level of responsiveness. The
extensions of the closing date did not have negative impact on the project activity costs.
The increase in expenditures was justified by the need for increased capacity building and
the additional scope of activities. Actual expenditures on expenditure categories remained
within the approved budget and savings were realized on incremental operating costs.
Additional resources from exchange rate variations financed an expansion in the scope of
activities without additional donor contributions 69 in December 2012. Project extensions
have required increased budget for implementation support / supervision. However, Bank
staff time and travel costs have been shared with parallel activities so as to contain costs.
More details on implementation, impact of exchange rate policy and costs by component
are provided in Annex 3.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

62. CPAR MDTF project’s contribution to undertaking Government’s first
comprehensive public administration reform after independence, driven by an ambitious
agenda and implemented in low capacity environment, cannot be underestimated and
deserves “satisfactory” rating. The project has achieved its development objective as
measured by PDO level and intermediary result indicators, supporting government
restructuring and establishing legislative foundation and methodological framework for
merit-based professional civil service, effective public administration and transparency
in decision-making. Policy development and implementation capacity has been
strengthened and the project has made significant contribution to improved efficiency in
managing public resources. Shortcomings in achieving PDO indicators are associated
with time delays in achieving the planned results. These delays were related to weak
capacity and weak reform leadership at start-up, and the lack of government experience
in implementing PAR. Low capacity was consistently addressed through an expanded
scope of capacity building activities throughout the project implementation. The initial
implementation delays eventually did not have negative impact on the cost of project
activities and quality of outputs. By the closing date all results planned under the original


69
  Following the World Bank risk mitigation policy for MDTFs with contributions in multiple currencies,
the Grant was adjusted in December 2012 and the adjusted amount of the Grant appeared to be twice higher
(US$1.55 million) than the amount retained to cover exchange rate risks at approval in 2006 (US$ 0.75
million).
                                                  22
and expanded scope of the project have been achieved and institutionalized. Looking
beyond the MDTF Results Framework, there is still room for improvement in
government effectiveness. Implementation of new policies and instruments requires
consistent effort of all government stakeholders. The project has also revealed a few
binding constraints which impact on public administration performance. These include
uncompetitive salaries in CPA, resulting in high turnover of staff at certain key positions
in ministries, and the lack of demand from politicians for evidence-based policy making.
Still, this is an indication of the on-going need for public administration reform as an
extension of results achieved under the project.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

       (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

63. There was no direct impact on poverty, gender or social development. However, by
supporting development of the Government National Development Strategy Moldova
2020, the project contributed to better national development policy planning, prioritizing
and planning implementation of the state interventions to deliver qualitative economic
development and poverty reduction. The National Development Strategy and its
consolidated action plan include measures to reduce inequality and address key
crosscutting themes, such as social inclusion and gender equality70.

       (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

64. Institutional change was central to the project objectives and is discussed at length in
the sections above. Continuity of the institutions created with support of the project is
ensured through both the legal framework on civil service, public administration and
transparency in decision-making 71 and the creation of units responsible for
implementation and monitoring of new policies in the center of Government (State
Chancellery). The sustainability of results still needs to be confirmed over time. The
project was implemented with high level of external local consultants’ participation and
performance may deteriorate as this support is scaled back. Nevertheless, the
Government has increased the staffing of key positions relevant to policy coordination
and civil service management. This provides a good platform for maintaining the level of
central coordination and management of the public administration. Close integration of
capacity building activities with government funded training organization (APA) allowed
for integration of training modules, supporting implementation of institutional
innovations, into the government funded training. Re-subordination of APA to the

Government at the end of 2013 has allowed better alignment of APA trainings with
Government PAR priorities.

          (c ) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

65. The project has significantly impacted the evolution of CPAR agenda, helping to
identify gaps and priorities to be addressed, in the course of CPAR MDTF
implementation. The need for modernization of public services emerged after functional
review has been implemented and government restructured. Based on an analysis of
results and lessons from CPAR implementation, the Government has developed a
roadmap for the next phase of public administration reform, to be implemented in 2014-
2020. Supporting strategic planning instruments development across the government, the
project had positive impact on policy development in all sectors, supporting development
of 50 strategic development programs and 31 public policy proposals for sector specific
reforms. No negative impact of the project was identified.

66. Looking beyond the project results, Moldova public sector performance, as
measured by available international Governance Indicators, reveals improvement on
government effectiveness and regulatory quality; however the implementation of policies
remains relatively weak. The available data on Global Integrity indicator “quality of
public administration and professionalism” for 2008/11 ranks Moldova (69) higher than
ECA average (66) and low income countries average (60). However, performance on the
indicator “implementation gap” for Moldova (30) is lower than ECA average (33) and
low income countries average (34) 72 . The analysis of World Governance Indicators
(WGI) 73 for Moldova for 2005-2012, reveals that the country scores on “government
effectiveness” and “regulatory quality” improved in 2012 as compared to 2005 (Figure
1). It is difficult to establish a precise causal chain between specific project interventions
and scores on these dimensions. However, CPAR MDTF was the major facility, bringing
international technical assistance to support government public administration reform
starting in 2006. The Government’s consistent effort on CPAR implementation has likely
contributed to the improvement of these scores.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

67. No beneficiary survey or stakeholder workshop was conducted specifically for the
purpose of reviewing project performance under preparation of ICRR, however ICRR
team attended the final project workshop that summarized the results and lessons of
CPAR implementation. The agenda of the final workshop, organized by the Government,
is enclosed in Annex 6.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial

68. Most of institutional changes achieved under the project have been built into
legislation, working methods and procedures, and the routine training of civil servants.
However, new HRM practices still have to be translated in improved staff productivity
and enhanced performance of Government ministries and agencies. Staff capacity at civil
service continues to be undermined by uncompetitive pay and high turnover. The
Government does not plan any significant pay increase in the short and medium term
owing to fiscal constraints. Capacity constraints may come to the fore following the
departure of relatively well paid and qualified consultants, even though the project
emphasized the importance of “knowledge transfer”. All these factors may contribute to
an increase in the gap between the laws and procedures adopted as a result of the project

69. Interviews with Government stakeholders in line ministries and international
development partners 74 indicated that implementation of new institutional policies
requires strengthening and some inconsistencies still have to be addressed. These include
the need to review selected labor code policies, prevailing over civil service legislation,
and the need for better synchronization of program budgeting initiative of the Ministry of
Finance with strategic planning, coordinated by the State Chancellery. Though ministries
and CPAAs continue developing sector expenditure strategies, it is not assuring enough
that these SESs will be used continuously in decision making as the Government did not
formally approve the MTBF in several budget cycles in the recent past. In the
environment where ministries capacity for strategic planning is fragile and still
developing, while the demand for evidenced based policy making from politicians and
senior civil servants is weak 75, formal legal enforcement of MBTF is essential. Longer-
term impacts from the new policies will require consistent monitoring and improvement
of implementation practice, identification and addressing of implementation gaps through
further refinement of Government functions and Government decisions.

70. Sustainability issues have been discussed with the Government by the World Bank
Task Team throughout project implementation and some actions have been undertaken
by the Government to diminish these risks 76. However, the continuity of these policies
cannot be guaranteed following Parliamentary elections in November of 2014.

71. The project preparation was undertaken by an experienced team, combining prior
experience and knowledge on design and implementation of public administration
reforms in other countries of ECA region and local knowledge. The team maintained
effective dialogue with other donors in addressing Government request for support of
CPAR and was entrusted by other development partners to design and implement the
project as multi-donor trust fund, supported by three donors at the time of its
establishment. The project development objective, design and mechanism remained
relevant until the project closing for 8 years of the project implementation. At the stage of

the project design the Bank’s trust fund procedures did not require development of
project appraisal document, results matrix and operational risk assessment. However,
monitoring and evaluation framework and risks were identified in the Program Brief.
With introduction of ISR and ORAF requirements for trust funds, these documents were
developed at the stage of implementation.

     (b) Quality of Supervision (including fiduciary and safeguard policies)

Rating: Satisfactory

72. MDTF implementation was supervised on a regular basis as confirmed by the project
Aid Memoires and combined implementation of Bank-Executed Trust Fund, active in
2006-2008. The critical approach, strengthened emphasis on capacity development and
relevant international experience mobilized by the World Bank team in the first years of
the MDTF implementation (including involvement of OECD SIGMA), pushed the
Government to progress on civil service legislation and implementation of functional
review results. The mid-term review was conducted in May-June 2010, after the new
Government took office in 2009, before making decision on the second 24 months
extension and increasing the project scope. The Progress Review mission’s report
provides detailed overview of the project progress and justification for the project
extension. The handover between TTLs in 2009 was effective, ensuring continuity of the
task team 77. All project extensions and restructurings were managed effectively by the
TTLs, in spite of changes in TF procedures in the middle of implementation and related
administrative complexities in processing restructurings. Fiduciary issues were
supervised effectively and reported in a timely fashion. No safeguard policies were
triggered under the MDTF.

74. Staring with prominent support for CPAR at the stage of approval of CPAR Strategy,
Government support appeared to wane from 2006 through to 2008. Lack of strong
political support, delayed decisions on key activities affecting initial achievement of PDO
(such as implementation of functional review recommendations and approval of the civil
service law). Implementation performance improved under the more reform oriented
Government in spring 2008-summer 2009, and still further with the new Government
taking office in 2009, when many technical documents and legal acts, drafted in 2006-
2008, have been approved and enforced. Nevertheless, even at a later stage some of the
relevant legal acts, related to results of CPAR, were approved with some delay: the
Program for public services reform in 2014-2016, regulations on introduction of State
Secretaries position in line ministries, and the launch of HRMIS Civil Service Register
were only approved in February 2014. This highlights continued inefficiencies in inter-
ministerial coordination in legislation drafting and consultations.

     (b) Implementing Agency Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

75. The performance of the Government Office / State Chancellery and its divisions
responsible for different components of CPAR was satisfactory. The Government
Secretary General (Minister of State) – Head of State Chancellery has paid close attention
to the project and followed up on recommendations of the World Bank Task Team. The
PAR Unit 78 suffered from change of managers in the first years of the project
implementation but gradually developed capacity in core CPAR thematic areas and
acquired skills in planning, implementation and monitoring reform activities. Leadership
of civil service component remained stable throughout the whole life of the project. This
facilitated progress in developing and implementing new civil service legislation and
HRM procedures, using diverse approaches to capacity building of the ministries HR
Units (e.g. peer-learning approaches through regular meetings of CPAAs HR Units).
Delays were associated with the lack of relevant capacity and no previous experience of
implementing HRMIS, which extended the process of implementation and launch of
Civil Service Register. But overall, the leadership of the State Chancellery and key
divisions, responsible for the project results, revealed high interest and commitment to
the project and readiness to learn in the course of implementation. This is one of the key
factors of achieving the results planned under PDO.

76. Office of Administrative Support (OAS) has provided satisfactory support to the
project implementation in procurement, financial management and project monitoring.

OAS has retained staff continuity to a great extent and, located in the State Chancellery,
was well integrated into the project activities. The State Chancellery and OAS team are
commendable for assuring smooth project management after the tragic loss of the project
management in November 2012. OAS has successfully finalized the project under the
leadership of the new Head of OAS, appointed in January 2013. The financial
arrangements of the project have been rated satisfactory from the project start. The
project final audit report, prepared in March 2014, contained unqualified audit opinion.


     (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Grantee Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

77. The Government has managed to implement the project and achieve project
development objective, however with delays, caused by the lack of political support to
the project activities in the first two years of the project implementation. Implementation
progress faced significant delays before 2009 and was rated “moderately unsatisfactory”
until February 2010. Implementation performance and progress towards PDO were only
upgraded to “moderately satisfactory” after project leadership had been strengthened
under the new Government. Even then the project experienced delays in the approval of
legislation and regulations due to poor inter-ministerial coordination in legislative
drafting. “Moderately satisfactory” implementation performance rating was maintained
until October 2012 when it was upgraded to “satisfactory” and the latest ISR rated
implementation performance “moderately satisfactory”, reflecting the implementation
progress over the whole lifetime of the project 79. Cooperation with the World Bank and
other donors was satisfactory throughout the project implementation.

6. Lessons Learned

78. Strong Government ownership and commitment to CPAR proved to be essential
for achieving results in the institutional reform project. The history of the project
implementation revealed that progress in implementing institutional change is not
possible without strong government commitment and political support. This is
particularly true when the change if focused on and within a government’s central
administrative bodies. Even though special efforts were made to ensure communication
of the reform to government and non-governmental stakeholders, consensus over new
legislation was not easy to achieve without strong political will in support of CPAR
objectives. Once a reform oriented Prime-Minister assumed leadership of the reform


79
  ISR approved in December 2013 noted, the IP “moderately satisfactory” rating “reflects the
implementation progress over the whole lifetime of the project. The project experienced some
implementation problems, especially during the first years of its implementation”.
                                                   29
agenda in 2008 and with strong Government commitment to CPAR after 2009, the
project started showing results fairly quickly. Committed implementation of HRM
reforms, particularly, recruitment and promotion of technical staff with higher level of
skills, supplemented the political drive for reform implementation. Government
commitment to CPAR after 2009 was a key consideration for the World Bank Task Team
and MDTF donors when deciding on whether to provide additional funding for the
MDTF and expand the scope of activities.

79. Institutional reform such as CPAR depends on staff capacity to absorb and
implement innovations: the importance of a capacity building strategy supporting
implementation of CPAR reforms should not be underestimated. The lack of
experience and weak capacity in reform implementation were acknowledged at the
project design stage, but only in relation to the implementation of project activities.
However, the early years of the reform implementation revealed that the lack of general
understanding of modern public administration standards and institutional reforms
objectives hindered progress. The State Chancellery tackled this constraint by building a
pool of HR managers and policy analysis specialists, making skillful use of international
consultants, organizing study visits, introducing regular peer-learning activities, and
involving of Government training institution in implementation of the reform.

80.     Long-term commitment in supporting government’s reforms implementation
process in the areas of institutional reorganization and capacity building bear fruit
and have a greater chance to lead to more sustainable results. In the case of Moldova,
the results of project interventions started showing after three years only, with increased
attention and resources for capacity development. The capacity of technical and
managerial staff kept improved along the reform implementation process. If at the
beginning of reforms, analytical process and strategy development were mainly led by
external experts, after 2008 the State Chancellery was increasingly in the position to lead
CPAR processes and develop analytical and monitoring reports without additional
external help.

81. Linking Government policies with the budget proves to be a challenging area
and it is hard to make progress in environment, where demand for evidenced based
policy making and budgeting is lacking 80. Though a notable progress was achieved
first with DFID support and then with support of CPAR MDTF in formulating sector
expenditure strategies and strategic development programs, MTBF strategy has not been
formally approved during several budget cycles in the recent past, despite the fact that it
was developed in line with the legal and regulatory framework and taking into account


80
   The Final Report on the consultancy Support to Strengthen Policy Management Capacity, prepared by
Ecorys, UK, in November 2012 indicated the need to focus on creating incentives for political and senior
civil service to demand evidence based policies.
                                                   30
sector development programs. This slippage results in disconnects between government
policy objectives and accountability for financial resources invested by the state in order
to achieve these objectives. Over time, in order to further strengthen accountability and
transparency of the use of public (and donors) funds, it is crucial to ensure that MTBF
gets approved 81.

82. Advisory assistance in the design of public administration reforms and
implementation planning is crucial when undertaking complex administrative
reforms. The Government approach to the implementation of its CPAR Strategy changed
following early donor engagement with the government 82 , recognizing that the low
capacity and lack of experience was an opportunity to step in. Parallel advisory services
provided under the Bank-executed part of CPAR MDTF in 2006-2008, served as a
catalyst for the reform 83 and ensured access to high-level international expertise, secured
through the World Bank “convening power”, on the key priority areas of the reform.
This contributed directly to shaping the new civil service legislation.

83. Effective donor coordination increases the impact of the development assistance
on the institutional reform and reduces administrative burden on the Government.
The coordination of international development partners was remarkable at the stage of the
project design, enabling a rapid response to the Government request to support CPAR:
UNDP and Sida funded the first advisory activities and phase I of the functional review,
while the World Bank Task Team built on these interventions to continue institutional
reforms. The MDTF, administered by the World Bank and funded by a variety of donors,
strengthened the dialogue and coordination among donors. Through the MDTF
instrument donors could pool resources in support of the Government’s overall program
for CPAR (as expressed in its CPAR Strategy) rather individually funding selected
components and activities. The Government has acknowledged the role of CPAR donors
as one of the most important in the whole CPAR implementation process: donors’
support to CPAR reform was critical in ensuring the continuity of CPAR implementation
at the time of political change and the arrival of the new Government in 2009 84.

84. Transparency in institutional reforms implementation is crucial for building
consensus on new policies among Government and non-Government stakeholders.
Indeed, the changes planned under public administration institutional reforms affect a
wide circle of stakeholders within and outside of the Government. Building consensus on
the new policies and administrative procedures is crucial for the success of these reforms.

Communication was recognized a crucial factor for implementation of institutional
changes under CPAR and a separate component was designed as a part of CPAR MDTF
to fund communication and consultations with Government and non-Government
stakeholders. Later the importance of consultations with stakeholders was acknowledged
by the Government to the extent that it was incorporated into decision-making process on
the new policies and national strategies (e.g. it was applied in developing Moldova 2020)
and it was institutionalized through establishing of National Participatory Council.
Feedback of NPC council leadership confirmed the positive impact of participatory and
consultative mechanisms on the quality of government policy proposals.

85. Flexibility in implementation has contributed to successful completion of CPAR,
but required a significant administrative effort by the Bank team constrained by a
modest supervision budget. The Government appreciated the World Bank Task Team’s
responsiveness, accommodating changes in the timeline during the first years of
implementation in order to adjust to low capacity, political change and staff turnover.
Flexibility was also evident at later stages when the scope of the project was expanded
(through additional donor funds) in light of the Government’s increased experience in
implementing reforms and results 85. Since the project was funded under MDTF, timely
extensions and restructurings required a significant administrative effort for the World
Bank Task Team. However, flexibility comes at a cost in terms of supervision time and
effort. This should be taken into account in setting supervision budget allocations. In the
CPAR case project’s flexibility and responsiveness was ensured mainly through the
dedication and focus of the World Bank task team since supervision budgets were
systematically lower than standard coefficients for the region. In the future, the Bank
should ensure that MDTF donors recognize the need to include a Bank-executed
component that provides sufficient funding to cover the costs of fielding a fully engaged
Bank team to provide the close supervision and technical oversight that MDTFs require.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)       Borrower/implementing agencies

86.     The State Chancellery confirmed that CPAR MDTF was reasonably efficient
project which met its immediate and wider objectives and scored well on impact and
sustainability. The important lesson of the project was that public administration reform
was not a one-time exercise but a continuing process of institutional development and it
remains highly relevant for Moldova on-going transition process. The Bank team fully
supports that need to continue public administration reform and plans continuing
cooperation with the Government under the World Bank-Moldova CPS for FY14-17.

87.     The State Chancellery has clarified the history of transformation initially created
PAR Unit in 2006 to the present Department for Coordination of Public Policies, Foreign
Aid and Central Public Administration Reform. Though in December 2012 Personnel
Policy Division was transferred into Central Public Administration Reform Unit and
joined to the Department for Public Policies and Foreign Aid Coordination and Central
Public Administration Reform, the unit continues leading and monitoring implementation
of HRM policy under civil service law. In addition it has undertaken responsibility for
coordination of institutional reorganisations and increased from 5 to 9 staff. Additional
data was provided to supplement description of achievements under the Result
Framework. Detailed comments, provided by the State Chancellery, are presented in
Annex 7 of this report. These clarifications and additional information have been
reflected in the final version of the report in the Result Framework, Annex 2 – Output by
Component and sections 1.4, 2.2, 2.5, 3.2 and 5.2.

(b)    Co-financiers

88.     The Embassy of Sweden in Chisinau noted that the reporting of results in the Data
Sheet Result Matrix are focused on outputs and should correspond more closely to the
fuller outcome descriptions given in the text. The Data Sheet Result Matrix and section
3.2 have been revised to reflect this advice. The Embassy of Sweden in Chisinau also
raised questions regarding the level of risk to the sustainability of the project outcomes.
These concerns have been covered in the risk to the development objective section above.

89.      The DFID expressed support to the report findings and raised two specific
questions: the need to raise salaries across the civil service in order to ensure
sustainability of reforms; and the Bank’s continued interest and role in supporting
Moldova’s future public administration reform plans. In response, the Bank has noted
that in light of Moldova’s fiscal constraints, the Bank will need to conduct an analysis of
the wage bill and pay issues in more detail, before coming to any conclusions on the
feasibility of increasing public sector pay. The Bank also noted that the Bank’s team is at
the beginning discussions on support for a follow on project on public administration
reform as part of the ongoing implementation of the World Bank-Moldova Country
Partnership Strategy. This follow on work will be guided by the Moldovan Government’s
Public Administration Reform Strategy 2014-2020.

As identified in 2010 and addressed in Restructuring of CPAR MDTF in March 2011:
Only 5 line ministries prepared sector expenditures plans with the use of new strategic
planning instruments with support from DFID project. National development strategy is
outdated and does not provide a useful basis for Government medium term activity
planning and budgeting. Only 2 ad-hoc National Participatory Council working groups
created.

   e) Trust Fund Administration

The administration support to CPAR MDTF implementation was provided by the Office
of Administrative Support (OAS), established, in the Government Office (Government
Decision No 1018 of September 5th, 2006) and functioning until the project closing in
February 2014.

Procurement:
   • For the life of the MDTF 126 tenders have been organized by OAS and approved
       by the World Bank.

Financial Management:


                                         52
   •   Daily management of financial arrangements of the project. The latest FM
       supervision in December 2013 confirmed that the financial arrangements were
       adequate and financial control procedures were in place.
   •   Submission of semi-annual un-audited interim financial reports to the World Bank
   •   The project audited financial statements for FY06-FY12 were received on time
       and contained “unqualified” audit opinion with no internal control issues raised
       by the auditors.

Tracking achievement of TF outputs:
   • Contracts management under MDTF
   • Semi-annual and annual reporting
   • Project Completion Report

B. Analytical Advice on Improving Policy and Accountability Framework (Bank-
Executed Activities) will finance analytical and advisory services supporting public
administration and civil service reform. The activities will include, where needed, support
for Client Document Review (CDR) and Institutional Development Plans (IDP).

(a)Strategic policy framework
   •   Consultancy on the design of the system for strategic planning and policy
       coordination. These consultancies helped develop a proposal for mechanisms
       (procedures and instruments) for National Development Planning and develop
       capacity of public officials in the Government Office (later State Chancellery) and
       in line ministries.
   •   Two workshops were conducted in support of the TF goals: (I) on civil service
       practices in the EU and goals for Moldovan administration (attended by
       representatives of the WB, SIGMA/OECD/EU and EU member states, as well as
       participating donors) (ii)on the role of the center of government in policy
       coordination and its alignment with budget planning (attended by practitioners
       from Latvia, Romania, Lithuania, Canada and the Netherlands).

(b)Managerial controls and accountability
   •   This component was aimed at supporting specific change in the administration:
       institutional separation of policy making ministries from executing "agencies".
       However, the government did not demonstrate interest and readiness to
       implement such changes in the structure of public administration in 2006-2008,
       postponing implementation of functional review recommendations. As a result
       approximately US$17,000 of the Bank-executed financing was cancelled.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Economic Rate of Return
As an institutional reform project, where the PDO was formulated in qualitative terms,
quantitative computation of the rate of return is not applicable.

Other Measures of Cost-Effectiveness

Project Implementation. The project was implemented 62 months (five years and two
months) longer than initially planned, however the scope of work was expanded in March
2011 and December 2012 and the total amount of the Grant under MDTF increased by
86% 89 from US$6.15 million at the project start to US$11.45 million at the project
closing (with actual expenditures of 11.44 million or 99.93% of the total grant).

The extensions of the closing date were associated with delays in procurement in the first
years of MDTF operation and consequently delays in disbursement. In summer 2008, 6
months before the original project closing date, only 28.2% of the MDTF amount was
disbursed 90, and at the project review, as of May 31, 2010, 58.4% of the grant had been
spent and 70% of the grant was committed 91. It is worth noting, however, that delays
were also explained by political context and difficulties in getting consensus around civil
service and public administration legislation 92 during the first three years of MDTF
implementation. After the change in Government, when the State Minister has
undertaken responsibilities for project implementation in 2009, the project’s
implementation performance rating improved from “moderately unsatisfactory” to
“moderately satisfactory” and by 2012 to “satisfactory”.

While the project struggled through a variety of implementation issues in the first years
and the closing date was extended four times, implementation performance improved and
was strong enough for the donors to support expansion of activities and provide
additional funding to MDTF. The extensions of the closing date did not have negative
impact on the project activities’ costs. The implementation support / supervision budget
was extended three times, but this was spread over five years. In fact the budget for
supervision of MDTF was very limited and the World Bank Task Team was able to
undertake supervision only because of the opportunity to share costs of the Bank’s staff
time with supervision of parallel activities.


89
   At approval in 2006, 85% (US$6.15 million) of the estimated budget for Recipient-executed activities
under CPAR MDTF were approved for disbursement, while 15% were retained for adjustment of the
amount closure to the end of the project.

Impact of the exchange rate risk mitigation policy. The MDTF benefited from
favorable dynamics of the exchange rate. Following the World Bank risk mitigation
policy for MDTFs with contributions in multiple currencies 93, the Grant was adjusted in
December 2012 and the adjusted amount of the Grant appeared to be twice higher
(US$1.55 million) than the amount retained to cover exchange rate risks at approval in
2006 (US$ 0.75 million). This allowed an expansion of the scope of activities without
additional donor contributions.

Component costs. Actual costs of components (a) Institutional Reorganization and (b)
Government Policy Making Capacity were higher than budgeted primarily because of
new activities and increased scope of capacity building. The use of resources on planned
activities was efficient and did not deviate significantly from the original budget. The
need for increased capacity building was recognized in the first years of the project
implementation, as confirmed by documentations from the World Bank implementation
support missions 94, therefore the increased actual cost on capacity building activities was
justified.

The actual cost of Component (c) Professional Merit-Based Civil Service was slightly
less than initially planned even though all planned activities were implemented and result
indicators relevant to the component were achieved. The creation of the HRMIS Civil
Service Register and a related local consultancy on the Register implementation and
software adaptation exceeded the originally budgeted amount only about 2.6%. Although
delays in implementation of HRMIS was one reason for the extension of project closing
date, this had only a marginal impact on costs.

An increase in the expenditures on component (d) Communication and Transparency in
Government Activities was related to the need for extensive CPAR communication at the
project start with key stakeholders who were influential in decision-making on the reform.
The efficiency of this component improved dramatically after institutionalization of
transparency mechanism through the law on transparency in decision-making,
establishing National Participatory Council and relying on ICT tools in communication.

Implementation of Component (5) Trust Fund Management was cost-effective: the
operating incremental costs were revised downwards during the Project Restructuring in
December 2012 by 58.25 percent. Actuals expenditures on TF management were 9
percent under the revised budget at the project closing.


93
   In compliance with the mentioned policy, the grant amount in the Grant Agreement with the Beneficiary
was determined as 85% of US$ equivalent of donor contributions, calculated with using exchange rates
fixed at the time of Grant Agreement preparation.

Bank-executed activities were planned as a part of MDTF to finance analytical and
advisory services and support the Government in the first years of the MDTF operation 95.
However, in 2006-2008 the Government had not confirmed its readiness for
institutionalization of managerial devolution and Bank-executed part was closed with 90
percent disbursement and 10 percent was cancelled 96.

Grantee’s Comments on Draft ICRR

This was a reasonably efficient project which met its immediate and wider objectives. It
also scored well on impact and sustainability. For example the competitive and equitable
remuneration and incentives policy became an integral part of personnel management
systems across the entire administration.

Modernizing the public administration system is a crucial element of the transition
process in Moldova. The activities implemented under this project helped the
Government of Moldova to make the first steps in transforming the state bureaucracy into
a professional and neutral civil service that is oriented to providing high quality public
services. The important lesson of the project is that public administration reform is not a
one-time exercise but a continuing process of institutional development.

A lot has been accomplished, but a great deal more needs to be done.
    − Continue adaptation of public administration and its functions to the political,
        economic, and social conditions;
    − Strengthen the capacity of local government to assume new managerial tasks and
        responsibilities in a decentralized government structure;
    − Consolidation and improvement of the civil service training and development for
        effective decision-making and management;
    − Improvement of the delivery of public services;
    − Implementation of e-governance throughout the entire government.

Our specific comments to the report are mostly clarification of information. They
include:

PDO Indicator 2 – actual value achieved:
  • “Policies, strategic planning and external assistance division” should be corrected
      to “Department for Coordination of Public Policies, Foreign Aid and Central
      Public Administration Reform” (according to the latest changes operated in
      2013).
  • “Annually the State Chancellery prepares a policy priority framework, to inform
      MTBF” is proposed to be corrected to “Annually the State Chancellery prepares a
      policy priority framework, as a first step in MTBF process”

PDO Indicator 4 – actual value achieved:
  • “Personnel policy division established within the State Chancellery” – please note
      that now it is called Central Public Administration Reform Unit, which is a part of


                                            62
       the Department for Coordination of Public Policies, Foreign Aid and Central
       Public Administration Reform.

Intermediate Indicator 1 – actual value achieved:
    • “The central division for policy coordination” should be corrected to “the
       Division for coordination of Public Policies, Foreign Aid and Central Public
       Administration Reform”

Intermediate Indicator 7 – actual value achieved:
    • “13 ministries used new strategic planning tools for development of sector
       expenditures plans with methodology support from CPAR MDTF in the context
       of preparing MBTF 2013-2015” (dated 10/10/13) is proposed to be changed to
       later data available by project completion 02/28/14 “In 2014 11 ministries and 2
       CPAA’s (Academy of Science and Tourism Agency) developed 16 SES (Ministry
       of Environment has 2 and Ministry of Economy has 3) for the period 2015-2017”.

Intermediate Indicator 8 – actual value achieved:
    • “Moldova 2020 national strategic vision document finalized through participatory
       process and is under implementation” – it is proposed to add number of the law,
       approving the national strategy – the national strategy was approved by the Law
       No.166 of 11.07.2012.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

Paragraph 10
   • “Government Office (which became State Chancellery after 2010 Government
       restructuring), with emphasis on the Public Administration Reform Unit (later
       transformed into Division for Public Policies and Foreign Aid Coordination and
       Central Public Administration Reform) and Personnel Policy unit” - CPAR
       includes the personnel policy, so there is no “personnel policy” in the name of the
       division.

2.2 Implementation

Paragraph 29 (paragraph 30 in the final version)
   • “before reorganization of the Government Office into the State Chancellery,
       project implementation was supervised by the Head of Public Administration
       Reform Coordination Unit” – the correct title of the Unit at that time was “Policy
       and Foreign Aid Coordination Unit”

2.5 Post-completion Operation / Next Phase


                                           63
Paragraph 39.
   • “Personnel Policy Division” does not exist as a separate division, as personnel
       policy is a part of CPAR, the unit has been re-named into “Central Public
       Administration Reform Unit”.

   •   HR Units from each public authority continue to implement the civil service
       normative framework (personnel procedures) and develop their community of
       professionals. We suggest mentioning it in the paragraph.

   •   “APA has incorporated training modules developed under CPAR in its curriculum
       which is now funded by the state budget” – In 2013, 1305 civil servants were
       trained at the Academy of Public Administration and in 2014, 1290 will receive
       training.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objective (Efficacy)

Paragraph 46.
   • “Strategic Planning and Policy Analysis Units” – according to Government
       Decision 168/2010: Analysis, Monitoring and Evaluation of Public Policy Units”.

Paragraph 47.
   • “A number of new strategic planning and policy analysis instruments were
       introduced as a result of project support, including: … sector expenditure
       strategies (SESs) for Medium-term Budget Framework (MBTF) (2013-2015) -
       we would not specify to a certain period, especially that SESs were introduced
       before 2013-2015 cycle. The process itself is important.

   •   “If in 2010 only 5 ministries used new strategic tools for SESs development on a
       pilot basis under parallel DFID funded project, CPAR MDTF allowed
       methodological support to implementation and roll out of new strategic planning
       tools in 13 ministries in the context of preparing MBTF 2013-2015” - in 2014: 11
       ministries and 2 CPAA’s (Academy of Science and Tourism Agency) developed
       16 SES (Ministry of Environment has 2 and Ministry of Economy has 3) for the
       period 2015-2017.

Paragraph 50
   • “…and establishing the National Participatory Council (NPC) in January 2010
       (www.particip.md)” - State Chancellery introduced the “Participation module”
       which is the technical solution for organizing public consultations online: simple
       and transparent. The correct web page is: www.particip.gov.md



                                           64
Paragraph 57
   • “Sector Expenditure Strategies (SES) have been introduced as a tool for linking
       the budget with policy development: 13 out of 16 ministries developed SES in
       2012 and 12 ministries submitted SES to the Ministry of Finance to consider in
       development of MBTF” - in 2014: 11 ministries and 2 CPAA’s (Academy of
       Science and Tourism Agency) developed 16 SES (Ministry of Environment has 2
       and Ministry of Economy has 3) for the period 2015-2017.

5.2 Grantee Performance – (b) Implementing agency performance

Paragraph 75 (paragraph 74 in the final version)
   • “The PAR Unit suffered from change of managers….” - There should be a
       clarification that PAR Unit, as a subdivision was only in 2006-2007. Then it was
       transformed in 2 distinct divisions: Policy and foreign aid coordination division
       (names has been changed several times, for example: Division of analysis of
       policy coordination in 2007, Division for policy and foreign aid coordination in
       2008, Division for policy coordination, strategic planning and foreign aid in 2010)
       and Personnel policy division. In December 2012 they were combined in one
       Department, for policy and foreign aid coordination and central public
       administration reform.

Annex 2 – Output by Component -(d)Change Management and Information and
Communication

Outputs
   • “80% of draft policy documents are being subject to consultations” - In 2013,
       85% of documents approved by the Government were consulted with citizens and
       civil society. Recommendations accepted / received from NGO: 563/1463.
       Recommendations accepted / received from the public: 69/425.


Summary of Grantee’s Completion Report

The Central Public Administration Reform, launched in 2005, has put forward a
comprehensive approach and systematic effort, and was targeted towards a transparent,
predictable, responsible, and efficient public administration, which would meet the
society’s demands and correspond to the European standards. In December 2005, the
Government approved a CPAR Strategy and a three-year (2006-2008) Implementation
Plan (Government Decision No.1402).

At the Government’s request, several development partners (the Government of Sweden,
the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of Netherlands) have

                                           65
decided to allocate financial assistance to support the design and the implementation of
the reform. The Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF), in the amount of US$6.15 million
and administered by the International Development Association, was aimed at
supporting the implementation of the reform program outlined in the Strategy and
included several components: (i) institutional reorganization, (ii) Government’s policy
making capacity, (iii) merit-based professional civil service, (iv) management,
information and communication, (v) TF management. The Trust Fund was to be
disbursed during the period of July 2006 – December 2008. The timeline for the MDTF
coincided with the government term, and followed the electoral cycle.

After three years the implementing team changed and it took some time for the new team
to reach its optimal capacity. Thus, during the period of 2006-2013, the MDTF was
amended several times with the extension of implementation period from three to
seven years over 2006 - February 2014, and the total budget of 11,450,000 USD. .In
2011 and 2012 new activities to the planned support were added.


Main Achievements: Reorganization of CPA

The Project has conducted a horizontal functional review (HFR) of five big policy
sectors, represented by all government ministries and approximately 160
subordinated government bodies. Recommendations for optimization of allocation
of functions among government entities have been developed and partially
implemented. The beginning of this activity was supported by the UNDP, which was
able to quickly mobilize resources to start the HFR prior to MDTF approval.

While the previous Government made limited use of the functional review
recommendations, reorganization undertaken by the current Government in 2010-2012 was
strongly guided by the functional review findings. As a result, better separation of policy
development from implementation function has been achieved. Consolidation of the
Government structure was also achieved by cutting the number of central public
administration bodies from 29 to 24 and the number of government agencies from 16 to 8.

The rich analysis has become a useful basis for the development and promotion of the law
on organization of the central specialized public administration, which was approved in
2012 and introduced a sound legal basis for the organization, subordination, monitoring
and accountability of public administration authorities for their performance. The State
Chancellery on a regular basis screens any normative draft to ensure that the organizational
system adheres to the set of principles developed as part of the functional review. In
addition, the government has realized the need to better regulate administrative functions of
the government and together with the SIGMA Program’s experts developed a concept of
the law on administrative procedures that binds civil servants to adhere to the due process in
making decisions regarding right of the citizens and businesses.
                                              66
After the improvement of the Government structure as a whole, and improvements done
in the structure of each public authority (regulations, division of functions,
responsibilities, etc.), it has been decided to go further and to modernize the public
service delivery process. Thus, with the MDTF support, a comprehensive review of
public services was conducted, new Vision document on public services and the
Government Program of public services’ modernization was developed, and is to be
approved. Based on concepts and solutions identified in Vision Document, a draft Law
on Public Services is now finalized (after consultations with the Department and the e-
Government Centre). Such systemic law, according to the best international practice, is
recommended solution to ensure a common legislative framework for the whole reform
to be implemented in a uniform style.

In parallel to setting up a comprehensive conceptual framework and tools for its
implementation during 2014 – 2016, project experts have prepared Methodology for Public
Service Reengineering, which provides a step-by-step guidance on how to approach
reengineering process within any public administration institution providing services to
citizens. Three pilot projects were carried out in cooperation with public institutions. Three
public service reengineering plans were prepared as a result.

Calculations based on proposed methodology suggest that if these reengineering plans
would be implemented, a MDL 32,55 million/per year administrative burden currently
placed on citizens and businesses would be removed. Investments needed to implement
these measures are only MDL 6,65 million during the first year that are outweighed by
cost reduction to clients and benefits from efficiency gains in public administration.

So, the project’s assistance ensured continuity and efficiency of the reforms and showed
that it is needed to reengineer processes before they are digitized to avoid investment into
badly formed and run public services.

Main Achievements: Government’s Policy Making Capacity

Moldova has developed and introduced an effective strategic planning and policy
coordination system. An institutional capacity, in terms of a dedicated policy coordination
unit, has been established in the State Chancellery and competent staff has been hired and
trained. Methodologies for development of National Development Strategy and sector
strategies (linked to government policy priority goals) have been introduced. Each Central
Public Administration Authority (CPAA) has developed and approved its Strategic
Development Program, which includes policy objectives and institutional capacity building
objectives. The National Development Strategy “Moldova 2020” serves as a policy
framework for developing a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF).


                                              67
A system of ex-ante policy impact analysis has been developed and introduced for most
important policies. Prior to final approval, policy options are being discussed at the
Strategic Planning Committee, chaired by the Prime Minister. The capacity to develop
policy at the sector level has been enhanced through setting up dedicated strategic
planning and policy analysis units in line ministries. The staff in these units has been
trained in the Academy of Public Administration that offers a training module on
strategic planning. Additional hands-on trainings on procedures introduced through new
regulatory acts and methodologies have been conducted by the State Chancellery’s staff
and supporting consultants with minimal cost impact.

It is to mention that the Academy of Public Administration prior to the MDTF has
not offered any topical training course, but rather had delivered informational
seminars to officials, mostly at the local government level. The capacity of APA
was developed under the PFM Project, as well as with the support and guidance of
the State Chancellery and contracting out trainings using the MDTF funds.

Main Achievements: Merit-based Professional Civil Service

Substantial progress has been achieved in the development of a merit based civil
service. The new Law on Public Office and Status of Civil Servant, drafted in line
with the EU good practice, was adopted in July 2008 and entered into force as of
January 1, 2009. The main achievement of the law was to introduce a merit-based
selection and promotion of administrative officials, and separating rules governing
political and administrative officials. Implementing government regulations on
competitive selection, performance appraisal, probation period, preparation of job
descriptions, recruitment, etc. have been approved and are being implemented. In
total, seven new human resource (HR) management procedures have been introduced.
The current legislative framework presents a good basis for a modern Civil Service,
according to the expert evaluators’ review, and is a significant step forward compared
to the system that existed when the Strategy for Central Public Administration Reform
was passed in 2005. The management of the civil service became transparent, rule
based, with emphasis placed on professional development, performance and ethics.

A Personnel Policy Division was established within the State Chancellery, and its
capacity for enforcement of the civil service law and coordination of HR units is being
continuously strengthened. A network of personnel managers has been established to
facilitate a uniform implementation of civil service rules and procedures across the
civil service. Training in application of new civil service rules has been implemented.
More than 300 of workshops for HR personnel and for management and executive
personnel were organized over the lifetime of the MDTF.



                                           68
Main Achievements: Management, Information and Communication

The MDTF supported the development of a communication program in relation to the
Central Public Administration Reform to ensure awareness, understanding and support to
CPAR measures aimed at improving transparency, professionalism, and ethics in the
civil service. Routinely, the Government adopted annual plans for implementation of
the CPAR and prepared annual reports on its implementation. The reports have been
posted on the CPAR web page on the Government portal. During 2006 - early 2008,
quarterly meetings on PAR for the Government, NGOs and Donor Com- munity were
organized to present the progress on PAR implementation. Later Governments did not
continue with this practice. However, initially introduced as project activity, first
consultants and then the staff responsible for public administration reform, started
publishing regular bulletins on civil service, strategic planning, policy coordination,
supplemented by an overview of international public administration reform practices.
These bulletins are being disseminated electronically and posted on the CPAR portal.
Thus the project helped institutionalize better transparency of the CPAR process and
accountability to the public on CPAR implementation.

Main Achievements: Trust Fund Management

The project was well integrated into activities of the State Chancellery. It has benefitted
from continuous necessary political support, as well as from close supervision by the
Prime Minister through a designated advisor.

The project steering arrangements have changed throughout implementation. Under the
current arrangements, Government Strategic Planning Committee chaired by the Prime
Minister plays the role of the steering committee for the project.

The Office of Administrative Support (OAS) for the project, based on World Banks’
assessment and audit reports, has provided highly satisfactory support to Project
implementation. The main functions that the OAS carries out are procurement, financial
management, contract management and project monitoring. The continuity of the OAS
staff has helped the State Chancellery to maintain satisfactory rating for MDTF
implementation.

Conclusions

The understanding of the CPAR reform evolved during its implementation.
Importantly, the technical leaders of the project have been the main drivers of the
reform implementation. They were learning throughout the process and evolved as
seasoned managers of the public sector management reforms capable of developing
customized solutions for the Moldovan administrative and cultural environment. Given
that the evolving vision presented more specific understanding on how MDTF (and
                                          69
CPAR) objectives could be better attained, the World Bank’s team supported changes to
the initially agreed activities.

Based on the Result Monitoring Matrix and the external assessment commissioned by
the project, more than 90 percent of initially planned results and activities have been
achieved. In cases when the result has been achieved much later than planned, the main
reason was mostly a lack of political will or limited capacities of the counterparts.

Better governed institutional system, enhanced transparency of the civil service
management, enhanced skills in policy management, predictable human resource
management framework, supported by the newly implemented HRMIS, ongoing
improvements in service delivery, prioritized policies, qualitative ex-ante assessments and
public policies, strategic planning systems at the level of central public authorities, as
well as professional civil servants in CPAAs – these are just a few results and outcomes
of the central public administration reform implemented during 2006-2013.

Annex 8. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders
CPAR MDTF was funded by the DFID (UK), Sweden / Sida, and the Government of the
Netherlands. Comments to the draft report have been provided by The Embassy of
Sweden in Chisinau and DFID. These comments are summarized in section 7 of the
report Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners. Full
version of the DFID comments is provided below.

Comments from Brian Penny, Europe Department, DFID

Thank you for letting me see this report.

As you know DFID no longer operates in Moldova. I have read the document as you
have requested. I no longer have the option of referring the draft to advisory colleagues
so my comments below are simply observations on the document.

Just the same the report is highly encouraging. It describes the situation in Moldova as I
remember it at the time particularly the slow progress made at the beginning of the
project and the subsequent improvement as the reform minded Prime Minster took office.
The first few pages of PFO indicators set the tone of the report well with comments that
nearly all the PDO indicators had been achieved compared to the original Baseline Value.
The extent of the changes made as a result of this project seem to be impressive given the
Government’s limited capacity. The text describes some highly encouraging events
during the course of the project notably the significant number of employees trained, the
introduction of performance appraisal and that 70.7 % of civil servants employed in 2012
were hired based on merit (presumably this is a good figure). I was amazed that the
project had to be extended four times and the final amount of funding at the time of
project closure- albeit against the backdrop of a programme that was achieving results.
Clearly the Government has not finished reforming yet with a PAR Strategy in place for
2014-2020.

The only concern I have is about staff salary. The report describes the introduction of a
unified salary grid introduced in April 2012 but later in the text describes the high
turnover of staff because of the low remuneration of staff and that this has a negative
impact on the sustainability of the reform. Presumably the salary grid is fully operational
and is effective in allocating pay awards according to responsibility – is the point here
that salaries really need to be raised across all grades?

The Government is clearly looking to do more work on PAR but it’s not clear whether
the World Bank will continue its support beyond this project. Is it the World Bank’s
intention to continue to remain engaged with Moldova to build on what has already been
achieved? I know from my role working on the European Neighbourhood Instrument that
the EC will provide PAR assistance- is that in place of World Bank support or will it be
                                            71
complementary? Presumably UNDP is also contributing. It would be useful to know
where support for the 2014-2020 strategy is coming from.

Overall a good report and one that I’m happy to support.
