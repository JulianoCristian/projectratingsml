    improve periodic maintenance of the trunk road network,\n            including bridges, and to strengthen the institutions\n            concerned with transport infrastructure.  It will achieve\n            this by providing rehabilitation of about 570 kilometers of\n            roads and repair, replacement, or widening of about 30\n            bridges.  The project also provides equipment for workshops\n            and quality-control laboratories, training in bitumen\n            emulsion technology and equipment fleet management, as well\n            as assistance with project execution, and technical\n            assistance to the Transport Coordinating Committee, within\n            the Ministry of Transport.  The main project benefit will be\n            the direct savings to highway users arising from reduced\n            vechicle operating costs, fewer bridge closings, improved\n            periodic maintenance, and improved transport planning and management."}, "docdt": "1985-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
