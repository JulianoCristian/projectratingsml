The project did\n            not fully achieve its objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development was modest, sustainability is\n            likely, and both the Bank and Borrower performed\n            satisfactorily. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, it is important during appraisal to take the\n            time necessary to ensure that institutional arrangements are\n            adequate to implement the project. Second, accurate\n            estimates of civil works costs require thorough inspections\n            and condition surveys during identification and appraisal.\n            Third, consultant engineers and economists preparing project\n            designs and costs cannot be relied upon to deliver\n            appropriate and accurate products without a thorough review\n            by the Bank and Borrower. Fourth, when the implementing\n            agency is inexperienced in dealing with international\n            contractors and large contracts, the supervisory role for\n            the Bank substantially increases. Fifth, the use of\n            standardized bidding documents should be mandated to limit\n            bidding problems and contractor claims. Finally, technology\n            transfers work best when counterpart staff are expressly\n            assigned to the project from its inception and continuity is assured."}, "docdt": "1994-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
