SUBJECT: Project Completion Note on Lebanon
Reconstruction Project (Loan 1476-LE)
Attached is the Project Completion Note (PCN) for the Lebanon Reconstruction Project (Loan
1476-LE, for US$50 million, approved in FY78), prepared by the Middle East and North Africa Regional
Office.
The project's goal was to assist the Government of Lebanon in its reconstruction efforts
following the civil war. It was designed to: (i) rehabilitate the Port of Beirut; (ii) rehabilitate the
telecommunications system; (iii) address urgent needs in water, sewerage, and sanitation; and (iv)
undertake studies to prepare critical projects in urban reconstruction and regional development.
Hostilities, however, did not stop as anticipated and after several extensions of the closing date,
the project was canceled in June 1985. Total disbursements amounted to almost US$29 million.
Because of the security situation Bank staff were unable to travel to Lebanon from 1983 until
1992. As a result, a full Project Completion Report for this credit was not prepared, and the attached
PCN is provided instead of a full PCR. While the PCN does not mention it, it appears that the
investments financed by the project were later destroyed. Thus OED rates outcome as unsatisfactory,
sustainability as unlikely, and institutional development as negligible.
The PCN itself is inadequate because it is based solely on the limited information available on
this project in Bank files and makes no use of recent informnation gathered in the preparation of similar
projects now being financed by the Bank and other multilaterals in Lebanon.
No audit is planned.

Project Completion Note
Preface
1.     On July 5, 1977, the Bank approved a loan of US$50.0 million (Loan 1476-LE) to the
Government of Lebanon (GOL) to assist the Government in its reconstruction efforts following
the civil war. After a slow start, some components of the project picked up speed and started
implementing, only to be interrupted again and again by the resumption of hostilities. After
several extensions to the Closing Date. from December 31, 1979 to June 30, 1985, the Bank
decided not to honor a further request for extension by GOL, because the security situation made
it extremely dangerous for Bank staff supervising the project. Total disbursements amounted
to US$28,961,566.47 and the undisbursed balance of US$21,038,433.53 was cancelled.
2.    This Project Completion Note (PCN) has been prepared in lieu of a Project Completion
Report (PCR), because of the age of the project and the insufficiency of data for a full PCR.
The PCN was prepared by the Private Sector Development and Infrastructure Division of
Department II of the Middle East and North Africa Region (MN2PI), based on information in
Bank files.
This document has a restricted distribution and may be used by recipients only in the performance of their

Introduction
2.1   By the beginning of 1977, the civil war in Lebanon had set back the country's economic
and social progress by several years. It had left deep scars on Beirut where the central business
district, the port, and several suburbs were devastated, several other cities, and a large number
of villages. There was extensive destruction in all sectors, but especially in housing, trade and
public services. In addition to the damage and destruction, public services further deteriorated
because of the inability of civil servants to go to their offices for security reasons; a large
number of competent staff looked for and found employment in the neighboring countries of the
region, many of them never to return.
2.2   In October, 1976, the fighting had stopped and economic recovery was underway in the
whole country, save the South. Government and banking services resumed operations in
January, 1977; in March 1977 the Ministry of Finance resumed collection of tax revenues. In
December, 1976, the Lebanese Parliament gave the President of the Republic and the Council
of Ministers full legislative powers (until June, 1977) to restore security and launch the
reconstruction of the country. The major task of the new Cabinet was the reactivation of the
economy, through the restoration of public services to their pre-war levels.



-3 -
2.3   After a broad preliminary assessment of the damage, the Government contacted potential
donors and specifically requested the assistance of the Bank. A Bank mission visited Lebanon
in February/March, 1977 to review the reconstruction and development priorities set out by the
Government as well as the needs and available resources and, in the light of the findings of a
previous IMF/Bank mission, determine how the Bank could most effectively assist in Lebanon's
reconstruction. It reviewed needs in transportation, education, telecommunications, agriculture
and low-cost housing. A subsequent mission to Lebanon in April assessed the needs in the water
supply and sewerage sector. The outcome was the (First) Reconstruction Project.
3.    Project Objectives and Description
Project Obiectives
3.1   The objective of the project was to provide emergency assistance to GOL, in support of
its reconstruction efforts, through the restoration of a minimum level of key public services, to
allow for the resumption of Lebanon's regional role as a service center. At the same time, the
Bank would provide planning advice in the sectors in which it would be involved to ensure
consistency among major investment projects.
3.2   The inmmediate objective of Bank assistance was to help finance, in coordination with
other external sources, (i) the rehabilitation of the port of Beirut; (ii) the rehabilitation of the
telecommunications system; (iii) the most urgent rehabilitation needs in the water, sewerage and
sanitation sector, as well as a study program for its further reconstruction and development; and
(iv) studies to prepare projects in critical areas of urban reconstruction and regional development
(low-cost housing in Beirut, industrial estates and rural development in deprived regions of
Lebanon, and possibly, the creation of a country-wide mass transit system).
Project Components
3.3   Total project cost was estimated at US$83.6 million, equivalent, of which US$60.0
million would be in foreign currency and US$23.6 million equivalent in local currency. The
Bank loan would finance $50.0 million (about 83.3 percent) of the foreign exchange component;
the balance of $10.0 million in foreign currency would be provided through export credits. The
Financing Plan is shown in Table 1 below. The project, as appraised, comprised the following
four major parts (detailed components are listed in Annex I; Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement
is presented under Annex II):
Beirut Port - (US$32.4 million, 39 percent of the total estimated cost) included the
provision of cargo handling equipment, transit sheds and warehouses, and general marine
equipment. The facilities to be rebuilt under the sub-project would cover about 40
percent of the area destroyed. The sub-project also included provision of technical



support to the Ministries of Public Works and Water Resources responsible for port
supervision and to the company responsible for port operations, the Societe Generale
d'Exploitation du Port (SGE). The consultants would develop recommendations for the
reform of the port sector, to be discussed with the Bank within two years of loan
approval.
Telecommunications - (US$33.7 million, 40 percent of the total estimated cost) included
equipment necessary for the restoration of the telecommunications system and provision
of a minimum service in areas into which population had moved as a result of the civil
war dislocation. It also included the provision of technical support to the Ministry of
Posts and Telephones (PTT) to carry out the rehabilitation works and the preparation of
recommendations aimed at introducing financial and management practices akin to those
of commercial enterprises for operation and development of telecommunications. The
consultants  would  develop  recommendations  for the  reorganization  of the
telecommunications sector, to be discussed with the Bank within two years of loan
approval.
Water, Sewerage and Sanitation - (US$16.1 imillion, 19 percent of the total estimated
cost) included the replacement of portions of the water distribution system and
maintenance equipment, the provision of leak detection equipment and training of
operators for the equipment, and the rehabilitation of the solid waste treatment plant. It
also included provision of consultant services to assist the local authorities in carrying
out rehabilitation works and reviewing water utility organization, management and
finance*.  On the basis of recommendations developed by the consultants, the
Government would prepare proposals for reorganizing water utility in Greater Beirut and
introducing progressive rates. These proposals and their implementation would be
discussed with the Bank no later than December 31, 1978.
*F   In 1974, a law was passed, establishing five Regional Authorities to assume responsibility
for the sector but, with the advent of the war, the enabling legislation was not passed and
the restructuring was not carried out.



-5 -
Studies - (US$1.4 million, 2 percent of the total estimated cost) comprised the
preparation of projects for urban reconstruction and regional development. Urban
Reconstruction would assist the population of the slum belt around Beirut to rebuild and
improve their homes and living conditions. The sub-project included (i) rehabilitation of
damaged physical and social infrastructure and construction of new social and community
facilities; (ii) reconstruction and improvement of low cost housing; and (iii) an
employment generation program through rehabilitation and the promotion of small scale
enterprises to increase the income earning opportunities of the population. Industrial
Decentralization would help prepare the outline of a policy paper on industrial
decentralization through the development of industrial estates in areas outside Beirut,
such as the North, the South, and the Bekaa Valley. Rural Development would include
the appointment of consultants for the preparation of integrated rural development
projects for the most deprived regions of the country. Mass Transit would comprise the
preparation of a mass transit system along the coast with inland connections, as an
economic means of enhancing mobility between different parts of Lebanon and its capital.

3.4  In April, 1983, upon the request of the Government, the Bank amended the project
description and revised Schedules 1 and 2 to the loan agreement to reflect (a) an expansion of
the project description for the Port component to include resurfacing works and construction of
a workshop; (b) the deletion of a comprehensive study on water utility organization, management
and financing in Lebanon, and its inclusion in a Second Reconstruction Project; and (c) deletion
of studies for Urban Reconstruction, Industrial Decentralization, and Rural Development, mainly
because they were likely to cost more than the amount allotted and were expected to be carried
out partially with financing from bilateral sources.  The revised Schedule 1 to the Loan
Agreement as amended is shown in Annex III.



- 6 -
4.    Project Design and Organization
4.1   The project was designed as an emergency reconstruction project to assist the
Government to restore essential public services to their pre-war level. Project components were
well conceived and designed and would have fulfilled the major part of the objectives had
hostilities not been resumed.
5.    Project Implementation
Loan Effectiveness and Project Start-up
5.1   The project became effective on time and imnplementation started immediately. All sub-
projects benefitted from emergency assistance projects financed by USAID and were
continuations of the work done by the Agency. There was no delay in project start-up, but the
intermittent recurrence of fighting adversely affected the progress of the work.
Construction
5.2   All the civil works under the Port and Telecommunications sub-projects were completed
and all the necessary equipment was procured. The civil works in the Port included construction
of: 7 transit sheds, 6 warehouses, a workshop and the resurfacing of Mole III. The equipment
comprised electric and diesel fork lift trucks, tipper trucks, loaders, tractors and cargo-handling
equipment. The Telecommunications component covered the rehabilitation of part of the
telephone network, and partial restoration of cable and telex services. The equipment included
the provision of switching equipment, battery chargers, and wiring. The consultants' services
provided under the project were not used. The work under the Water Supply, Sewerage and
Sanitation component was limited to technical assistance (partly used) and the procurement of
equipment, for leak detection, maintenance and replacement of damaged sections. Civil works
for rehabilitation of the solid waste incinerator was not carried out.
Procurement
5.3   In general, the procurement of goods, works and services was in conformity with the
Bank's Guidelines and the legal documents. There was one case of mis-procurement. A
contract for long distance cables, at a total cost of US$1.0 million, was not awarded in
accordance with Bank Guidelines for procurement. Management decided, on April 17, 1980,
that the Bank would not finance the contract but, taking into account the extenuating
circumstances caused by the prevailing situation in Lebanon, the corresponding amount of the
Loan was not cancelled.



-7 -
Studies
5.4   As mentioned under Para. 3.4 above, the studies for Urban Reconstruction, Industrial
Decentralization, and Rural Development were cancelled from the project upon the
Government's request.  The study for Mass Transit was commenced but only partially
completed; GOL decided not to utilize loan proceeds for the payment of the consultant's fees,
which were settled from other sources.
Implementation Delavs
5.5   Major implementation delays were caused by long periods of heavy fighting. The project
also suffered from the multiplicity of agencies involved. This was most important in the Port
because (i) there was serious in-fighting between the Port Authority (which was under the
tutelage of the Ministry of Public Works) and the CGE (which reported to the Ministry of
Hydraulic Resources).  Furthermore, the Executive Council for Major Project in Beirut
(CEGPVB) was dissatisfied because it was left out of the decision making process. CDR was
a new organization that had the powers of a super-ministry but had not built up sufficient
experience in dealing with complex projects.
Closing Date Extensions and Completion
5.6   The original closing date of the project (December 31, 1979) was extended three times,
up to June 30, 1985. In July, 1985 the Bank informed the Government that it would not honor
its request for a further extension of the closing date, because of the security situation, which
made it extremely difficult for Bank staff to supervise the implementation of the project, but
would keep its books open up to December 31, 1985 in order to allow for final disbursements
against commitments made prior to June 30, 1985.  The unutilized balance of the loan,
$21,038,433.53 was cancelled.
Project Cost and Disbursement
5.7   Of the total amount of US$50.0 million in the loan, total disbursements were
US$28,961,566.47. Annex IV gives a comparative presentation of the amounts allocated, by
Category, in the original loan agreement, the revised Schedule 1 and final disbursements.
6.    Project Results
6.1   The objectives of the project were only partially achieved because of the security
situation. However, the project had beneficial results for Lebanon, especially in the Port of
Beirut, because it helped lay the foundation for the future resumption of port operations with the
restoration of peace.



-8 -
7.    Bank Performance
7.1   Throughout the life of the project, the Bank was supportive of the Government's efforts
to restore public services, at least to their pre-war levels.  Bank staff meticulously and
conscientiously carried out their supervision duties at great physical risk to themselves.
8.    Borrower Performance
8.1    Under the circumstances, the Borrower's performance was quite satisfactory.  Civil
servants undertook major risks reporting to work and still carried out their duties as required.
As a new agency having to deal with the Bank and other funding agencies, the CDR carried out
its responsibilities in a satisfactory manner.
9.    Bank - Borrower Relationship
9.1   The relationship between the Bank's missions and GOL and CDR was cordial. Similarly,
relations between GOL and senior Bank management was frank and cordial.
10.   I essones Learnied
10.1  Given the Bank's structure before the 1987 Reorganization, the project was somewhat
complex because it covered not only several government agencies but also spread over four
sectoral divisions across the Bank - Transportation, Energy and Industry, Water Supply and
Sanitation, and Urban Development (for some of the studies). It is difficult to avoid multi-
sectoral projects in the case of emergency and the Bank is now better structured to deal with
them. The execution of studies also proved to be problematic. This indicates that the inclusion
of components that have long-term planning and development objectives in a project of an
emergency nature should be carefully assessed vis a vis Government capability to implement
them.
