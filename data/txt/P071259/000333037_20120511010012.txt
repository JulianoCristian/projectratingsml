2.      Project Implementation Progress: The Project has been rated moderately satisfactory
for the Project Development Objective and Implementation Progress in the last 5 ISRs. This is
due to the lag in implementation and the subsequent disbursement lag of 20%. The lag in
implementation is primarily due to the delay in the effectiveness of the Additional Finance of 23
months resulting from the delay in meeting the effectiveness condition of the clearance of the
Government arrears to the Lusaka Water and Sewerage Corporation. Once effectiveness was
declared (April 2011), implementation progress has improved, and it is likely that the Project
will disburse 100% of the funds and achieve a satisfactory PDO and IP by Project closing, if an
extension is granted. This view was supported by a recent review by AFTOS of MS projects.
From the parent project, 72% of the SDR 15.7 million IDA credit has been disbursed and 0% of
Additional Financing (SDR 6.5 million IDA credit) has been disbursed. The current closing
date is June 30, 2012.

3.      Change Being Requested: Two changes are requested: (i) an extension of the credit
closing date by 12 months to June 30, 2013. The extension is needed to allow the current works
and goods contracts to be completed on time due to the delay caused by the effectiveness delay;
and (ii) fund reallocation from Category 3 (Refund of Project Preparation Advance) and
Category 5 (Unallocated) to Category 1 (Works, Goods and Consultant Services). These
reallocated funds will finance activities agreed in the Procurement Plan.

                                     Restructuring Paper


1.      The closing date for Zambia, Water Sector PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT
PROJECT, Credit Nos. 4550-ZA, and 42330-ZA, P071259 will be extended from June 30, 2012
until June 30, 2013.

2.      Project Implementation Progress: The Project has been rated moderately satisfactory
for the Project Development Objective and Implementation Progress in the last [5] ISRs. This
is due to the lag in implementation and the subsequent disbursement lag of 20%. The lag in
implementation is primarily due to the delay in the effectiveness of the Additional Finance of 23
months resulting from the delay in meeting the effectiveness condition of the clearance of the
Government arrears to the Lusaka Water and Sewerage Corporation. Once effectiveness was
declared (April 2011), implementation progress has improved, and it is likely that the Project
will disburse 100% of the funds and achieve a satisfactory PDO and IP by Project closing, if an
extension is granted. This view was supported by a recent review by AFTOS of MS projects.
From the parent project, 72% of the SDR 15.7 million IDA credit has been disbursed and 0% of
Additional Financing (SDR 6.5 million IDA credit) has been disbursed. The current closing
date is June 30, 2012.

3.     The proposed extension is necessary to allow the current works and goods contracts to
be completed on time due to the delay caused by the effectiveness delay. The Borrower has
submitted a disbursement plan to disburse 100% of the funds by the revised closing date. The
Bank team has reviewed the plan and assessed it to be a realistic and credible plan.

4.      This will be the second extension of the credit closing date. The original project was
extended by 24 months as part of the preparation of the Additional Financing. This extension is
due to the delay of 23 months in the effectiveness of the Additional Financing.
