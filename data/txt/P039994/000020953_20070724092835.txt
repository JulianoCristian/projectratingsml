        1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design:


1.1Context at Appraisal:

1.      This operation was originally conceived as a two-tranche financial sector adjustment loan (FSAL) in an
amount of US$60 million to support a phased program of financial sector reforms. A program document was
distributed to the Board of Executive Directors in August 2004 but subsequently withdrawn at the request of the
Government to allow time for the Government to submit a new banking law to Congress. A draft banking law,
satisfactory to the Bank, was submitted to Congress in December 2004. However, Board presentation of the
FSAL was also conditioned on progress with other financial sector reforms which did not proceed as smoothly as
expected. To better manage perceived increased risks to the program, the Bank and the Government agreed to a
risk mitigation strategy whereby Bank support would be based on a programmatic approach for Paraguay's
financial sector reform. Under this approach, a sequence of three single-tranche programmatic financial sector
loans was envisaged. They were to be presented to the Board in line with measurable progress in the reform
program.

        The programmatic financial sector adjustment loan (PFSAL I) in an amount of US$15 million was
approved by the Board in April 2005. As the first loan of the sequence it provided up-front support for prior
reforms. Under the programmatic approach there was to be a back-loading of Bank support to reflect the
perceived increased risks. The Government encountered a long delay in getting Congress to approve the loan, and
loan effectiveness had to be extended beyond the 18 month deadline. By the time the loan became effective and
disbursed in November it was apparent that, despite the implementation of initial prior actions, the overall
financial sector reform program was progressing at a slower pace than expected. With the further postponement
of additional reforms in January 2007, the Bank decided not to proceed with further programmatic lending while
remaining open to resume support for financial sector reform at a future date if warranted by country
circumstances.

        This ICR reviews the status of financial sector reform in Paraguay as supported by PFSAL I and as
envisaged under the broader program that was to receive programmatic support from the Bank.

Background

2.      After a hiatus in Bank lending to Paraguay between 1984 and 1992, a total of nine loans were approved
during 1992 and 1997. The Bank then formalized a strategy of re-engagement in the CAS of April 1997. As part
of the new strategic direction the Bank initiated a policy dialogue with the Government in 1998 on banking
reform including discussions on potential Bank support involving technical assistance and policy lending. The
Bank subsequently issued a Financial Sector Review in November 2002 The report addressed the following areas:
condition of the financial system and vulnerabilities; reform of the State-owned banks; assessment of banking
regulations and supervision; deposit insurance and bank resolution procedures and pension system reform.1

3.      Following several years of economic stagnation and decline, a new Paraguayan administration came to
power in August 2003 enjoying substantial political support. Economic performance improved during 2003-2004.
This positive recovery came on the heels of a major economic crisis in 2002 induced, in part by a failure to
undertake needed policy reforms. The economy had also been battered by adverse developments in its main
trading partners, namely the Brazilian devaluation of 1999 and the recession and financial turmoil in Argentina
during 2001-2002.

4.      The Paraguayan banking system had been in a vulnerable state for a number of years. Major banking
crises in 1995 and in 1997-1998 had led to the closure of a number of domestic banks, the reduction of credit to

the private sector, and a sharp drop in private investment.2 During 1995-2004, 21 banks and more than 30 finance
companies were dissolved. The orderly resolution of problem banks thus became one of the priority areas in the
Bank's support strategy.

5.       The Bank's financial sector diagnostic report was very helpful in renewing discussions with the
Government on a Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL). The principal components of the proposed operation
included a new Banking Law, a new State-owned Banks Law, and reform of the Organic Law of the Central Bank
(BCP) and the Superintendency of Financial Institutions (SB) to harness their autonomy, along with the need for
technical assistance resources to support the Government's reform process. A preparation mission in October
2003 further defined the scope of the FSAL which was to consist of two tranches. The first tranche was to be
triggered based on the following conditions: i) a new Bank Resolution / Deposit Insurance Law; ii) BCP approval
of a new Resolution 8 strengthening the standards on risk asset classification and loss provisioning; iii)
presentation to Congress of a State-owned Banks and an Anti-money Laundering Laws; and iv) BCP approval of
a strategic plan for SB. The second tranche was to be conditioned on the approval and implementation of the laws
supported by the first tranche as well as passage of a revised Banking Law, whereby presentation of a new
Banking Law to Congress subsequently became a condition for first tranche release. The Government received a
technical assistance PHRD grant from Japan in order to assist in the preparation of the financial sector reform
program.

6.       The original FSAL was distributed to the Board in August 2004, but was subsequently withdrawn at the
Government's request to allow time for the Government to submit a proposed Banking Law to Congress. A draft
Banking Law was then submitted to Congress on December 10, 2004, thus meeting the remaining condition for
Board presentation. After evaluating the progress with financial sector reforms, the Bank and the Government
agreed to shift from a single multi-tranche FSAL loan to a Programmatic approach thus providing for some
flexibility in the structuring of future operations as well as the option of shortening the duration of the Program if
reforms were not being effective. The Programmatic lending approach consisted of three single tranche loans, the
first a Financial Sector Adjustment Loan for US$ 15 million, to be followed by two Financial Sector
Development Policy loans for US$15 million and US$30 million respectively.

7.       The PFSAL I was approved by the Board on April 5, 2005, with an original effectiveness date of
September 12, 2005. However, it took longer than expected for the Government to secure Congressional approval
and the date of effectiveness was delayed to November 21, 2006. These delays were not specific to Bank
operations; other non-World Bank operations were rejected or had been similarly stalled for many months as well.
Notwithstanding the delay in obtaining approval from Congress, there was no indication of reversals on the
financial sector reform program supported by the FPSAL I. This was confirmed by a due diligence performed by
the Bank, including a letter by the Government ratifying their commitment. The Bank also concluded that
the operation's objectives continued to be achievable, albeit over a longer period than initially envisaged.
However, other reforms that were to be supported by the follow-up programmatic operation were progressing
more slowly than expected. In January 2007, the BCP postponed implementation of some aspects of Resolution 8,
which called for new asset risk classification standards to be phased in. That, and other delays in the reform
agenda, led the Bank to suspend preparation of the second operation of the Program.

8.       The Bank closely coordinated the design of the Program with both the IMF and the IDB. At that time, the
IMF had in place a Stand-By program which included structural benchmarks for financial sector reforms. The
IDB postponed its original financial sector adjustment program to pursue a more targeted program to support the
consolidation of the state-owned banks into a single second tier institution, which was part of the state-owned
bank reforms. The IDB program also supported separate but complementary issues such as improving the
supervision and institutional framework for the cooperatives sector.



2In this report the terms banking system and financial intermediaries are used interchangeably to refer to those entities that
fall under the supervision of the Superintendency of Banks: banks, finance companies, foreign exchange (FX) houses, and
custodians. The term financial system is used to refer to the banking system plus cooperatives but excluding insurance
companies.
                                                               2

9.       In order to strengthen the Government's institutional capacity to implement financial sector reforms, the
Bank prepared a parallel Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project (FTAP) which received Board approval
together with PFSAL I. The FTAP was to support many of the second-phase PFSAL policy actions such as
providing training to SB for development of regulations concerning bank resolution; to monitor progress made by
banks in complying with new regulations; upgrade prudential norms; and improve the quality of on-site
supervision by SB. It also included a component to modernize its payments and settlement systems. The BCP was
to be the implementing agency for the FTAP but a change of management at the BCP led to a change of priorities
and the loan was withdrawn at the request of the Paraguayan authorities in June 2006. An IDB technical
assistance project was to provide support to the Government in the restructuring of the state-owned banks.

10.      At the time of loan approval the financial sector was vulnerable after several episodes of financial crises.
Financial intermediaries, as defined by the BCP, comprised banks and finance companies, both under the
supervision of the SB. Credit Cooperatives, although important (representing 25 percent of financial assets), were
not formally classified as financial intermediaries. As of January 31, 2005, the Paraguayan banks accounted for
about 90 percent of total assets of financial intermediaries (about 70 percent if cooperatives were included). Of 14
existing banks, 10 were branches of foreign banks or foreign-owned banks representing 74 percent of banking
assets, three were locally-owned banks, representing 15 percent of assets and one was a state-owned bank (BNF),
with 10 percent of banking assets. The banking system had an aggregate non-performing loan ratio of 11 percent
of total loans. There were also 14 finance companies with a non-performing loan ratio of 7 percent. However, the
loan classification standards were not considered compatible with international practices at that time thus
underestimating the true extent of loan quality problems, an area that was to be addressed by the financial sector
reforms.

1.2Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved):

11.      As per the PD, the objective of the Financial Sector Reform Program was to strengthen the financial
condition of the private and public banking sector in order to reduce vulnerability to future shocks and negative
impacts on economic growth and increase the flow of credit for domestic investment.

12.      The objective of the first loan (PFSAL I) was to strengthen the Government's capacity to manage
weaknesses and stress in the financial system and to prevent crisis contagion effects, by utilizing early corrective
actions and market risk-sharing mechanisms to transfer and sell good loan assets of failed institutions, while
reducing losses to the State.

1.3      Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification:

No changes were made.


1.4      Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):

13.      In order to achieve its objectives, the Program was organized into three areas: i) modernization of the
bank resolution and deposit insurance system; ii) banking legal, regulatory and institutional framework; and iii)
restructuring and consolidation of state-owned banks.

I Modernization of the Bank Restructuring and Deposit Insurance System

14.      Previous banking system crises invoked ad-hoc responses by regulators who lacked a legal framework
and financial resources to be more proactive in terms of supervisory actions. This program component was aimed
at strengthening the effectiveness of problem bank restructuring. The Government established a Deposit
Insurance Agency (FGD) within BCP to implement the regulations and operating procedures of the new deposit
insurance system and support bank restructuring under Law 2334/03. As part of the restructuring of problem
banks new exit procedures were designed for banks which are deemed insolvent. A number of prudential
preventive actions and strengthened supervision efforts were also established.

15.      As part of the reform of the deposit insurance system, the Government was to provide back-stop financial
support during the initial period needed to build up to the fund's minimum reserve coverage with respect to
insured deposits ­ estimated at 15 years. For this purpose, the Government was to co-fund any shortfalls arising
from deposit insurance liabilities not covered by reserve funds either because the Fund has not attained the
minimum reserve coverage or because the amount of losses associated with bank defaults were to exceed the
Fund's capacity.

16.      The Government was committed to modernize procedures for removing weak banks from the system,
using market mechanisms and risk sharing with the rest of the financial industry. These procedures were approved
under Law 2334/03 developed with the assistance of the Bank and approved under the prior Economic Recovery
Loan. Implementation of the law required the design of highly detailed regulations specifying the operational
procedures for implementing bank restructuring including methodologies for the valuation of matching liabilities
and assets to identify and separate viable portions of balance sheets, methodologies for securitizing loans, and
rules for proceeding with restructuring. Another important element was to introduce early corrective actions as
part of the supervision process so that preventive measures could be taken before banks become insolvent.

17.      As specified in the Policy Matrix, PFSAL I focused on the development of specific criteria for subjecting
weak financial institutions to corrective actions to improve their financial performance, and to clean up certain
trouble spots in bank operating practices. The second operation was to expand the implementation of this
component through additional regulations dealing with resolution procedures to minimize the use of deposit
insurance funds; to transfer matching assets and liabilities to financially sound banks; and to securitize such assets
to facilitate their sale to other banks. Implementation of these practices was to be highlighted in the third
operation.

II The Legal, Regulatory and Institutional Framework for Banking

18.      In order to strengthen the banking sector's prudential regulations in line with best practices, this
component supported Government reforms of the banking laws and key regulations. The principal interventions
identified in this component were: a new Banking Law; new regulations governing classification of risk assets
                                                           4

and provision for loan losses; a new Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Law; and development and implementation
of a new Strategic Plan for SB.

New Banking Law:
19.      Drawing on the Bank's ESW, agreement was reached with the Government on the preparation, passage,
and implementation of a comprehensive banking law drawing on international best practices including some of
the concepts of Basle I and II. The list of changes to the existing Banking Law included the following: including
cooperatives as a financial intermediary governed by the Banking Law; strengthening fit and proper rules; raising
capital adequacy standards including limits on the revaluation of reserves as part of the capital account; defining
coverage of financial groups and introducing rules on supervision on a consolidated basis; requiring authorization
for significant transactions of banking shares and transfers of the loan portfolio; stipulating clear responsibilities
for bank managers and board members regarding risk management, internal controls and use of external auditors;
identifying financial transactions between related parties; establishing a more comprehensive schedule of
penalties and fines for breach of regulations; establishing grounds for the withdrawal of banking licenses; and the
composition of boards of directors.

Amendments to the Organic Law of BCP:
20.      In order to enhance the effectiveness of BCP and SB as regulators of the financial system, BP's Organic
Law would be amended to confer greater autonomy to both BCP and SB. The staggering of BCP Board
appointments was to be one of the key changes to the existing Organic Law in order to minimize political
interference.



New Regulations on the Risk Classification Assets and Provisioning for Losses:
21.      The banking system reforms addressed the need to strengthen the banks' financial position by upgrading
the standards governing asset quality. Building on existing regulations established by BCP Resolution 8, this sub-
component contained key elements necessary to raise the standards for the evaluation of asset risks. The
recommended changes included reducing the arrears period for each risk category; increasing the percentage of
provisions for each category; limiting the use of collateral in the calculation of provisions; stricter rules on the
reclassification of loans; classification of borrowers who are part of an economic group on a consolidated basis;
and more stringent documentation requirements for all borrowers.

Reform of the Anti-Money Laundering Framework:
22.      In response to the Government's anti-corruption drive, to global initiatives for combating money
laundering and terrorist financing, and potential linkages between the informal economy along the borders and
illegal money-laundering through the financial system, the Program supported legislative and regulatory
initiatives to reinforce the anti-money laundering framework. Passage of a new AML Law and centralization of
oversight within the Government were key elements of the strategy with financial intermediaries assuming greater
responsibilities for the reporting of suspicious activities and collaborating with the authorities.

SB's Strategic Plan:
23.      As part of the reform effort, the Government considered it essential that SB prepare and implement a
Strategic Plan within the timeline of this Program. The Plan was to focus on the development of a risk-based
approach to banking supervision. The Plan would address the following policy areas: i) development of a risk
rating methodology for banks; ii) assessment of banks' compliance with the new rules for classifying asset risk;
iii) the design of procedures for bank restructuring; and iv) implementation of an ongoing consultations with the
banking industry in order to create more effective mechanisms for dealing with problem banks.

24.      The sequencing of Government actions under the legal and regulatory reform component was specified in
the Policy Matrix. For PFSAL I the Government was to present the draft of the new Banking and the AML Laws
to Congress for approval; BCP was to have issued the new version of Resolution 8 outlining the criteria for the
classification of asset risk and provisioning for losses; and SB's Strategic Plan would have been approved by the
BCP Board. For the second operation both the Banking and AML laws would have been approved and made

                                                            5

effective along with the necessary regulations to govern their implementation; banks would have submitted
contingency plans for compliance with Resolution 8; and SB would be on track with the implementation of its
Strategic Plan. In addition, the amendments to the Organic Law of BCP would have been presented to Congress.
For the third operation, the actions identified at the time of Program design consisted in continuing to implement
the reforms adopted in the earlier operations and to begin implementation of the reforms of the Organic Law of
BCP.

III Restructuring and Consolidation of State-owned Banks

25.       The third component of the Program was to address reforms of state-owned banks through a restructuring
of existing institutions with the goal of reducing the presence of the state in the financial sector. Historically, these
financial institutions had generated substantial losses due to poor asset quality and operational inefficiencies. Due
to the large size of the National Development Bank (BNF) ­ around 10 percent of total banking system assets, a
priority step was to restructure BNF in order prevent any further financial deterioration which could disrupt the
financial sector. Subsequently the Government was to focus on a two pronged strategy of downsizing and
consolidation. First, the creation of a second-tier development finance bank from the merger of the existing
institutions: UTEP, FDI, FDC, and CONAVI/BANAVI. This new second-tier bank would specialize in the
rediscounting of medium and long-term investment loans to banks and finance companies on market compatible
terms. Second, the creation of a first tier bank from the merger of existing first tier institutions: BNF, CAH, and
FG. The new first-tier bank would operate as a credit and payments institution focusing on financing of micro-
and small scale enterprises, primarily in the agricultural sector, and any other areas where access to the private
sector banks and finance companies is limited. The restructuring of the state-owned banking sector was expected
to cost of US$54 million, of which, US$ 7 million represented severance payments to reduce the workforce. All
of these activities were expected to be completed as conditionality for the third operation of the Program.

1.5      Revised Policy Areas (if applicable):

No changes were made.


1.6      Other significant changes:

26.      Implementation of the Program was also undermined by certain design features which basically
contributed to an impasse in terms of the types of reforms that the Government could at this juncture realistically
achieve. While the triggers for PFSAL I were met, some conditions involved the submission of laws to Congress.
The approval and subsequent implementation of these laws were to be prior conditions for the second operation in
the Program, but political obstacles unrelated to the laws themselves made their passage as originally drafted
unfeasible. In January 2007, the BCP delayed in part the implementation of Resolution 8. Presidential and
Congressional elections slated for April 2008 compounded uncertainty with respect to the program.3 The Bank
made the decision not to continue with the Program but to reassess its support of Government reforms in the
financial sector at a time when conditions become more favorable.



         2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes


2.1      Program Performance:

27.      Despite the long delays between Board-approval of PFSAL I in April 2005 and loan effectiveness in
November 2006, the Government remained in compliance with with reforms supported by the loan throughout
that period. Advancement was also noted in other areas to be supported by the second and third operations, but
progress in those areas was not sufficient to justify moving forward with the Program.




3Based on the ICR Guidelines last updated on February 9, 2007, a programmatic series is considered to have lapsed if no
subsequent operation is presented to the Board 24 months after the Board approval of the previous operation in the series, in
the case of PFSAL I it was March 2005.

Selected Program Implementation Accomplishments and Pending Issues

Deposit Insurance Fund (FGD) is collecting deposit insurance premiums
28.      Since FGD was established in October 2004, the agency has been collecting insurance premiums on a
regular basis. The insurance assessment rate is 0.48 percent per annum applied to total deposits and payable on a
quarterly basis. The insurance fund currently has about US$23 million and is expected to reach the minimum
reserve coverage in 15 years. BCP's Board has also issued regulations governing the Deposit Insurance Fund
which was a condition for the second operation.

29.      The government is committed to issuing US$50 million in the form of zero coupon non-negotiable 20
year bonds as a backup to the insurance fund. These bonds would be used by FGD as needed to obtain funds from
BCP through REPO operations. The government has already approved US$20 million bonds for 2007, scheduled
to be issued during the first half of the year.

Bank resolution practices successfully applied.
30.      In 2005, following the specification of the technical criteria for managing problem banks as adopted by
BCP, SB intervened in a finance company (Financentro). This case served as a proving ground for the
development of policies and procedures in handling problem banks. Following an analysis of assets and liabilities,
the "good" assets were sold. The bank which acquired these assets expressed a very positive view of their
experience with the purchased accounts. The acquiring bank offered G13 billion for the assets backing G23
billion in deposits, and FGD contributed the difference of G9 billion in order to finalize the transaction. Based on
its experience with Financentro, FGD staff upgraded their policies and procedures, established a data room for
potential bidders and also improved coordination with bank examiners prior to intervention in order to pre-
identify "good" assets for sale to other interested banks.

New Bank Law as originally submitted to Congress has not yet been approved. The Government may
propose a limited number of amendments to the existing law based on recommendations made by a recent
FSAP mission.
31.      The new Banking Law was perhaps too ambitious in terms of the number of changes to the existing law
and of the scope of new regulatory standards. The Government, through BCP, is considering simpler legislation to
selectively amend the existing law to enhance financial sector stability. A recent FSAP report for Paraguay was
very helpful in confirming many of the elements proposed in the original banking law recommendations and also
provided useful input in the re-drafting of the proposed changes to the law. It is important to note that some
changes in regulations can also be adopted through BCP Resolutions rather than going through changes to the
existing law. However, the Board of BCP has not been able to assemble a quorum since mid-2006.

Resolution 8 was issued and partially implemented, but changes in provisioning and risk classification have
been postponed.
32.      The current favorable economic environment, and strong pickup in bank and finance company earnings,
provide BCP with an opportunity to begin phasing in the new risk asset classification standards established by
Resolution 8. Financial intermediaries have raised several substantive issues regarding the application of the new
norms that could have been resolved without compromising its effectiveness. These concerns included the new
documentation requirements from borrowers which were considered too cumbersome and unrealistic, the
shortening to 30 days of the period for classifying a loan as non-performing, and treatment of agricultural credits
when producers were faced with unfavorable climatic factors. In addition, finance companies considered that the
new regulations would put them at a disadvantage relative to the cooperatives which are are not subject to the new
asset quality standards. There were also some legitimate concerns by regulators that some financial
intermediaries, particularly finance companies, may not be able to increase capital in tandem with the more
stringent rules for loan loss provisions, so full implementation was delayed until August 2008. Nevertheless, SB
has confirmed that banks have submitted contingency plans for compliance with Resolution 8 which was to be a
trigger condition for the second operation.

Passage of Anti-Money Laundering Law pending but AML Agency is working with SB and financial
intermediaries on enhanced "know-your-customer" procedures.

                                                          10

33.      One of the challenges for a successful AML program in Paraguay is the large size of the informal
economy and the growing importance of the largely unregulated cooperative sector. The government's Anti-
Money Laundering agency (SEPRELAD) still lacks basic hardware and software needed to process information
on financial transactions. The agency also has few trained investigators. One strategy being considered is for SB
to act as supervisor for the banking system in matters relating to AML and for SEPRELAD to supervise the other
financial intermediaries including the cooperatives. Nevertheless, an effective Anti-Money Laundering Law still
hinges on legal reforms which have yet to be considered by Congress.

SB needs to improve the quality of supervisory staff and focus on implementing its Strategic Plan
34.      With the upgrading of regulatory standards, SB faces new challenges in terms of adapting its regulatory
culture to a risk-based approach. As SB officials have asserted, greater emphasis should be placed on improving
the quality of supervisory staff through training and collaborative programs with examiners from other countries.
Supervision should place greater emphasis on the risks associated with particular banking practices and the
adoption of disciplinary measures should be consistent with the seriousness of the financial institution's non-
compliance which should in turn result in more effective incentives for appropriate risk management policies by
financial intermediaries.

35.      The Strategic Plan supported by the PFSAL I has not been fully implemented due to lack of resources.
With the absence of a governing Board at BCP it has not been possible to monitor the implementation of the
Superintendency's Strategic Plan. In view of the amount of time that has elapsed since the current Plan was
approved by the BCP Board, SB could consider preparation of a revised Strategic Plan.

First Tier banking through BNF: financial performance has improved.
36.      BNF management developed a new Business Plan for 2006-2007 aimed at restructuring the bank into a
financially viable institution. The initial challenge was to improve asset quality through more aggressive loan
workouts. Significant progress was made in 2006, although the level of past-due loans remains a challenge. Credit
quality improved by 20 percentage points and past-due loans as percent of total loans declined from 39.5 percent
in 2005 to 19.4 percent in 2006. In terms of efficiency, there is still a need for reduction of staff, which is a
politically charged issue. Overall, the actions taken by management are in line with the objectives that were
pursued by the first-tier State-owned Banks Law proposal.

Second tier banking through AFD is off to a very good start
37.      The newly-established second-tier development finance bank, AFD, has been well received by other
banks with respect to the professionalism of its management team and lending practices. It appears to have
contributed to renewed interest on the part of financial institutions in longer term lending. As an example of its
innovative style, AFD has introduced a loan pricing formula to encourage intermediaries to fund variable-rate
local currency loans. The key to sustainable sound growth of AFD is maintaining the professional quality of its
managers. The accomplishment of this initiative was to be a trigger for the third operation.



2.1      Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Program Design

38.      The design of the Program was comprehensive but perhaps somewhat ambitious in view of the limited
institutional capacity available for its full implementation. The Program conditionality relied on the presentation
of extensive reforms to the Banking Law and other legislation. As it turned out, the political window of
opportunity for reform legislation may have been shorter than originally anticipated.

39.      On the other hand, the logical framework of the Program was well conceived:

    · The establishment of a deposit insurance fund that would collect deposit insurance premiums to build up a
         reserve fund was expected to reduce future government liabilities from failed financial intermediaries.
                                                           11

    · Supervisory practices that emphasize preventive actions aimed at weak financial intermediaries would
        result in fewer emergencies, thus lowering the possibility of runs on the banking system. By resulting in
        fewer bank interventions, these practices would also reduce future government liabilities.

    · The passage of a new Banking Law and subsequent issuance of regulations to implement the Law was
        expected to result in an improvement in asset quality, sustainable earnings growth, and a strengthening of
        bank capital.

    · Implementation of Resolution 8 was to result in more rigorous asset quality standards and increased
        provisions for loan losses. Better capital coverage and sound growth of financial institutions would lead
        to greater lending for productive uses.

    · The AML Law was expected to strengthen the financial system by eliminating illegal financial activity
        and particularly contributing to a culture of "know-you-customer". That would also have the beneficial
        effect of enhancing bank relationships with their clients and enabling them to better understand their
        underlying banking needs.

    · The restructuring and downsizing of the State-owned banks was to reduce the involvement of the State in
        the banking system and thus reduce future Government exposure to losses.

40.     Although the program was well structured, the extent of the reforms may have exceeded the capacity on
the ground, both politically and institutionally. The proposed new Banking Law embraced many changes; even
when some intermediaries have felt that the existing Law was not in such a state of disrepair. Perhaps a less
ambitious approach to the reform of the Banking Law, focusing as the Government is now planning on selected
amendments, and putting greater emphasis on implementation of Resolution 8, would have been a more realistic
strategy. The AML Law was a good initiative, but it also required reforms of the Civil and Penal Codes in order to
establish its effectiveness. Dramatically downsizing BNF may not have been realistic given the bank's role in
providing access to financial services by an underserved population and its role as the payment system in rural
areas.

41.     One of the institutional challenges to financial sector reforms has been the relatively large size of the
informal economy in Paraguay. This is particularly evident in the dual nature of the financial system comprised of
a regulated financial intermediation sector alongside the fast growing and considerably less regulated cooperative
sector. The extension of the regulatory umbrella over the whole financial system still remains a major hurdle.
With a more simplified design for the Program there might have been greater space to explore ways to upgrade
the regulatory framework for cooperatives,.


Implementation Efficiency

42.     One of the decisive factors for not continuing with the remaining operations of the Program has been the
insufficient implementation capacity of key agencies and the lack of legislative response to the Government's
proposed reforms. The complexity of the Program also affected implementation efficiency.

43.     As stated in the PD, the principal risks to the reform program were the uncertainties of the national policy
debate and weak institutional capacity. It was recognized that the reform of the banking system's regulatory
framework and the restructuring of the state-owned banking sector was going to be a politically charged process.
Anemic economic growth was also viewed as a potential threat to banking system reforms, but as it turned out,
the economy has posted robust growth during the past couple of years thus contributing to enhanced financial
sector performance. Other risks pertained to overall governance issues. On the other hand, the new Administration
that took office in August 2003 seemed to have strong legitimacy and willingness to set the country on a different
development path which at that time convinced the Bank that risks had diminished. Nevertheless, the Bank's risk

                                                          12

mitigation strategy which focused on a well disseminated public disclosure program and education campaign
carried out by the Ministry of Finance probably fell short of what was needed to keep the Program on track.

44.     The high quality of Program design from a technical point of view was offset by the shortcomings
associated with weak institutional capacity. In the case of Resolution 8, enforcement was hampered by unrealistic
documentation requirements that called for each borrower to present proof of tax payments to be issued by MOF.
Other problems were caused by shortening the length of time for past-due loans for small consumer loans, and
complicated formulas for adjusting the value of collateral. With respect to the AML Law, the financial
intelligence unit (SEPRELAD) needed more resources such as hardware and software as well as the legal reforms
necessary to facilitate prosecution of criminal acts.

Factors Outside the Control of Government

45.     Opposition within Congress to the reform agenda compromised the ability of the Government to process
key legislation. Congress took no action on the proposed new Banking Law submitted by the Government.
Congress also introduced amendments to the proposed first tier State-owned Banks Law that were unacceptable to
the Government and the law was vetoed. Nevertheless, the BNF has made considerable headway with
restructuring under newly appointed management. `With presidential and congressional elections slated for April
2008, the political climate has become even more uncertain with most financial sector policy decisions likely to
be delayed.

46.     A favorable global economic environment has contributed to the strengthening of the economy. The fiscal
accounts have improved thanks to the expansion in the economy as well as to the recent tax reform program. The
expansion in exports have helped buttress the country's international liquidity thus stabilizing and even
strengthening the currency. These positive developments may have dispelled the sense of urgency in
implementing financial sector reforms and they have also noticeably reduced the country's financing
requirements.

Factors Subject to Government Control

47.     The macroeconomic policy framework was favorable for implementation of the Program, particularly the
improved fiscal performance. The Government successfully completed a three year (2003-2005) Stand-By
Arrangement with the IMF in November 2005, and in May 2006 the Fund approved a follow-up Stand-By for
2006-2008. A first review of the follow-up Stand-By was made by the Executive Directors of the IMF in
September 2006, and subsequent reviews are still pending.

48.     While the Government has been committed to the Program from the start, turnover of key ministers and
other key government officials may have taken away from the momentum of the Program.

Factors Subject to Implementing Agency Control

49.     BCP was a natural candidate for implementation of the financial sector reforms because of its role as
principal regulator through SB and its management and technical capabilities. However, the Central Bank has
been beset with problems of governance that have held up implementation of key reforms and compromised the
effectiveness of banking supervision since most regulatory, administrative and supervisory actions need to be
approved by the Board. A new President has been appointed in March 2007, who seems to be well oriented
towards resolving these governance issues.


2.2     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

50.     Program targets as specified in the PD were mostly expressed in terms of direction of change such as
growth of the deposit insurance fund, measurable increase in banking system capital and a sharp reduction in SB

                                                         13

emergency restructuring. In some cases there were specific quantitative targets as in the case of a 15 percent
reduction in the number of financial institutions and a consolidation of State-owned banks from seven to two.
When existing information is insufficient to make specific quantitative projections, a target based on a direction of
change is still helpful in evaluating outcomes.

51.     Despite the abundance of information on financial intermediation, some reforms affecting institutional
development are less tangible and thus more difficult to quantify. In the case of the new Banking and Anti-Money
Laundering Laws, there are no specific generally-accepted indicators that measure compliance with laws and
regulations and the degree to which banking supervision adheres to international best practices. Bank secrecy
impedes access to information concerning banking supervision practices by individuals not affiliated with SB.
Other information such as the development of early warning indicators by SB and lending to micro and small
scale enterprises by state-owned banks was to be dependent on the second and third operations of the Program.

52.     Monitoring of PFSAL I intermediate outcomes in the ISR reports focused on the capital ­ asset and the
non-performing loans to total loans ratios of the banking system (all ISR ratings refer to the first operation under
the Program). These indicators are widely used in the industry as primary guides of the stability of a financial
system. While the absolute level of these indicators may be distorted by reporting practices, the change over time
is usually a valid indicator of performance. The capital ­ asset ratio was also one of the key performance
indicators identified in the PD.




2.3     Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

53.     The decision not to go ahead with the remaining two operations in the Program at the present juncture
does not preclude Bank support for financial sector reform in the future. The Bank plans to maintain a policy
dialogue with the current Government and will continue this process with the successor administration and thus
be able to provide an effective response to future financial sector initiatives by the Government.


        3        Assessment of Outcomes


3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation:

54.     The objectives of the financial sector program supported by the Bank loans were consistent with the
FY2004-2007 CAS objectives.4 The Bank's country strategy was aimed at strengthening the Government's core
economic reforms in the following areas: fundamental tax reform; rationalization of the government pension
system; and financial sector reforms. One of the principal recommendations of the Poverty Assessment carried
out in 2002 was that economic growth is the best overall strategy for reducing the number of poor, since the poor
benefit most from increases in basic public services result from increased government spending which in turn is
made possible by faster economic growth and the consequent increase in tax revenues.5 The linkage between a
healthy financial system and sustainable economic growth was underscored in the Bank's emphasis on fiscal and
financial sector stabilization as the first pillar of its country assistance strategy. The current Government is
strongly committed to financial sector reforms even though it has not been able to generate sufficient support in
Congress for their full implementation.

3.2       Achievement of Program Development Objectives:

55.       During 2005-2006, the performance of financial intermediaries has improved significantly. This positive
outcome can be attributed to a number of factors including the policies supported by PFSAL I as well as favorable
economic developments in the country emanating from a good macroeconomic policy framework. Key policy
actions such as the establishment of problem bank restructuring procedures by SB, the Deposit Insurance Fund
(FGD) to protect depositors, the successful launch of the new second-tier bank (AFD), the restructuring of the
first-tier public bank BNF (thereby reducing public institutions from seven to two focused ones) and partial
implementation of SB's Strategic Plan have already been implemented. Others, principally Resolution 8, which
has been partially delayed, and the new Banking and AML Laws which have yet to be passed, are expected to
eventually contribute towards the Program objectives, possibly within the next one to two years. Although it may
still be too soon to reach a definitive conclusion, it appears so far to be very positive. In addition to the actions
taken under PFSAL I, the recent passage of the second-tier State-Owned Banks Law and the establishment of the
AFD, renewed efforts to restructure BNF, and other reforms that were to be associated with the second and third
operations bode well for results under what would have been the full implementation of the original Program.

56.       The banking system has demonstrated improvement in a number of areas. Private sector banks have
shown a moderate recovery in capitalization to 10.3 percent in 2006 up from 8.4 percent in 2003. This increase
has been made possible by strong earnings growth resulting in an average ROE of 38.1 percent in 2006. As shown
in the Table, the banking system experienced a dip in ROE during the problem years 2001-2002, but has since
recovered strongly. It is particularly important to note that key financial indicators have improved markedly, there
has been an encouraging reduction in past-due loans from 14.5 percent in 2002 to only 2.1 percent in 2006.
Additionally, thanks to new information technologies and an increase in the volume of operations, banking
efficiency indicators have also been improving.

57.       BNF has possibly turned the corner in terms of moving towards profitability; however, its financial
condition is still unsteady. After posting sizeable losses during 2002-2003, mostly as a result of bad loans, it has
improved its asset quality. Additionally, its efficiency indicators have improved noticeably during 2005-2006.

58.       Finance companies on the other hand have been lagging moderately behind the banks. Capitalization has
been slipping since 2001 raising some concerns about their financial strength, despite a strong earnings
performance during 2005-2006. Finance companies are more actively engaged in lending as seen by the loan to
assets ratio of 71.3 percent compared to 52.8 percent for the banks. A few finance companies also exhibit
significant weaknesses and should be monitored more closely.

59.       One of the Program objectives of increasing financing to productive sectors has not yet materialized. In
fact banking system loans to the private sector have fallen as a share of GDP from 25 percent in 2002 to 15
percent in 2006. This is likely to be a temporary trend reflecting a clean up of non-performing loans and the
impact of stricter regulations affecting lending which may initially discourage banks from taking on commercial
lending risks in preference to lower risk government securities. That is shown by the increase in the
investments/assets ratio to 19.2 percent in 206, up from 4.2 percent in 2001. One of the policy actions supported
by PFSAL I was the restructuring of Public Sector debt which enabled banks to improve the performance of their
investment portfolio`. However, as economic growth continues and banks have been able to fully implement the
new loan quality standards, financial intermediaries will likely assume a more proactive role in lending since it is
one of the main drivers of banking profitability in the long term.

As to the objective of reducing financial system vulnerability to future shocks, the following pending issues could
have an adverse material effect on the final outcome:

Impact of Resolution 8 will only be known after examiners review bank portfolios
60.     While both regulators and financial intermediaries consider their loan loss provisions to be in line with the
new standards, this can only be completely ascertained once Resolution 8 becomes fully effective. Banks have
already provided SB with contingency plans for implementing the new resolution; however, new provisioning
requirements have not yet been implemented. The ability of SB to assess the quality of bank assets will in turn
hinge on the experience of examiners in applying the new standards.

Cooperatives account for a significant share of total financial system assets
61.      While reliable financial information on cooperatives is incomplete, preliminary estimates show that in
2006 they represented about 25 percent of financial system assets. The dimension and the dynamics of the
cooperative system in Paraguay stand out in comparison to other countries. Type A cooperatives, which represent
the largest institutions ­ numbering 40 cooperatives and 13 federations of cooperatives, out of a total of 673
cooperatives, account for 40 percent of total assets of cooperatives as of October 2006. There is still a regulatory
divide between cooperatives and other financial intermediaries. As regulatory standards for banks and finance
companies are raised, cooperatives will be able to expand by taking a greater market share from the banks and
finance companies. For these reasons, reliable financial information on the cooperative system and regular
monitoring of their operations should be a key objective of financial system regulators.

INCOOP's role as regulator is hampered by its lack of independence
62.      Under the supervision of INCOOP, the cooperative sector is going through a transition from a deregulated
and unsupervised system to one with some degree of supervision. INCOOP is a self-regulated organization with a
Board of Directors elected by the cooperatives. It thus lacks the status of an autonomous regulatory agency.
While recent efforts to strengthen its technical skills have been encouraging, INCOOP needs additional technical
assistance in order to upgrade its supervisory capacity. However, the cooperative system needs to have an
independent regulator with a strong legal mandate. INCOOP may be able to assume this role if it is granted legal
autonomy.

Linkages between banks, finance companies and cooperatives need to be monitored more closely.
63.      From the perspective of systemic risks, it is important to closely monitor linkages between banks, finance
companies and cooperatives. Although it is believed that they are independent of the rest of the financial sector,
some banks and finance companies may have sizeable credit exposures to cooperatives while others may be
receiving a significant share of deposits from cooperatives, thus posing both credit and liquidity risks. These
issues need to be monitored, and if needed, regulations should be issued to address any potential risks arising
from banking and cooperative system linkages.




3.3      Justification of Overall Outcome Rating:

         Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory for the overall financial sector program

                                                          17

64.      Despite the satisfactory impact of the first operation in the financial system as well as the substantial and
partial achievement of several actions slated for the other two operations, the fact that political conditions make it
unlikely to carry through with other Program reforms during the remaining of the present Administration, giving
rise to the Bank's decision not to proceed with the operation, the overall outcome of this ICR is deemed to be
moderately unsatisfactory. A more realistic approach to banking reforms such as passage of selected
amendments to the existing Banking Law and the continuation of the current expansion of the economy, which
has significantly reduced the country's financing requirements, could lead to a more favorable outcome.

65.      The prospects for successful passage of reforms to the Banking and the AML laws is not favorable at
present but prospects for reform could eventually improve. With respect to the goal of financial system stability,
important steps have been taken and key ratios have improved considerably but the largely unregulated
cooperative system remains a challenge. On the other hand, with adequate institutional and legal reforms
INCOOP may be able to become an effective regulatory agency for the cooperative sector. However, it first
would need to be granted legal status as an autonomous agency.

66.      The restructuring of the State-owned banking sector appears to be headed in the right direction,
particularly the establishment of AFD as a viable second-tier source of long-term development financing.
Achievements have also been made in the restructuring of BNF. Nevertheless, more work needs to be done
consistent with reducing the role of the state in the financial sector.

67.      In terms of the specific objectives of PFSAL I, this Operation is considered to have been Satisfactory.
All its conditionalities continue to be met, and the stability of the financial system has improved. The ISRs of this
operation indicate that steps have been taken to improve the stability of the system, and PDO indicators in
particular show important improvements.

         (a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Not Applicable



         (b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-
         term capacity and institutional development):

68.      The PFSAL I made significant contributions to institutional change in several areas. The strengthening of
FGD and upgrading of SB's capacity to restructure problem banks was an important step in enhancing the
efficiency and financial sustainability of the deposit insurance mechanism. The approval of Resolution 8 also
reinforces the process for financial intermediaries to make good loans and thus reduce vulnerability to future
shocks to the system.

69.      Revisions to the Bank and AML Laws have triggered serious Government debate on better practices in
the financial system. Less ambitious changes to the legislation may be more successful in receiving Congressional
approval and thereby contribute to a shift towards more efficient financial intermediation. Nevertheless, greater
institutional changes in the cooperative sector are necessary.

70.      Although the reorganization of the State-owned banks was to receive support from the third operation of
the Program, actions already taken in this area with support from the Bank along with a parallel IDB operation
have produced encouraging results. The establishment of AFD has triggered renewed interest on the part of banks

to lend longer-term, and the initial restructuring of BNF bodes well for a more effective public sector role in
financial intermediation.

71.     The Bank's role in assisting SB to focus on its organizational effectiveness through the development of a
Strategic Plan was a positive contribution. However, implementation of the Plan has not been consistent and the
original version may have already become outdated.


        (c)      Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):


Not Applicable

        4.       Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

        Rating: Substantial

72.     Program outcomes including those associated with the PFSAL I have to some extent been adversely
impacted by political, financial, governance, and institutional risks. The economy is vulnerable to external shocks
through terms of trade or adverse developments in Argentina and Brazil. Because the cooperatives sector is still
relatively unregulated, a financial shock in that sector could have adverse repercussions on the banking system.
Problems at BCP associated with the lack of quorum in its Board of Directors impacts negatively on the
effectiveness of the principal regulator of the financial system, although the new President seems to be headed to
resolve them .

73.     While the Program was well designed in terms of the technical analysis and the incorporation of best
international practices into the policy reform recommendations, the Bank could have been more realistic in its
assessment of the limited capacity to implement ambitious and complex reforms such as those contained in the
original draft of the revised Banking Law. Risk mitigation strategies perhaps should have focused on a less
ambitious program that emphasized new standards for the classification of asset risk, the use of BCP Resolutions
to implement new regulations, and fewer selective changes in the Banking Law. Greater monitoring of the SB's
Strategic Plan could have helped implementation.


        5.       Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance


5.1     Bank Performance

        (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase):

        Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


                                                          19

74.     In the design of the Program, Bank staff relied on extensive ESW particularly the Financial Sector
Review (2002) which was well received by the Government, and the Bank was also supportive through an
ongoing policy dialogue. Perhaps the pitfall was the ambitious scope of the Program. Greater assessment of
political, institutional, and operational capacity to implement complex reforms was needed. For example, the
proposed new Banking Law called for the banking system to swiftly assimilate best international standards of
banking regulation. Greater sensitivity to political uncertainties given the Government's minority representation
in Congress would have suggested a more cautious approach in the design of the Program and to a more engaged
plan to seek wider ownership of the reform process.

75.     A very positive aspect of Bank performance was the close working relationship with other IFIs, mainly
the IDB and the IMF. The Bank and the IDB agreed on a division of labor whereby the Bank would focus on the
new Banking Law and the IDB would give greater attention to the State-owned banking sector. Both institutions
coordinated on the conditionality established in their respective policy matrixes. The Bank also collaborated
closely with the IMF given the importance of the macroeconomic policy framework in determining the
effectiveness of financial sector reforms.


        (b) Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements):

        Rating: Satisfactory

76.     The Bank provided good support particularly in the area of problem bank restructuring and in working
with the Government to develop a revised version of the new Banking Law that would be more widely accepted
but would still be compatible with the initial Program objectives. The joint Bank ­ IMF FSAP Mission in 2005
helped to provide additional inputs for the implementation of financial sector reforms contemplated in the
Program.


        (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

        Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

77.     The Bank provided good support during supervision, which helped to maintain Government interest in the
reforms of the financial sector, but the quality at entry was only moderately satisfactory.



5.2     Borrower Performance

        (a) Government Performance:

        Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

78.     Macroeconomic polices were consistent with the Program goals and continue to be satisfactory.
The Government worked closely with the Bank during preparation of the Program, and during supervision of the
loan. The Government could have devoted more efforts to building greater ownership of the Program with
Congress to obtain approval of the Government's proposed legislation.


        (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance:

        Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

                                                          20

79.     The implementing agencies, MOF and BCP, were supportive of the Program goals. Subsequent changes
in the Ministry of Finance weakened the working relationship with Congress to pass some reforms. Governance
problems at BCP hampered its effectiveness as an implementing agency. SB has initiated implementation of the
Strategic Plan but greater progress is needed.


        (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

        Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

80.     Greater Government commitment to financial sector reforms could possibly have prevented the early
cancellation of the Program although that is not entirely clear given the strength and depth of contrary views
within Congress.



        6.       Lessons Learned

    · The Bank needs to strike a better balance between Program goals, the design of Program
        instruments, and a country's political realities. In addition to the long-term objective of strengthening
        the financial sector in order to increase the flow of credit, Program goals should include specific
        intermediate objectives. When the design of policy instruments in a Program emphasizes the enactment of
        laws and regulations as in the case of Paraguay, it is crucial that the feasibility analysis include an
        assessment of the country's political climate and the likelihood of congressional approval for each piece
        of legislation. No matter how well-intentioned a Government's commitment to the passage of key
        financial sector legislation may be, the Bank needs to perform a reality check.

    · The complexity of design and the number of operations in a Program should be consistent with the
        risks to development outcomes. The Bank may want to consider a more systematic measure of country
        risk factors that can be used to establish guidelines for Program design that are risk-driven.

        Where country risks are high the design of a Program should be relatively conservative. With simpler
        programs the Bank is able to focus greater attention on supervision of each component. If each loan in a
        Program is designed conservatively, it will give the Borrower greater incentive to meet expectations and
        then move on to the next operation.


    · It is best to be more conservative in assessing borrower's capacity to implement reforms and thus
        be less ambitious in Program design. One of the lessons of the proposed new Banking Law was that it
        may be better to aim for a few selected changes rather than a wholesale reform of banking regulations.


    · Financial sector reform Programs aimed at reducing systemic vulnerabilities need to be inclusive of
        all important sectors. For instance, finance companies were included but cooperatives were not. The
        issue was not whether cooperatives need to be regulated by BCP in order to achieve a level playing field
        with banks and finance companies, but whether INCOOP could be vested with the regulatory authority to
        independently supervise all cooperatives. The Bank could have placed greater priority on the cooperatives
        sector in designing the Program.

7.      Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing
        Agencies/Partners

(a)     Borrower/Implementing Agencies:

The Borrower commented that this loan has highly contributed to support financial sector reform, besides
of being timely for the administration of public finances. They added that they agree with the report in
general, although they do not fully share the assessment on the performance of the Borrower. In that
sense, they consider important to advance in a dialogue regarding government policies and the support
that can be given in this sector, strengthening technical and institutional coordination with the Bank (See
Annex 4 for the original in Spanish).

Annex 4. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR (Original in

Tengo el agrado de dirigirme a usted con referencia a la nota de fecha 5 de junio del año en curso del Banco
Internacional de Reconstrucción y Fomento (BIRF) (Exp. M.H. N° 11.594/2007). relacionada con la solicitud de
comentarios acerca del Informe de Finalización y de los Resultados de la Implementación del Convenio de
Préstamo N° 7288-PA Préstamo de Ajuste Programático del Sector Financiero(Programmatic Financial Sector
Adjustment Loan -PFSAL). por Dólares de los Estados Unidos de América Quince Millones (USD. 15.000.000.-)
-primera etapa- fechado el 13 de junio de 2005, aprobado por Ley N° 3039 del 24 de octubre de 2006, a cargo del
Ministerio de Hacienda.

La operación de Préstamo de Ajuste Programático del Sector Financiero ha contribuido en gran medida en apoyar
los planes de reforma del sector financiero, además de ser oportuna para la administración de las finanzas
públicas.

En general coincidimos con el informe, sin embargo, no podría compartir del todo las apreciaciones referentes a la
evaluación de desempeño del Prestatario. En ese sentido, considero importante avanzar en el diálogo acerca de las
políticas del Gobierno y el apoyo que se pueda brindar en éste sector, resultando vital fortalecer el vínculo de
coordinación técnica e institucional con el Banco para el logro de los objetivos.
