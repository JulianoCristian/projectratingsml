                     UPDATETO THE BOARDOF EXECUTIVEDIRECTORS


         The original Paraguay Financial Sector AdjustmentReform Loan (FSAL) was distributedto the
Board o f Executive Directors inAugust 2004 and subsequentlywithdrawn at the Government's
request given a pendingBoardpresentation condition. The pendingcondition was the submissiono f a
new BankingLaw to the Congress. A draft Banking Law, evaluated as satisfactory by the Bank, was
submitted to Congress on December 10,2004, thus meeting the pending condition.

         Boardpresentation o fthe FSALwas also conditioned on progress with the restructuring and
consolidation o fthe state ownedfinancial institutions. Inthis context, a draft law was submittedto
Congress inmid-2004 covering the consolidation o fthe first tier and second tier public financial
institutions. This draft law was not taken up by the Congress and was subsequently replacedby
another draft law covering the consolidation o f the second tier public financial institutions only. While
the Administration has reaffirmed its commitment to the full scope of the reform o f the public financial
institutions, these events reflect the challenging political environment inCongress. This was further
reflected inthe recent approval by Congress o f expanded credit limits for the largest first tier public
bank (Banco National de Fomento) which hadbeen reducedearlier as a policy action endorsed by the
Bank. These developments have increased the perceived risks to the program.

         Despite the challenges, the Government has made important progress inimplementingreform
o fthe regulatory framework for the banking system. The Government's macroeconomic policies and
performance remain satisfactory and Paraguay continues to meet the poverty, governance, structural,
and portfolio triggers for the CAS base case lendingprogram. OnDecember20,2004, the IMF
approved the third review of the Stand-By Arrangement and a six month extension o f the program to
September 30,2005 to accommodate the authorities' modified strategy for the financial sector. The
Inter-American Development Bank has postponed its policy loan which focused on the state banking
reforms, and i s proceedingwith a credit line project to support the operation o f the planned
consolidated second tier bank, including implementation o f financial operating rules and risk
management policies.

         Inlight ofdevelopments, the Bankand Governmenthave agreedto proceedwith a
programmatic approach to Bank support for Paraguay's financial sector reform. Under this approach,
Bank support i s proposed through a sequence o f three single tranche programmatic financial sector
loans, the first a Financial Sector Adjustment Loan followed by two Financial Sector Development
Policy Loans, to bepresented to the Board as the reform program achieves sufficient, measurable
progress. All o f the elements o fthe original financial sector reform remain within the scope o f the
program as described inthis ProgramDocument for the first PFSAL, including the agreed triggers for
the subsequent two PFSAL operations. While providing up-front support for reformactions already
taken, the proposed loan amounts under the new programmatic approach incorporate a back-loading o f
Bank support to reflect the increased risks.

               PROGRAMMATIC   FINANCIAL    SECTOR ADJUSTMENT      LOAN

                                 LOAN   SUMMARY



Borrower:             The Republic o f Paraguay

ImplementingAgencies: Ministryo fFinance with the assistanceo fthe CentralBank

Objectives:           To strengthen the financial condition o fthe private andpublic
                      banking sector inorder to reduce vulnerability to future shocks and
                      negative impacts on economic growth and increase the flow o f
                      credit for domestic investement.

Description:          Financial support to the Borrower for the formulation
                      and approval o f key financial sector laws and regulations
                      including implementationo fthe recently approved
                      deposit insurance and banking resolution law, new loan loss
                      provisioning regulations, revision o f the general banking law, and
                      approval o f a new anti-money laundering law.

Beneficiaries:        Enterprises o f all sizes requiring improved access to financial
                      services and credit, savers and depositors o f the banking system,
                      taxpayers, banking sector regulatory and supervisory agencies, and
                      the Treasury o fParaguay.

PovertyIssues:        For the banking system as a whole, the implementation o fbank
                      resolution and deposit insurance schemes will, as apriority, protect
                      the smallest depositors with the least economic assets, and assure
                      prompt repayment o f their deposits inthe event o fbank failures
                      while reducing costly bank bail-outs at taxpayers' expense.

Risks:                Main risks pertain to political, macroeconomic, governance and
                      institutional capacity. The mainrisk i s that Congress may not
                      approve inhllsome of the key legislation supported by this
                      operation such as the bankinglaw which would underminethe
                      adjustment program. Stricter capital and provisioning regulations
                      may initially lead to further contraction incommercial bank credit
                      available to the private sector, especially ifthe macroeconomic
                      environment is less conducive towards improvement inbanks'
                      financial condition. A public information campaign and
                      consultation with the banking industrywill help to encourage
                      participation inthe reforms, as well as a gradual phasing ino f
                      some o f the tougher reforms such as the increase inbase capital
                      and loan loss provisioning requirements. Institutional capacity

o f Paraguay inthe amount of US$15 million to support the reform o f the banking systemthrough a
new framework for banking legislation, and supervision andresolutiono f distressed banks. The
program would be implementedjointly by the Ministryo f Financewith the assistance o fthe Central
Bank. The Loanwould be fixed spread LIBOR-based, U S Dollar denominated, with a grace period o f
five years, a final maturity of twenty three years, and level repayment o fprincipal at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate.

                  PARTI.RECENTECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTSAND PROSPECTS

A. EconomicContext

2.     Following several years of economic stagnation and decline, exacerbated by political stalemates
that preventedadvances on important policy reforms, a new Paraguayan administration came to power
inAugust 2003. Enjoying substantial political support, the Governmenthas since achieved important
advances inits program of economic reforms. Economic performance has also beenpositive in2003
and 2004, following several years o f deteriorating GDP and fiscal indicators. The Governmenthas
reached agreement on a precautionary Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF and re-activatedthe
lendingprogram with the Bank.

3.     The shift inperformance and outlook came on the heels o f a major economic crisis in2002,
which was the culmination of several years o f fiscal mismanagement and inability to undertake needed
policy reforms. A small open economy, with an estimated GDP o fUS$6.6 billion (2004), Paraguay i s
one o f the poorest countries inthe region with a per capita income o f about US$llOO1.Heavily
dependent on agriculture (cotton, cattle, timber, and recently, soybeans) and on regional conditions, the
economy has been aided inrecent decades by an open trading environment which fostered significant
contraband trade with neighbors Brazil and Argentina. While Paraguay enjoyed economic booms
during the construction of the Itaipu and Yacyreta hydropower projects betweenthe late 1970sand the
early 1990s, the prosperity proved to be transitory.

4.     Although economic management was gradualist and fairly prudent inthe years following the end
ofthe military dictatorship in 1989, with balanced fiscal accounts, small current account deficits and
declining inflation, growth performance was disappointing. Protractedslow growth which went
negative inrecent years, reflected a decline intotal factor productivity associated with a shrinking
investment ratio, little progress instructural reform, fiscal deficits, andwidespread corruption.

5.     Poor policy Performance was exacerbated by a series of external and domestic events. Major
banking crises in 1995 and in 1997-98 ledto the closure o f a number o f domestic banks, the reduction
o f credit to the private sector, and a sharp drop inprivate investment. Paraguay's terms o f trade

deteriorated significantly after the mid-1990s andthe country suffereddroughts in 1999,2000, and
most recently in2002. The economy was battered by adverse developments inits main trading
partners, namely the Brazilian devaluation o f 1999 and the recession and financial turmoil inArgentina
in2001-2002.

6.    The combination of external vulnerability and a poor policy environment resulted in
exceptionally poor growth performance, particularly since the mid-1990s. While GDP growth
averaged 1percent per year, annual population growth stood at 2.5 percent. The outcome has been a
secular decline inper capita GDP to pre-1990 levels. Poverty was estimated at 41 percent in2003 with
the extreme poor makingup 20 percent o f the population. Poverty is concentrated inthe rural areas
where halfo f Paraguay's population lives, and i s exacerbated by polarized income and land
distribution.

7.    In2002, worsening economic conditions came to aheadas GDPfellby2.3 percent, leadingto
an over 4 percent contraction inper capita income. Inflation rose to double digits, the guarani
depreciated by nearly 40 percent, and the public sector's fiscal situation deteriorated sharply, recording
a deficit o f 3.1 percent o f GDP. As a result o fthe depreciation, public external debt climbedto nearly
50 percent o f GDP from 33 percent a year earlier. Given Paraguay's lack o f access to financing, either
internal or inthe international capital markets, the fiscal gap was financed by a combination o f delays
inpublic sector salary payments, postponement o fpublic investmentexpenditures, the drawing down
o f deposits at the Central Bank and the accumulation o f arrears to creditors and suppliers.At the end o f
2002, arrears on debt service amounted to almost 3 percent o f GDP.

8.    Financial Sector Problems. The Government and Central Bank intervened in four banking crises
between the mid 1990s and early 2000s duringwhich a number o f financial institutions accounting for
approximately 35 percent o f the financial systemwere liquidated. The currency suffered a loss o f
confidence as the Central Bank usedits reserves to rescue insolvent banks (via longterm credits,
deposit guarantees, lender o f last resort facilities and other instruments). Overall outlays amounted to
almost 12 percent o f GDP with only 5 percent havingbeenrecuperated to date by the Central Bank.
The additional liquidityinjectedinto variousbanks ultimately failed, and there was an additional cost
to the Central Bank interms o f the interest paid on open market operations to mop up excess liquidity.
In2002, arunonBanco Alemhn -which itselfwas healthybut sufferedcontagion from the failure and
dissolution o f a mutual fund affiliate - eventually required its closure. Since then and through 2004, an
additional four banks closed down, some voluntarily, due to the rising share o fnon-performing loans.

9.    The result o fthe financial sector problems has been a reduction inbank credit to the private
sector by about a 14 percent at the end o f 2004 compared to two years earlier, although credit beganto
grow inthe second halfo fthe year. The banking systemi s highlydollarized, and remains vulnerable
to shocks. Another major problem i s the critical condition o f the public developmentbank, the Banco
Nacional de Foment0 (BNF), which suffers from both illiquidity and insolvency with non-performing
loans constituting more than half o f its portfolio. Other serious issues include weak bank resolution
and supervisionprocesses and institutions, accounting practices and norms that do not comply with
international standards and that over-estimate local bank solvency, a deposit guarantee system that
relies on direct financial support from the State, an antiquated banking law lacking modernresolution
procedures2,and vulnerability o f the Central Bank to interference andpressure from the Executive.



 A modembanking resolution law including a private sector deposit insurance scheme was approved inDecember 2003.

B. RecentEconomicDevelopments

10.   Economic perfomance improved markedly in2003 and 2004 with GDP expandingby an
estimated 2.6 and 2.9 percent respectively (Table 1).The increased growth in2003 was the result o f a
12percent expansion inthe agriculture sector thanks to exceptionallyhigh intemational prices o f
soybeans and cotton. Risingagricultural exports bolstered the guarani which appreciated by close to 15
percent with respect to the U S dollar over the year allowing inflation to return to single digits and
international reserves to rise by 50 percent. After several years o f deficits, tight spendingpolicies and
improved tax administrationresultedinprimary surpluses. These trends strengthenedin2004, as
economic growth continued despite a drought, supported by favorable regional and global conditions.
Unlike2003, growth was morebalanced across sectors, withnearly all areas contributing to the
economic expansion. Thanks to a 36 percent rise intax revenues and to constrained public spending,
the Central Government achieved an estimated primary surplus o f 2.7 percent of GDP. The guarani
remained stable, depreciatingby 5 percent with respect to the U S dollar, and CPIinflation endedthe
year at 2.8 percent.

11. Registeredexports grew bynearly 30 percent inpart due to strong soy prices and access to new
export markets for meat. Imports also expanded by 30 percent inthe same period, reflecting both the
economic recovery and higher petroleum prices. As a result, the current account surplus declined to 0.7
percent of GDP in2004, from 2.4 percent in2003. Net central bank purchases o f foreign exchange
have offset upward pressures on the currency from buoyant export eaming and large private capital
inflows, moderating the growth o f the money supply, and increasing intemational reserves to US$1.2
billion at the end o f 2004.

 12.   DespiteParaguay's lack o f access to international markets, total external debt, mostlypublic
sector, i s estimated to have reached 49 percent o f GDP in2002, declining to about 45 percent in2003
as a result o f GDP growth and the appreciationo f the guarani3.The debt-to-GDP ratio i s estimated to
have declinedto 39 percent by the end o f 2004 due to economic expansion and a primary surplus, and
helpedby low intemational interest rates andthe depreciationofthe dollar. For the mediumterm, and
barring a further major depreciation of the guarani, debt service payments are not projectedto increase
dramatically as debt i s mainly long-run and concessional. The on-going and projected improvement in
the public finances should also ease concerns about debt sustainability.


 The 2003 debt ratio reflects an increase of over 10percentage points with respect to its 2001 level, largely the result o f the
depreciation o f the guarani and poor growth performance, rather than a significant amount o f new debt.

13.   Policy reforms. The Administration took advantage o f the incipient recovery and strong political
support to quickly launch an economic adjustment and reform program. By the end o f 2003, notable
advances on a package of core economic laws had enabled the Administration to reach an agreement
with the IMFfor a precautionary 15-monthStand-By Arrangement (now extendedby six months) and
led to the support inlending for financial sector programs, totaling a combined US$45 million from the
Bank and the IDB.Together with the Administration's agreement with commercial banks to
reschedule over US$100 million indomestic debt which was complementedby accords with bilateral
creditors to reschedule debt service arrears, this facilitated a significant reduction inarrears.

14.   The Administration's economic program aims to stabilize Paraguay's macroeconomic situation
andbegin a process o f structuralreform, with priority placedon addressing the country's long-standing
governance problems and improving the efficiency and transparency o f government operations. In
October 2003, the President signed a political agreement with the heads of bothhouses o f Congress
andwith opposition party leaders to pass a series o f economic reform laws designed to constrain
current expenditures, tackle key fiscal drains on the public accounts, enhance tax and tariff revenues,
and address urgentvulnerabilities o f the economy such as those associated with the financial sector
and public enterprises. These bills included an austere budget for 2004, the renegotiation o f domestic
debt obligations with commercialbanks, a tax reformbillto widen the tax base and eliminate
loopholes and exemptions, laws to strengthen the banking system through improved bank resolution
and deposit insurance and to reorganize ailing public banks, legislationreforming the government
employees' pension planwhich was the major drain on public finances, a new customs code to
modernize and strengthen the customs administration, and a plan for the restructuring o f public
administration. Ofthe eight bills included inthe agreement, six have already been approved by
Congress (the 2004 budget law, debt restructuring, deposit insurance and bank resolution, the
government pension law, the tax reform, and the customs code).

 15.   Inadditionto legislative advances, the Government has taken concrete actions to address some
of the mainimmediate obstacles impedingParaguay's returnto sustained economic growth and


                                                    4

poverty reduction. Steps for improving the soundness and performance o f Petropar, the State
petroleum company are undenvaf. Significant steps have been taken to tackle short-run fiscal issues.
A number o fmeasures were swiftly implementedto halt growth ofspending includingwithdrawalo f
budgetary supplements presented duringthe previous Administration and freezing o f public sector
wages. The administration also moved to tackle the pervasive problem o f tax evasion and poor tax
revenues. The results of this effort to date have beenimpressive: a 36 percent increase intax revenues
in2004 as comparedto 2003. Morerecently, inorderto ensure that fiscal targets for the year aremet,
the Government announced the imposition o f a temporary 4 percent tax on soybean industry exporters
who traditionally bear a very low tax burden inParaguay.

16.     Alongside fiscal measures to contain spending and increase revenues, the Administration has
also embarked on a program of administrative measures to increase transparency andreduce waste and
corruption inthe public sector. These have included steps to begin the cleaning up o f two state
institutions: the state development bank (Banco Nacional de Fomento, BNF) and the state social
security institute (Instituto de Prevision Social, IPS). The top command inthe military and national
police have been replaced and the Government succeeded inthe difficult political challenge o f
changing two thirds o f the judges sitting on the Supreme Court. The Administration has also taken
actions inthe areas o ftax and customs administration. A census o f public sector employees was
recently completed which, inaddition to playing a keyrole inrationalizing resources and enhancing
the performance o f the public sector, i s serving to audit employee rolls inorder to eliminate phantom
workers and those illegally collecting more than one salary. Similarly, the government pension rolls
are being cleaned, with 1600 non-justified pensions eliminated to date.

17.     The Governmenthas made important progress inimplementingParaguay's Procurement Action
Plan following the regulationo fthe recently approved Public Procurement Law and the resolution
creating the Directorate General o f Public Procurement (DGCP). A procurement portal has been
launched on the Web. At this stage, this website i s an informational one which includes the annual
procurement plans for state institutions, available biddingdocuments, the bulk o f invitations to bid and
contract awards, as well as a list o f ineligible and black-listed contractors. This i s seen as the first step
ina full-fledged electronic procurementsystem. Inaddition,a public process for the competitive
selection o f the head and key staff of the DGCP has taken place, as have public hearings on the newly
designed standard public biddingdocuments. Progress on these measures and the increased
transparency o fpublic procurement practices has already led to reductions inspending on goods and
services and to more efficient public investment.

18.     The Governmentis implementingstrategies to continue to improve financial management in
Paraguay. Public sector budgetingand accounting have been transformed and an integrated financial
management system (SIAF) has beenimplemented inthe Central Govemment and insome
decentralized agencies. The IDBhas been supporting the Government inthis effort through technical
cooperation operations. Measures to introduce accrual accounting into the SIAF andto further expand
it to other decentralized agencies were supported underthe World Bank's Economic Recovery

 A CAS benchmarkfor the base case scenario is that the net worth of Petropar shouldnot declinewith respectto its level on December
31,2003. Petropar'snet worth fell in 2004 as aresult of the failure of domestic pricesto keep up with the rising internationalprice of oil.
Diesel prices havebeen adjustedonly to the levelprevailing in neighboringcountries. Recently,however, an important change to the
way inwhich domestic prices are set has beeneffected allowing Petropar,rather than the Govemment, to set price increases.This should
ensure that increaseswill be govemedby economic rationalerather than by political expediency. Moreover, with the assistance of the
Bank, anew law for the fuel sector has beenprepared,which would increasecompetitionin the sector, and would endPetropar's defucto
monopolyin the import ofdiesel. The framework is currently beingdiscussedby the Cabinet's EconomicTeam, which will present a
draft law to Congress.


                                                                 5

Structural Adjustment Loan approved inDecember 2003. A peer review o f the Comptroller General's
auditprocedures is underway, and an internal audit manual for the institution is beingprepared. The
Government has announced that it will perform regular, independentaudits o fpublic enterprises which
will also be subject to increased data publishingrequirementsto improve transparency. Five such
audits were performed in2004, o f the electric power utility, the telecommunications company, the
telecommunications corporation, the urbanwater and sewerage company, and the social security
institute.This i s part o f an effort to improve efficiency and governance inParaguay's public enterprises
which, despitehaving a strong presence inkey economic activities o f the country, have beenplagued
byinefficient operations andinadequate financial management.

19. The new Government's track recordhas beenencouraging, and the Administration has shown
strong commitment to macroeconomic and fiscal stability. This has begunto engender increased
confidence by the private sector and has paved the way for implementinga financial sector reform
program developed through years o f collaboration between the Bank and successive governments. In
addition to the recently approved Deposit Insurance and Bank Resolution Law, the Government has
put inplace a new regimeto phase inhigher cash provisions inthe bankingsystemto guard against
potential losses on non-performing loans.

C. EconomicProspectsand FinancingNeeds

20.   The Government's economic reform program, along with greater external stability, make the
outlook inParaguay more stable than it has beeninrecent years. Forecasts are for continued GDP
growthon the order o f 3.2 percent in2005, supported by enhanced overall confidence and gradually
strengthening domestic demand. While a severe drought affected agricultural yields in2004, other
sectors o f the economy are expected to expand. Inflation has declined and the exchange rate has
remainedbroadly stable.

21.   Public finances improved in2004 as tax receipts grew at 36 percent above their level in2003,
generating over 2 percent of GDP inadditional revenues. Implementation of the tax reform bill that
was approved in2004, and which i s expected to generate an estimated 1percent o f GDP in additional
revenues in2005, will help ensure continued good revenue performance inthe mediumterm. On the
spendingside, the growth of current expenditures in2004 was constrained to 8 percent innominal
terms, largely reflecting salary increases following 3 years o f a public wage freeze.

22.   As aresult, the Government over-performed on its target of a fiscal surplus o f 0.1percent of
GDP for the full year, as established inthe IMFSBA, with the estimated surplus standing at 1.9
percent5.Paraguay met the quantitative targets for the third quarterly review o f the program, which was
completed and approved by the Fund's Board inDecember 2004. The third review also supported the
Government's request for an extension o f the SBA to September 2005, inorder to complete
outstanding structural reform measures, especially inthe financial sector.

23.   The projected improvement inthe public finances eases concerns about debt sustainability.
Fiscal constraint, combined with economic expansion and a stable local currency, translated into a
gradual reduction inParaguay's debt-to-GDP ratio in2004. The debt ratio i s estimated to have fallen to
about 39 percent o f GDP from 44 percent in2003. Under a scenario o f continued fiscal prudence (with
real primary spendinggrowth o f 2-3 percent) medium-termGDP growtho f 3-3.5 percent, a stable real

24.    GivenParaguay's lack of accessto international financial markets, the Government continues to
face financing needs on the order o fUS$200 million for 2005 that are projectedto bemet by
multilateral andbilateral lending (Table 3). Inaddition, the balance ofpayments projections for
Paraguay show an overall financing need of US$186 million in2005 and US$281 millionin2006, out
o f which the expected foreign exchange contribution from multilateral and official flows (net o f new
commercial inflows/outflows) would be US$185 million and US$l50million respectively, with this
loan's projecteddisbursements o f US$15 million constituting a portion o fthose amounts (also see

D. MultilateralCoordination

25.    The Bank is closely coordinatingthe design of a financial sector and state bank reform program
with boththe IMF and the IDB(Box 1). The IMF SBA includes structural benchmarks for financial
sector reform. The Bank and IDBhaveprepared ajoint financial sector program with actions related
to the reform andmodernizationof the bankingsector andthe rationalization and downsizing o f the
state banks, IDBhas postponedits adjustment lending and will initiate the process through financial

intermediation lendingto support the new consolidation o fthe state banks into a single second tier
institution, reflecting the first half o fthe state bank reforms. The Bank has also prepared a parallel
Technical Assistance project to support reform implementation and institutional strengthening. The
IMFprogram supports the financial sector reformcommitments inthe Bankprogram, but also includes
complementary issues such as increasingthe independence o fthe Central Bank, supporting the
organizational reengineering o f the Central Bank, providing technical assistance for twinning
arrangements with Chile's bankingsuperintendency, and movingtowards obtaining international credit
ratings o f Paraguayanbanks. The IDBprogram also supports separatebut complementary issues such
as improving the supervision and institutional framework for the cooperatives and credit union sectors.

26.   The sectoral program supportedbythis programmatic operation is aimed at financing policy
reform efforts to ensure the stability o fthe financial system duringthis critical period. A well
functioning banking systemwhich can provide broad access to credit inthe economy, while
maintainingprudent reserves against risks, i s essential to achieving a higher sustained level o f
investment and GDP. A lack o f investmentfinancing can quickly stifle the renewedgrowth if
domestic sources o f financing do not become available due to balance sheet weaknesses infinancial
institutions. The reform program intends to prevent such outcomes by undertaking up-front reform
actions to fortify the banking system.

        PART 11. FINANCIAL SECTORCONTEXT AND THE REFORMPROGRAM

A.    Overview

27.   The Paraguayan banking systemhas been ina vulnerable state for a number o f years, inlarge
part due to the continuing anemic economic growth, but also due to the incidence o f at least three
separate banking crises since 1995 to-date, duringwhich twenty one banks and over thirty finance
companies were dissolved. Presently, the banking system i s primarily foreign owned. Interms o f
deposits, 35 percent o fbanks represent branches o f foreign banks and another 41 percent are either
regional banks or locally basedbanks with a majority foreign ownership. Excluding the finance
companies which represent under 10percent o f the financial system, the remainder o f the banks are
three local banks which hold 24 percent o f deposits including the State bank, BNF with 9 percent.

28.   Although deposit growth has beensteady, credit has been contracting, primarily due to a higher
share of non-performing loans from slow economic growth, and more recently due to credit defaults o f
borrowers highly exposed indollars. Average intermediation spreads inlocal currency remainhigh,
easily reaching 20 percentage points. This not only reflects cost inefficiencies, but more importantly
highrateswhich compensate for largeportionso floanportfolioswhich are notperforming,
particularly those denominated inlocal currency. Banking reserve requirementsare inversely
proportional to the maturity term o f deposits. This puts a higherreserve cost on short term deposits
and would normally encourage banks to offer longer term instruments.

29.   However, given depositor preference for short term deposits andbanks' preferences for shorter
term lending, the result i s a relatively highreserve/deposit ratio which increases intermediation costs
particularly on dollar denominated loans, and therefore on lendingrates. For deposits indomestic
currency the reserve requirement is: 15 percent for depositsup to 1year maturity; 7 percent for
maturities between 1and 1?4years; and zero for over 1?4years. For dollar deposits, the requirement
is: 27 percent for up to one year; 15 percent for between 1 and 1?4years; 5 percent for between 1?4 to
3 years; and zero above 3 years.

30.    Dueto the difficult externalenvironment inthe past three years, generated inpartbyParaguay's
large neighbors (Brazil, Argentina), the Paraguayan monetary authorities took action towards managed
devaluations inorder to maintain export competitiveness vis-a-vis the country's main trading partners,
However, such devaluations have also put indirect stress on the banking system since a large portion
(57 percent) o f loans are denominated inU S dollars and for borrowers with no hard currency income
(approximately 85 percent o fborrowers), any devaluation translates into a higher debt servicing load in
local currency terms, thus increasing credit risk andpossibilities o f default on payments. Therefore,
about 48 percent ofthe loan portfolio i s at risk o f payment difficulties due to current and potential
devaluations.

31,    The devaluation effect has, however, strengthened Paraguay's ratio o f hard currency reserves to
national currency since the latter has lost value. Even takingthe most conservative measurement o f
available international reserves to back up a potential currency run,the reserve backing appears
adequate (see tables below) and the Government does not pretendto defend the currency with a fixed
rate policy, particularly given the recent loss o freserves intrying to defendthe currency after the
previous wave o f Brazilian devaluations. Nevertheless, while reserves are adequate for this particular
purpose, additional shocks related to trade payments and withdrawal o fbanking systemdollar deposits,
mayrenderthem somewhat limited for covering internationalpayment obligations, ifneeded. In

addition, the dollarization risk which affects the corporate borrowing sector represents a large potential
vulnerability problem for banks interms o fthe higher credit risks, and therefore increasingnon-
perfonning loans, that this impliesfrom unhedgedborrowers.

32.    Money supply indicators show that M1grew by 29 percent inthe year on year period from end
November 2003 through November 2004. Credit to the private sector increasedby 17percent during
the same period although this was accounted for inpart because the nominal exchange rate appreciated
slightly duringthe same period. M 2 grew by 27 percent duringthat annual period reflectingmore
liquidityinthe financial systemwith loweredinterest rates. While the BCP's open market operations
continued to place additional paper on the market to absorb excess liquidity, these were priced at lower
rates, which, along with the extremely low inflation achieved, allowed the guarani to appreciate against
the dollar (the guarani hadreached a devaluation peak inearly 2003). The preference for foreign
currency deposits was reversed in2004 with a decline o f 6 percent since the end o f the first quarter,
with an increasingshare movingto local currency deposits which increasedby 12percent, inpart due
to the very low interest rates offered for dollar deposits and the stabilization o f the exchange rate.
While additional dollarization mighthave some benefits such as making the financial system less
vulnerable to currency risks, it also generates more structural vulnerabilities due to emergence o f
corporate credit risks from increased local currency debt servicing costs on dollar denominated
borrowing. The looseningo f monetary policy and overall lowering o f interest rates under a more

stable exchange rate environment has de-dollarized the banking system by about 5 percent. The
increased banking liquiditywhich now remains at very highlevels has resultedinthe expansion liquid
financial investments to compensate for the reduced willingness o fbanksto lendwithin an
environment o f lower solvency ratios anddecreasing earnings.

System Vulnerabilities

33.    The reformprogram supportedbythe PFSAL to a significant extent developed out o fthe
Paraguayan Financial Sector Review (Grey Cover Report No. 24249-PAYNovember 15,2002). That
Review took an FSAP-styleapproach to diagnosing financial systemrisks and regulatory
vulnerabilities. It recommended key reform actions and was discussed extensively with the authorities
(particularly the Central Bank and the Ministryo f Finance) who worked closely with the Bank to
define the future policy actions impliedfrom that diagnosis.

34.    The Review addressed a number o f critical issues inthe Paraguayan banking system, including
the need to reform the exit procedures for weak or insolvent banks, the needto strengthenbanking
prudential regulations such as loan loss provisioning and capital adequacy norms, the need to establish
a banking sector funded deposit insurance scheme versus apublicly guaranteed scheme, and the
critical need to reform the State owned banks which requiredcapital injections andmajor reforms to
stem losses and limit exposures to smaller borrowers. The Review also conducted a vulnerability
stress test o fbankingbalance sheets (described further below) to determine which institutions had
capital deficiencies and where existing regulatory norms could be improved to address these and
mitigate future risks.

35.    The mainchallenge inParaguay's financial system i s to assure stable banking institutions and to
manage the smooth exit of financial institutions not capable o f weathering the economic cycles and
ensuring an adequate capital base. The financial system remains vulnerable after periodically re-
emergingbankingcrises. The first crisis in 1995 was primarily generated by the collusion o fvarious
banks representingabout 10percent o f the financial system and the Central Bank, inwhich banking
reserves were re-lent on the black market through unregistered institutions. Besides the illegality o f
the entire scheme, the derived effects endedup affecting 18 financial institutions and the Central Bank
endedup spendingUS$400 million equivalent to bail out the bankingsystemto avoid a systemic
collapse.

36.    In1997 the secondbankingcrisis occurredwhenBanco Union, followed by Banco de Desarrollo
del Paraguay collapsed after a run on deposits. Inpart, the weakness manifested inthese banks also
pertainedto the legacy o f the previous banking crisis, since Banco Union inparticular suffered from
non-performing assets which were inlarge part linked to the absorption o f repossessed assets as part of
a settlement inthe previous crisis. The next crisis occurred in 1998 following the Government's
decision to raise domestic interest rates to maintain currency stability and attract foreign investment,
The sale o f CentralBank T-bills for this purpose, resultedina sharp contraction o f liquidity from the
financial systemprompting some public sector agencies such as the social security institute to begin
withdrawingits deposits from banks which appearedweak after the liquidity tightening. This
generated contagion effects until finally a total o f eight banks had to be intervened and closed. While
not considered a full blown crises per se, there were additional scares in2001 when another local bank,
Bancoplus was intervened due to liquidity problems and a regional bank, Banespa, closed. Following
that, inmid-2002 the foreign owned Banco Aleman was closed after depositors withdrew their funds,
and in2003 Banco de Asunci6n and INGBank closed due to solvency problems.


                                                    11

37.    The recent crises also highlightedthe problems o fParaguayanbanks due to their over-reliance
on public sector deposits for their operations as well as their accounting practices which hidunderlying
solvency problems until liquidity crises hit. It also highlighted the risks to pensioners inhaving the
Social Security Institute deposit excessive funds inriskybanks, particularly public sector banks. This
latter issue i s o fparticular prominence currently as the remaining state-owned commercial bank, BNF,
holds a large quantity of social security deposits and i s experiencing liquidityproblems due to
borrower defaults. Some of these are due to government initiatives inthe previous Administration to
forgive debt repayment inorder to help reactivate the economy as well as by the generally politically
motivated lendingpractices seen historically inthe bank. Recently, a new management team was
installed to overhaul operations.

38.    The Government considers it critical that an updated banking framework beput inplace to both
detect banking weaknesses early on and to ensure corrective action, as well as to implement market
based financial mechanisms to allow the smooth exit or sale o f insolvent banks from the system.

B.    The BankingSystem

Background

39.    The Paraguayan financial system i s dominatedby banks which comprise 85 percent o f all
financial intermediaries and 91percent o f licensed deposit taking institutions6. Foreign owned banks
hold 75 percent o fbanking systemassets and deposits. The four large international foreign banks
which are the strongest group o fbanks inParaguay represent 44 percent o f all bank assets. Credit
cooperatives, insurance companies, securities firms, pensionmanagers, and other non-bank financial
institutions are currently overseen by supervisory authorities which are separate from the banking
superintendency.

Non-Performing Loans

40.    As o fJanuary 31,2005, the Paraguayan banking system which represents over 90 percent o f
assets o f deposit taking institutions, had an aggregate non-performing loan ratio o f 11percent.
Excluding BNFwhich initselfreports 50 percent of its loans as non-performing, the aggregate level

  Excludes nonbanks such as exchange houses and cooperatives, and non deposit taking State intermediaries.


                                                                     13

would be 6 percent. If     provisions are taken into account, thenthe unprovisioned portion o f the non-
performing portfolio for all banks would stand at 5 percent o f net loans. These levels o f non-
performing assets may not fully take into account refinanced or restructured loans which in some cases
become reclassified if a borrower has paid at least 10percent o fprevious debts, therefore, ifone were
to use stricter criteria, these ratios could potentially be higher.

41.     The loanclassification system uses standard non-accrual time triggers, although untilrecently,
following entry into non accrual status not all interest accruals were hlly reversed as they should.
Category 1and 2 loans didnot requireany generic provisioning either and extended to longer elapsed
days before beingreclassified, although categories 3-5 use standard provisioning ratios. However, up
untilrecently, there was anover relianceonunderlyingcollateral as a substitutefor provisions, and
while this might normally be acceptable ifcollateral assets were quickly collectible, the delays inlegal
procedures to obtain court judgments, which average three years, effectively reduce or discount the
present value o f such collateral substantially. The reported level o fnon-performing loans makes the
financial systemvulnerable not only from a general solvency viewpoint but also because such
circumstances put pressure on interest rates to rise inorder for banks to compensate their income from
losses on the non-performing portfolio andnew provisioning needs.

42.     While the financial condition of the banking system improved through 2004, the fragile state o f
the system hadbeencompoundedbypast currency devaluations. While banks' dollar denominated
loans and investments surpass their dollar denominated deposits, thus providing them with a "long"
hedgeindollars, borrowers are generally exposed to exchange risks on debt servicing costs. About 57
percent o f loans are dollar denominated and it i s estimated that 85 percent o fborrowers (interms o f
borrowed amounts) are unhedged. This means that about 48 percent (= 0.85         * 57 percent)  o fthe loan
portfolio i s subject to risk due to devaluation. While banks themselves are not directly exposed to the
foreign exchange risk from a highly dollarized system, the borrowers' exposure generates a significant
additional credit risk, and hence risk management issue, for bank portfolios, thus requiring the
formulation o fpolicies to mitigate such risks.

Experience with Safety Net, Liquidity Facilities and Deposit Insurance Mechanisms

43.     The CentralBank o fParaguay has recently institutedchanges inits policies governing the use o f
safety net and other Central Bank credit mechanisms, particularly inlight o f the past six years'
experience which resultedinsubstantial Central Bank Losses from failed banks which had previously
made extensive use o f BCP credit (Table 8).

44.     Inapproximate historical costs, 12percent o fGDPhas beenexpendedonvarious rescue
packages. Interms of amounts expended, over US$1 billion equivalent was used for such operations,


                                                     14

whose historical dollar value of still unrecuperated itemswould have beenabout US$700 million'.
However due to ongoing devaluations, the current outstanding balances o f non-repaid BCP credit
and/or other funds extended, as o f end 2003, would now equal US$244 million at 2003 andcurrent
exchange rates, or equivalent to 12 percent o fpresent banking system deposit liabilities. Some
instruments which hadpreviously beenallowed have beenrecently halted as a matter o fpolicy. These
include overdrafts on banks' clearing accounts, and the use of discretionary credits from the BCP to
banks, most o fwhich were used duringthe 1995-96 banking crisis but have now been discontinued.

Deposit Insurance

45.    Untilrecently, Paraguay's deposit insurance schemewas named adeposit "guarantee" scheme
since it reflected a guarantee by the State which was not backedby any private premiums contributed
by financial institutions inorder to accumulate a fund. The schemewas not funded and dependedon
disbursementsfrom the CentralBank when needed8. Inthis regard, the system already induces moral
hazard since banks have no stake infunding the cost o f the scheme and depositors have no incentives
to monitor bank risks. The level o f covered deposits i s approximately $11,000 per person (Le., not per
account) reflecting 75 minimumwages, which i s about 9 times Paraguay's GDP per capita, a level
above global and regional averages but also recently biased upwards by the fact that Paraguayan per
capita income indollars has decreased inrecent years on account o f currency devaluations. To-date
the Government guarantee schemehas disbursedapproximately $700 million equivalent since 1994.

46.    The Government i s now developing the creation o f a privately funded deposit insurance scheme.
The capitalization o f such a scheme would bebased on the accumulated investedpremiums
complemented by State supported funddguarantees inthe initial years of operation. As o f January 31,
2005, total deposits inthe bankingsystem amounted to US$2,032 million equivalent. Ifone uses 5
percent o f deposits as a reasonable target level sought for an insurance fundg,this would needto reach
US$102 million equivalent assuming current exchange rates. However, this only reflects 5 percent of
the present day level o f deposits and the objective would be to reach at least 5 percent o f ongoing and
future levels o fthe deposit base. Based onrecent historical trends, deposits inthebanking systemin
Paraguay have grown by 15 percent annually on average. Ifone uses this figure to project the level o f
future deposits, say inten years, one obtains the following:

           6. Estimated time for full capitalization:
               (excluding any Government contribution)                                  11 years


47.     It shouldbenoted that, although 5 percent o f deposits appears small, based on present data on
"insured/covered deposits", it would infact cover about 20 percent o f all such portions o f deposits in
the systemas of January 31,2005. This means that ifthe fund was capitalized today at 5 percent, its
resources would be sufficient to cover at one time, one fifth o f all insureddeposit amounts - any
amounts above the insuredlimit for larger deposits would not be covered as i s the present policy under

  Inthis case, as with others, the central bank inParaguay covers a number offunding costs whichnormally should be
attributed to the Treasury. These include medium term funding facilities for systemic liquidityproblems as discussed
earlier. In 1999,however, this policy was temporarily modified when proceeds from a Taiwanese credit (issued as a bond
of the ParaguayanGovernment) were usedinpart, for the pay-out of depositors.
  The new Deposit Insurance / Bank ResolutionLaw (2334103) states that the fundwill be capitalized at up to 10percent of
deposits. The insured amount per depositor remains at 75 minimummonthly wages as inthe previous system.


                                                           16

the deposit guarantee. An "excess of loss policy" sourced from Government funds, for any payments
above the 5 percent limit, based on the current banking structure, would cover any portion o f the
remaining 80 percent of legally insured deposits. Since a scenario o f more than 20 percent o f insured
deposits being at risk at any one time i s almost equivalent to a systemic crisis, it i s unlikely, once such
a fund i s fully capitalized, that it would even needto finance such a level o f loss unless a crisis was
bank wide. At the current level o fUS$11,000 equivalent per person as the deposit guarantee,
approximately 80 percent of individuals holding deposits would be fully covered.

48.    The investment regime for deposit insurance funds would be extremely conservative and
riskless. For conflict of interest purposes, the funds could not be invested inthe financial sector or if
so, likelyunder a trustee arrangement. A more viable option would be for the Central Bank to place
investedfunds inhighlyratedcorrespondent banks.

Bank Exit /Bank Resolution Mechanisms & Early CorrectiveActions

49.    Paraguay's banking law i s clear on the steps and triggers for intervention andmonitoring o f
weak banks, and provides clear indications o f shareholders'responsibilities inrestoring capital. In
terms o f flexible options for the resolution and restructuring of bank balance sheets to avoid full
liquidation, a Law (No. 1420) hadbeen adopted inearly 1999 with Bank assistance" inwhich the
modalities o f splittingweak banks into good andbadbanks for the purpose o f transferring viable assets
and deposits to other purchasing institutions was included (Articles 22, 24, 25: "Depuracion").                      This
law, however, only lasted one year since the Government saw it as a crisis resolutionmeasure which
the Congress only authorized as a temporary special measure. That law while including the menuo f
modalities for resolving failed banks, hadlacked some prioritization inthe sequencing o f steps to be
followed as well as the clarification of least cost criteria inthe use o f deposit guarantee andor fiscal
funds to restructure and sell banksprior to consideringthe liquidation option. However, since the law
was authorized for one year as a contingent emergency measure, there was no opportunity to apply it
before it expired.

50.    Untilrecently Paraguay's bankingresolutionprocedures were governed by Title E,Chapter 11,
and Title X o f the Banking Law (No. 861) which existed prior to Law 1420. While Articles 122-123
o f Title X o f Law 861 permit the sale o f a bank by shareholders, once intervened, this i s the only
modality which alludes to market based mechanisms for "saving" badbanks. Once such mechanisms
are exhausted, the remainingoption is liquidation, either judicial or extra-judicial which normally
entails a higher cost to the State interms o f immediate payments for all insured depositors. The extra-
judicial route was traditionally preferredsince it maintained the full control o f the process inthe SB,
whereas, underjudicial liquidation, the courts are involved and there are constraints inexecution due
to judicial system delays as well as problems inherent inthe bankruptcy law. However, to diminishthe
SB's draining o f resources from carrying out such liquidation exercises, the Government intendsto
modify the legal framework so that all liquidations are carried out within the context o f formal judicial
and improvedbankruptcyproceedings. Under the new Bank Resolution and Deposit Insurance Law,
the contingent cost issues and bank dissolution procedures are substantially optimized under a
sequenced procedural framework so as to diminishState liabilities while protecting depositors.



loA Bank mission visited Paraguay inlate 1998 for the purpose of identifying changes to the existing banking law as part
o fpotential conditionality for a fmancial sector operation. Shortly after the mission, political upheavals obviated the
possibility o f continuing with the financial sector program.


                                                             17

Assessment of Financial System Vulnerabilities

5 1. Inorder to assess latent weaknesses inthe bankingsector, an exercise was conducted in
conjunction with the Government to determinethe inherent financial strength o f financial institutions.
A number o fbalance sheet adjustments and"stress test" adjustment, beyondregulatory requirements,
were made for this purpose. The adjustments include two basic components. First there are
adjustments to thefinancial statements presented to the Superintendency o f Banks by the financial
institutions, and these adjustments attempt to reflect more accurately the actual financial condition o f
the system. These financial reporting adjustments include a change inthe calculation o f solvency
capital, as well as four adjustments related to the loan portfolio.

52.    Following these, astress test of portfolio impact over selected macroeconomic variables i s
conducted (stress test 1for exchange rate devaluation, and stress test 2 for real economic growth). The
impact o f the macroeconomic variables on non-performing loans is calculated bymeans o fmultiple
regressions intwo scenarios (elasticities calculated for the entire banking systemand by bank
categories). Regarding the adjustment to financial statements a fully accurate analysis would still
require a validation review on an institution by institution basis, which will be conducted by the
Superintendency o f Banks utilizing these results to prioritize its supervisory activity.

53.    The net effect is a potential capital deficit inthe banking system on the order o fUS$134million.
While these adjustments go beyond existingregulatoryrequirements,they do attempt to scale up, by
proxy, the prudential standards to the highest international levels. While the adjustments may be
overly rigorous insome cases, the overall diagnosis nevertheless indicates that certainbanks that do
not count on capital cushions inany substantial way, are not inthe strongest position. This indicates
the needfor close monitoring by the Banking Superintendency incase bank resolution actions need to
be applied ifthe conditions o f such banks deteriorates further.

Non Bank Credit Institutions

54.    The assessment o f sub-sectors requiringfinancial systemstrengthening also include, besides
banks, the finance companies which generally represent much smaller scale operations and constitute
about 10percent o f the deposit-taking financial system. The primary difference betweenbanks and
finance companies i s that the latter are not permittedto offer checking accounts or otherwise constitute
a formal part o f the payments system for transactions processing, daily fund transfers and cash
settlement. Inall other respect, finance companies require prudential oversight giventheir core
business o f lendingagainst funding provided by individual depositors. However, to-date, a much less
regulatedand growing sector i s the credit cooperatives (credit unions as known insome countries)
sector. While traditionally such cooperatives have beenless regulated since many are not credit
providing institutions (e.g.: some farmers' coops) and others are strictly for professionals or trade
membersonly (e.g.: inthe agricultural or education sectors), this segment o fthe financial services
industryhas begunexpanding rapidly" and more recently membershiprequirements havebecome
more lenient. Inthis context, even though the cooperatives are supervised by the Cooperatives
Institute (INCOOP) an autonomous agency previously underthe Ministryo fAgriculture, the Central
Bank has considered their growth to be systemically important, and since membershipi s now
expanding to the general public, it i s felt that cooperatives, particularly those with a significant mass o f


I'Estimates o f their size inthe financial system vary with estimates as high as 15%-20% regarding their share within the
total of all deposit taking financial institutions.

deposits, should beregulated with minimum solvency requirements as the other deposit-taking credit
providing institutions are, to avoid an unfair competitive advantage via regulatory arbitrage as well as
puttingdepositor funds at risk through unsoundfinancialmanagement practices. While the IDBhas
been taking the lead inthis sector, the Bank has provided complementary technical advice and worked
inconjunctionwith the World Council ofCreditUnions (WOCCU) to recommend a sound set of
regulations for implementation inthe credit cooperatives sector, supervisedby INCOOP.

Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism

55.     Giventhe increased emphasis post September 11,2001, as well as due to the crackdownon
contraband trade and drug trafficking activity, the Government will also implement new measures to
oversee and detect money laundering activity. Ontop o f the already existing legislation for this
purpose, the new measures will require financial institutions to adopt a monitorable code o f conduct in
line with Base1Core Principle No. 15, so that banks can better know their clients and report any
suspicious operations to the Central Bank and the National Secretariat for the Prevention o fMoney
Laundering.

56.    Money laundering i s a problem inParaguay which hampers private sector development since
illicit funds `compete' unfairly by not having to paymarket interest rates. Besides affecting above
board businesses, laundered funds are not subject to taxes and eventually those responsible for such
funds accumulate sufficient capital so as to havethe capability to influence or confront the
Government itself. Overall, this activity affects the Government inits ability to engender sustainable
development. While Paraguay has signed international agreements (U.N.,OAS,Egmont Group,
GAFISUD, IMFand World Bank) committing itself to fight money laundering andterrorist financing,
much needs to be done at the local implementation level. For the Egmont Group, an association o f
financial intelligence unitswith 80 membersworldwide, Paraguay i s currently suspended and under
probationary status which has motivated an overhaul o f its AML framework.

57.     Previously a special unit for analysis o fmoney/asset laundering was set up inthe Central Bank,
and this Unit would coordinate with the Central Bank's Department o f Economic Crimes which would
thenliaisewith the National Secretariat for Anti Money Laundering. The Unitwas also meant to
maintain contact and seek advice on best practices from the Egmont Group which exchanges
procedural information on these matters with participating financial authorities. Technical assistance
for the strengtheningo fthe Unit i s beingprovided by the IDBthrough a technical cooperation grant,
andthe IMFwill also beproviding advice inthis area. The U.S. Treasury i s assisting the Government
indrafting anew framework. TheBank would also support the institutionbuildingefforts as
necessary, while considering the funding already available.

58.     Other reforms beingput inplace include a new `manual o f conduct' guideline that will apply to
all entities supervisedby the Superintendency and emphasize "know thy client" principles. This will
require regular reporting on connected businesses and forwarding o f information on potentially illicit
activities to the Secretariat for Prevention o f Money Laundering.

59.     The reforms underthe framework for anti-money laundering and detection o fterrorism financing
will apply to a wider sectoral coverage includingfinancial institutions outside o fthe banking system,
such as insurance companies and securities firms which could also potentially channel illicit funds.

60.     Inaddition, the SuperintendencyofBankswill, for banking anddeposit taking institutions,
include inits `fit andproper' reviews, criteria to assess adequacy o f bank managers andmajor

                                                    19

shareholders (both at the licensing stage or for change inownership), factors to assess or identify any
potential money laundering connections. Inaddition, under the SB's review o f bank risk management
procedures, its evaluation of intemal controls and susceptibility to fraudulent practices, will also assess
within the same context, the institutional vulnerability to money laundering.

TheState Owned Banks

61.   There i s currently one public bank and 6 other state-owned institutions operating inthe
Paraguayan financial sector. Together, these public institutions have total assets of about US$450
million, which corresponds to about 17percent o f the total financial sector assets12and 5 percent o f
Paraguay's GDP. The Banco Nacional de Fomento i s by far the largest state-owned financial
institution inParaguay. It manages about 60 percent o f the total assets inits peer group, and about 11
percent o fbanking sector assets. It i s the only state-owned institution to accept deposits from the
public. The remaining entities arejust usedas conduits to channel subsidized funds, mainly from the
international donor community. Accordingly, the loans granted by these institutions, including BNF,
are offered at rates substantially lower than those o fprivate sector institutions. Three out the seven
institutions are offering their services directly to their target group, whereas the remaining ones, UTEP,
FDI,FDC and CONAVUBANAVI (see pages 21-23) are operatingas a second-tier institutions, using
other financial intermediaries to offer their services.

motivation behindthe current bank restructuringproposal o f the Government o f Paraguay. Inthe
remainder o f this section, a brief assessmento fthe institutional set-up and the financial situation o f
each o f these state-owned financial institutions i s conducted. Thereafter, the insights o f these
institutional assessments are usedto review the current restructuring plans preparedby the Ministry o f
Finance and the Banco Central of Paraguay, and elaborate a selected number o f alternatives to support
the decision-making process.

First Tier Institutions
63.   Banco Nacional de Fomento: The BNF was incorporatedin 1961bymeans o f the Law-Decree
2811 1961with the objective to promote various segments of the Paraguayan economy, inparticular
agriculture and selected trade and manufacturing activities. According to its organic law, the bank i s
divided into three business areas: an agricultural department, a commercial department and a
development banking department. All three areas have their own capital endowment and maintain a
separate accounting      .However,       they are supported by the same administrative systemand operational
infrastructure. Art. 1o f the organic law states that BNF's obligations are guaranteed by the Paraguayan
State. Inaddition, Art. 12prescribes that any losses from the agricultural department will be absorbed
bythe Government o fParaguay (GOP), through the Ministryo fFinance (MoF).

64.   The value BNF's assets i s substantially inflated due to nonconventional accounting. After the
requiredadjustments, it is shownthat the institutionis decapitalizing at a very fast pace, and thereby
destroying value for the taxpayer. It i s more alarming, therefore, to know that nearly a third o f BNF's
funds originates from deposits o fthe social security system. Overall, the quality o fthe loanportfolio
is very poor with over 55 percent o fthe portfolio inarrears. Over 70 percent o fthese non-performing
loans have beeninarrears for more than 360 days. Surprisingly,legal proceedings are underway for
only less than halfo f these cases. The analysis o fBNF's arrears statistics indicates that the bad loans
are concentrated essentially inthe loanportfolio at the headquarters, which currently shows an arrears
rate o f 66.6 percent. After minimumadjustments to raise accounting standards according to
international practices, BNFwas found to have a provisioning deficit for bad debts o f about $50
million.
                                                            Table 11

                                                     FINANCIALSOUNDNESS OFBNF
          I n contrast topublished reports, BNF, with an asset base of almost US$200 million equivalent, has an
 estimated capital gap equivalent to one quarter of its assets, based on the application of bestpractice bank accounting
 n o m "   BNF's operational losseshavebeenhistoricallyabsorbedbythe Government byremoving fromBNF's balance
 sheet, foreign loans received to hnd BNF's operations (effectively capitalizing such liabilities). Hence, BNFhas been able
 to technically comply with the solvency requirements o f the Banking Superintendency. But with an accumulating burden
 o n the M o F and the recent deteriorated public finances, the institutionhas increasingly turned to less sound accounting
 practices to delay recognizing its losses. T o assess BNF's real equity position, four different types o f adjustments were
 conducted on recent financial statements. First, the deficit for bad debts provisions was adjusted. Second, BNFwas found
 to have increased its earnings since 1999 by adding the accruedbut previously not accounted interest on those bad loans
 which were reactivated or cancelled according to the laws 1418199 and 1470199 - these figures were thus excluded. As
 BNFproceededwith the debt restructuring, it also dissolved existing provisions for those loans and accountedit as
 extraordinary income. The thirdadjustment consisted inreversing this procedure. The fourth and last adjustment was to
 reverse unpaid amounts due from the Ministry o f Finance to cover losses accumulated inrecent years.

           The assessment o f BNF's liquidity position clearly portrays the fragility o f its financial situation. Its cash, short
 term investments and reserve deposits at the Central Bank could eventually cover only its current accounts and a small
 fraction o f savings accounts and other deposits. The loan portfolio i s shrinkingas the consequence o f the insufficient cash-
 flow generation given the ever increasing delinquency rates and the large operational costs. Receivables from the MoF are
 not likely to be paid incash or negotiable instruments. Foreign loans and credit lines outstanding are subject to foreign
 exchange adjustments. At the current devaluation rate, foreign exchange adjustments to multilateral and bilateral loans
 could further erode significantly the institution's liquidity reserves and its equity base. Unless there i s a strong
 improvementplan with a capital infusion, rising debt service payments will necessarily lead to a sustained shrinkingo f
 productive assets inthe near future.

           Deposits have been declining and have been particularlypronounced inthe last two years, and public sector
 entities such as the state social security1pension fund (IPS) have recently removed massive deposits from the bank for fear
 o f eroding the pensionfund savings. A recent law initiated by congressionalrepresentatives, mandated that BNF's non
 performing portfolio be transferred to the Ministryo f Finance so as to recapitalize the bank. However, the law has not yet
 been implementedsince the Finance Ministry does not feel it has the capacity nor should manage such `lines o fbusiness'.
 Encouraginglythough, a new management team for BNF was appointed to stem losses and to downsize the bank. To-date,
 the team has severely restrictedlendingandlimitedit to small loans consistent with future reforms anticipated for the
 public banks. Loan collection operations have intensifiedinorder to buildup a stronger loss provisioning base and stem
 the loss o f earnings, and an overly top heavy management structure has been greatly downsized with a budget estimated for
 future severance packages and requisite financing being sought.

I        a/ World Bank estimatesbased on application of intemationalaccounting standards and Bask guidelines.

 65.     CrBdito Agricola de Habilitacidn (CAH): The C A H i s not a bank, but a state-owned
 development finance institution with independent legal status which i s dedicated to the promotion o f
 low-income producers and small to micro-enterprises inrural areas. The institutionwas set-up in 1943
 and i s governed by the Law no. 551175. CAH does not take deposits from the public. Its activities are
 financed mostly by international donors, inparticular Japan and Taiwan, and the Ministries o f Finance
 andAgriculture. CAHhas over four times as many clients as BNF, particularly inthe agricultural
 sector, but with a much lighter organizational structure. However its income, much o f it earned via
 below market loan rates i s sufficient only cover halfof its operating expenses, thus the institution i s
 decapitalizing.

 66.     Fondo Ganadero: Like CAH, the Fondo Ganadero (FG) is not a bank, but a state-owned
 development finance institution with independent legal status, dedicated to the promotion o f the
 livestock sector inParaguay through subsidized credit and know-how transfer to increase productivity.
 The activities o fthe FGare profitable inspite o f its below-market interest rates, however the margin is


                                                                     22

very sensitive to fluctuations inthe exchange rate. With most o fthe FG's funding denominated in
foreign currency this has generated added liabilities to the Government, from local currency
devaluations. About one quarter of FG's loanportfolio i s inarrears.

Second Tier Institutions

67.   Paraguay's second tier institutions are non deposit taking funds financedby external
international agencies. They are the Unidad Te`cnicaEjecutora de Programas which i s currently
housed inthe Central Bank and which extends second tier loans to private finance companies for the
micro enterprise and agro sector, the Fondo de Desarrollo Industrial which has a similar funding
structure focused on small andmediumindustry, the Fondo deDesarrollo Campesinowhich focuses
on the farming sector, and the Banco Nacional de la Vivienda which provide housing finance.

68.   Unidad Te`cnicaEjecutora de Programas (UTEP): UTEP i s a special unit o fthe Banco Central
de Paraguay set to implement the IDB's Global Program to FinanceMicroenterprises inParaguay, The
unitwas set-up in 1994andits activities consist inrefinancingupto 90percent ofloans providedto
micro-entrepreneurs byparticipating financial institutions, which inturn receive training on best
practice methodologies for micro-enterprise finance, inparticular risk analysis o fprojects. The
participating intermediaries are selected according to a CAMEL type o f system and financial
information providedby the Superintendency o f Banks. Since UTEP i s fhded at "market rate" by the
IDB,loans from UTEP to the intermediaries as well as the loans to the microentreprises havebeto
granted on a for-profit basis.14 Inspite of UTEP's remarkableperformance, its income i s not sufficient
to cover losses from exchange rate fluctuations.

69.   Fondo deDesarrollo Industrial (FDI): FDIi s a second-tier lending fund housed within the
Paraguayan Ministry of Finance, which was established to channel intemational donor resources
towards the small and mediumindustryinParaguay. The fundwas created in 1993 with, among others,
resources provided by the World Bank. FDIhas a total staff o f 10including a director. Inits
operations, the FDIworks in a way similar to that o fUTEP, but (i) about half o f its loans, and
                                                                             grants
(ii) lessstringentselectioncriteriaforparticipatingfinancialintermediaries.Actually,UTEPused
    has
to be part o f FDIbefore it was decided to transfer it to the Central Bank. Still, a significant link
remainedbetweenthe two institutions, as illustrated by the fact that UTEP i s responsible for managing
FDI's accounts. UnlikeUTEP, the performance o fthe FDIhas so far beenvery disappointing. The
institution didnot manage to attract financially sound institutions such as foreign banks to participate
to the project. Dueto these factors, the volume o f FDI's loan portfolio has beenfalling since 1995 with
a drop o f more than 50 percent inthe last two years alone.

70.   The remaining second tier entities are the Fondo deDesarrollo Campesino (FDC)andthe Banco
Nacional de la Vivienda (BANAVI). The Fondo de Desarrollo Campesino does not take deposits from
the public, but relies mostly on funds providedbythe international donor community and channeled
through the Ministryo f Finance. Related to BANAVIi s the Consejo Nacional de la Vivienda
(CONAVI) which oversees BANAVIoperations. The Government expects to unwindand liquidate
these entities whose portfolios are effectively not performing and no new lending i s taking place.

C. The GovernmentReformAgenda for the BankingSystem

71,   The new Government team which took office inAugust o f 2003, appointed a Minister o fFinance
and a new Central Bank President botho fwhich have prioritized addressing the structural problems
and risks inthe financial system, particularly given Paraguay's recent history o f financial distress and
fiscal losses on an account of such events. To this end, the Central Bank, including the active
involvement o fthe BankingSuperintendency andwith the support o f the Ministry o f Finance, agreed
to undertake a substantial reform o fthe current banking legal framework inorder to strengthen
regulation, supervision, early corrective actionpowers, bank resolutionmechanisms and operation o f
the deposit insurance system. The requiredreforms involve substantial modifications to the banking
law (implementation o f a new Law for Bank Resolution and Deposit Insurance) as well as related
modifications to the overall masterbanking law (Law No. 861) in a number o f areas pertaining to
licensing, capital adequacy, portfolio management, relatedparties, and supervisory enforcement and
sanctioning.

The First Operation Under the Propram

72.    Under this first operation, the Government has put inplace the new framework governing the
regulation o fthe banking system and inparticular the new exit procedures for banks which are deemed
insolvent as well as a number o fprudential preventive actions and strengthenedsupervision efforts as
further described below. The loanis inthe amount o fUS$15 million and is presentedto the Board
based on all agreed prior policy actions havingnow been met.

TheDeposit Insurance System

73.    The Government's recent deposit guarantee systemgeneratedmoral hazardsince the banking
sector did not contribute to its funding via premiums and there was no loss sharing with depositors to
encourage monitoring. Under the reform program, the Government has set up a defined institutional
function and financial structure including the implementation o f regulations and operating procedures,
for a new insurance systemwhich will be support bank resolution and restructuring processes approved
under Law 2334/03. The new insurance fund will be managed by the Central Bank with input from
industryparticipants andhave its own statutory identityto insulate it from fiscal influences. Its charter
and operations which will definedby regulation under the reform program, will be under the oversight
of the Central Bank and the Superintendency.

74.    The new deposit insurance system i s fundedby premiums paid by the banking industry, so that a
target funding o f 10percent o f the financial system's depositary base i s reached. The insurance fund
will have a Government "reinsurance" feature for any losses which exceed the 10percent deposit base,
so that losses above that level would be automatically assumedby the Government under an `excess o f
loss' policy inits charter. Duringthe early years o fthe fund's accumulation o fresources, a co-
insurance feature would be ineffect whereby the Government will provide a funding contribution in
realizablebonds, iflosses below the 10percent level occur, before the fund has accrued sufficient
financial resources. Insuch an event, the co-insurance feature would finance any insured deposits not
covered by accumulated premiumspaid inby the private industry. The co-insurance feature would be
structured as a defined initial capital contribution with the possibility of the Government's treasury
issuingadditional bonds to finance the insurance fund for special casebank restructuring/resolution
operations.

75.   Under the reformof the deposit insurance system, the Governmentwill take all the necessary
precautions to ensure that the new systemwill be sustainable, particularly as it i s buildingup its finds
(which will be invested to obtain additional compounded retums). For this purpose, the potential
obligation limitso f the new systemwill be steadily phased inand supported by the State co-funded
amounts while the scheme becomes capitalized.

76.    The settingo fpremiums will inthe longer term, is expected to be based on the assessedrisk of
individual banks, including rating factors to incorporatebank management factors rather than solely
the mechanical application of financial ratios. However, to avoid inadvertent signaling via the
premiumlevel, the CentralBank is considering an initialflat premiumand a future riskbasedpremium
that would be charged at the start o f the year through bank clearing or deposit accounts heldat the
Central Bank, followed by potential rebates to banks at the end o fthe period, based on ex-post
maintenance o f a low risk financial condition. Currently, the system has started with a flat premium.

77.    The deposit insurance fund will also be intricately linkedto bank restructuring responsibilities
following their interventionby the SB, interms o f resolving banks through the sale o f their acceptable
assets with matching deposits and liablities, andusingthe deposit insurance funds to pay residual
insured deposits, so as to minimize use o f insurance or State funds. Residual non-performing assets
will betransferred for liquidation to specialized firms. These mechanisms are explained further below.

Bank Resolution Procedures

78.    One o fthe highlightsof the banking sector reform which the Government will undertake,
constitutes the modernization o fprocedures to remove weak banks from the system, usingmarket
mechanisms and risk sharing with the rest of the financial industry. This involves implementingunder
the new Bank ResolutionandDeposit Insurance Law androlling into the overall banking law, the use
o f `good bankhadbank' procedures to carve out viable assets from weak banks, and match them with
deposit liabilities, for transfedsale to other banks before considering payment to `uncovered
depositors'. These procedures have been approved under a recent Law (Ley 2334/03) developedwith
the assistance o fthe Bank and approved under the prior Economic Recovery Loan.


                                                      25

79.    However, implementation o f this law requires the design o fhighly detailed regulations which
will specify the operational procedures for implementing"bank resolution actions" including
methodologies for valuing matching liabilities and assets to segregateviable portions o fbalance sheets,
optimization and decision criteria to minimize the use o f deposit insurance resources for "gap filling",
methodologies for securitizing loan assets before they can be transferred as marketable bonds to other
banks, and specification o fthe various new institutional roles for operatingthe new deposit insurance
fund and its rules for engagement inresolutiontransactions. Inaddition to the bankingresolution
process, the Government reforms also include the institutionalizationo f early corrective actions as part
o f the supervisionprocess to permit ex ante preventive measures before banks become completely
insolvent.

80.    The main features inthe implementation o f the approved law goveming new procedures for
bankingresolution including specificationvia regulations o f the sequence o f actions required, involves
the following key steps and institutional responsibilities to be carried out by the SB:

       a.    The prioritization and specificity inthe use o f "good bank" asset carve-outs and
       restructurings to transfer viable loans and other assets with matching deposits and other liabilities
       to market buyers, while maintaining intervenedbanks as `going concems'.

       b.    The utilization o fpre-specifiedbank restructuring contingency plans developed prior to
       official intervention, so as to minimize the time inwhich a bank remains closed prior to
       reopening under new ownership.

       c.    Followingthe preference inthe use o fthe "good bank"modality and definition o f
       qualifyingassets, the subsequent structuring o fthe residual "bad bank" assets for transfer to
       collection/liquidation agents. Underthe terms o f recovery o f such assets, these will include
       agreements for the sharing inlosses and gains among assuming agentshanks and the
       Government, when such lossedgains fall outside o fprojected ranges o f recoveries contractually
       agreed.

       d.    Underthe above modalities, the primary criteria inselecting from the available options
       (including the liquidation option) will be specified as the minimization inthe use of deposit
       insurance and fiscal resources to accomplish the restructuring, sale, or liquidation, inline with
       the "least cost" principle.

       e.    The provision o f legal options for setting up trust accounts andtrustees to administer
       "good bank" asset portfolios and securitize such portfolios through the collateralized issuance o f
       special purpose bonds backed by such assets. The asset backing (collateralization) o f such
       securitized bonds will be over-collateralizedvia underlyingloans by a multipleo fbond face
       value, according to the overall risk established for the subject portfolios, inorder to assure that
       the bonds minimize their default probabilities and thus are marketable.

       f.    Purchasing banks/institutions/investors o f the bonds listed above, while receivingtheir
       bond couponpayments from the trust, will simultaneously agree to take on the collection
       function for the underlyingloan portfolios. Collection fees for suchwork are to be pre-agreed,
       or altematively, they will be includedas part o f the spread inthe overall couponrate for the bond
       representingaparticular loan portfolio.



                                                   26

      g.     The trustee will act with the deposit insurance fund as the restructuring administrator and
     portfolio securitization agency, with the overall management o fthe process beingoperated and
      overseen by the BCP.

81. The implementation inthe new Bank Resolution and Deposit Insurance law contains changes
which impact the overall banking law interms o f incorporatingmodemized procedures for the
resolution, restructuring and exit o f insolvent banks from the financial system as summarized inthe
diagram below:

82.   Besides the needto specify detailed implementing regulations delineating the sequenced
functioning o f these new procedures andtheir operationalization(e.g. : usingjudicially supported trust
and securitizationmechanisms), the Central Bank has issueda regulation prohibitingbanks to


                                                     27

encumber assets (loan portfolios, securities, etc.) usingthese as collateral to guarantee deposits, as
occurred during a recent bank closure o f the Multibanco institution. The banking law didnot explicitly
prohibit such action and thus it created difficulties inthe final settlement and liquidation o f
Multibanco. However, since such a practice i s inconsistent with the principle o fhierarchies o f
creditor preferences both under standard bank restructurings as well as under the new Resolution
procedures, the Central Bank intendsto resolve this legal loophole by making explicit the prohibition
against encumberingbank assets for the benefito f specified depositors.

Banking Exposure to Government Debt

83.   While potentially it mighthave generated an adverse development for the balance sheet
soundness o fthe banking system, the Government engaged innegotiationsto reschedule overdue
treasury securities held as investments by the banking system, without unduly affecting bank solvency
or profitability. Because o f severe fiscal pressures during2003 and inability to meet all its fiscal
obligations, including the payment o fpublic sector wages, the Government suspended some its
principal and interest payments due on government securities leaving an overdue debt owed to the
bankingsystemo fUS$130million. As part o fits effort to increase financial transparency, promote
confidence ingovernment financial management, and lay the way for future financial sector reforms,
the Government and the banking sector (as well as construction contractors) agreed to reschedule
bonds which had become due as well as overdue accrued interest.

84.   The terms o fthe rescheduling are to extend final maturities o fthe bonds for an additional four
years duringwhich the interest rate on the bonds will be reduced after the first two years from the
current coupon level o f 9 percent to 7 percent. Since the banking system didnot have alternative
liquidinvestmentoptions, the reschedulingo fprincipal has little or no impact on their balance sheets.
The reduction inthe interest rate has a small but insignificant effect on bank net eamings.

85.   As part o fits reform effort, the Governmenthas successfully completed negotiationswith the
bankingsysteminorder to give itselfadditional fiscal space to meet other pendingfiscal obligations.
The debt restructuring agreement initiative was well receivedby the banking system giventhat it had
already accumulated unpaid overdue debts during2003 with the previous Government and without any
certainty on the prospects and terms o f eventual repayment.

Regulatory and Supervisory Framework

86.   Interms ofstrengthening thebanking sector's prudentialregulations to better assess solvency in
line with best practices, the Government's modifications to the banking laws and key regulations
governing credit risk management will address a number o fbank accounting and prudential practices
including legal requirementsfor classifying loan portfolios and ensuring adequate loss provisioning.

Coverage of Regulation 8 Reforms -Loan Loss Provisioning

87.   The reform o fthis keyregulation as approved and put into effect by the BCP, involves the
phasing ino f stricter requirements, with 100percent compliance o f the regulation's norms requiredby
the start o f 2007, including: (a) Reintroduction of interest reversal for loans innon accrual status; (b)
Precluding directly or indirectly new lendingto improve loan classification; (c) Minimizing recourse to
collateral as a substitute for loan provisioning; (d) Adopting strict rules for collateral appraisal; (e)
Increasingminimumprovisioning for category 2 loans from 1percent to between 5 and 10percent;
and (g) Establishinga generic provision (0.5 to 2 percent) for category 1loans.

                                                    28

88.    Inaddition, associated regulatory changes also reflectedinthis initiative and inthe new general
banking law, address the computation o friskweightedcapital to ensure that best practices inline with
international standards are utilized inthe determinationo fbank solvency. Such measures will include:
(a) Minimizing the use o f collateral to reduce risk weights and augment risk limits; (b) Requiring
capital adequacy not only on an individual institution, but also on a consolidated basis; (c) Excluding
from tier 2 capital, 50 percent o frevaluation reserves after validation; (d) Excluding from tier 2 capital,
50 percent o f current year profits before distribution; (e) For rating loan asset risks, permittinga 50
percent risk weighting only if assets are guaranteed by residential mortgages, but 100percent risk if
backed by commercial mortgage collateral; and (f) Adding market risks to the computation o f capital.

89.     Inthe area spanning market andportfolio risks there exists an overlapping issuepertainingto
foreign exchange risks on account of partial dollarization o fthe banking system. To mitigate the risks
from dollarization, of borrowers not being able to repay loans following currency devaluations, the
regulatory reform includes the development and implementation o f risk management guidelines
regardingthe provisioning for credit risks generated from open foreign exchange exposures o f
borrowers.

Reform of the General Banking Law

90.     The keypillar onwhich the Govemrnent's financial sector reform program is anchored is a
wholesale reform of the General BankingLaw (currently LeyNo. 861). Besides the incorporation as
part of this law, of the new bank resolution and deposit insurance system which was already approved
under a separate law (see section on BankResolutionProcedures above), the newproposedBanking
Law includes several major reforms which upgrade Paraguay's prudential regulatory framework and
modernize the supervisory approach. Among various other aspects, the new proposedGeneral
Banking Law includes the following policy reforms:

      a.      The new law defines categories o fparticular institutions subject to bank regulation, but
      also regulates any `financial intermediation' activity involvingdeposit-taking. The law also
      requires credit cooperative to follow prudential rules applicable to the banking sector.

      b.      Financial groups are identified as subject to licensing for banking activity, and linkedparty
      risks are identified as subject to exposure limits and capital requirements, including cross-
      ownership and concentration limits. Additional powers are given to the SB to conduct supervision
      o f consolidated financial groups. Bank credit exposure limits are specified for individual credit
      risks as well as group risks.

      c.      Governance norms are upgraded in line with internationalpractices. Bank mangers,
      directors, shareholders, auditors, attorneys and personnel are subject to accountability norms and
      application of sanctions for duties pertaining to ensuring prudent banking operations. Bank
      management are accountable not only to prudential financial performance but also for risk
      management policies and appropriate internal controls.

      d.      The minimumcapital requirements to operate banking businesses are increased
      substantially, more inline with international standards, and such requirements are subject to
      periodic revaluation linkedto an inflation index.15


 l5
  Credit cooperatives do not fall under the banking law. Separate regulations under development with WOCCU, require
their meetingphased-in solvency requirements andprudentialriskmanagement and credit classification standards,


                                                         29

     e.      Net income and/or dividends are prohibited from beingrecognized or distributeduntil
     eamings are received incash. A limit o f 50 percent i s also applied to the amount o f revaluation
     reserves which can be counted s capital.

     f.      The minimumsolvency ratio is specified at aminimumrequirementbut i s not capped at
     any upper limit, and the SB has discretion to increase it for any particular bank ifit i s deemed to
     be at risk andrequiring ahigher capital/solvency cushion.

     g.      The Law gives the SB autonomy inapplying sanctions for infractions committed, without
     need for prior authorization from BCP. Additional sanctions are added including penalties to
     banks for not ceasing and desistingor following directives issuedbythe SB previously, for
     imprudentlyputtingbank depositors at risk, and for not meetingimprovement targets under
     previously agreed `regularization' programs. Fines are increased inline with international
     standards and expressed as a percentage ofbank capital.

     h.      The mechanism of judicial liquidation i s incorporatedas a rule once the bank resolution
     process i s completed. This allows the SB to discontinue the management and oversight o f closed
     banks and allow their remaining assets to be liquidated as part o f formal bankruptcy proceedings.

Reform in Paraguay's Anti-Money Laundering Policies

91.    Paraguay has a number of initiatives which reflects its evolution inthe implementation o f an
anti-money laundering framework. This recently gained priority and increased importance following
the September 11,2001 terrorist attacks inthe U.S.and the discovery o f financing links inParaguay's
border towns. The following describes Paraguay's existing AML framework and legislative reforms
beingdeveloped inthe sector.

92.    The Central Bank serves on the Boards of national agencies set up to detect andprosecute money
laundering activities. These include the Secretariat for the Prevention o f Money Laundering and the
National Anti-Drug Secretariat. The framework Law No.1015/97 requires from financial institutions,
the identificationo fclients, the settingup of a monitoringregistry, andmaintenance o f such registries
for at least 5 years. The law was updated inmid 1997 to explicitly define as illegal, the use o f the
financial and payments systemfor transacting illicit activities. Liability was definedto equally include
the executors o f specified transactions as well as the "moral" authors or planners o f such. All financial
(bank andnonbank) institutions as well as funds andNGOs are included interms o freporting
requirements and monitoring responsibilities.

93.    The Superintendency's (SB's) Regulation 245 of 1997 establishes and defines the specific means
o f communication and reporting formats between financial institutions and the SB for operations above
US$lO,OOO. Regulation 455 o f 1999 reinforces this by requiringnew intemal control units to be set up
ineachinstitution, and specifies their responsibilities inpreventingmoney launderingas well as the
additional oversight functions of corporate audit committees. Regulation 536/97 elaborates on
external auditor requirements and responsibilities inthis area.

94.    A separate regulation No. 2 o f 1997 defines the scope o f institutions, financial activities,
operations, clients, and modes of registeringthese for reporting to the designated Government agencies
once suspicious activities havebeendetected. Protections are included with respect to lawsuits against
reporting banking officials no matter what the outcome o f investigations might be (Le., meaningfulor
not). Regulation 153 o f 1998 requires entities which transfer funds abroad to inform the SB and the
Department o f Economic Crimes o fthe Central Bank, while providing specific amounts, destinations

                                                   30

 and origins o f funds. Regulation224 o f 2000 provides additional guidelines andreporting
 requirements specifically tailored to exchange houses. A separateMERCOSUR agreement also exists
 to define guidelines for suppressing money launderinginthe MERCOSUR countries and formalizing
 cooperation among those Central Banks.

 95.     Act 105 and Regulation 9 o f October 2001 has set up within the BCP, a special purpose Unit for
 financial analysis on money and asset laundering. This Unit coordinates activities and information
 with the BCP's Department of Economic Crimes. Most recently, Act 123 and Regulation 1o f
 November 2001, implementeda "manual of conduct" requirementfor banks to delineate the steps
 necessary for the identification and preventiono f asset laundering, as related to Base1Core Principle
 15 and codes o f ethics. This regulation applies to all entities supervised by the SB. Essentially it
 emphasizes "know thy client" guidelines and requests reporting on connected businesses. Suspicious
 operations are reportedto the National Secretariat for Prevention o fMoney Laundering.

 Reform of the AML Framework

 96.     The Government with assistance o f the U.S.Treasury, has developed a new draft AML
 legislation expected to be approved in2005. This would reform the AML framework law No. 1015,
 and replace it with a modemized AML approach.

.97.     The new law, already presented to the Congress contains provisions for defining the AMWCTF
 as specific crimes. Better coordination arrangements inline with best practices worldwide, are set up
 inorder to centralize the oversight ofAML/CTF activities withinthe Government to avoiddispersed
 accountabilities, and to operate the relevant Unitunder the President's Secretariat.

 98.     The law also addresses information technology issues andthe ability for law enforcement to have
 legal tools to follow up on `high tech' criminal activity. With regard to asset seizures under AML/CTF
 activity, the new framework i s also specific with respect to procedures to be followed.

 99.     Financial institutions and other entities under the new framework, will also have reporting
 obligations with regardto suspicious transactions under standardized formats allowing quick analysis
 bythe financial authorities.

 Strategic Plan of the Banking Superintendency

  100. As part o fthe reform effort and as part of the process delineated above, the Government
 considers it essential within the proposed framework and prior to its implementation, to have inplace a
 strategic planwhereby a more risk management approach to bank supervision would be conducted and
 a sequenced, and a structured set o f actions would take place before any event o f bank failures
 occurred which mightprovoke systemic contagion. For this purpose, the following pro-active
 measures have been identified as part o f the Central Bank's supervisory strategy and a contingency
 planwhich wouldbeimplementedearly on inthe reform effort, andmaintained as akeytool for
  effectively leveragingthe new resolution mechanisms.

  101. Risk Ratings of Banks: As part o f a pro-active riskbased focus o f a new supervisory strategy,
 the SB will beginimplementing an intemal rating method usingboth quantitative (e.g., CAMEL
  criteria) and qualitative assessments o f the soundness o fbanks and their associated management and
 riskmitigation functions. The riskrating approach will count on advanced financial, economic and
 balance sheet simulation tools to evaluate varying risk scenarios and capital adequacy for subject

                                                     31

banks. This will move beyondthe mechanical application o f financial ratios andprovide ratings based
on the intemal risk management practices andcontrols o fbanksbeing supervised.

102. Adaptation Planfor New Norms: With the implementation o f the reformedbanking laws and
regulation #8 which requires a phase ino f increased loan loss provisions (and lower dependence on
collateral as reserves), the SB will assess the adequacy o fbanks' businessprospects, cash flows and
financial cushions, to allow them to successfully transition into a stricter regulatory regime required
under the new framework. This will involve continuous oversight and guidance by the SB to the
financial sector, to engender corrective actions ifbanks are not taking adequatemeasures to reach their
target levels o f reserves under the new norms. While this exercise i s initselfgeared towards
establishing regulatory compliance, it will also serve to identifylatent weaknesses ininstitutions and
determine their viability for survival inthe longrun.

103. Solvency vs. Liquidity Issues: Once weak banks are identified, and following the application o f
prompt corrective actions mandatedby the SB to stop further deterioration, an immediate diagnosis
would be made as to whether their problems constitute liquidity or solvency constraints. For those
banks that appear solvent, liquidity assistance would be considered by the BCP. For those banks
diagnosed as insolvent, a bank resolution strategy would be mapped out a priori.

104. Consolidation Strategy and Resolution Plan: The SB will give highpriority under its strategic
planto fully develop and implementregulations to operationalize the procedures for conducting bank
resolution and the institutionalization o f the new deposit insurance fund. The BCP and SB would a
priori approve a banking consolidation strategy and develop alternatives for promoting the merger o f
weak banks (or selected assets therefrom) with other banks inthe market. A set o f models estimating
the good bank portions o fthe insolvent banks, would be drawn up, inorder to determine the level o f
deposits that can be matched against viable assets before invoking any deposit guarantee funds. Any
fbnding gaps would consider resources or securities from the deposit insurance fundprovided they met
the `least cost criteria'.

105. Industvy Consultation Process: The above exercises will require ongoing consultation with the
banking industryto: (i)   determine potentialbuyers o f the remainingviable portfolio assets from the
weak banks, (ii)   consider alternative market based arrangements for handlingthe weak banks, and (iii)
execute these processes ina matter o f days to avoid disruption o f the financial system.


TheSecond Operation Under the Program

 106. The second operation supported by a loan o f US$15 million, will focus on the implementation o f
the reforms andlegal framework set out inthe first phase through, inter alia, the measurement o f
improvement inthe banking sector's financial condition.

 107. Under this second operation as defined here, the reforms inthe new Banking Resolution and
Deposit Insurance framework would be implemented with applicable provisions enforced. Besides the
application o f that law (No. 2334/03), this will include the issuance o fkey regulations goveming
procedures to minimize the use o f deposit insurance resources (`least cost criteria' rule) inthe pay-out
of depositors duringbanking resolution activities. Relatedto this will be the directive to prioritize the
mechanism o f transfers o f assets and liabilities to sound banks (versus the outright liquidation process)
inorder to minimize State outlays.


                                                    32

108. As part o f the above framework, the second operation will have fully developedand applied the
legal, regulatory and market mechanisms to allow the securitization o f asset portfolios through the
legal establishment o f special purpose trusts which would holdloanportfolios as collateral for
securities issued by such trusts to interested banks and investors, as a means o f selling such assets
while providing sufficient assurances o f the credit quality o f the security.

109. Inaddition, regulations andpractices governing the operation ofthe new deposit insurancefund
will be inplace including the budgetary and institutional set up as well as the fund's accounting and
investment regime for premiums collected from the banking system, and the formalization o f the
Finance Ministry's capitalization contribution to the insurance fund via special bondissuances. As
well, coupledwith the bank resolutionprocedures, the deposit insurance fund will have inplace
policies defining its criteria for covering any asset/liability gaps o f failed institutions inline with
minimizing costs o f such procedures while compensating all insureddepositors.

110. Underthe second operation, the contingency plans o fbanks and financial institutionswill be
presented to provide assurances that they are able to adapt their balance sheets to the more stringent
capital and loss reserving requirements. This will ensure compliance with the new capital and
provisioning norms meant to strengthenthe financial condition o f the system and be able to withstand
future credit portfolio or market risks.

111. The new proposed general banking law that uponits entry into effect will replace Law No. 861,
will include application of its norms including those mentionedinthe preceding paragraph, and others
such as the application o f new sanctions for breach o fnorms, enforcement o f exposure limits to related
borrowers, implementation o frisk management standards as part o fbanks' corporate governance, and
new minimumbank licensingrequirementsincluding fit-and-proper criteria for new owners,
shareholders and managers.

112, The second operationis also expected to fully bringinto effect the new anti-money laundering
law which i s to have beenapprovedby the Congress. The law will correct and improve on the
following issues:

  (a) Under the existing framework, judicial action against AML activity can only be applied once the
  underlyingcrime involved (e.g.: goods trafficking) is first ruled on. This createsjudicial delays and
  duplication o f costs acrossjurisdictions. Under the new law, AML activity inits own right will be
  grounds for immediatejudicial/penal action, independent o f underlying criminal activity;

  (b) The institutional framework under the existinglaw essentially includes two financial intelligence
  units, Le., the National Secretariat for AMLprevention andthe Central Bank intelligenceunit. As
  per best practice and to ensure highest confidentiality and centralization o f information while
  avoiding problems ininformation sharing, the new law would create only one unique intelligence unit
  incharge ofoverseeing all AML activity andreportingto thejudiciary, a change which wouldhelpto
  modify Paraguay's status as seenby the Egmont Group;

  (c) Under the existing law, the National Secretariat for AML i s managed by a council constituted o f
  highrankingofficials inthe Executivebranch, whichmakes management ofthe Unitslow and
  inoperative. Under the reformed law, the Unitwill dependdirectly on the President allowing
  expedited decisionmakingand related actions.



                                                   33

 (d) Under the current law, drug trafficking and other `traditional' activities are recognizedas being
 subject to AML legislation. However, giventhe evolution o ftechniques usedby launderers, and
 other practices including the use o ftechnology, which have advanced the sophistication o f laundering
 processes, the current law as well as investigatory methods have become outdated. Under the new
 legislation, new and unusual types and sources o f money laundering activity will be recognizedin
 terms o f their expanded scope, allowing for morejudicial and penal follow up without being
 restrictedto traditional types o f illicit activities. The new law will also provide more flexibility in
 investigatory techniques subject to judicial control, but more intune with the sophistication o f the
 crime.

 (e) The new law will also regulate the reporting requirementsby subject entities to report suspicious
 cash or financial transactions. This will standardize such reports according to international standards,
 allowing quicker verification o f information and expeditedfollow up action.

 (f) The current framework i s not specific on the decommissioning o f assets or funds seized from
 illicit activities or establishments. Under the new reform, procedures for seizure and
 decommissioning o f assets as well as their safeguarding, will be specified, inorder to ensure more
 efficient and transparent processes while protecting individuals and supporting institutions that assist
 inAML efforts.

113, Underthe second operation, inaddition, the key actions definedunder the SB's StrategicPlan
will havebeen executed. These cover the supervision strengthening activities such as the completion
of the evaluation o f risks inherent inbanking institutions including focused intensive inspections o f 20
percent o fbanks inthe system deemed more risky, and the undertaking o f corrective actions
demonstrating the application o f the new bank resolution framework as well as the provisions inthe
new general banking law and implementation o fregulation 8 for loan loss provisioning.

114. As part o f the reform o fthe law governing the Central Bank Charter, the second operationwill
supportthe adoption o f additional institutional reforms complementary to the general bankinglaw but
developed under as part o f the plannedchanges inthe BCP Charter (Law No. 489) -- these changes
will ensure more autonomy and independence o fboththe BCP andthe SB. The BCP's Board o f
Directors are currently appointedinstaggeredterms so as to span across more than one electoral cycle
andprevent a single Administration from appointing all Board memberswithin one electoral term.
Currently, however, ifa Boardmember departs, resigns or is dismissedprematurely, the next appointee
begins hidher term and follows through for the full term o f five years. This effectively breaks the
"staggering" rule. A reform o f the BCP Charter will require that ifnew appointments occur inthe
middleo fthe term of a recent Boardmember, then the new appointment should first runthe remaining
course o fthe prior member's term, and then expire before consideration for a new five year term. This
would preventthe staggering rule from beingbroken and would maintain appointment periods crossing
electoral cycles. Another reform plannedunder the BCP Charter, i s granting the Superintendent more
o f a voice on the BCP Board's decisions inmatters pertaining to banking supervision, and granting the
SB more autonomy inapplying sanctions based onits owntechnicaljudgment, something already
incorporatedinthe reform of the General Banking Law. Inaddition, the BCP Charter which currently
includes the schedule o f sanctions, will require a technical modification so that this schedule i s referred
to more appropriately under the General Banking Law.

115. Finally, under parallel reforms complementingthe government's program and following
consultations among INCOOP the Credit Cooperatives Supervisory Agency, the Banking


                                                       34

Superintendency, the World Council o f Credit Unions and the Bank, a new regulatory and supervisory
framework will be put inplace covering adequate solvency norms, asset risk weighting, loss
provisioning and accounting for capital for the credit cooperatives sector.


The Third Operation Under the Propram

116. The priorpolicy actions for the third operationwill constitute reforms pertainingto the
restructuring o f the state ownedbanking sector andprogress made under the overall program. This
phase o f reforms follows from the prior stages given that the establishment o fthe new State banks
requires a baseline regulatory framework from which the design and a sustainable structure for this
sub-sector can be established and monitored against future performance. A loan o fUS$30 million
would support this operation and its extensive reforms envisioned as described below.

117. As definedcurrently, this third operation will focus on the reform o f the State owned financial
institutions. Inorder to address the pressingissues regardingthe financial health o f the state owned
financial institutions, andto resolve the deteriorating condition o f BNF,the Government will
undertake a reform program through the implementation o f a new legislative framework to rationalize
the state owned bankingsector. Through mergers and liquidations, it i s plannedto reshuffle the
current institutional landscape and reduce the number o f state-owned financial intermediaries to two
consisting o f a first-tier rural agricultural bank, and a second tier institution structured as a fund to
channel bilateral and multilateralresources. The reform will be initiatedwith a public information
campaign organizedby the Ministryo f Finance to assure all stakeholders o f the benefits o f
restructuring loss making state institutions and focusing credit to the sectorswith the highest needs.

118. As first steps inthe reform program, the Government will take measures to prevent any further
financial deterioration inBNF. This includes the (a) appointment o f well experienced professional and
politically independent bankers to the Management andBoard o fDirectors and revisions o f corporate
governance policies, (b) provisioning fully all the non-performing loan assets and closure o f
unprofitable branches, (c) elimination o f lendingrate subsidies which did not generate cost recovery
and the setting o f rates to hlly cover all administrative and financial costs, (d) halting all new lending
to the commercial and development sectors as well as to individual borrowers with over US$15,000
equivalent inoutstanding short term debt to the bank, (e) sharp reductions in administrative and
advisory staff and an increase instaff assigned to loadcredit review and collections, (0reorganizing
the bank to drastically reduce the number o f departments and linemanagers, and (g) updating the
registry o f loan collateral and determination o fthe liquidation value o f such.

119. Underthe first major component o fthis reform, a 2ndtier development finance hndwill be
created primarily out the merger o f the existing second-tier institutions, UTEP FDI, FDC, and
CONAVI/BANAVI. Whereas the first tier bank will be created with an option as a futurejoint-stock
company, the status ofthe 2ndtier fundwould be that o f an autonomous public entity with independent
legal status. The 2ndtier fundwill have the mandate to rediscount mediumand longterm investment
loans to banks and finance companies selected competitively. Lending would be deemed to promote
the development o f various areas o fthe Paraguayan economy by providing loan funds to financial
institutions willing to lenddirectly to targeted areas and sectors, for the promotion o f financing o f
investmentand development projects by domestic enterprises, housing investment programs,
agricultural investments, export-related activities or any other activities deemed fit to its institutional
objectives, The institution will not collect any deposits from the public andwould be funded from


                                                      35

multilateral, bilateral and government credit lines. The minimumterm o f its loans would be two years.
Accordingly, the institution would not be authorized to accept any liabilities with a maturity o f less
than 1year. For bothinstitutions (lst tier), the interest rates on loans mustbeequal to the
                                        and 2nd
administrative costs plus the costs of deposit-taking(inthe case o f lStcost o fborrowed funds, and
                                                                          tier),
provision for exchange risks.

120. Underthe second main component of this reform, the first tier bank will be formed primarily
from the merger o f the sound portions the existing first tier institutions (BNF, CAH, FG), which will
be extracted accordingto a "good bank/ badbank" liquidationprocedure andwith the intento f
limitingthe target clientele andportfolio character to smallrural and small enterpriseborrowers, many
o fwhich are current BNF and CAH clients. The 1" tier bankwill be limited inits borrowing from the
2ndtier fund, in an amount not to exceed 25 percent o f its liabilities. The portions o f assets which
include all non-performing loans, will be aggregated into a bad asset residual fund whose liquidation
will bemanaged byprivate contractors underthe oversight o fthe MinistryofFinance. Any well
performing assets not included inthe new bank will also be placed inthe residual fund to be wound
down, sold to the private sector either as select assets or a going business concern, or securitized if
feasible. A temporary Government restructuring commission will be created to consolidate the
management and downsizing o f the institutions duringthis restructuring process as well as to re-
negotiate or wind down bilateral or multilateral donor financedprojects which do not fit into the
framework o f the new 2ndtier institution.

121. The new lStbank will operate as a credit andpayments institution dedicated to the broad-
                    tier
based development o f the Paraguayan economy through the provision o f financial services to
creditworthy small andmediumenterprises primarily inthe agricultural sector, andwhich lack access
to private financial institutions. All loans outstanding providedby the institution will be subject to a
credit maximum for individual credit risks, and another for investment loans o f four or more years
allowed to be fundedthrough the second tier institution. Public sector entities will be excludedas
recipients o f services. For both institutions, the interest rates on loans must be able to cover the
administrative costs plus the costs o f funding and any market and exchange risks. To avoid the risk o f
over dependence on public sector deposits and/or of relying on social security deposits for funding, the
lSt willbeabletotakedepositsfromthepublicsectorlimitedto12.5percentofitstotal
   tier bank
deposits for any single institution (e.g., social security), and to 25 percent for all public sector
institutions combined.

122. The lSt   tier bank and the 2ndtier fundwill be subject to a more stringent corporate governance
than the public financial institutions operatingtoday. Directors at both institutions would be required
to have extensive previous business experience inbanking and finance. Boththe new lSt tier     and 2nd
institutions will operate under the umbrella o f the existing financial sector/banking legislation; and
they will have no State guarantees or favorable tax treatment.

123. The special restructuringcommission that will be established to coordinate the process o f the
creation o f the new state banks, will also oversee the consolidation o f operations, policy and
accounting, andthe contracting o f private specialists to undertake the carving out o f assets and
liabilities which will be transferred to the new institutions, and the liquidation ofresidual assets which
will be wound down or sold.

124. The reform of the State owned financial institutions will require substantial fiscal injectionsto
wind down current unprofitable operations andmatch assetswith existing liabilities duringthe


                                                     36

consolidation process into the two new remaining institutions. The main cost will be the reduction and
wind down o fBNF andits consolidation at a smaller scale into the new first tier rural and small
enterprise bank. Ifa full liquidation procedure was used, the cost to the State would be approximately
$74 million to pay for all outstanding liabilities and deposits, net o f asset recoveries. However, the
anticipated scenario under the proposed operation, would entail conducting an asset/liability matching
and transfer exercise so that all outstanding liabilities neednot be liquidated outright, butrather
transferred to the new bank with matching loans incurrently performing status. Good loans which do
not qualify under the guidelines under the new first tier bank structure would be sold along with
matching deposits to the private banking sector.

125. Underthese reforms scenario, the anticipated cost o f the State to fundthe asset/liability gap,
would be US$47 million. Severance payments to reduce the State banking workforce to half o f the
current level, would amount to approximately US$7 million. The contracting o f expert bank
restructuring consultants and liquidators to carry out the process o f asset disposition and continue
management o f institutions untilthe reform i s fully implementedi s estimated at US$1millionI6. In
addition, some contingency funds may be needed to make deposit insurance payments and assist in
bank mergers iffragile banks inthe systemare forced to close, as well as to pay off depositors from
BNFiftheir deposits cannot be transferred to other institutions. Insuch an event, the Governmentmay
need to capitalize any initial obligations underthe new deposit insurance fund which requires an initial
capital through government bond issuance. Thus, the total "all-in'' cost o fthe reform would amount to
about US$55 million excluding any contingencies to pay out funds for deposit insurance. The Bank
will work with the Government on the timingo fthe requisite financial support inrelation to any debt
service incurred on bonds issuedto capitalize the restructuredbanks and finance the deposit insurance
fund.




  These funds are separate and not included inthe financing provided under the accompanying Technical Assistance
project.

                                    PART 111. THE PROPOSEDLOAN



A.    Loan Description: Objective and Rationale for Bank Involvement

126. Loan Objective. The objective o fthe loan i s to strengthenthe Government's capacity to manage
weaknesses and stresses inthe financial system and to prevent crisis contagion effects, by utilizing
early corrective actions and market risk-sharing mechanisms to transfer and sell good loan assets o f
failed institutions, while reducing losses to the State. This objective, by promoting increased financial
health, aims to avoid the recurrence o fprolonged bankingcrises, and augment Paraguay's growth
prospects by maintaining a banking sector with sufficient underlying capital and improved allocation
o f savings to expand the provision o f credit inthe economy. At an institutional level, the objective will
be to strengthen the capabilities and financial/supervisory technology usedby the Central Bank and the
superintendency o f banks to maintain the health of the financial system. This would be accomplished
through invoking stronger capital adequacy rules combined with restructured asset/liability sales, and
supported with deposit insurance funding, inorder to resolve insolvencies at the lowest cost.

127. A key aspect o f the proposed program i s the design o f an effective financial safety net feature in
Paraguay's financial system, to preventrepetitions o fpast experiences and languishingbanking crises
brought on by inadequate regulations. These cost the state enormous resources that might havebeen
contained with more effective modernized bank resolution instruments. The weak economic
environment inParaguay and inthe region as a whole, pose significant vulnerabilities to financial
institutions. The loan's design i s meant to support prompt legal reforms to permit the State to pre-
arrange and deploy problem resolution tools inthe event o fnew bank insolvencies. This PFSAL loan
program will be accompanied by a small 4-5 year Technical Assistance project which will provide
technical support to the bankingsuperintendency for the longer term institutional implementation o f
the reform program, including the areas o fregulation, supervision, bank resolution, anti money
laundering and others.

128. Loan Amount and Sequencing. The first PFSAL loan will be inthe amount o f US$15 million
under a programmatic operation that will consist o f three loans amounting to US$60 million inthe
aggregate. Compliance with the first loan's prior policy actions i s requiredprior to submittingthe
operation to the Bank's Board for approval. Disbursement will take place immediately following
approval and compliance with standard effectiveness conditions o f the Bank. Presentation of the
second PFSAL to the Boardwill take place following completion o ftangible implementation
indicators and compliance with the policy actions aimed to enforce the application o f the new
legislative framework approved under the first loan. Presentation o fthe third PFSAL loan will take
place following the approval o f a legislative package and implementation o f actions for the reform and
restructuring o fthe State owned financial institutions, and overall progress under the program. Given
that the original concept paper for this program was preparedprior to September 2004, this document
remains under the guidelines o f the earlier Operational Directive 8.60 rather than under the new
Development Policy Lendingframework. However, the subsequent loans under this program will be
prepared accordingto Development Policy Lending guidelines under the new Operational Policy 8.60.

Rationale for Bank Involvement and Strategy

129. Relation to Country Assistance Strategy. The loan constitutes a mainpillar inthe Bank's
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) as delineated inthe CAS document discussed and approvedby the


                                                   38

Board on December 16,2003 (Report No. 27341-PA dated November 26,2003) reflecting the current
program. The assistance strategy which relies on the Government completing a number o f structural
changes supporting its own economic management strategy, includes strengthening o f the State's
policy apparatus to promote fiscal discipline and increased revenue inflows, fortifying the banking
systemas amaininstrument for engendering investmentanddevelopment, andreducingpublic
pension liabilities. Giventhe Bank's extensive involvement inthis sector and its policy dialogue with
the Government through an earlier conducted Financial Sector ESW exercise to examine banking
systemvulnerabilities (as specifiedunderPart 11, A, pg. 11o fthis report), the Bank has a comparative
advantage inproviding informed policy support for this type o f operation.

130. While current economic andpolicy conditions preclude strong incentives for private bank
lending, andthus financial access i s very restricted, the banking systemrequires substantial
strengtheningto ensure that once economic activity picks up, financial institutionshave sufficient
capital to extend credit to support growth. Inthe current environment, the authorities are not able to
deal efficiently with fragile financial institutions, therefore the banking systembecomes encumbered
with weak balance sheets, and without consolidation, is not able to reach more optimal levels of
financial capacity. Recent growth prospects have improved, however, and the private foreign
investmentenvironment is becoming more favorable. Since one o fthe mainpillars o fthe CAS is to
increase the role o f the private sector inpromoting growth, an assurance o f strongbalance sheets inthe
bankingsystem(via the applicationo frigorousprudentialnorms, prompt and strong corrective actions,
and quick resolution and exit o f weak banks) will substantially leverage the Government's
macroeconomic tool kit to achieve its stated goals, which would merit Bank support.

131. Timing and Level of Financial Support. The program financing i sjustified on two grounds: (a)
a balance o fpaymentsneed, and (b) the overall budgetary cost o fthe reform. At thisjuncture,
Paraguay has little ifno access to financing from the international private capital markets, and due to
the fiscal situation, there are no reassignable funds. From a balance o fpayments and budgetary
perspective, the country's external financing requirement from multilateral, official and other sources,
so as to assure a sound level o f international reserves and a sustainable capacity to repay future debt
obligations taking into account ongoing capital outflows and elimination o f arrears on external debt
service, amounts to an average o f about US$200 million annually through 2006. While commercial
banking flows decreased inthe aftermath o f recent period of banking instability through 2003 these
were offset by foreign exchange inflows, with additional commercial and net private inflows observed
in2004. Commercial andinvestment flows are expectedto riseduringthe periodofthereform
program, Therefore, including newprojected capital inflows and net foreign currency deposits, private
capital flows are projected to bepositive under a more stable macroeconomic and financial
environment. International reserves are expected to modestly rise inorder to maintain a steady
coverage o f 41/2months worth o f imports as well as to bolster confidence by assuring an appropriate
level o f foreign exchange reserves with respect to Paraguay's partially dollarized banking system.

 132. For the subsequent operations under the program, the restructuring o f the State banking sector
may require up to US$55 million indirect or indirect capital support to close downand liquidate
institutions (assuming modest recoveries inbad loan portfolios, severance payments and the price o f
asset disposition contractors) and to create the remainingtwo new State institutions while assuring they
are fully solvent. Also, contingent needs exist to pre-fund the new deposit insurance scheme which by
law requires that the Treasury provide support with an initial bond infusion to capitalize the fundwhile
it builds up premiumbased reserves. The Bank's support o fUS$60 million for this multi-year
program will be complemented by IDB support through a financial intermediation loan to launchthe


                                                     39

public second tier bank and the possibility o f a later adjustment program. Both institutions will work
with the Government on the phasingissues with respect to evolving financing needs. The overall
program i s beingimplementedwith a precautionary Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF. The
proposedloan would, through the more efficient mechanisms for bank failure resolution and the
halting o f losses o f banks, aim to sharply reduce future fiscal outlays and engender solid financial
institutions, thus eventually attracting additional external and internal financing and investment.

133. Medium Term Objectivesand Outcomes. The Government's mediumterm goals for the
bankingsystemare to ensure the stability and strength o fthe systemso that it may returnto aposition
where the provision of credit can be increased to support the reactivationo fthe economy, a key
requirement inthe success o f the government's economic program. Within this process, the
government intends to reduce its fiscal obligations and contingent liabilities. The reduction o f these
obligations would not only provide the government with additional "fiscal space" but also encourage a
new policy framework inwhich the private sector might share the risks inherent inthe financial system
with the support o f a modernized bank resolution process and deposit insurance system. Outcomes
sought include a well capitalized, regulated, supervised, stable and efficient consolidated financial
systemthat can effectively intermediate savings andprovide broader credit, capital, and other financial
services andproducts for Paraguayan consumers, investors and underserved enterprises while also
attracting foreign direct investment into the financial industry.

 134. Bank Role in the Medium Term Program. The Bank expects a continued visible presence in
the financial sector dialogue with Paraguay inthe mediumterm. Giventhe Bank's regional leadership
inthe areao fmodemized `asset carve-out' style bank resolutionprocedures andtransfers o fpartial
balance sheets, the Bank has a reputational interest incontinuing to assist the Government inthe
implementationo fthe new legal framework and associated financial mechanisms required. In
addition, the Bank will be simultaneously implementinga Technical Assistance project to support the
institutions incharge of implementingthe new banking regulatory framework, and this project will
serve as an instrument to continue the Bank's engagement and assist inimplementation. The Bank
will also becommencing inlate FY05, a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) inParaguay

                                                          40

which will helpto deepen the diagnostics and continue the policy dialogue to strengthen ongoing and
futurereformefforts. The Bank will also beinvolved intheongoingpreparationofprograms related
to both private sector development and pensionreformwhich will have direct links to the financial
sector issues addressed under this loan.

                                                   41

      and definition of recognition of loan loss reserves, accrued interest payments, and refinancings,
      resultingfrom financial institutions' loans to individuals and/or legal entities.

      The Government's executive branch haspresented to the Congressfor approval, the Banking

136. Implementation Benchmarks and Results Monitoring. All agreed prior actions have beenmet
for this first loan covering reform o fthe legal, regulatory and supervisory framework o f the banking
system. Monitorable benchmarks will include the passage o fkey legislation such as the reformed
General Banking Law and the enforcement o fnew resolutionprocedures for dealing with troubled
banks through the application o f the pertinent asset and liabilitycarve out mechanisms usedfor such
procedures. Inaddition, the levels and quality o fbank capital inthe systemwill be carefully
monitoredto ensure that the solvency o f the banking system i s improving and strengthening given
stricter requirements. The execution o f resolution actions to disband and carve out assets and liabilities
o fweak or failed bankswill constitute key evidence (where situations warrant) o f applying the new
procedures while minimizing State or Deposit Insurance cash outlays. Other indicators such as
evidence o fbank mergers or closures as well as corrective actions directives issuedby the SB an
adhered to by non-compliant financial institutions, will also be monitored as key implementation
benchmarks. Duringthe final stages o f the program, the mainbenchmarks will include the actual
creation o f the new State banks and winding down o fresidual operations, and the ensuing provision o f
credit to the small borrower population o f entrepreneurs and rural enterprises. Giventhe three stage
programmatic approach, subsequent approval o f future operations will also provide key opportunities
to verify the implementation o fprior agreed reforms before proceeding to the next loan(s).

verifiable implementation progress under the earlier phases o f the program, and (iii)        approved,
promulgated a legislative package that has implementedthe restructuring o f the State owned banking
sector including the resulting formation o f single first tier public bank and a single second tier
development fund. The third PFSALloan o fUS$30 million would be prepared and presentedonce
evidence was receivedthat all triggers havebeenmet. The details o f these are listedbelow:

Macroeconomic Framework

      Maintenance of an adequate macroeconomic policyframework agreed with the Bank, coveringfiscal,
      monetary, exchange, external, andfinancial policies.

Restructuring and Consolidation of the State Owned Banks

      A management and institutional reform for the National Development Bank (BNF) has been undertaken,
      the bank is reorganized and streamlined, new regulations are approved specifiing credit limits placed on
      new lending, a staff downsizing program is implemented including a sharp reduction in departments and
      managementposts, branches are rationalized according to cost recovery criteria.

      TheLegislative Packagefor the Restructuring and Consolidationof the StateFinancial Institutions and
      its implementing regulation is in effect, including the establishment of

      (A) A singlepublicfirst tier bank created via the merger and downsizing of the State's lsttier institutions,
      with thefollowing features: (i) statutory lending limits per borrower establishedfor both short term and
      investment loans; (ii) limits on holding ofpublic sector deposits; and (iii) limits on borrowingfrom the
      public second tier bank; and

      (B) A singlepublic second tierfund created by merging and/or extinguishing thefive existing second tier
      financial institutions with the minimumfollowing features: (i) establishment of a reservefund to cover
      foreign exchange exposure and/or other hedging instruments; (ii) interest rate setting on loans to cover
      allJinancia1 and operating costs; and (iii) no authority to channelfunds to individual persons or entities
      that do not constitute banks,finance companies, savings and loans associations or cooperatives, subject
      toprudentialfinancial regulations.

      New prudential rules and operational directivesfor setting interest rates on loans, lending limits and risk
      exposures applicable to all assets of the State banking sector, are in effect and loss resewing standards
      are being enforced.

       The reform is underway and in operation and under its legal mandate, contracted specialists are
      managing, valuing and transferring assets and liabilitiesfrom thepool of State Financial Institutions'
      assets, toform the new balance sheets of the newfirst and second tier banks.

139. Expected Outcomes,Benchmarks and Follow Up. Followingthe endo f the program, the
targeted outcomes inthe banking sector will include a measurable reduction infiscal liabilities and
contingent obligations from the resolution o f insolvent institutions. A quantifiable improvement inthe
financial health of the sector under the assumption o f moderate economic growth should be observed,
as well as a verifiable record o f corrective actions achieved through the financial authorities' improved
supervision andprudent application o f sanctions andpenalties to reverse deficient risk management
practices. Under the State banking sector, the restriction o f imprudentcredit policies and the
consolidation o f the sector into special purpose entities with specified corporate governance mandates
and that demonstrate the ability to evaluate andprovide lendingto underservedbut productive sectors,
will constitute key outcomes to measure the success o fthe last phase o fthe reform. The programmatic

                                                      44

designas well as the FSAP exercise and its recommendations, coupledwith the implementation
dialogue that will take place under the Financial Sector Technical Assistance project will allow
continuation o f the policy dialogue with the Government to follow up on progress made. As well, the
to-date collaborative joint efforts with parallel teams from the IDB and the IMFwill ensure a
continuous follow up on financial sector reforms by the three multilateral institutions.

C.     DisbursementandAuditing

140. Disbursement arrangements will follow the simplified procedures for SALs/SECALs approved
bythe Board since 1996 and ineffect presently. Basedon a CFAA prepared bythe Bank withthe IDB
during2003, financial management systemcontrols were assessedas weak and inneedof
improvement, despite the existence o f a computerized public financial management system platform.
For the purpose o f this PFSAL loan, the Government will open an account inthe Central Bank o f
Paraguay. Once the Bank formally notifies the borrower that a tranche i s available for withdrawal, the
borrower may submit a withdrawal application so that the proceeds o f the tranche are deposited by the
Bank inthis account to be usedin accordance with the Loan Agreement. An audit o f the deposit
account, as part o f the Central Bank's newly implemented external audit oversight, would be
conducted for the project only upon the Bank's request, to assure that proceeds are transferred
according to acceptable budgetary procedures and standards, and that sufficient controls exist under the
Treasury accounts linkedto the Deposit Account to ensure adequate monitoring and financial reporting
o f Government budgetbalances.

141, As part o f the CFAA and a prior risk assessment o f financial management processes, Regional
financial management staff o fthe Bank conducted a summary diagnostic analysis and set forth
recommendations for improvement in financial controls o f the Government's Treasury, particularly as
they relate to fiduciary issues inthe management o f loan funds and adequacy o f Government financial
statements. Besides the internal control weaknesses mentioned, the diagnosis also identifiedthe need
for Government systems to recordbudget commitments and accruals properly and completely for all
public entities receiving central Government funding as well as those with own funding, and to apply
generally accepted accounting principles as well as consolidation o f financial statements for all public
entities and enterprises.

D.      EnvironmentalAspects

142. The PFSAL has no direct impact on the environment. For the purposes o f Operational Directive
4.01, it has an environmental category o f C, which does not requirean environmental assessment.

E.      ProgramObjectiveCategories

 143. The PFSAL belongs to the category o fEconomic Management. It supports the Government's
economic reform program aimed at improvingthe environment for sustained and stable economic
growth, by ensuring a stable, appropriately capitalized, andwell functioning financial system. The
PFSAL includes features to improve the Government's institutional capacity to prevent financial
system deteriorationand to have financial policy and fundingmechanisms to promptlyresolve and
insulate weak financial institutions ifproblems should arise. The reform o f the public bank sector will
also significantly reduce financial systemrisks, while lowering the cost to the state o fmaintaining the
operating infrastructure and continuing losses from such institutions. Implementation o f the wider
financial sector program will also benefit the population at large by eventually generating improved


                                                    45

access to finance and savings. The program thus complements assistance by the Bank and other
donors designed to directly support the Government's development objectives.

F.     Benefitsand Risks

144. Benefits. This proposedprogrammatic loan would have benefits ina number o f areas o f the
financial system. The new legal framework would significantly modernize and facilitate the
management and regulation o f the financial system thus providing the public more transparency and
confidence inthe health of financial institutions and eventually attract increased foreign investment
into the financial services industry. The modernizationo fbank supervisory practices would cover the
early application o f sanctions to halt accelerated deterioration o f financial institutions and correct
deficient management practices regarding operational decisions and risk taking, as well as upgrading
the Superintendency's monitoring tools for risk assessment. This will reduce future disruptions inthe
financial system and `surprise banking crises', and thus engender a banking culture more predisposed
to reserve adequately against losses and able to extend credit duringeconomic growth periods. The
program would support these outcomes by increasingthe autonomy o fthe supervisory body, and
upgrading prudential financial regulations to enhance banking sector surveillance and thus reduce the
frequency and severity o f bank failures.

145. Modernization o f the failed bank resolutionprocedures will reduce potential drains on the public
budget and thus provide more room for spending on critical social programs includinghealth,
education as well as infrastructure. The establishment o f an industryfundeddeposit insurance system
will delinkbank resolution funding from the fiscal purse, while providing incentivesto the private
banking industryto better safeguard deposit insurance resources. The modernized rapid and efficient
mechanisms for bank exit will reduce the likelihood o f contagion effects andthus enable the economy
to resume growth quickly without beingunduly affected by bank failures, banking runs andor
exchange rate crises. The rationalizationo fthe state owned banking sector will reduce fiscal exposure
and generate additional market niches for the private banking system to develop andto increase credit
to smaller productive rural enterprises which can contribute to growth and to the export market. State
banking rationalization will, inaddition, reduce the misallocation o f resources to highly exposed
subsidized borrowers that generate losses, while focusing the provision o f financial services to those
populations and sectors with least access and geographically dispersed.

146. Risks. The principal risks to the reform program are the uncertainties o fthe national policy
debate and macroeconomic factors, as well as the risk o f incomplete implementation o f the reforms
due to weak institutional capacity. The reform o fthe banking system's regulatory framework and the
restructuring o f the state owned banking sector may be a politically charged process. Inthe first
instance, the stricter prudential regulations to be established for the operation o fbanks may generate
lobbying opposition from the private banking sector with appeals to their respective congressmen. The
reform will necessitate the eventual regularization or resolution o fweak banks. The Paraguayan
Congress has traditionally beena very activist and politically galvanizedbody which does not easily
approve reforms proposedby the executive branch ifthey threaten political interests generated from
constituency pressures. These factors could threaten the integrityo f the reform program ifthe
Congress does not approve any of, or a combination o f these pieces o f legislation under the program, a
circumstance which would not allow the second tranche to be disbursed.

 147. On another front, and more concerning the latter phases o fthe program, the restructuring o f the
state owned banking sector poses additional political challenges: the closure o f credit operations


                                                    46

beyond those aimed at the small farmer or entrepreneur, could generate political issues from the
influential cattle ranching sector that currently benefits from some o f these programs such as the Fondo
Ganadero which would be merged, wound down or privatized. At the other end o f the spectrum, the
closing o f certainbranches of institutions across the country, so as to rationalize operations, could
spark protests from the rural sectors on which the Government relies heavily for political support.
Because o f the large scope o f this reform, the Government i s consideringaltemative strategies inthe
latter phases such as beginningwith a reform o f the second tier institutions to be followed by a
subsequent stage where the first tier institutions would be addressed. While this to some extent could
achieve political consensus, it also carries the risk o f splitting the reform and delaying its subsequent
phase.

148. These risks will be ameliorated through a transparent and well disseminated public disclosure
and educational campaign carried out by the Ministryo f Finance inconjunction with partner agencies,
regarding the intent o f the reforms, showing that they are meant to benefit the economy as a whole, and
the poorer rural sectors inparticular. The public information campaignwill also extend to
consultations with congressional members to clearly disclose that the financial backing o f the
multilateralcommunity i s conditioned on the approval of the reforms, whose implementation would
release the needed financial resources to support the national economic program. The Government has
also started a closer ongoing dialogue with the key committees inthe Congress that oversee this
reform, to ensure that both the Executive and the Congress communicate regularly regarding strategies
andproposed changes inthe designo f the reform.

149. On the macroeconomic front, anemic growth could pose a threat to the viability o f implementing
bankingsystemreform. Given the higher capitalrequirements for banks under the new legislative
framework, low growth would make it difficult for the financial systemto generate sufficient
incremental retums to capitalize itselfadequately, therefore, there may be a need to phase inthe
reforms over a mediumterm period. The external and regional environment will also have an impact
were past competitive devaluations with Brazil to start again, not only from the overall macroeconomic
perspective (e.g.: loss o f markets), but also due to the effect on Paraguay's domestic debtors who
borrowed indollars and whose debt inguarani terms would continue rising. Other external
developments ineither the Argentine or Brazilian economies could adversely affect Paraguay's
projected growth. The currency mismatch within a highly dollarized economy can also pose severe
credit risks to Paraguayan banks. The program envisages reforms and risk management criteria for the
banks to address, ex ante, the issues o f dollarization and devaluation induced effects on the financial
system. Ifregional instabilitywere to recur, however, generating new bank failures, the Government
might face serious difficulties to sustain implementationo fthe reforms.

150. At a time whenprudential and reserving requirementsas well as capital adequacy standards were
becoming stricter, the loss provisioning requiredby banksunder the new norms, coupled with the
possibility o f yet higherprovisioning needs (iflocal borrowers were to default due to foreign exchange
exposures), could hamper effective implementation o f the reforms if such provisioning implied
excessive reductions o f reported capital, and the associated regulatory insolvency status. These
measures will be ameliorated bybuildingina grace period for full implementation so as to phase inthe
stricter requirementswithout causing undue technical failures or accounting bankruptcies inthe
interim. While such instances would provide the Government andthe Central Bank opportunities to
deploy the bank exit mechanisms included inthe new legislative framework, any materialization o f a
systemic problem might short circuit the reform givenpolitical pressures which could emanate to



                                                    47

rescue banks and depositors before an adequate deposit insurance find and its operating staff and
procedures were constituted.

151. Other risks pertain to overall govemance issues within an environment susceptible to corruption
as well as risks o f illicitly laundered monies within the banking system, either from contraband, drug
or terrorist activity. However, the new Government, with Bank support, has embarked on a public anti
corruption campaign to clean up the State sector, an initiative which will help to counteract past
abuses. Interms o f illicit funds, the program envisages a number o fmeasures to fortify the anti-money
laundering institutional framework which i s already supported by a number o fpieces o f legislation
developed over the last few years. These are included as part o f the supervisory andprudential aspects
under the reform program, and are also beingsupported bymultilateral funding inthe form o f grants
and other assistance. Some o fthe perceivedrisks o f corruption and lack o f transparency will be
ameliorated, as discussed earlier, through: (a) the audit o fthe special account used for deposit o f loan
proceeds as required, (b) new annual audits o fthe Central Bank as an institution, and (c) continued
implementation o f the Government's so far successful public transparency campaign, as well as follow
up on the recommendations o fthe IMF's safeguards assessment and the Bank's diagnostic o fpublic
financial accountability.

Mr.JamesD.Wolfensohn
President, InternationalBank for Reconstruction
and Development (IBRD)
Washington, D.C.
United States o f America

Dear Mr.Wolfensohn,

       Ihavethepleasureofaddressingyouinorderputtoyourknowledgeinformationonthe
development o f Paraguay's economy and financial system, and also to present the framework within
which the financial sector reform program will be implemented. It i s our intention to request financing
from the InternationalBank for Reconstruction and Development for introducing the programmed
adjustments for carrying out the reform o fthe financial sector. The assistance requested will facilitate
the implementationofthe structuralreforms to be carriedout bythe Paraguayan Government, which
are based on an efficient and stable administration o fboth banks and finance companies, with the aim
o f establishinga reliable financial systemcapable o f contributing to the economic recovery of
Paraguay (Exps. M.H.No. 27.878 and 29.369/ 2004).

A.     RecentDevelopmentsin the ParaguayanEconomy

       Inrecent years, the Paraguayan economyhasbeenmiredinadeep recession andpersistent
stagnation, with their resulting negative effects on the population's well being. The growth rate of the
economy duringthe last twenty years has been runningbelow the rate of demographic growth, and in
thepast five years, the average annual growth ofthe Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been
negative.

       The weakness o fthe financial sector has generated constraints on its capacity to provide
financing for the productive sector. Addedto this i s the low level of agricultural productivity and the
limiteddiversification of export products. This situation reveals the country's vulnerability to
international market fluctuations and its effects within and outside o f the region.

       The structural crisis prevailing inthe country has beenmirrored inthe recession o fthe last five
years and especially inthe significant slump ineconomic activity in2002. The 2.3 percent decline in
GDP ledto a reduction inthe goods and services available for the population, low incomes, and fewer
sources o f employment. Annual inflation stood at 14.6 percent, as a result o f a scant supply of goods
and services coupledwith the effect o f a sharp devaluation o f the guarani against the dollar. The
financial sector cut back lendingdue to the cumulative losses caused by the recession and borrower
defaults, as many borrowers are exposed to exchange rate risks. This situation has reducedthe private
sector's capacity to invest.




                                                   54

        Inthe monetary sector, the aggregateshave shown ahighconcentration o fdeposits inforeign
currency, plus a drop inloans to the private sector owing to the increase inpast due payments on bank
loans, which rose from 12 percent to 22 percent in2003, a situation that was compounded by the
recurrent financial crises besetting the country since mid-1995.

        Nevertheless, this situation was addressedimmediately by the Central Bank, at significant cost to
the State interms o f funds allocated to protect depositors and also support inthe granting o f
emergency loans that have not always beenrepaid.

        Inthe fiscal sector, considerable increaseshavebeenposted inthe fiscal deficit since 1995,due
to the fact that fixed expenditures increased inrelation to tax revenues. This ledto a rise inthe fiscal
deficit to 3.1 percent o f GDP in2002. Rationalization andprioritization o fthe allocation o f
expenditure, combined with the presentAdministration's efforts to improve collections, subsequently
enabled consolidation o f the cumulative deficit to only 0.1 percent o f GDP for fiscal 2003 and a
surplusof 1.4percent for 2004. Inaddition, the surpluses generated, facilitated the financing o f fixed
expenditures and funding o f active personnel's salaries, pensions, and debt interestpayments.

B.      Vision, Objectives,andGuidingPrinciplesof the Government'sProgram

        The situation described above calls for substantial changes inthe economic model applied in
recent years and requires transformation o fboththe structure o fproduction and the institutional
structure o f the State. This transformation entails the adoption o f a holistic approach to the different
dimensions o f the development process andpromotion o f a newmodel o f society based on sustainable
economic growth, inconjunction with fiscal, social, and environmental responsibility.

        To achieve this new country model, clear, fair and transparentlaws are needed, corruption must
be combated by ensuring the enforcement o flaws, intemal securitymustbe strengthened,and
credibility and confidence inthe nation andits future must be restored. Inaddition, steps must be
taken to overcome intemal conflicts derivingfrom the preeminence o f sectoral interests.

        The present Government is committed to the restorationo fthe State as a legal, administrative,
and political entity that ensures preservationo f the rules laid down inthe laws. Inthis context, the
Government's program includes as one o f its pillars for economic recovery and financial stability a far-
reaching reform o f the financial system. Emphasis i s also placed on the needto reform the banking
regulations, the resolution framework for banking institutions, public sector banks, social security
systems, bothpublic andprivate, andpublic enterprises. A growing concern on the part o f society is
for transparency and the needfor an effective legal system for the conduct o fbusiness.

C.      EconomicOutlookfor 2004-2005

        The present Administration inherited a nation that was plaguedby aprolongedperiod o f
stagnation and a persistent economic recession duringthe preceding years, with weak financial
institutions and deteriorated public finances which impose limits on the Government's ability to meet
i t s domestic and external payment commitments on the public debt.

        The Government has negotiated an agreement with the IntemationalMonetary Fund(IMF) for
economic policy reforms that will help reduce uncertainty by sending clear signals to the private sector
and preparing and strengtheningit to become a true catalyst for sustainable economic growth.

                                                   55

      In2003, the realGDP growthratewas 2.6 percent andgrowthofapproximately 2.9 percent or
above i s projected for 2004. Regarding the general price level, annual inflation i s projected at around
2.8% for 2004.

      The current account should close with a positive balance o f approximately 1percent o f GDP, and
the expected figure for public investmentis 3.5 percent o fGDP.

      The steps takento-date by the Ministryo fFinance, starting since 2003 and aimed at transparency
inits actions haveplayed asignificant role inthe improvedtax collectionto datewhich, together with
the reduction o f superfluous public expenditure, havepavedthe way for reversal o f the trend infiscal
performance for 2004. It i s important to note that the approval o fthe Law on Restructuring the
National PensionFundhas resultedina considerable improvement inthe fiscal situation inthe first
halfof 2004.

      Inaddition, various measureshavebeentakento containexpenditure,including elimination of
budget supplements submittedduringthe previous Administration and the fieezing o fpublic salaries.
The Government has moved to deal with the problem o ftax evasion, resulting ina 36 percent increase
incollections inthe fiscal year endinginApril 2004. Other importantreforms havinganimpact inthe
fiscal sphere andhelping to mitigate the scope o f corruption and maintain control of expenditure are
being carried out proactively inthe areas o fpublic procurement, customs, the Supreme Court, review
o fpublic payrolls, financial administration, and strengthening o f the public audit function.

      The projections o f the mainmacroeconomic variables for 2004 and 2005 show an improvement
inthe economic situation. GDPgrowth ofapproximately 3.5 percent is estimated for 2005, inflationis
expected to remain at around 6 percent. The guarani-dollar exchange rate shouldremain stable. The
2005 central government budget i s anticipates a primary surplus o f 0.8 percent compared to an
estimated primarysurplus o f 2.6 percent in2004, a surplus o f 0.9 percent in2003, and a deficit o f 1.7
percent for 2002.

       Regarding extemal debt, the Government has begunto honor the commitments to creditors and
also to renegotiate debt with the aim o f holding it at approximately 40 percent o f GDP.

       It is also important to note that the document "Interinstitutional Agenda for the Executive and
Legislative Branches" was signed inearly October 2003. This document has beenconverted into a
political agreement, as a result o f negotiations with the leaders o f the National Congress and the
representatives o f the main political parties forming the legislative body. The Agenda considers
reduction o fthe fixed expenditures o f the 2004 budget as a commitment, together with submission for
review and discussion o fthe following bills: (i)  Pension Reform; (ii) on Administrative Reform
                                                                           Law
and Fiscal Adjustment; (iii) Customs Code; (iv) Public Debt Restructuring; and (v) Public Sector
                               New
Bank Reform. These are all actions that will complement the reform of the financial system, which
seeks to strengthenthe system and insulate it from possible shocks, while at the same time puttingin
place appropriate measures to protect depositors.

D.     The FinancialSector ReformProgram

       The Government has launched a financial system reformprogram with the aim of strengthening
its capacity to regulate the system and prevent contagion from systemic crises.

                                                   56

FirstPhase

       Underthe first phase o fthe program, Law No. 2334/2003 was promulgated, pertaining to
Deposit Insurance and Resolution o fFinancial Intermediaries subject to the General Law o f Banks,
Finance Companies, and other LendingEntities, as well as accompanying regulations for its
implementation. This law forms part o f a complete package o freforms o f the financial system and
envisages the creation o f a deposit insurance find which will be established initiallywith capital
providedby the State through the issuance o f State bonds, and subsequently be made up of
contributions furnishedby the financial institutions. It i s important to emphasize that use o f the
deposit insurance fund resources will be subject to the new regularization and resolutionrules for
financial entities, laid down inLaw No. 2334/2003. The reform beingimplementedplaces the
Paraguayan legislation in a vanguard position and inline with similar regional and intemational
mechanisms.

       Underthe previous system, the taking over and closingo fbanks and financial institutions was a
slow process that generally resultedinthe loss o f market value o f the institutions and their collateral.
The proposed new regularizationand resolutionprocedures will enable timely,identificationo fviable
assets and liabilities, so that attractive balance sheet packages can be offered to other banks.

       This would make it possible to reduce the use of funds for deposit insurance, since the portfolio
o f troubled banks can be transferred immediately to interested banks. Only the remainingdeposits, i.e.
those not absorbed by the other banks, will require usingdeposit insurance funds.

       The proposed bank resolution arrangements envisionmodemmethods of transferring assets and
liabilities from troubled banksto sound banks. This will eliminate the delays intransferring assets
from troubledbanks resulting from the needto wait for assessments o f asset quality before the transfer
i s made.

       Therefore, the reform accordingly proposes the transfer o f the largest possible number o f
deposits together with bonds issuedby means o f securitization o f the portfolio made up o f the assets o f
the entity undergoingresolution, employing mechanisms that ensure competition andare consistent
with the creditor hierarchy stipulated by law.

       The instrumentsinquestionwill involve complex regulations requiringtechnical and legal
expertise and experience. To that end, the Govemment hired intemational experts inthese areas in
order to draft the requisite regulations and implement the proposed scheme. These processes have
already advanced and as a result the Central Bank issued Regulation 6 o fMarch 15, 2004 establishing
the criteria to subjects financial institutions to Regularizatiodhprovement Plans, andRegulation 31
o f March 18, 2004 prohibiting financial institutions to guarantee client deposits with assets as
collateral.

       Another essential aspect o f the reform process under the first phase i s the Government's
commitment to amend the General Law for Banks, Finance Companies, and other Lending Entities.
Important amendments have been introducedto this billpertaining to bank licensing, standards to be
metbyboardsof directors, tighter requirementswith respect to capital and adjustments for inflation,
procedures for corrective actions, and a system for sanctions and assessment o f fines. The bill hrther
envisages limits on lendingconcentration, responsibility o f managers with respect to oversight and risk

                                                     57

management policies, a 50 percent limit on the inclusion o f the revaluation reserve as capital, greater
autonomy for the Superintendency o f Banks inthe imposition of sanctions, regulation o f financial
intermediation activity, and management o f related party risks.

       The General Banking law bill that the Executive has submittedto Congress on December 10,
2004, i s primarily designed push forward the above mentioned reforms and to establish uniform
regulatory standards for all entities inthe financial system. The national economic authorities
understand that the establishment o f uniform rules and standards i s crucial to establish a framework
through which the competition o f financial entities works to maximize efficiency.

       Inaddition, uniform regulatory standards are also essential for ensuring that the financial
intermediaries do not obtain benefits or advantages that encourage them to act less effectively in
certain cases due to fewer requirements,and to the detriment o f other types o f competitors and
possibly savers as well.

       The amendments to Regulation 8 o fthe Central Bank, dated November 27, 2003, include new
rules concerning the increase of provisions against losses and limitation inthe use o f real estate
collateral, rules on assessing collateral, on classifyingrefinanced loans and interest accrual, and
regulatory adaptation or contingency plans to be submittedby the banks.

       Inaddition, the sanctions regimeunderthe CentralBank Charter Law hasbeenamended to
incorporatedthis under the General Banking Law. The reform o fthe General Banking Law will
facilitate more active oversight o f financial institutions and adoption o f the appropriate measures
required by the Central Bank and the Superintendency o f Banks to reduce the level o frisk inthe
financial system.

       To complement these reforms andprevent contamination o f the financial systemwith illicit
money, the approval and subsequentenforcement o f a draft law aimed at preventing and suppressing
illegal acts intended to launder money and goods will be supported. The draft law on anti-money
laundering which was presented to the Congress on May 13,2004, proposes centralizing the detection
andmonitoring o f such activities inone agency, together with an updateddefinition o f crimes inthis
area: the financing o f terrorism as a criminal offense and money laundering as a separate, independent
crime.

       For these reforms to be implemented, institutional changes will beneeded inthe degree o f
oversight. To that end, a Strategic Plan for the Superintendency o f Banks was prepared with the aim o f
establishing short, medium, and long-tenn goals relating to targeted oversight o f institutions,
contingency plans for dealing with weaknesses, and undertaking appropriate corrective actions. The
Strategic Planwas approved and formalized bythe Central Bank's Board o f Directors and will
facilitate a more in-depthevaluation o f the bank risks as well as full-scale activation o fthe new rules
governing resolution and regularization o f the financial institutions.

Second Phase

       The secondphase o fthe reform anticipates the implementation o fthe new legal andregulatory
framework including putting inforce the new BankingLaw. With respect to the BankingResolution
and Deposit Insurance Law, actions include the implementation o fprocedures that permit applying the
new insurance mechanismusinga least cost criteria as well as standardizing the resolutionpractice o f

                                                     58

usingmatching assets and liabilities to transfer those balances to acquiring banks inthe financial
system, including the use o f the securitizationmechanism for that purpose.

       Underthis phase it is also anticipated that the operational procedures o fthe Deposit Insurance
Fundwill be institutionalizedincluding the criteria for theuse ofits funds such as the principal o fleast
cost, its functional structure andintemal controls, and its custody and investment regime for insurance
premiums collected fromthe financial system.

       Underthis phase ofthe reform, the Central Bank will ensure compliance with the regulations on
provisions as defined under Regulation 8, so that banks and finance companies show the adequate
allocation o f capital and reserves to cover actual andprojected losses intheir loan portfolios. These
actions will be essential to strengthenthe financial systemand better protect it against future economic
and financial shocks.

       To complement these changes, this stage o f the reform will also implement a stremngthened
supervisionprocess according to the guidelinesunder the Banking Superintendency's Strategic Plan
underwhich banks inthe system will be evaluated against their inherentbusiness risks, andcorrective
actions will be taken when consideredjustified according to the new regulatory framework.

       It is also anticipated inthis phase to have approved and ineffect the new Anti Money
Laundering Law. Inaddition, the Government will presentto the Congress a new bill o f law which
modified the Central Bank Charter andwhich will cover, among other reforms, a more robust process
to maintain at any point intime, a structure o f staggered appointments andterms for the membersof
the Central Bank's Board o fDirectors.

E. Restructuringofthe State-OwnedFinancialInstitutions

ThirdPhase

       The thirdphase o fthe program deals primarily with the restructuring o fthe public state-owned
financial entities. Ifthe implementation o f these reforms were carried out early on, this phase mightbe
accelerated.

       Public Sector financial institutions needto be restructured and consolidated, primarily inlight o f
the insolvency o f a number of them, the deficient allocation o f subsidies, political and social
considerations regarding the criteria for profitability, solvency and growth, the evident patronage in
their portfolios, and their level o fnonperformance. This reformwill apply to the National
Development Bank (BNF),the Livestock Fund(FG`),the Industrial Development Fund(FDI),the
Technical Project ImplementationUnit (UTEP),the National Housing Board (CONAVI), the National
Housing Bank (BANAVI),the Government Agricultural Bank (CAW and the Farming Development
Fund(FDC).

       Taken as a whole, State financial institutions have had efficiency problems andhave generated
continuous negative fiscal impacts, jeopardizing the reliability o f the financial system as a whole and
negatively impacting the country's international reserves. At this time, the difficulties facing public
sector banks, the negative effect o f these problems on the functioning o f the financial system inthe
country, andthe consequences o f this situation on the real sectors o fthe economy, have made it
imperative to reform the institutions concemed.

                                                    59

      Against this backdrop, the Law on the Restructuringo f the Public Sector Financial Institutions
was elaborated. The objective o f this law i s the overhaul o f the State-owned financial entities,
channeling state participation to two entities, one a first tier institution and the other a second tier
entity, inorder to eliminate the existing obstacles inthe present configuration o fpublic sector banks
which hinder efficient channeling o f hnds available for lending, and to focus their activity on potential
borrowers who do not at present have access to the formal financial system.

      To assure an agile reform effort and gain political support duringthis process, the Government
recently modified its strategy for implementingthe reform o f the state-owned banks so as to consider
two phases; one through the presentation and approval o f a second tier bank, and another which
includes presentation o f a reform bill for the restructuring of the first tier banks. Bothbills have been
presentedto the Congress onNovember 2,2004 and February 16,2005, respectively. Inthe first case,
the FDI,FDC, UTEP, CONAVIand BANAVIwill berestructured, and inthe secondphase this will
cover the BNF, C A H and FG. Giventhe current situation, the original draft bill which hadnot yet
beenreviewedby the Congress was replaced by a bill to create the FinancialAgency for Development
as the only secondtier bank and the sole channel for loans from the public sector to the financial
system. Eventhough this sequential strategy i s considered as the most politically viable currently, the
option to consolidate these reforms under a single bill will remain open if subsequent developments
lead toward this under this third phase o fthe reform program.

      At the initiationofthe reform, efforts that were started andwill continue, involve the
restructuring o f the National Development Bank (BNF),the largest public sector bank, to trim its size
and limit its operations to priority clients and sectors that have scant access to financing through the
privatebanking system, and for this purpose, via Decree No. 4818 o fFebruary 3,2005, a Commission
was created to monitor the action plan for BNF's reorganization. The reform o fthe State bank system
seeks to utilize the advantages offered by the existence o fpublic institutions such as the BNF, which
already have a network and a computerized systemcovering the entire country, and the CAH, which
has experience with rural micro lending. Since the BNF and the other public institutions are currently
indeficit as regards their capital levels, fundingwill beneededto fully capitalize the newlyinstitution.

      As regards second tier banking activities, the intention is to set up a single entityresultingfrom
the restructuring ofthe current development funds that will transfer resources to financial
intermediaries at competitive rates. The primary purpose o f the second tier financial entity will be to
administer the resources deriving from loans granted by intemational developmentfinancing agencies.

      With the restructuring o f the first tier banks, which work directly with the public, the aim is to
serve clients which, besides qualifying for credits, are those with the most difficult access to financial
and banking services, and operating the bank to prevent mismanagement resultinginfinancing from
restricted public funds. To that end, limitswill be placed on lendingand borrowing operations and
indebtednessfrom the second tier bank, and it will be ensured that all financial and operating costs are
covered by the institution's lendingrates, and that its loan portfolio i s adequately provisioned against
losses.

      The reform will be carried out under the coordination o f a special restructuring commission that
will contract private specialists to manage the creation o fthe balance sheets o fthe new institutions.
Uponthe conclusion of the reform process, it i s expected there will be efficient state participation in
the financial system, appropriate and clear assignment o froles inthe financial sector plus better

                                                    60

utilization o fthe tax revenues obtained from the population as a whole, inasmuch as they will no
longer be financing the losses causedby inefficient management.

F.     Conclusion

       The protracted recession that Paraguay has beenexperiencing i s the outcome o f structural
rigidities inthe economy that do not foster growth and significantly impact the well being o fthe
country's population. The present Administration has begunto designmedium-term policies for
achieving a sustainable fiscal and financial sector, with a view to improving the conduct o fpublic
administration and the operations of the financial system inorder to reactivate the economy.

       At the same time, short andmedium-termmeasures havebeen implemented to meet the National
Treasury's fundingneeds and cope with the severe budgetary constraints, inparallel with the priority
initiatives aimed at puttingthe financial systemon a sound footing.

       The purpose of the loanbeing requested from the World Bank is to support the Paraguayan State
inresolving its present liquidity,balance of payments andbudgetaryneedswhich, among others, will
require incremental resources for moving forward with the restructuring o f the public financial
institutions. The three phase medium-term program for reactivating and strengtheningthe financial
sector the Government of Paraguay i s seeking to promote, will require the requisite funding.

       As mentioned earlier, the Government has negotiateda Stand-By Arrangement with the
InternationalMonetary Fund(IMF) for a period of 15 month^'^, which will be essential for
guaranteeing the actions planned for the recovery o f the system inthe fiscal sphere and from the
standpoint o f monetary and financial stability, and for enhancing the country's solvency, so that it can
honor its commitments with respect to public debt contracted.

       Inthe present circumstances, the support ofthe World Bank and other multilateral financing
agencies will be o f paramount importance andwill lay the groundwork for promoting the structural
reform o f the financial sector, thereby achieving economic growth inParaguay.

       Let me take this opportunity to convey to you my distinguishedregards.

  El sectorfinanciero,* redujo 10s niveles deprkstamos debido a pdrdidas acumuladaspor

    promocidn de un nuevo modelo de sociedad con un crecimiento econdmico sustentable,y
    con una misidn la responsabilidadfiscal, social y ambiental.

             Para lograr este nuevo modelo de pais, se requieren reglas claras, equitativas y
   , transparentes, luchar contra la corrupcidn asegurando la aplicacidn de las. leyes,
    fortaleciendo la seguridad interna y recuperando la credibilidad y la confianza en la

     entidad legal, administrativa y politica que asegure la permanencia de las reglas

     estancamiento y persistente recesibn econdmica durante 10s aios anteriores, con
     instituciones financieras dkbiles y deterioradas finanzas publicas que se traducen en

                                       crecimiento real del PIB fue de 2.6% y se estima un
                                      dedor de 2.9% o mayor para el 2004. Con respecto a1
   Nivel General de Precios, se estima una inJtacidn alrededor del 2.8%para el 2004.


 a          La balanza de cuenta corriente cerraria con saldo positivo de aproximadamente
    1%del PIB,y la expectativa de inversidn ptiblica seria del 3.5 %del PIB.

             Las acciones tomadas hasta la fecha, comenzando desde el aiio 2003 por el
   Ministerio de Hacienda conducentes a la transparencia en su gestidn posibilitaron en
    buena rnedida el incremento en la recaudacidn tributaria hasta la fecha que
    conjuntamente con la reduccidn del gastoptiblico super-uoposibilitnran un cambio de la
    tendencia en el            Jiscal2004. Es importante mencionar, que la sancidn de la Ley
                                                 rmitid mejorar considerablementela situacidn

              Las proyecciones de las principales variables macroecondmicas para 2005
       muestran un mejoramiento de la situacidn econdmica. Se estima que el Product0 Interno
       Bruto crecerb en torno a1 3.5% en el 2005, mientras que se espera una inflacidn en torno
       a1 6.0%. Et tipo de cambio guarani-ddlar se mantendria estable. Para el Gobierno
       Central, la ejecucidn del presupuesto de 2005 anticipa un superrivit primario de 0.8%
       cornparado con un'superavit primario del 2.6% en 2004, un superrivit en el 2003 de 0.9%
       y un dkficit de I.7% en el 2002.

              Respecto a la deuda aterna, el Gobierno ha empezado a honrar 10s compromisos
       nsumidos con 10s acreedores, ademas de renegociar la deuda, con el objetivo de reducir
       la proporcidn de la deuda`en relacidn con el PIB a niveles menores del 40%.

       Interinstitucional pura el Ejecutivo y el Legislativo" fue firmado a inicios del mes de
       octubre del 2003. Este documento se ha convertido en un acuerdo politico, resultado de
       una negociacidn con 10s lideres del Congreso Nacional y de 10s representantes de 10s
       principales partidos politicos que conforman el - cuerpo legislativo. Esta agenda

Prinrera Fase

        Bajo la primera fase del programa fue promulgada la Ley No2334/2003, de
Garantia de Depdsitos y Resolucion de Eritidades de Intermediacibn Financiera sujetos
de lu Ley General,de Bancos, Financierus y otras Entidades de Crkdito acompaiiada de
reglamentacion base para su implementacidn. La Ley citadaforma parte de un paquete
integral de reformas del sistema financier0 y contempla la creacidn de un fondo de
gurantia de depdsitos, el cuaI sera constituido inicialmente con capital aportado por el
Estado, a travds de la emisidn de bonos del Estado, y posteriormente integrado con
aportes de Ias institucionmjnancieras. Es importante destacar, que la utilizacidn de 10s
rccursos del fondo de garantia de depdsitos estarci sujeta a las nuevas normas de
regularizacibn y resolucidn de entidatles financieras establecidas en la Ley No
2334/2003. La reforma que se viene implementando coloca a la legislacidn paraguaya en
la vanguardia y en linea con mecanismos similares tanto regionales como
ititernacionales.

        Bqjo el rdgimen anterior, la intewencidn y cierre de 10s bancos e instituciones
financieras constituia unproceso lento, que generalmente derivaba en pkrdida del valor
de mereado Ias instituciones y garantias. Los nuevos procedimientos de regularizacibn y
resolucidn propuestos pemitircin la identficacidn a tiempo de 10s' activos y obligaciones
viahles, de manera quepuedan ser atractivospara ofiecer a otros bancos.

        Esto permf$ria'reducir la utilizacidn de 10sfondos disponibles para el seguro de
 deppdsito, debido a que la cartera de los bancos con problemas podrcin ser transferidos
 inniedintcrmentea bancos interesados. Solo el remanente de 10s depdsitos, ayuellos que
 no fueron absorbidos por 10s delemas bancos requerird la utilizacidn del seguro de
 depbsitos.

        El esquema de resolucidn bancaria propuesto contempla mktodos modernos de
 transferencia de activos y pasivos de 10s bancos conproblemas a 10s bancos sanos. Seran
 soIucionndas Ins demoras en la transferencia de 10s activos de 10s bancos con oroblehas

                        Por ello, la refo     propone como una alternativa 'la transferencia del mayor
           nlimero posible de depdsitos juntamente con participaciones emitidas a travds de la
           titulnrizacidn' de carteralformada con 10s activos de la entidad en resolucidiz, utilizando
           rnecanisnzos que aseguren la cornpetencia y de acuerdo a1 rdgimen de prelacidn
           establecido en la ley.

                        Los instrumentos mencionados requerircin de regulaciones complejas que
           iniplicnn capacidad y experiencia, tdcnica y legal. Para estepropdsito, el Gobierno ya ha
           contratado expertos internacionales en &stas cireas, para desarrollar la reglamentacidn
           correspondiente, asi como la operativizacidn del esquemapropuesto. Estos procesos ya
         , hnn avanzado y como resultado el BCP emitid la Resolucidn No6 del 15 de marzo de
           2004 estableciendo 10s criterios para sujetar a entidades financieras a un Plan de
           Regiilarizncidn, y la Resolucion No31 del I8 de marzo de 2004 prohibiendo a entidades
           financieras garantizar con sus activos, 10s depdsitos del priblico.

                         Otro de 10s aspectos esenciales bajo la primera fase de la rgorma, es el
            compronziso del Gobierno de modificar la Ley General de Bancos, Financieras y Otras
           Instituciones de Credito. Importantes cambios se han introducido en el Proyecto de ley
            concernicntes a li           a y esthndares-de 10s directorios de LQS-bancos, aumento de
            rcyuerimientos de'           1y ajuste por injlacidn, procedimientos de acciones correctivas,
            rigimen de sanci0nes.y aplicacidn de multas. Asimismo, el proyecto contempla Iimites a
            la concentracidn'de       '      0, responsabilidad de gerentes en controles y politicas de
            ricsgo, limite de 50%             esewa de revalliopara integrar el capital, mayor autonomia
            del poder sancionatorio de la superintendencia de bancos, regulacidn de la actividad de
            intermediacidnfiitanciera, y manejo de riesgos vinculados.

                         El proyecto de Ley General de Bancos que el Poder Ejecutivo ha remitido a1
             Congreso de la Nacidn el 10 de diciembre de 2004, time como principal objetivo
            inipulsar las reformas arriba mencionadasy establecer normas regulatorias uniformes,
            para todas las entidades que componen el sistemafinancier0 nacional. Las autoridades
            econdmicas nacionales entienden que el establecimiento de normas uniJormes es crtccial

           Para complementar estas reformas y para evitar la contaminacidn del sistema
  jlnanciero con dinero ilicito, se impulsard la sancidn y posterior impbmentacidn de un
   proyecto de Ley qge preyifne y reprime 10s actos ilicitos destinados a la legitimacidn de

           Para la implementacidn de las rejorrnas,sercin necesarios cambios institucionales

                La tercera fase del programa abarca principalmente la reestructuracidn de las
         eiztidadesfinancieras pziblicas. Si la implementacidn de estas reformas se efectuaran
         teniprananiente, estafase sepodria adelantar.

                 Las   insiituciones financieras pliblicas necesitan ser reestructuradas y
i,..'    consolidadas, principalmente considerando la insolvencia de algunas de ellas, deficiente
         asignacidn de subsidios, consideraciones politicas y sociales sobre 10s criterios de
         rentabilidad, solvencia y crecimiento, el clientelismo de sus carteras y la morosidad de
         Ins mismas. Esta reforma abarcarri a1 Banco Nacional de Foment0 (BNF), el Fondo
         Ganadero (FG), el.*Fondo,de Desarrollo Industrial (FDI), la Unidad Thcnica Ejecutora
         de Proyectos del BCP'(<TEP), el Consejo Nacional de la Vivienda (CONAVI), el Banco

           las enticiadesfinancieras ptiblicas, encausando la participacidn estatal a dos entidades,
           unci deprime? piso y otra de segundo, de manera a eliminar 10s obstciculos existentes en
           lu configuracibn presente de la Banca Publica que impiden la canalizacidn eficiente de

                     Para asegurar una reforma mas agil y ganar apoyo politico en este proceso, el

   BACKGROUNDAND DIAGNOSTICS OF THE PARAGUAYANBANKING
     REGULATORY AND RESOLUTIONFRAMEWORKAND TECHNICAL
                                ISSUES INTHE REFORM


                   a. InstitutionalIssues: RegulationandSupervision

1.    The supervision o f financial activities inParaguay is distributed among several
official agencies. The Central Bank and the Superintendency of Banks are responsible for
supervising those institutions regulated by the bankinglaw (banks, finance companies,
and exchange and receipt warehouses). The conduct o ftheir banks and finance
companies falls entirely under the supervision o f the Central Bank o f Paraguay (BCP)
and the legal provisions o f its Organic Law 489/95 and the BankingLaw 861/6918.
Savings and LoanAssociations, earlier supervised by the Superintendency o f Societies
(part o f BANAVI") and regulated by Law 325/71 are now under the banking law, while
Credit UnionCooperatives are subject to oversight by the INCOOP (Cooperatives
oversight agency inthe Ministryo f Agriculture) under the terms o f Law 438/94.
Supervision o f deposit taker intermediaries is, therefore, fragmented among three
institutions andlacks the necessary compatibility. A parallel operation prepared by the
InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB)has included areform and technical assistance
program to strengthenthe supervision o f cooperatives and tie it more closely with the
banking and depositary institution norms overseen by the Superintendency o f Banks.

2.    Inaddition, the financial sector includesinsurance companies, brokerage houses
andinvestment funds. Insurance activities are carried underthe provisions o f Law
897/96, and their supervision i s the responsibility o f the Superintendency o f Insurance,
underthe aegis o fthe Central Bank (BCP). Brokerage and capital market activities,
albeit very reduced, fall under the control o f CNV (Comision Nacional de Valores) and
are carried under the precepts o f the Securities Law, while investment management
activities and services are regulatedby the Law 921/96 on Trusts, presumably under the
supervision o f the BCP.

3.    Paraguayan prudential banking regulations incorporate many o f the key Basle
principles, although for some accountingpractices they differ, leading to potential
overstatement o f capital o fbanks. The use o f different types o freal collateral both for
capital computation purposes as well as for loss provisioning purposes overestimates
freely available capital, especially since the unwindingor liquidation o f collateral
backingifneeded, can normally take years and therefore its present value should be
heavily discounted. Other accounting adjustments inline with best practices would
implythat the Paraguayan banking system is under capitalized, with the local (private and
public) banks reflecting the largest gap to ensure technical solvency ifthe strictest

                                               75

accounting standards are used. An estimate o f the required capitalization at the system
wide level, yielded a potential gap o f $134 million ifone were to apply best practice
standards beyond the minimumBasle requirements.

4.     The Central Bank of Paraguay (BCP) is the sole bankingregulator and supervisor
inthe country. According to its Organic Law 489195 ,ithas all the basic powers
(licensing, regulatory, enforcement and exit authority) requiredto promote the stability
and soundness of operations o fbanks and finance companies. The Superintendency i s
closely affiliated with the Central Bank through a common Board o f Directors, but by
law it operates as a separate department with very little autonomy inpractice, since all
powers are vested inthe Board o f the BCP. The Superintendent o f Banks (SB) directs
the operations o fthe SB but does not have much administrative authority which is
exerted by the President o f the BCP.

Supervisory Structure and Method

5.     The SB has no direct power regardinglicensing and enforcement, and few bank
resolution and regulatory competencies. The role o f SB inthese matters i s limitedto
advising the Board of BCP which retains the core competencies and decision making
authority. The real banking supervisor inParaguay i s de facto, the Board o fthe BCP
itself and not the Superintendency, as a reading o f the Organic Law would indicate. The
lack o f delegationby the Board of some o f its powers to the SB, and a relative scarce
formalization inwriting of core supervisory policies --communicated both internally and
to bank directors and management-- have also contributed towards limitingthe autonomy
o f SB and the efficiency of banking supervision.

6.     Inpart as aby-product o fthese limitations, the Supervisoryapproach followed in
the past has focused more on determining compliancewith the letter o f laws and
regulations rather than focusing into assessingthe risk profile o f activities and the quality
o fthe management processes followed bybanking institutions. Absent o f a set o f
communicated standards on good governance and risk management --and short o fthe
capacity to evaluate risk and risk management practices -- supervision has evolved from a
compliance approach to one o f a solvency diagnostic type. As the BCP and SB have not
developed policies for addressing varying degrees o frisky practices, they have not been
capable o fpreventingand early remedyingexcessive accumulation of risks and poor risk
management, governance and control processes associated with banking failures and
crises.

7.     State banks with their own statutory mandates and which do not fall under the same
provisions as the commercial banking law, also represent an area o f neededreform and
increased oversight, something the Government i s already considering inits reform
efforts. This i s particularly so for State financial nonbank intermediaries utilized to
channel bilateral and multilateral resources for credit. Giventhe non deposit taking
nature o f these institutions, they are supervisedscantly and their loan portfolios have
beendeteriorating. Consolidation of some o fthese operations into a small rural sector
bank and one second tier intermediary, will help to increase supervisory oversight. The
one commercial State bank (BNF) which has suffered from both adverse debt forgiveness
initiatives and large non-performing borrowers, will be dismantled so that its lendingcan

                                              76

better focus on small businesses with a higher needfor credit access, while lowering its
overall exposure.

Prudential Approach

8.    Prudential quantitative standards (capital ratios, risk weights, and risk limits) are
explicitly established inthe Banking Law 861/69 with a degree o f detail that makes
regulatory development and adaptation to changing circumstances too rigid. Major risk
limitsandprudential ratios are established inthe Law including riskweights and detailed
definitions. Inmany countries these would be established by secondary regulations that
develop the principles o f the Law, facilitating continuous development and adaptation.
An additional issue inthe Paraguayancontext is the problem ofmoney laundering,
primarily due to the contraband trade, but also more recently on account o f suspected
terrorist links inits border communities. The BCP has, andwill continue to strengthenits
institutional resources and its legal framework to betterdetect such money flows which
impact the operations o f the financial system.

9.     Interms ofprudentialreforms, however, even a small amendment to capital
adequacy or regulations on risk limits, requires inParaguay an amendment to the
Banking Law approvedby Congress. This prevents adaptingprudential regulations to
international evolving standards without reforming the Banking Law. Albeit, it i s o f
particular importance for establishing the sufficiency o f capital, since risk weights
assigned inthe Banking Law differ markedly from international standards, resultinginan
overstatement o f risk weightedsolvency o f the system and individual banks. The Board
o f the Central Bank shouldconsider obtaining legal delegationto establish by regulation
the more important prudential parameters.

10. Another feature o f the evolving regulatory framework inParaguay is its marked
quantitative style, with few standards having been promulgatedregarding governance,
control structures and risk management. Inturn, as inmany other countries, the
formalism o fprudential quantitative regulations may have precluded the development o f
a risk based Supervisory Approach that focuses on identifying varying degrees o f risk,
summarizing the riskprofile o f institutions, and actingpreemptivelyto address
weaknesses detected inrisk management and controls.

11. The CADEF is the Superintendency's bank rating systemwhich is a CAMEL based
composite index o f financial ratios prepared with information reported by banks and
finance companies; and currently required by law to be publishedby the SB.
Accordingly, its value as a predictor o f problems, or as a tool to classify institutions, i s
dependent on the quality o fthe data reportedby banks and finance companies. Dueto
the distortions inregulations, accounting and reportingpractices, there are serious doubts
about the current transparency o f that information and the final value o f the CADEF.

Process Constraints

 12. The SB's ability to identify serious banking solvency or liquidityproblems appears
adequate during its normal course o f on-site inspections. However, and as discussed
earlier under the regulatory/supervisory fiamework, the enforcement o f sanctions applied

                                             77

for non compliance suffer from delays bothwithin the Central Bank and due to lack o f
response from the supervisedinstitutions. While "corrective action" i s not a formally
specified stage under the banking law, it i s important to identify deficiencies inits
application and how this may impact the overall bank resolution framework. Corrective
action directives and sanctions are established by the issuance o fregulations
("resoluciones") by the Central Bank, which follow from the provisions inthe Law
covering exceedance o f specified limits, etc.

13.    Some o f the constraints ineffectively applying prompt corrective actions orders
and enforcing them, involve the following:

      a.      Lack o f timely response from banks to recommendations/orders
              communicatedby the SB to improve their internal management processes;

      b.      Existent application o f fines for exceeding regulated financial limitsbut not
              for judgments regarding faulty management;

       c.     The formality o fpreparing legal documents prior to officially implementing
               sanctions; and

d.     The lack o fdelegationbyBCP's Boardto the SB, to apply sanctions for ongoing
non compliance issues.


          b. Current Frameworkfor the BankVigilance,InterventionRegimes

14.    The current Banking Law (No. 861) invokes the Vigilance Regime(`Vigilancia
Localizada ') which implies, the following actions (Article 113) affecting the target bank:
(i)Permanent ongoing inspection of the financial entity, (ii)   Reduction inthe period
duringwhich the institution's minimumreserve requirementat the BCP i s calculated, (iii)
Prohibition against accepting management o f Trusts, (iv) Non eligibility o f the entity to
participate as intermediary for promotional/directed credits, (v) Deposit o f any surplus or
repaid funds above what i s needed to meet depositor payments, ina remunerated BCP
account, and (vi) N o distributions o fnet income, andno increase inpersonnel or salaries.
Duringthe vigilance regime, arehabilitation program is requiredwithin 7 days o fthe
start o f the regime and the program delineates an action plan to reverse the tendencies
which resulted intriggering vigilance by the SB.

 15.   The triggers for placing a bank under the Vigilance regime as specified inArticle
 110 o fthe banking law, are the following:

a.     Non compliance with the reserve requirements for 30 consecutive days or for a
total o f 60 non consecutive days during a 12monthperiod.

b.     Exceedingthe limits established under articles 58 and 59 (investment, capital,
connected lending) duringtwo consecutive months, or four non consecutive months
during a 12monthperiod.


                                              78

c.    A capital deficit below the minimumfor more than 60 days.

d.    An observed need to refinance obligations or use BCP liquidity credit for over 60
days duringa 180day period. This excludes extraordinarycredit demands generated
from seasonal requirements.

e.    Non compliance with implementationo f corrective actions.

f.    Offering deposit rates at levels markedly higher than the market interms o f similar
institutions.

Intervention

16.   Underthe Paraguayanbanking framework, interventiono f abank by the SB is
triggeredby one or more of the following (Article 118):

a.     Suspension o f a bank's payment o f obligations;

b.    Having lost over 50 percent o f its capital;

c.    Not complying with a rehabilitation planagreed duringthe Vigilance stage, or not
presentingan adequate plan to the SB;

d.     Havingcommittedvarious continued infractions o fthe banking law andits
statutory requirements as well as non compliance with regulations or resolutions issued
by the BCP and SB;

e.     Having suppliedfalse information to the SB or the BCP; and

f.     Not complying with the requisite shareholder meetings or parent company actions
to ensure appropriate operational actions and meetingo f legal requirements.

 17.   Duringintervention, the SB undertakes the following actions which are
consequences o f entering into such phase: (i)  powers ofmanagement and the Board are
suspended; (ii) bank's administrationi s taken over by the SB through officials
                the
designated for such purpose, (iii) the intervened entity continues to operate under the
administration o f the interventor subject to the operating constraints put into force under
Vigilance; (iv) the SB will determine loss provisioning requirements for assets according
theproperaccountingnorms after approvalbythe BCP Board, and subsequentreduction
o f capital inorder to determine the market value o f the bank; and (v) the SB will order all
shareholders to deposit their share securities at the BCP within 15 days o f a request for
such via the public media. Securities not deposited duringthat time periodwill be
considered valueless subsequently.

 18.   As mentioned above, the subsequent stage after interventioneither involves
immediatecapitalization o fthe bank by shareholders or other parties via purchase &
 assumption, or moving towards liquidation. Under the current law, the sale option named


                                            79

"forced sale" as described inArticles 122 and 123, i s very briefly described with most o f
that chapter o f the law dedicated to the modalities o f liquidation including the contracting
o f thirdparties for this purpose. However, modemizedresolutionmechanisms using
selected carve-out o f assets and liabilities are not explicitly contemplated as part o f this
legislation.

     c. Stress Test andAccountingAdjustmentsto BankingSystemBalanceSheets

Adjustment to Risk Weighted Capital

19.    The initial financial statement adjustment conducted as part o f the diagnostic o f the
soundness o f the financial system, corresponds to the calculation o frisk weighted capital,
i.e. the capital adequacy ratio (CAR). The levels o f reported CAR for Paraguayan
entities are among the highest inthe Regionbut this is caused inpart caused by a less
strict and insome cases, incomplete regulationo f particular accounting norms. For
example, some risks are not considered, such as market risks, exchange rate risk, etc., and
the regulation i s based mainlyon credit riskparameters. The CAR adjustment, therefore,
i s the starting point to make comparisons for the latter adjustments and for the exogenous
factors (stress tests). The CAR adjustment to reported equity (the numerator inthe risk
weighted capital calculation) consists o f including revaluationreserves at only 50 percent
ofreported value, particularly given the economic situation inParaguay where any past
revaluations o f fixed assets such as real estate may not be adjusted to current market
conditions o f low demand for such assets. Another adjustment within the CAR ratio
numerator i s for eamings before distributions. InParaguay, eamings are reported at 100
percent for the purposes o f calculation o f capital but this adjustment places them at only
50 percent since typically a large share o f eamings are distributedto stockholders rather
than allocated to capital reserves.

20.     Onthe denominator side o fthe CARratio, the adjustment to Risk Weighted Assets
(RWAthe denominator) entails valuing loan assets collateralizedby real estate/mortgage
properties at 100percent risk versus 50 percent, thus increasing the riskiness o f the asset
andreducing the CAR. This adjustment i s based on intemational standards which dictate
that only residential mortgage assets have a lower risk o f 50 percent but all other
mortgages have full 100percent risk for weighting purposes. The adjustment i s also
based on the reality o f the difficulty o f collecting and liquidating collateral inParaguay
and thus the needto discount its value based on elapsed time for collection. The
adjustment could be considered strict, and perhaps could understate capital, however, it i s
balanced by the fact that no calculation was carried out to estimate capital requirements
for risks other than credit risks, such as market risks. The result i s that there i s an
important decrease from the reported CAR ratio. For banks inaggregate, this reduces the
reported risk weighted CARby almost 8.0 points.". This effect i s different across
different groups o fbanks with the most significant decrease affecting the state bank,
BNF.


2o InParaguay the current minimumlegal CAR requirement is 10, although Law 861permits setting it ina
range between 8 and 12. This analysis excludes finance companies which represent 10% of the banking
 system.


                                                 80

Loan Portfolio Adjustments

21. The following analysis compares additional adjustments:

22.   Adjustment 1: Value of Collateral in Lieu of Provisions: This adjustment addresses
the common practice o fusingcollateral as a substitutefor loanprovisions. The
assumption i s that the collateral i s liquid and can be executed promptly. However, since
collateral (usually real estate) particularly inParaguay, due to both economic andjudicial
factors, i s effectively not liquid, this adjustment increases loan loss provision
requirements based on appropriate downward adjustment to collateral based on the
criteria described below.

23.    Financial statements are usedto obtain the shares o f collateral types such as
mortgages, monetary collateral and other types. These shares are applied to each loan
risk category (1to 5) as reportedbythe entities. The allowance for collateral instead of
provisions i s considered based on the following criteria: 100percent allowed for
monetary collateral; 50 percent for mortgage collateral; and 0 percent for others (e.g.:
automobiles, equipment, etc.). The rationale for considering 50 percent for mortgage
collateral i s based on estimates o f 3 years (based on Paraguayan experience) for
executing and collecting the value o fmortgage collateral. By utilizing as a discount rate
the nominal interest rate indomestic currency (which approximates the weighted
domestic interest rate for credits over one year inmaturity and adds administrative costs)
the presentvalue o fthe collateral declines to under 50 percent.

24.    Adjustment 2: Provisioningfor Refinanced Loans: This adjustment addresses
provisioning increases for renewed,refinanced and restructured loans. As most o f these
loans are classified incategory 1(`Pass') but are likely refinanced andrestructured from
previous non-performing loans or loans havingpaidthe minimumto avoid `non
performance' ,the adjustment conservatively places them into category 3 (substandard)
which would require 20 percent inloss provisions. The same collateral adjustments as
above are made. Inaddition, since prior interest accrual reversals andprovisioning for
principal may have not been effected after the loans were refinanced, it i s estimated that
there exists a 30 percent level o f under-provisioning underlyingthese loans based on
those which they refinanced. These two adjustments add a requirement o f 50 percent in
provisions for the refinanced portfolio This adjustment and the prior one for collateral
                                           ,
value has a very significant for all groups o fbanks, lowering the overall capital adequacy
ratio by 7 percentage points for both factors combined.

25.    Adjustment 3: Inclusion of Generic Provisions: This adjustment adds a generic
provision o f 1.5 percent to category 1 loans, and increases provisions for loans in
category 2 from 1percent to 10 percent. This adjustment i s based on international
practices. The result i s not very significant and from this effect alone. The effect might
be slightly less since Basle standards allow up to 1.25 percent o f generic provisions
(category 1) to be counted as second tier capital, therefore, such an amount would not
reduce the banks' available capital.




                                               81

26.   Adjustment 4: Repossessedproperties and Deferred charges. Repossessed
properties are includedat a 50 percent value following a similar rationale usedfor
mortgage collateral. Some deferredcharges are reversedat 100percent giventhat they
reflect incurred losses which are being amortized. The adjustments are not very
significant interms o f this effect on the adjusted CAR for the banking system.

27.   Aggregate effect - Sum of initial Risk Weighted Capital Adjustments plus effects of
Adjustments 1 through 4: This takes into account all the reported provisions and the
deficit over the estimated minimumrequirementsbased on the above methodology. In
sum, the effect o fall the adjustments is significant for all groups. These cumulative
adjustmentslower the effective capital asset ratio for the banking system to levels
requiringcareful monitoringparticularly for a small set ofbanks which could be
vulnerable to additional shocks. The most significant effects o f the sum o f these
adjustment are for BNF. Other effects requiringfollow up are observed for banks
established inParaguay and also local domestic banks.

Off-Site Surveillance

30.   The following processes are beingconsidered to strengthenthe off-site surveillance
activities o f SB inorder to enhance its overall efficiency and capacity:

            Having a separate component for surveillance inthe SB's Institutional
            Development Plan (IDP), including training;
            Adopting a surveillance policy aligned to a new proposed supervisory
             strategy;
            Revisingas necessary surveillance procedures (manual and work papers);
            Performing book adjustments per examination before ratio analysis takes
            place;
            Developing a methodology to combine quantitative and qualitative measures;
             Standardizing a uniform bank performance report and ratio analysis system;
             Developing further waming systems (dynamic, stress, proxy early indicators);
             Coordinating as a policy matter, the monitoring, examination, and
             enforcement activities;
             Using a risk rating profile to anchor the coordinationpolicy;
             Developing processes to compile and compare qualitative management
             reviews;
             Staffing the surveillance function satisfactorily and train analysts to supervise;
             Forming a rating committee coordinating surveillance and examination
             functions;
        m) Consolidating supervisoryresponsibilitybynominating account managers.

Institutional Capacity and Modus Operandi

31. Inorder to successfully implement the above standards, the following are
considered to strengthen operating policies andprocedures o f supervision inorder to
enhance its overall efficiency and capacity:


                                              84

         a) Adopting a multiyear institutional development program (IDP) for SB;
         b) Havinga sub-IDP for each function: examination, surveillance, enforcement;
         c) Adopting a supervisory strategy that discriminates risk profile among
             institutions;
         d) Adopting core policies for each function (licensing, on-site, enforcement,etc.);
         e) Discriminating (cycle, frequency, extension, tools) as per risk profiles;
         f, Reviewingandreformingprocedures ofeach function (licensing, off/on-site,
             etc.);
         g) Linkingsupervisory functions by means o f a risk profile ratingmethodology;
         h) Estimating supervisionwork load(monitoring, examination, visitation);
         i) Staffingmajorfunctionstoadequatelevelsfordealingwithworkload;
        j) Training staffinimplementingnewpolicies andprocedures andraterisk
             profiles;
         k) Providingresident advice alongthe duration ofthe multiyear IDP.

32.    Interms ofthe signalingto thepublic regardingoverall bankinghealth, the reform
o f the BankingLaw also includes the elimination o f the obligation for the BCP and the
SB to makepublic the classification ofbanks as currently required. Forcing SB to rate
banks publicly crates unduepressure on SB, brings information o f little value to the
general public that can destabilize the system and, under stress, forces the SB to collude
against transparency. Thus, under the proposed legal reform, bank ratings by the SB will
bekept as internal information o fthe BCP and SB. While amore reliable rating index is
developed which should include a larger weight with respect to bank management
quality, the SB will only publisha set o f standard financial ratios including those relating
to overall exposure, asset performance andprudential indicators for each bank, but
without consolidating these indicators into a single artificial rating index as i s currently
done. This will provide more transparent information which the market can use to assess
bank quality. Inthe meantime, banks will also be required to obtain and disseminate
`ratings givenby intemationally recognizedrating agencies.

 33.    Other institutional issues to ensure the transparency o f operations at the BCP,
besidesthe above mentioned areas, include improving intemal controls (as per IMF
 safeguards assessmentbeing conducted) and carrying out external audits o f the BCP
 every year versus the bi-annual cycle currently ineffect.


               e. Lender of Last Resort Facilities and Emergency Liquidity

Lender of Last Resort Facilities

 34.    While seldom usednow following BCP's losses duringprior bankingcrises, the
 criteria and policy for the use o f LOLR short term facilities as well as BCP credit under
 supervisedrehabilitation plans, became substantially stricter under more recent norms
 implemented,to avoid easy accessbybanks with highpotential for insolvency. The
 current policies and facilities available include inaddition to the call money facility: (i)a
 short term facility for credits between 1-10 days in a 30 day period; (ii)  a `safety net'
 facility for credits up to 60 days within a 180days period (but renewable for an additional


                                              85

90 days in exceptional circumstance); and (iii)longer term `rehabilitation' facility for
                                                 a
credits potentially up to a maximum o f 5 years. The interest rate on these facilities i s
based on a 2 percent spread over an average o f outstanding Central Bank billrates or call
money rates. Required collateral for the credits includes Government or BCP paper,
other liquidnegotiable securities or IOUs. The BCP i s considering, to avoid moral
hazard, that the interest rate charged on these LOLR facilities bebased on a spread above
the market rate, and that IOUs be excluded as collateral guarantees which should be
limitedto very low risk negotiable securities.

Market Based Liquidity Instruments and Constraints

35.     The interbank market inParaguay is limitedand mostly relationship based. The
size and frequency o f interbank flows, however, can be good indication o f how the
market qualifies its memberbanks, since weak banks are generally cut off from access to
this credit. However, the direction and size o f flows inthis market has not yet beenused
systematically to monitor and provide early warning indicators o f potential bank
illiquidity as well as insolvency. Nevertheless, liquiditytransfer mechanisms are
crucially neededinthe Paraguayan financial system, particularly at this time.

36.     Besides the limitedinterbank market, there are very few liquidity facilities
available inthe money market. The Central Bank's call money facility and the extremely
limitedrep0 market are some options, but the process o f collateralizing such short term
facilities still requires more streamlining to make them effective and widespread
instruments. The short term corporate paper market is practically non-existent, with the
fixed income money market beingpredominantly drivenby an active primary market in
Central Bank bills (monetary regulatiodopen market instruments) for which there i s a
very limited secondary market. The current stock o f Government (BCP) bills outstanding
i s about $266 millionwhich represents 40 percent o fbanking system usable liquidity
(i.e., cash and liquid assets excluding reserve requirements) and 12percent o f total bank
assets.

Actions under the Reform Agenda

37.     To ensure that modernized safety net mechanisms are inplace for the provision o f
liquidity and the prompt payment of depositors, the Government's reform agenda
includes modifications to legislationcovering ina numbero fkey areas:

38.     While not a traditional LOLR issue, the authorities are concerned about financial
system instability duringperiods o f currency devaluation, not only on account o f dollar
denominated loans which may default, but also from potential currency runs and
withdrawal o f deposits from the system, includingdollar denominated deposits. Such
instances demand a sufficient cushion o f resources to avoid financial system collapse.
The Government cannot rely on a constant source o f contingent international credit
(either commercial or multilateral) to affront such circumstances, andthe Central Bank
cannot and should not utilize its own resources or international reserves as an automatic
response mechanism as has been used inthe past. However, the Government and the
Central Bank will reexamine its reserves policy for bank deposits, to permit additional


                                             86

flexibility for increasing dollar deposit reserve requirementsfor use as a potential supply
o f emergencyliquidity.

39.    By subsequently reducing such reserve requirements or utilizingthe stock of
reserves duringperiods of devaluation induced stress, banks will be able to protect their
balance sheets untilsuch macro financial tensions stabilize. Inthis regard, under
systemically vulnerable situations, the CentralBank would be able to release liquid funds
by lowering an already raiseddollar reserve requirement,without having to access its
own resources or assume additional debt (which at times may simply be unavailable).
Underthe reform program, the Government will develop the criteria underwhichreserve
requirements could be adjusted to affront such situations, as part o f its crisis response tool
kit.

40.    Underthe newBanking ResolutionandDeposit Insurance law, the provision o f
emergency liquidity facilities i s contemplated inthe event o fsystemic-wideJinanciaZ
crises. Insuch instances, and with the consent o f the President o f the Republic, the
Central Bank and the Finance Ministrywould present a contingency plan for illiquid but
solvent entities, allowing temporary regulatory forbearance and the availability o f
additional liquidity facilities. The measures permissibleunder such crises scenarios
would include (a) full coverage o f deposits to prevent systemic runs, (b) increase inthe
Government contribution towards the deposit insurance fund, (c) lengthening o f the
elapsed times and triggers normally requiredfor bank corrective action programs, (d)
case by case exemption o f intervention and resolution o f entities considered temporarily
illiquid, (e) increase inthe credit facilities offered bythe Central Bank, (f) imposing
timelines for meetingstandard prudential requirements during and after crisis periods,
and (8) setting up a temporary fimd for strengthening o f the banking system, with the sole
objective o f recapitalizingviable institutions andbringing stability and continuity to
banking operations.

  f. Specificationof Early CorrectiveActions and SecuritizationMechanismsunder
                               the New BankResolutionProcedures

41,    The reforms to enhance the prompt corrective actions regime and which would
precede the stage o fbank resolution inorder to steer banks toward a sounder financial
condition before considering asset carve out, will include:

       (i)Thedevelopmentofasetofqualitativeindicatorsoffaultybankmanagement
practices, and associating each indicator with a set o f sanctions and fines to be applied.
Since weak, faulty or purposeful deficient management generally i s an accurate early
indicator o fpotentialbank problems, the regulation and establishment o f a schedule o f
corrective actions associated with specific fines inthis area, will help to reverse negative
trends at an early stage, while insuringcompliance due to the associated monetary
penalties.21 Along with the already existing schedule o f corrective actions for the
exceedance of prudential limits, the SB will implementa matrix o f corrective actions and
penalties covering boththe quantitative and qualitative (management performance) areas.
*' Itshould be noted that fines already exist for exceedance of lending and other limits, but such fines are
limitedto quantifiable financial indicators but not to qualitative assessments of deficient management.


                                                    87

      (ii)ThecurrentrequirementfortheBCP'slegaldepartmenttopreparelegal
documents before invoking compliance from the industry, while intendedto provide
more `force and legality' to the application o f sanctions for inducing corrective action,
has can at times result indelays since the legal processes take time to be finalized and
documented, and months can elapse before formal sanctions are communicated. Since
thebanking law itself does not requirethis step and allows the BCP to directly mandate
action under threat o f sanction, this paperwork stage will bereformulatedto expeditethe
quick reversal of identifiedproblems. The application o f sanctions under most cases
duringthe SB's ongoing supervision work as well as duringits supervisionunder the
Vigilance regime, will also be further delegated directly to the SB by the BCP's Board o f
Directors.

42.   Once the resolution regime i s invoked the asset/liability carve outs would be
carried out for purchase and assumption by sound banks. To facilitate this strategy, the a
priori securitization o f loan assets would permit purchasingbanks to count on
overcollateralization o f the value o f the loan-backed security which would facilitate its
acquisition along with matching deposits. The structure o f the securitization scheme for
this purpose, is illustratedbelow:
                                             Figure3

                 g. Strategy for Management of Residual Liquidations

Bank Closure and Liquidation of Non Performing Assets

43.    On assessing the desired separation o f duties, a key differentiation mustbe made
betweenthe functions o fbank resolutionhestructuring with deposit insurance operations,

                                              88

and those pertaining to collection o f non-performing loans and/or liquidation o f
underlyingassets. The latter function, i.e, the management ofthe residual "bad bank" is
not a function of the new restructuringhesolutionprocess established under this reform
program, and should not bemixedwith that function. This i s because the resolution
process works on short term restructuring arrangements while the `collectiordliquidation'
function i s longer term and drawn out and usually subcontracted.

44.   InParaguay, the experience since the bankingcrises of 1995-98hasbeento
contract individual liquidation experts to collect and/or dispose o f loan portfolios o f
closed banks. The strategy o f the Government initiallywas to hire individual liquidation
experts and compensate them based on a percentage o fproceeds collected. However, this
practice hadsome obstacles for two reasons: (i) some cases, the collection o f bad loans
                                                  in
andthe disposal of assets was done usingcreative `financial engineering' methodswhich
technically liquidated assets with non cash instruments(e.g.: bonds to maturity) but did
not actually recover the promised amounts inpresent value terms, and (ii) assigning
                                                                              by
liquidators to individual banks some o f which were inworse shape than others, the
variable percentage commissions were not profitable in some cases and resulted in a non-
viable recovery effort. Subsequently the SB modified the contractual terms o f liquidators
so that their compensation was based on fixed sums or fixed monthly payments. This
system,however,is still beingtweaked; while attractingmore professional liquidators, it
sometimes reduces their incentives to recover and collect funds quickly and thus
liquidations became protracted, sometimes spanning over 3 years or more. Judicial
impediments also prevent assets from beingliquidated at "fire sale" prices.

45.   A key ingredientfor an effective mechanism settle liquidation sales o f assets, is the
establishment o f a centralizedregistryo f collateral assets. An effective registry should be
supported by a comprehensive property titling effort to ensure that all available usable
collateral i s documented as a mechanism to help promote credit access. A central
collateral/guarantee registry for the financial sector, along with the upgrading o f property
assessment/valuation standards would constitute a primary institutional tool to improve
the efficiency and criteria for settling debt, bankruptcy and liquidation issues. As a
mediumterm issue relatedto the use o freal collateral, the Governmenthas considered a
program to register and provide formal title to property owners inParaguay so as to
increase access to credit via the provision o f guarantees such as collateral backing.

Actions under the Reform Agenda

46.    The function o fmanagingthe residual "bad bank" will not be a responsibility of the
restructuringh-esolution process or o f the SB proper, andwill not be mixedwith that
function. Underthe agenda o fthe Government's reform effort, and to ensure the proper
incentives inthe recovery o f assets, the liquidation process will and its institutional set up
will be reexamined with the objective o f considering alternative options to align
incentives for maximizing proceeds within short time periods:

       (i)    Where significant size portfolios are managed, options for compensationto
liquidators will be considered as variable commissions related to proceeds recovered at
cash value. Such a modality would provide the best incentives to assure performance in
this task. Inorder for the SB to maintain increased control against creative financial

                                            89

engineeringand accounting arrangements to demonstrate asset recovery, while not
encumbering its staff by managing such operations directly (as at present), the SB will
approve final transactions to liquidate collateral for example, when such transactions
utilize securities with unclear market values. Inthis context, the "property assessment"
service industryinParaguay has undergone a significant upgrading o f standards
established by the SB to ensure consistent and fair valuation o f underlying collateral
assets usedto price non cash recoveries.

       (ii)  The biddingsystemto obtain offers from liquidators will consider proposals
from firms to oversee an entire portfolio o f assets from many banks under liquidation,
rather than limitingthe systemto utilizing individual liquidators for individual banks.
This will, besides generating business efficiencies and better diversification o fportfolio
risks for non-performing assets, permit a more viable implementation o f the variable
(percent-based) commission as the primary compensation mechanism linkedto
recoveries.

       (iii)Theassetrecoveryprocesswillimmediatelybetransferredtodirectjudicial
bankruptcyproceedings while providing flexibility to the liquidating firm to sell portions
o f the loan asset portfolio for a fee to interested banks, when such assets are considered to
beviable interms ofproducing some minimumeamings retums. Such a modality o f
`recovery' will supplement the traditional collection mechanismbased on the sole
liquidation o f the underlying loan collateral.

       (iv) Liquidation contracts will also beginincluding exit clauses for the
Government including contractual time limits and expiration dates which will allow the
BCP and the SB to delink from the direct management o fthe process and replace firms
which do not perform or have not met minimumtargets within a specified period.

against(v)lawsuits by creditors o fthe failed banks (who would wish to maximize the value
             Inorder to ensure afair andtransparent process, as well as to protect theBCP

o frecoveries and wait until a buyer `shows up'), a triple consecutive auction system will
be considered for usage under liquidator contracts. This will help so that the value o f
collateral gooddassets which are difficult to sell on the market, are offeredauctioned in
three consecutive stages (each time lowering the auction `reserve' price) to ensure that
the final purchase offer received fully reflects existing market demand.

47.    Inorder to support the efficient useofthe above mechanisms, the Govemment will
implementa new centralizedregistryo fproperty appraisers based on recentregulations
set forth to value collateral underlyingbanking assets so as to support more streamlined
procedures for bank resolution and liquidation.

     IMP ExecutiveBoardCompletesThird Review UnderParaguay'sStand-By
                                        Arrangement

        The ExecutiveBoard o fthe International Monetary Fund(IMF) today completed
the thirdreviewunder an SDR 50 million (about US$76.2 million) Stand-By
Arrangement for Paraguay, originally approved on December 15,2003 for 15 months
(see Press Release No. 03/218), and granted an extension o f the arrangement by six
months,through September 30,2005.

        Incompletingthereview,the ExecutiveBoardalso grantedthe Paraguay
authorities' request for waivers o f the nonobservance o f two quantitative performance
criteria and two structural performance criteria, and the modification o f four performance
criteria.

        The remaining amounts available underthe arrangement were also rephasedin
four equal tranches inan amount equivalent to SDR 3 million each (about US$4.6
million). However, Paraguay has not made any drawings under the arrangement so far,
and the authorities have indicatedthat they continue to treat the arrangement as
precautionary.

        Following the Executive Board's discussion o fParaguay's economic performance,
Mr.TakatoshiKato, DeputyManaging Director andActing Chair, stated:
"Paraguay's macroeconomic performance has improved significantly under the program
supported by the Stand-By Arrangement. Economic growth has been sustained in2004
despite a drought, inflation has declined significantly, international reserves have
increased, and the exchange rate has stabilized.

        "Overall, Paraguay has performed well underthe program. Onthe structural side,
the authorities have approved keypieces o f economic legislationover the last 12months,
including the fiscal adjustment law, the customs code, the bank resolution law, and the
publicpensionreform law. The authorities will needto press ahead with the reform
agenda inorder to reduce unemployment andpoverty, which remain stubbomly high.
"Reform o fpublic banks remains a critical component o fthe program. It i s important that
this process move forward expeditiously, andthat the authorities carefully monitor
lending by the public banks inthe run-upto their reform inorder to prevent the
resumption o f unsustainablelendingpractices.

        "Fiscal policy has been placed on a sustainable path and the authorities' 2005
program i s aimed at maintaining this improvedperformance. The fiscal outlook has
improved significantly following the improvements intax administration and the
approval o fthe fiscal adjustment law. Tax collections have increased while expenditures
have beenkept incheck, although capital outlays remainlow. The government has
eliminated sizable arrears and taken decisive steps toward normalizing relations with all
creditors. The stock o fpublic debt i s now on a declining trend. For 2005, the authorities
intendto pursue abalanced overallbudget, with higher projectedrevenues allowing for a
significant increase incapital expenditure inneededinfrastructure. It will be important to
have mechanisms inplace to limit expenditure to programmedlevels, and to ensure that
investment spending supports highquality projects.

       "Monetary policy has been effective incontaining inflation while allowing for rapid
reserve accumulation. However, monetary management has beencomplicatedby large
capital inflows, which threatened to generate rapid monetary expansion or a sharp
appreciation o f the currency. Inorder to minimize these risks, the central bank has
pursued an active sterilization policy while accumulating international reserves. In2005
the authorities intendto use interest rate and exchange rate policies more flexibly inorder
to stabilize inflation," Mr.Kat0 said.

                        Statement by IMF Staff Mission to Paraguay

       The following statement was issuedinAsunci6n by an Intemational Monetary
Fund(IMF) staffmission:

       "A mission from the IntemationalMonetary Fund(IMF)visitedAsunci6n during
Februaryl-l1,2004 to conduct discussions for the fourth review under the Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA).The missionwas headed by Mr.Alejandro Santos and met with
Finance Minister Borda, Central Bank President Gonzilez, senior officials, as well as
business and legislative representatives. Considerable progress was made towards
completing the review and discussions are expected to continue inthe following weeks.

       "The missionwill conduct the final assessment o fthis review inWashington in
coming weeks. Some technical issues on the budget and aspects of the public banking
reform agenda are to be resolved.

       "The main findings o f the mission were: Macroeconomic performance was
 significantly better than anticipated in2004. Real GDP grew by almost 3 percent in2004,
the highestinalmost a decade. Inflation fell below 3 percent in2004, one o f the lowest in
 the region, andthe lowest inParaguay inmore than two decades. The fiscal accounts

                                            93

were insurplus for the first time ina decade and intemationalreserves are at record
highs.

      "The program i s broadly on track. The majority o f the program targets for end-
December 2004 were observed. An important target ahead i s the approval o f the second-
tier public banking law by at least one chamber o f Congress.

      "Progress was made on all elements o fthe structural reform agenda. Inparticular,
several important bankingbills were submittedto Congress, a commission was created to
design a restructuringplan for the first-tier public banks, additional external audits for
public enterprises were completed, the civil service reformwas advanced, and
preparations continue to finalize the domestic bond exchange.

      "The main challenges for 2005 will beto consolidate the macroeconomic gains o f
the recent past and to continue implementationo f the structural reform agenda. An
important objective for 2005 will be to maintain fiscal discipline while paying due regard
to social spending.Onthe structural side, while there are many challenges ahead, efforts
should be concentrated on implementingthe public banking reform agenda. The
agreements reached with civil society indesigning a development planwith equity are
important steps towards the consolidation o f a medium-term policy framework.

      "The missionwould like to take this opportunity to thank the authorities and the
citizens of Paraguay for their hospitality.
