The Bank must\n            be commended for piecing together an integrated rural\n            development project capable of providing such valuable\n            services and inputs as extension, cooperative training,\n            feeder roads and the monitoring of the incidence of\n            schistosomiasis. The primary shortcoming of the design came\n            as result of inadequate knowledge about the expected\n            response of the intended beneficiaries and the prevailing\n            soil condition in the proposed project area. In summary,\n            while inadequate knowledge at appraisal gave rise to much\n            problems for implementation, and given the complexities of\n            changing a large subsistence agriculture and the weakness of\n            national institutions, the project, as a case study, for\n            integrated agricultural development, was successful. The\n            lessons learned during the first phase implementation will\n            certainly provide much guidance for future planners."}, "docdt": "1984-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
