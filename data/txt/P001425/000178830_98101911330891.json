ha. of swamp rice, 3,000 ha.\n            of cocoa and 1,500 ha. of coffee through provision of farm\n            inputs on the basis of credit, extension services for crop\n            production and land development and assistance in processing\n            and marketing of crops. In addition the project would: (a)\n            construct or recondition 300 km of farm-to-market roads and\n            maintain 540 km; (b) establish farmer cooperatives; (c) help\n            establish banking facilities in the project area; (d)\n            improve agricultural research facilities at Suakoko; (e)\n            provide schistosomiasis surveillance and construct 300\n            village wells; (f) train Liberians and strengthen\n            institutional framework for agricultural development; and\n            (g) provide technical assistance for project preparation.\n            The project would establish a smallholder credit scheme to\n            provide: (a) development loans for coffee and cocoa and for\n            swamp rice; and (b) seasonal loans."}, "docdt": "1977-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
