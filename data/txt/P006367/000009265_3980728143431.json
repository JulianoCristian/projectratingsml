project sustainability\n            was likely, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the modus operandi of Salvador Metropolitan\n            Development Agency (CONDER) in developing partnerships is\n            worth highlighting. It was apparently, effective in inter\n            agency communications as well as informal consultation and\n            participation, and selling itself with credibility through\n            the delivery of promises made to the community, was a very\n            important ingredient for success. Staff continuity in CONDER\n            throughout the life of the project was very important. The\n            other important lesson is the way the State created an\n            enabling environment for the private sector. Both in the\n            historic center as well as in the various rehabilitation of\n            urban park, the state provided the public infrastructure,\n            and invited the private sector to invest in construction, or\n            alternatively in leasing and operating a number of\n            facilities (food, recreation, etc.)."}, "docdt": "1998-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
