Some lessons learned included: In order to\n            ensure the sustainability, as a medium term development\n            objective, of built assets, mechanisms to allocate\n            sufficient funds or establish a maintenance fund should be\n            effectively designed, especially in environments where\n            decentralization efforts are lagging. Also, it seems that a\n            regionalized large infrastructure program such as this one\n            are best suited in an environment where the capacity of the\n            local government is sound and devolution of authority is\n            real. In the end, and understandably, the emphasis in this\n            project was always on the completion of the large building\n            programs under institutional, budgetary and time pressures\n            rather than on the sustainability of these assets after\n            handover. The project did not put enough emphasis in\n            effective training in infrastructure management, operation\n            and maintenance of local government staff, as was\n            underscored by the reduction of funding devoted to these\n            activities. Local governments, on the other hand, did not\n            allocate funds to these training activities. Capacity\n            building in infrastructure management can only be effective\n            when based on a sound analysis of the incentives and\n            capacity of the local government, to which assets are to be\n            handed over. It is recommended that in the future, local\n            governments will allow for funding of capacity building\n            programs in their medium term development plans to acquire\n            the proper skills in infrastructure management."}, "docdt": "2012-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
