MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPHENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED WAN TO INDIA
FOR A NINTH TELECOMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to India for $345 million
is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be at the standard
variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years, including five years'
grace. Most of the loan (about $247 million) would be channelled to the
Department of Telecommunications (DOT) as part of the Government of India's
(GOI) capital-at-charge, on which DOT pays a dividend at a rate fixed by
GOI, currently 8% p.a. The balance of the loan (about $98 nillion) would
be relent to the Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) on commercial
terms of 15 years, including three years' grace, at not less than 13% p.a.
GOI would bear the foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
Background
2.        !-ith 3.2 million connected direct exchange lines (DELs) as of
March 31, 1986, India's average telephone density of 0.4 DELs per 100
population is among the lowest in Asia. Lines in service met 75% of
expressed demand (DELs plus registered applicants), down from 85% in 1980,
while the average waiting time increased from about 2-1/2 years to 3-1/2
years, as the 7.5% p.a. network growth failed to match the 10% p.a. demand
growta. In almost all categories, the quality of service is inadequate,
with high call failure rates and subscriber complaints.
3.        The poor state of telecommunications in India is due primarily
to: (a) severe underinvestment in the sector, averaging only 0.2% of GDP
since FY74, whereas 0.4%-0.7% is generally needed for rapid development;
(b) GOI's hitherto self-reliant and public-sector-monopoly oriented
industrial and technological development policies, making DOT's progress
largely contingent upon that of domestic equipment manufacturers; and (c)
DOT's organizational culture, with regulations, centralization and
procedures unsuited for a high-technology sector, and poor staff motivation
*         resulting from low salaries, lack of performance incentives, and promotion
by seniority, which frustrate DOT's many competent and conscientious
staff.
4.        In the past few years, the sector's problems and their causes,
and the implications for India's overall economic development, have
received considerable attention in India. In response, a series of
technological, institutional and investment measures are being undertaken
or planned, to: (a) raise public confidence, by improving the quality of
service; (b) slow the growth of unsatisfied demand by accelerating network
expansion; (c) extend telecommunications in rural areas, to meet economic,
medical, and social objectives; (d) introduce new services for business
users; and (e) raise off-budget the necessary financial resources for (a)
to (d) above, including through sale of bonds.



-2-
5.        During the Sixth Plan (1980-85), DOT achieved only 65% of its
targets for incremental telephone exchange capacity and DELs, and 45%-50%
for long-distance facilities. In preparationi for the Seventh Plan, an
interagency committee estims-ed that an investment of $11.2 billion (ir.
constant 1985 prices) was required to reduce waiting time for a telephone
line to within one year, and to achieve satisfactory service quality.
However, given GOI's overall budget constraints, and reservations about
DOT's capacity to implement that large a program, DOT is expected to be
allowed a total investment of only $4.9 biliion, which would nevertheless
increase the percentage of public sector investment in the sector from 2.5%
to 3.1%, and raise the network growth rate to 8.7% p.a. The program would
be financed about 50% from internal DOT and MTNL cash generation, 20% from
the sale of MTNL bonds, and 15% each from foreign and GOI loans.
6.        In an important institutional reform, DOT was separated from the
Department of Posts in 1985. MTNL was established in April 1986 as a
public sector corporation to operate the Bombay and Delhi networks. Most
telecommunications equipment is manufactured domestically by three public
sector enterprises (PSE's). To promote competition and greater reliability
of supply, GOI now permits the manufacture of telecommunications equipment
by the private sector for subscriber equipment and cables, and joint (51%
public) sector for all equipment, and DOT has begun to adjust its domestic
procurement practices accordingly.
Project Objectives
7.        The project, which represents about 40% of DOT's five-year
investment program, would help meet the growing demand for
telecommunications services and improve the quality of these services,
through the expansion and upgrading of the telephone and telex networks in
Bombay, Delhi, Madras and Calcutta (which contain about 34% of the
country's DELs and generate about 47% of total revenues), and the
long-distance links between them. The effective operation of the system in
these high-traffic areas is critical for the viability of the entire
domestic network; furthermore, the improved efficiency and profitability
resulting from these investments will ease the overall financial
constraints on the sector. Quality of service will be improved under the
project through the introduction of new digital transmission and switching
equipment and of a long-distance network management system, and close
monitoring of quality of service indicators.
Project Description
8.        The project comprises all the investments in the four
metropolitan cities during the Seventh Plan, plus the new long distance
links between them, a long distance network management system, a training
component and consultancy services. The main project components are:
(a) Installation of local and long distance transmission
facilities (including optical fiber and digital microwave



-3-
systems), within and between the four metropolitan networks
of Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi and Madras, together with local
and long distance telephone and telex switching facilities
and associated urban cable networks, subscriber plant and
buildings, to increase telephone exchange capacity in the
four metropolitan areas by about 1,000,000 local lines and
50,000 trunks, and telex exchange capacity by about 14,000
local and 1,000 transit lines.
(b)  (i) Modernization and expansion of domestic satellite earth
station networks;
(ii) Establishment of a packet switched data network among
the four metropolitan cities and other major cities and
industrial areas;
(iii) Establishment of a long distance network management
system including appropriate facilities, to improve traffic
flows by locating and bypassing or eliminating bottlenecks;
and
(iv) Introduction of automatic message accounting
facilities in the four metropolitan networks, to permit
detailed billing of subscriber trunk dialled calls.
(c) Support, together with UNDP, of a program for upgrading
five regional telecommunications training centers and
DOT/MTNL's manpower development.
(d) Provision of consultants' services for institutional
improvements in DOT (delegation of authority to field
units, and review of the planning and budgetting system),
and for design of (b)(iii) above.
9.        Total project cost, including contingencies but excluding $211
million in taxes and duties, is about $1,839 million, of which about $418
million and $411 million (totalling 45%) are direct and indirect foreign
exchange costs, respectively. The cost breakdown and financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursements, as well as the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events, and the status
of Bank Group operations in India are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map (IBRD No. 19634-IN) showing the project investments is
also attached. The staff appraisal report (No. 6260-IN) dated April 9,
1987 is being distributed separately.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
10.       Through its participation in the project, the Bank would support
GOI's efforts to address sectoral and project related issues, jy



-4-
(i) helping DOT/MTNL accelerate program implementation, by ensuring early
procurement actions on the project, and more streamlined DOT/MTNL
procurement procedures; (ii) supporting increased competition in the
domestic procurement of telecommunications equipment--an action plan for
this has been agreed upon; (iii) supporting measures for the institutional
development of both DOT and MTNL; and (iv) reviewing specific investment
programs to ensure that they are properly balanced.
Agreed Actions
11.       The following actions were agreed with Government, DOT and MTNL:
(a) DOT and MTNL would: (i) continue to take all action necessary to
expand competition in domestic procurement, in accordance with an agreed
action plan; and (ii) use commercial contracts for single source purchases
from PSEs effective by April 1, 1987; (b) for project studies (para 8(d)),
DOT would appoint consultants by September 30, 1987, with terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank, exchange views with the Bank on the
consultants' findings, and take appropriate action in accordance with a
timetable agreed with the Bank; (c) DOT and MTNL would review periodically
with the Bank their respective project implementation, service quality,
productivity anc financial performance, their future targets and actions
proposed to achieve them, and then take all measures necessary to achieve
these targets; (d) MTNL would review with the Bank the findings and
recommendations of its institutional consultants and then take actions on
the recommendation in accordance with an appropriate timetable; (e) the
audit reports on DOT and MTNL financial statements by an independent
aud'tor acceptable to the Bank would be provided to the Bank, within nine
months after the close of each fiscal year; (f) the rate of return on the
revalued assets of DOT and MTNL (consolidated) would not fall below 11%
p.a.; and (g) Bank funds (currently estimated at $98 million equivalent)
*ould be onlent to MTNL under a subsidiary loan agreement. Execution of
the agreement between GOI and MTNL would be a condition of loan
effectiveness.
Project Justification and Benefits
12.       Improved telecommunications are vital to support India's new
market-oriented liberalization policies, as the efficient functioning of
markets depends primarily on information flow. In this connection,
telecommunications are particularly essential for (a) export development,
which require reliable international telephone and telex, as well as good
connections to domestic suppliers, and (b) attracting foreign investment,
as reliable telecommunications is one of the main determinants of where
international firms invest. Improved telecommunications are equally
critical for India's emphasis on (a) rural development, especially for
providing essential support services, marketing local produce, and
substituting for expensive transportation, and (b) decentralization of
industry, as the absence of even basic telephone services makes it
difficult to attract entrepreneurs and technical staff to the rural areas,



-5-
and imposes heavy cost on production there. By focusing on the key
metropolitan cities and the long-distance network, the project will relieve
congestion, assist the development of these major centers and generate high
profits that will permit cross-subsidization of other economically and
socially important parts of the network. The institutional-strengthening
aspects will help maximize the benefits from the recent separation of Posts
l        and Telecommunications, and the establishment of MTNL.
13.       The projected financial and economic rates of return to the
entire investment program are 15% and 20% p.a., respectively. (The rates
of return for the project will be higher since the project is located in
the major revenue-generating areas of the network.) Sensitivity analysis
indicates that in the worst case scenario (20% cost increase, 20% benefit
decrease), the economic rate of return remains satisfactory at 12%.
Project Risks
14.       One risk is that DOT and MTNL will have difficulties with the
introduction of the new digital and optical fiber technologies. The
project training component is designed inter alia to provide support for
the installation and operation of these new technologies, and DOT has
high-quality technical staff. A second risk is that the institutional and
policy reforms will only be implemented very slowly. However, the new DOT
and MTNL managements are committed to the reforms, and other involved GOI
agencies are supportive. External consultants will assist in formulating
institutional improvement measures, and the Bank will monitor carefully
implementation of the institutional action program. A final risk is that
the domestic telecommunications equipment for the project would be
inadequate in quantity and quality. The expansion of competition in DOT's
domestic procurement, and the introduction of commercial contracts should
help in this regard. The Bank will closely monitor domestic equipment
manufacture and has indicated that further Bank lending to the
telecommunications sector beyond the proposed project would be contingent
on continued satisfactory progress in this area.
Recommendations
15.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
