Project\n            will help meet the growing demand for telecommunications\n            services and improve the quality of these services, through\n            the expansion and upgrading of the telephone and telex\n            networks in Bombay, Delhi, Madras and Calcutta and the\n            long-distance links between them.  To this end, the project\n            includes (a) installation of local and long distance\n            transmission facilities, within and between the four\n            metropolitan networks, together with local and long distance\n            telephone and telex switching facilities, associated urban\n            cable networks, subscriber plant and buildings.  It also\n            provides for (b) (i) modernization and expansion of domestic\n            satellite earth station networks; (ii) establishment of a\n            packet switched data network among the four metropolitan\n            cities and other major cities and industrial areas; (iii)\n            establishment of a long distance network management system\n            including appropriate facilities; and (iv) introduction of\n            automatic message accounting facilities in the four\n            metropolitan networks.  Lastly, the project entails (c)\n            support, of a program for upgrading five regional\n            telecommunications training centers and manpower\n            development; and (d) provision of consultants' services."}, "docdt": "1987-04-22T00:00:00Z"}
