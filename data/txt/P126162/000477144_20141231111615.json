      risk to development outcome. Both the Bank\u0092s and Borrower\u0092s\n            performances were satisfactory as well. There are no\n            recorded restructurings or major changes to this project.\n            Three key lessons were learned from this project and are as\n            follows: (1) The evolution of the core DPL program into\n            three sectoral operations resulted in increased government\n            ownership, a deeper Bank engagement on key topics, and an\n            improved focus on the Government\u0092s most current priorities.\n            This shift proved to be an effective strategy to advance the\n            Government\u0092s reform program. (2) The extensive analytical\n            work and technical assistance on poverty alleviation, shared\n            prosperity, and PFM prior to the DPL were critical in\n            identifying the reform program. (3) The presence of a strong\n            government counterpart to serve as coordinator was an\n            important success factor in a loan involving multiple institutions."}, "docdt": "2014-10-22T00:00:00Z"}
