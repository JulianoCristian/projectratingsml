1.          Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1.        Context at Appraisal

1.       At the time of the first and second INSTANSI DPLs, the overall macroeconomic
situation and policy framework warranted the WBG’s continued support for
Indonesia’s structural and institutional reforms. Economic growth was moderating and
projected to stabilize at a pace more commensurate with a sustainable current account deficit
in light of tighter external financing conditions. The key risk was that external funding needs
continued to place a strain on the rupiah or reserves due to continued weakening in key export
commodity prices, or weak net inward investment dynamics, requiring additional monetary
policy tightening that dented confidence and further crimped growth. The risks of such a
scenario turning into a loss of macroeconomic stability were mitigated by generally
responsive policy framework to address macroeconomic imbalances. Policy buffers, albeit
somewhat eroded, remained generally ample. Most importantly, the solid structural
underpinnings of resilient growth remained intact, suggesting a favorable medium-term
outlook for Indonesia.

2.       Indonesia proved resilient to the 2008/09 global financial crisis and fared better
economically and socially than many of its neighbors. GDP growth declined from 6.0
percent in 2008 to 4.6 percent in 2009, but quickly recovered to pre-crisis levels of 6.5
percent in 2011. There were few reports of layoffs. Poverty and unemployment rates
continued to fall and relatively strong household spending power continued to support
growth. This resilience was attributable to strong economic conditions and policy buffers
going into the crisis and Indonesia’s relatively low direct dependence on external demand
compared to its regional peers. However, Indonesia remained susceptible to external shocks
through the financial channel given its growing external financing needs (exceeding FDI) and
significant foreign investor participation in its relatively shallow domestic bond and equity
markets.

3.       The national poverty rate fell to 11.4 percent in 2013, resulting from Indonesia’s
sustained economic growth, but the rate of reduction could have been higher. Since
recovering from the Asian Financial Crisis, Indonesia’s national poverty rate has halved from
24 percent in 1999 to 12 percent in 20121. In 2010, 18 percent of households in Indonesia fell
below the international benchmark for extreme poverty set at PPP$1.25 per day (as calculated
by PovcalNet), though national extreme poverty rate fell from 9.39 percent in 1999 to 3.70
percent in 2012. Despite sustained strong economic growth, the rate of poverty reduction was
slowing. The 0.5 percentage point fall in poverty between 2011 and 2012 was the smallest
decline in the past six years. One of the reasons for the slowing rate of poverty reduction was
that the poverty basket inflation was considerably higher than both headline and core
inflation. Based on the 2013 poverty line of IDR 271,600 per person per month, about 28
million Indonesians, out of the current population of 246 million, still lived below the poverty
line. Approximately half of these households could be considered as being chronically poor,
or      consistently     measured       as     poor      in    three       consecutive    years.

4.       Over the three years before the second INSTANSI DPL, a quarter of all
Indonesians had been in poverty at least once despite the falling poverty rate. In 1999, 39
percent of households lived below the official near-poor line of 1.2 times the poverty line.
This fell to 23 percent by 2012. As of March 2012, about 55 million people lived below the
official near-poor line of IDR 298,400 per person per month, and 94 million Indonesians lived
below 1.5 times the poverty line of IDR 373,000 per person per month. This bottom 40

1   Indonesia’s national poverty line is the weighted average of the provincial urban/rural poverty lines.

                                                                                                             1
percent of the population is highly vulnerable to small shocks, such as food price increases,
sending them into poverty. In fact, half of the poor in 2010 were not poor in 2009, with over
80 percent of them coming from the poorest 40 percent the year before.

5.        Female-headed households, in particular, experience much more volatile poverty
rates than the male-headed households. At the time of the second INSTANSI DPL, the
labor participation rate of women was substantially lower than that of men (Female: 51.2%;
Male: 76.3%; based on WB data), and there was a large gender wage gap with women
earning about 70 percent less than that of men. While poverty rates for female-headed
households (FHHs) and male-headed ones (MHHs) experienced a similar reduction during
the first decade of the 21st century, the FHHs poverty rate was much more volatile than of the
MHHs. This would suggest that FHHs interacted with labor markets differently than the
MHHs, faced different risks to income and consumption, or had differential access to coping
mechanisms and were less able to smooth consumption when shocks occurred. At the time of
both INSTANSI DPLs, the Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) was still high at 220 per 100,000
live births. There is a real risk that this key MDG target of 102 per 100,000 live births may
not be reached by 2015. Data also suggest that FHHs tend to adopt negative coping strategies
such as resorting to child labor. Despite tangible progress—gender parity in enrollment rates
at all levels of education—persistent gender disparities continue to be a challenge.

6.       The relatively low consumption growth of Indonesia’s poorest 40 percent, and
resulting inequality, may begin to adversely affect social and political cohesion. The Gini
coefficient fell from 0.33 in 1997 to 0.30 in 2000 as the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997/8
affected mostly the non-poor 2 . Since 2000, the Gini coefficient rose steadily to 0.41 by
20123, a level considered to be high by OECD standards, around average for lower middle
income economies, but high for the East Asian region. There is a strong public perception that
many more Indonesians are not well-off, and that growth has not been shared by all, which is
supported by data. Around half of the poor and vulnerable households do not receive major
social assistance programs, while half of the benefits go to the non-poor. There is some
evidence that inequities in access to social assistance have increased crime and decreased
social capital.

7.       At the time of both INSTANSI DPLs, some outcomes from the administration
showed protectionist tendency, generating concerns over Indonesia’s overall investment
climate and commitment to reforms. Following a decade of relatively successful political
and institutional reforms, Indonesia has emerged as a highly competitive and decentralized
electoral democracy. Despite some continuing political tensions, the administration
maintained its coalition structure and consensus-oriented approach overall. However,
concerns over some controversial policy moves, such as the elimination of foreign majority
ownership of mines, the banning of rattan exports to protect domestic furniture makers, the
restriction on imports of horticultural products, the tighter rules on establishing retail and
restaurant franchises to promote domestic businesses, and the restriction on mineral exports
have emerged. Such policy measures intensified in advance of the 2014 elections and were
viewed widely by the private sector and many stakeholders to be detrimental to Indonesia’s
investment climate.

8.      There have been other policymaking successes in government oversight. In
addition to the commissioners appointed to the new Financial Services Authority (OJK), very
sound candidates were appointed to the new leadership teams in the KPK and the General
Election Commission (KPU). The administration also succeeded in passing a new Law on
Land Acquisition Procedures for Public Interest Developments along with the implementing

9.      The first INSTANSI DPL supported the emphasis of the 2009-2012 Country
Partnership Strategy on strengthening Indonesia’s institutions and systems, a key cross -
sectoral engagement theme. The new generation of DPLs was expected to continue to build
on strong relationships with the reform-minded economic ministries and to support the
Central Government in strengthening its institutions and systems and was highlighted again in
the 2009-2012 Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report (CPSPR), issued in February
2011. The CPSPR recognized that the DPLs had helped the Government’s efforts in
improving the effectiveness and accountability of Central Government institutions and
systems under the long term objective of enhancing public financial management and
governance to increase the development impact of priority budget expenditures. Underpinned
by advisory and monitoring work, as well as institutional capacity-building in collaboration
with other development partners, DPLs had also supported key reforms in the areas of private
sector development, community development, and poverty alleviation.

10.      Following the deployment of single multi-sectoral DPLs since 2003, the
INSTANSI DPL series emerged as one of three sectoral DPLs that were requested by
the Government in 2012. While the core DPL program had demonstrated a solid track
record in key reform areas, given the deepening engagements in several priority areas, the
Government requested a series of three sectoral DPLs in 2012: (i) this INSTANSI DPL series
to focus on strengthening public financial management and enhancing poverty alleviation
efforts to improve the quality of spending; (ii) the Connectivity DPL to supported reforms to
reduce domestic logistics costs; and (iii) the FIRM DPL to focus on the financial sector and
investment climate. Such a sectoral approach was envisioned to maximize synergies across
the Bank’s program in Indonesia, further strengthen institutional ownership over the multi -
faceted reform programs and improve the targeting of complementary technical assistance
programs.

11.     The overall goal of the INSTANSI DPL series was to assist the Government of
Indonesia to achieve its medium-term growth, poverty reduction and shared prosperity
objectives, by supporting measures to enhance Indonesia’s capacity and institutions for
targeting poverty reduction measures, introducing a major social insurance program,
and enhancing the management of public finances for better service delivery. The key
outcome and results indicators are:

       The INSTANSI DPL series is expected to contribute to the following targeted outcomes by
       2014:
       (i) Greater integrity and more effective use and management of public funds (continued
           improvements in Central Government ministries and agencies [K/Ls] receiving an
           ‘unqualified’ audit opinion from 63 percent for FY2010 to 84 percent for FY2013;
           and with the percentage of total capital expenditure disbursed by end of Q2 increased
           from 18 percent in 2012 to 22 percent in FY2014);
       (ii) Strengthened GoI efforts to reduce poverty and vulnerability, through better informed
            and evidence-based policy and program decisions (with the percentage of social
            assistance programs in Central Government expenditure increasing from 3.3 percent
            in FY2011 to 4.5 percent in FY2013).

       The second INSTANSI DPL is expected to contribute to the achievement of the following
       results by mid-2014:


                                                                                               3
       (i) An expansion of targeted social assistance measures for the poor following an
           increase in the price of subsidized fuel prices, from 8.5 million households to 15.5
           million poor and vulnerable beneficiary households (about 70 million individuals)
           identified through the national registry (PPLS11);
       (ii) Implementation of a participatory mechanism through which communities can update
            beneficiary lists for the integrated social protection cards (KPS);
       (iii) Establishment of a main regulatory framework for implementing the national health
             insurance program;
       (iv) Improved budget transparency and planning by strengthening the use of the MTEF,
            with publication of the details in the 2014 budget;
       (v) More efficient and effective public financial management following the introduction
           of a Presidential regulation governing new procedures and the introduction of a new
           integrated budget and treasury system in 2014;
       (vi) Modernization of the core tax system through the establishment of individual e-filing
            for a ‘Simple Tax Return’ and ‘Very Simple Tax Return’ Forms in 2013.

12.        The INSTANSI DPL series has two main pillars:
           (i) Strengthening public financial management (PFM) through improvements in
               the medium-term results orientation of the budget process, the introduction of an
               enhanced automated budget and treasury system (SPAN) and ICT services,
               improved budget execution within Central Government, strengthened state assets
               management, improved Government accounting, audit, tax administration, and
               subnational fiscal management; and
           (ii) Enhancing poverty alleviation, service delivery and shared prosperity efforts
                through improved governance and institutional accountability, better
                measurement and targeting of the poor in social assistance programs, improved
                household-targeted poverty reduction programs, i.e. Jamkesmas, and community-
                based poverty reduction programs, i.e. the National Program for Community
                Empowerment (PNPM).

13.      The two-year programmatic INSTANSI DPL series aimed to contribute to the
Government of Indonesia’s medium term growth, poverty reduction and shared
prosperity objectives through two pillars: strengthening PFM and enhancing poverty
alleviation. The operation was in line with the recent two CPS periods and was delivered
within their one-year time frame as scheduled with INSTANSI 1 focusing more on the PFM
pillar and INSTANSI 2 on poverty alleviation. The following two tables showed eight prior
actions for INSTANSI 1 in 2012 and 10 triggers and adjustments for INSTANSI 2 in 2013
that were completed prior to negotiations. With the emphasis shifted to enhancing poverty
alleviation, the numbering of the two pillars was switched for INSTANSI 2. Furthermore,
INSTANSI 2 also acknowledged a set of benchmark actions which were not linked to DPL
disbursement. GoI requested these benchmark actions to be included as part of the DPL
policy dialogue and program document.

14.     Two triggers for INSTANSI 2—integrated baseline and policy review for budget
preparation and full implementation of an integrated budget and treasury information
system (SPAN)—were postponed to the next operation. More time would be needed to
integrate the work of DG Budget of the Ministry of Finance and Bappenas. Instead, the two
agencies worked on establishing a framework for the development of an integrated baseline
and policy review for 2015 budget preparation. SPAN is scheduled to be operational by end
of 2014, which may creep into early 2015. While there was steady progress in 2013 in the
development and testing of SPAN, the technical and managerial challenges encountered by
the MOF and its primary vendor resulted in significant delays in the user acceptance test and
subsequent roll out across Treasury offices.

                               as part of the compensation package for the
                               fuel price increase in June 2013. This new
                               prior action builds previous prior and
                               benchmark actions towards the development

                           and vulnerable households (PPLS11). Given
                           the dynamic movement of households in and
                           out of poverty, updating mechanisms are

                           targeting system. The Bank’s analytical work
                           found that communities are more effective in
                           identifying poorest households, which
                           provided the basis for developing the

2.2.       Major Factors Affecting Implementation

15.     The design and implementation of the two-year programmatic INSTANSI DPL
series was led by and based on GoI’s priorities following the three successfully
implemented DPL series that started in 2004. The two pillars of policy areas in the
INSTANSI series were continuation of the third DPL series (DPLs 7-8) with the remaining
areas spun off to two separate sectoral DPLs according to GoI’s preference: (i) the
Connectivity DPL which focused on reducing domestic logistics costs and strengthen
inclusive development; and (ii) the Financial Sector and Investment Climate Reform and
Modernization (FIRM) DPL which aimed to promote the development of a sound, efficient,
and inclusive financial sector to support improvements in the investment climate in Indonesia.
The following elements were conducive to the positive performance of both INSTANSI
operations.

          Strong GoI-Bank partnership in delivering the government’s overall
           development agenda. The Bank’s CPS for 2009-2012 and the current CPS for 2013-
           2015 were developed and aligned with the government’s overall development
           agenda. By the time of the first INSTANSI, the government had anchored its
           development agenda to four strategic objectives of pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-poor,
           and pro-green. The INSTANSI operations were accordingly designed with the
           following development plans as the backdrop: National Long-Term Development
           Plan for 2005-2025, Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN) 2010-2014, the
           Master Plan for Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesia’s Economic Development



                                                                                             10
           2011-2025 (MP3EI), and the Master Plan for the Acceleration and Expansion of
           Poverty Reduction (MP3KI).

          Lessons learned from the previous DPL Series. The INSTANSI operations
           continued from the previous three DPL series and benefited from a list of lessons
           learned. These included a set of basic engagement principles such as building robust
           engagements with key high-ranking, reform-minded counterparts, providing value-
           added propositions to sustain commitment, and connecting the policy dialogues
           directly with the Bank’s work programs. To ensure operational efficiency, the scope
           of the reforms supported was limited to maximize focused engagements.
           Accordingly, a more sectoral approach to DPL emerged and INSTANSI was the
           result.

          Stable financial, economic and political environment. Since the 1997-98 Asian
           financial crisis, Indonesia had undergone extensive “crisis recovery” reforms and a
           smooth political process that helped put in place an overall stable financial,
           economic, and political environment. Such stability allowed the Government to move
           forward with difficult medium-term reforms aimed at poverty reduction and
           strengthening institutions in the PFM area, i.e. the two policy pillars of the
           ISNTANSI operations.

2.3.       Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

16.       Following the previous DPL series, the INSTANSI operations were monitored
by continuous dialogue with government counterparts. The operations benefited from the
solid presence of Bank team members in the field, which allowed continuous close
monitoring of the supported reform actions. Complementary technical assistance and
analytical and advisory activities (AAA) also helped facilitate the M&E of the design and
implementation of the reform agenda. Specific, quantifiable indicators were identified for
each of the two pillars, with baseline and target data, which altogether formed a programmatic
results framework that was monitored by the Bank team and GoI counterparts through regular
meetings between GoI and development partners as well as through ongoing engagement with
agencies responsible for the various prior actions. The GoI established monitoring committees
and technical groups to ensure the implementation of agreed prior actions and to follow up on
progress.

17.     The Bank supports the Government’s ownership and commitment towards the
achievement of reform milestones through the INSTANSI series. Through technical
assistance and other financing instruments, the Bank supplements assistance through advisory
support to carry out the reforms. The Government also provides monitoring of progress
through its own agencies. Monitoring of progress by the Government is mostly done by the
Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs (CMEA). For public financial management, the
Public Financial Management Multi Donor Trust Fund (PFM MDTF), brings together key
development partners and provides a vehicle for effective and coordinated engagement that
reinforces the GoI’s PFM reform agenda and contributes to progress towards reform goals.
For the poverty reduction pillar, ongoing monitoring of the national poverty alleviation and
social assistance programs was conducted by the National Team for the Acceleration of
Poverty Reduction (TNP2K) and the Bank team supported through the Partnership for
Knowledge-based Poverty Reduction (PKPR) trust fund program. Other instruments to aid
monitoring include the Bank investment projects such as GFMRAP, PINTAR, and
STATCAP, which directly reinforce changes to the underlying institutional frameworks.

2.4.     Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any)

18.     The Government has decided not to continue with INSTANSI after two
operations. When INSTANSI 2 was presented, the government indicated a possibility of
extending the series from two to three years through 2014. However, due to the expected
change of government following the 2014 elections, the decision was taken to halt this
particular series.


3.       Assessment of Outcomes

3.1.     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1.   Relevance of Objectives

Rating: High

19.     The PDO remains highly relevant to the Government of Indonesia’s medium-
term growth toward poverty reduction and shared prosperity, and strengthened public
financial management for improved service delivery. The INSTANSI series continued the
previous DPL series. The series is in line with the Government’s Medium-Term Development
Plan (RPJMN) 2010-2014, and consistent with the Bank’s country partnership strategy for
2009-2012 and the current CPS for 2013-15. Indonesia has enjoyed sustained growth since
the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997/8, but the rate of reduction has slowed in recent years and
many non-poor households remain vulnerable to small shocks. At the same time, the
country’s PFM systems remain in need of significant improvements to be more efficient and
transparent in the allocation of public funds toward more responsive priority development
spending. Addressing these poverty and PFM issues are fundamental to improving public
service delivery and desired development outcomes.

3.1.2.   Relevance of Design and Implementation

Rating: Substantial

20.     The INSTANSI DPL was designed as a two-year programmatic series to focus
on two pillars: public financial management and poverty alleviation, service delivery
and shared prosperity. The focus on these two core areas was underpinned by the rationale
that strengthening PFM was essential for enhancing government effectiveness and
governance, particularly in a more deconcentrated fiscal and political environment, and
enhancing service delivery and poverty alleviation efforts was essential if Indonesia was to
bring about more broad-based improvements in welfare for its people. The two pillars are
complimentary.

21.      The design of the INSTANSI operations was largely consistent with the PDO
with two pillars to address the three objectives. The two pillars—enhancing poverty
alleviation and shared prosperity, and strengthening PFM for improved service delivery—
provided the foundation to deliver targeted capacity and institutional building in evidence-
based poverty reduction policy reform as well as laying the groundwork for transparent and
efficient PFM. The operations further supported the successful launching of a major national
social insurance program that proved to be highly relevant and timely. However, in the design
of the results framework for PFM, the quantitative indicators tend to focus on narrow aspects
of PFM and are not necessarily adequate proxies to reflect the overall strength of the PFM
system or its ability to enhance service delivery.



                                                                                          12
22.     INSTANSI 1 was a natural extension of the previous DPL series (DPLs 7 and 8)
focusing more on PFM capacity and institutional strengthening, while setting the stage
for deepening poverty reduction and shared prosperity measures through evidence-
based policy and program decision-making. INSTANSI 2 was opportunistic in taking
advantage of the country’s evolving macroeconomic and policy environment to shift attention
to the poverty reduction measures to safeguard the country’s vulnerable groups while
delivering the major launching of the nation-wide social assistance program. The shift is
evident in the revised triggers and prior actions for INSTANSI 2.

23.      The multiplicity of implementing agencies and their varying institutional
capacities create a challenge in coordinating and implementing the reform efforts . The
National Team for the Acceleration of Poverty Reduction (TNP2K) continues to address the
issues of fragmentation and lack of coordination, and to improve the effectiveness of national
poverty reduction programs. Continued improvements in systems for better targeting of
poverty alleviation programs and measurement of poverty will support the poor by ensuring
that these programs reach the appropriate beneficiaries. With progressively improved and
reliable sex-disaggregated data, policymakers are enabled to make sound policy decisions.
Household-based poverty reduction programs are being strengthened, which will improve the
coverage of health insurance for all families, including the poor, and increase the number of
scholarships for poor students at all education levels. Together, these actions are expected to
yield positive impacts to the poor and vulnerable social groups throughout Indonesia.

24.      The strengthening of PFM systems is expected to have significant poverty and
social benefits. Improvements in public financial management inherently require a medium
term time horizon to fully see the impact, and reforms are often initiated through changes in
procedures and regulations that govern the budget process. However, improvements in PFM
should over time enhance the government’s capacity to provide better public goods and
services, which in turn will benefit the poor. The transparency and quality of public spending
and the provision of public services will allow social programs to have a greater impact on
targeted populations. Through the fiscal management actions, the Government introduces new
systems and procedures that facilitate better compliance, while encouraging more rapid
execution of the budget, and improving transparency of spending. Tax reform measures are
more modest than initially anticipated, but are still valuable steps to improve efficiency and
effectiveness of revenue collections. Overall public savings through better fiscal management
will allow the GoI to dedicate more resources to pro-poor programs.

3.2.    Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Pillar 1: Enhancing poverty alleviation and service delivery efforts
This pillar aimed to support the government’s reforms towards developing an effective and
integrated social protection system with the following two objectives as formulated in the
PDO:
    1) Objective 1: To support measures to enhance Indonesia’s capacity and institutions for
         targeting poverty reduction measures
    2) Objective 2: To support the government to introducing a major social insurance
         program

Rating: High

25.       INSTANSI supported GoI’s reforms that work towards developing an effective
and integrated social protection system. The government’s efforts in this emerging social
protection system have been high with over 50% of the indicators for both objectives rated as
high and the remaining indicators as substantial (see Table 2a below). The system consists of
two policy challenges: (i) reforming and integrating social assistance programs to both
protect those at risk of falling into poverty and promote them so that they are able to share the

                                                                                             13
benefits of Indonesia’s strong growth; and (ii) preparing for the implementation of universal
social security programs—starting with health insurance programs—that provide adequate
protection from risks faced by all households, but are financially and institutionally
sustainable.

26.       GoI expanded targeted compensation for the poor with the introduction of
Kartu Kompensai Khusus. Representing a major step towards integrating social assistance
programs, GoI has issued integrated social protection cards (KPS) to 15,500,000 poor and
vulnerable beneficiary households identified through the Borrower’s national registry
(PPLS11), entitling them to subsidized rice allocations (RASKIN), temporary unconditional
cash transfers (BLSM), and financial assistance for poor students (BSM). With the launch of
Program Kompensasi Khusus and P4S, the Government is taking the opportunity to issue a
Social Protection Card (Kartu Perlindungan Sosial, or KPS) to the poorest 15.5 million
households drawn from Unified Database of potential beneficiaries ( Basis Data Terpadu, or
BDT), which was created by the TNP2K Secretariat with the assistance of Central Bureau of
Statistics (BPS). The careful design of the database with incorporation of international best
practices means that many of the previously excluded poor households will now become
program beneficiaries. Indeed, the use of a single card for multiple programs marks an
important first step towards an integrated social assistance framework in Indonesia.

27.      The Government also introduced innovations in community targeting to update
social protection card beneficiary lists in order to minimize inclusion and exclusion
errors. The Ministry of Home Affairs has issued an instruction for local governments to
improve the targeting accuracy of the KPS beneficiary list, through the use of a transparent
and participatory community-based mechanism. The Government will be coordinating with
local communities to help identify poor households that are currently excluded from the BDT
database. This is expected to contribute to the planned 2014 update and expansion of the
database.

28.      The Government has almost doubled the coverage of the BSM program to now
extend to 16 million beneficiaries. The GoI issued a Presidential Decree (No. 37/2012) to
provide budget allocation to increase the adequacy of benefit levels for the BSM program and
expand the coverage of the BSM program. Under the new system, students from eligible
families can directly approach schools, carrying their Social Protection Card and supporting
documentation, to claim their entitled assistance. By empowering beneficiaries in this way, it
is expected that the expansion of BSM through the P4S program will help to ensure that a
greater share of assistance will reach students who are at the greatest risk of dropping out.
The reform also improved the adequacy of BSM benefit levels so that poor and vulnerable
households will be able to afford to keep their children in school. In the past, the benefit
levels were equal to about 30 percent of education out-of-pocket costs faced by families and
were not indexed to inflation. By expanding financial assistance for poor students and
increasing benefit levels, the subsidy savings can help to mitigate the problem of rising
inequality in Indonesia by improving the mobility of the next generation.

29.      Under the current reform, the Government will increase the coverage of the
PKH program and improve integration with other social assistance programs. The GoI
issued a Presidential Decree (No. 37/2012) to provide budget allocation to increase the
adequacy of benefit levels for the conditional cash transfer (PKH) program and expand
coverage of the PKH using the PPLS11 to identify beneficiaries of the PKH. PKH will is
expected to expand from 1.5 million households in 2012 to 3.2 million households in 2014.
Beneficiary lists now includes KPS cardholders, will enables PKH beneficiary families to
automatically have access to the BSM program, BLSM and Raskin allocations. This is the
first time that individual programs in Indonesia are deployed as a system to provide
comprehensive support to extremely and chronically poor households.


                                                                                          14
30. Under the P4S program, minimum benefit levels have substantially increased.
Average benefit levels increased from IDR 1.4 million to IDR 1.8 million per year per
household. Minimum benefit levels increased from IDR 600,000 to IDR 800,000 per year per
family, and the maximum benefit level will increased from IDR 2,200,000 to IDR 2,800,000
(the calculation is based on number of number and age of children, and the inclusion of
pregnant or lactating women in the family). The increase took effect immediately in June
2013 for existing beneficiary households, while new beneficiary households added through
the expansion received the revised benefit levels as of November 2013. In the past, benefit
levels did not match the expenses faced by families in order to afford health and education
services.

31. The reforms of the permanent social assistance programs are financed until the end
of 2014, but the Government has indicated a vision to sustain the reforms in the future.
These reforms will be in effect for the duration of the current administration (i.e., until
December 2014). There are indications, however, that the reforms will be sustained in the
medium-term future. The Government’s draft Masterplan for the Acceleration and Expansion
of Poverty Reduction (MP3KI) prepared by the National Development Planning Agency
(Bappenas) outlines a social protection strategy that extends until 2025. The plan includes an
expansion of PKH to cover the poorest 5 percent of households, an expansion of scholarships
to cover all students from households included in the national registry, and increases in
benefit levels based on estimated needs. This improves the likelihood of sustaining the
reforms introduced through the fuel subsidy compensation programs.

32. Health system reforms included a number of key measures to help ensure efficient
and effective Universal Health Coverage (UHC) scale-up starting in 2014. In 2013, GoI
issued Presidential Regulation to provide the main regulatory framework for implementation
of the national health insurance program. This marks a significant regulatory milestone for
UHC implementation, covering qualification and participation, registration, contribution,
health service organization, service provision and quality, payment administration, complaint
management, and dispute settlement. The Ministry of Health also signed a critical
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the transformation of Jamkesmas, with PT Askes
as the appointed future administrator of BPJS Health. The MoU strengthens coordination and
collaboration between the parties, covering the transfer of management and administration of
Jamkesmas to BPJS Health, for successful implementation of this health insurance program
for the poor and near-poor, by January 1 2014. The Ministry of Health has also issued
Guidelines for Socialization for UHC implementation, to help policymakers inform citizens
about key UHC aspects, including membership enrollment, premium, health providers,
benefits package, and organization and feedback. The near term will include additional
comprehensive and detailed reforms to implement universal health coverage.

33.     The INSTANSI operations aimed to deepen the government’s ongoing PFM
reforms guided by the 2002 White Paper. The Government achieved a number of
milestones during the first INSTANSI operation:
     Completing the development and testing of the SPAN system;
     Further strengthening the use of the MTEF in the budget preparation process;
     Initiated steps to improve the systematic monitoring and evaluation of government
        expenditures as part of the annual budget cycle;
     Issued new regulations to improve budget execution, including steps to streamline the
        approval of budget adjustments during the year; and
     Issued new regulation (PMK 1/2013) and a training plan to support the
        implementation of accrual accounting in 2015.

34.      The government completed a major reform in the area of budget execution with
the issuance of a new Government Regulation (PP) 45/2013 on the Guidelines on
Implementing the State Budget. This had been under development since 2009 and its
issuance was a breakthrough. Furthermore, the regulation was one of the triggers for the
second INSTANSI operation. This regulation provides a legal basis for a number of reforms
aimed at improving the efficiency of budget execution and accelerating spending, including
the authorization of spending unit officials and procedures to issue multiyear contracts. The
aim is to shift from detailed compliance checking with specified standard costs to a more
strategic role of setting up cost structures and methodology. The regulation marks the
beginning of the new role for the costing unit at DG Budget by initially setting up basic cost
structures of a government program.

35.     Delegation of responsibility for in-year budget adjustments or virements from
the Ministry of Finance to the line ministries is also covered under PP 45/2013. The
responsibility for budget authorization was transferred from DG Treasury to DG Budget in
2012. The Bank provided support to DG Budget to simplify the virements related business
processes along with other measures to streamline budget execution. This area of reform has
proved to be challenging. One example has been where changes to eliminate the practice of
budget block through “bintang” resulted in revised procedures, which have some similar
problematic features. This item was one of the triggers for the second INSTANSI operation
and was adjusted as a benchmark due to the problematic nature to implement the regulation.

36.      The implementation of SPAN benefited from the issuance of PP 45/2013. SPAN
is progressively becoming the sole system used by treasury offices across the country. There
are two important implementation milestones during the INSTANSI operations include (i)
finalizing the development of the budget execution application with user acceptance and sign-
off completed; and (ii) all supporting regulations and/or standard operating procedures were
issued as a prerequisite for starting the pilot in early 2014. All daily transactions have been
converted and stored in the SPAN database since 2013. As of the time of this ICR, SPAN had
been rolled out to 60 out of 220 locations representing 70% of all transactions. This is a major
milestone for the MOF, and it indicates that SPAN is increasingly relied upon for daily
budget execution. The full roll out to all 220 locations is ongoing and is likely to creep into
2015. However, it is expected that SPAN will be able to support the implementation of
accrual accounting in producing the FY15 central government financial statement.

37.     Two new applications were developed in parallel with the development of SPAN
during the INSTANSI operations. The Ministry of Finance started to modernize the State
Revenue Module (Modul Peremimaan Negara/MPN). MPN processes receipts from tax,
customs and excise, and non-tax revenue. The new generation MPN will be more reliable,
more user-friendly, and more informative. For improved quality of data covering the entire
financial management process, from budgeting to execution to reporting, at the spending unit
level, a new application SAKTI was also developed to link to the SPAN. SAKTI is


                                                                                             17
specifically for the 29,000 spending units across Indonesia. Both MPN and SAKTI will be
integrated into the SPAN system.

38.      There has not been an update to the 2011 PEFA review during the INSTANSI
operations. The results framework for the INSTANSI series includes two PEFA related
indicators, PI 12 and PI 17. PEFA PI 12 is a proxy to measure overall budget information
transparency and the use of MTEF, while PEFA PI 17 looks at the efficiency and flexibility
of budget execution and management. Since the 2011 PEFA review, there has been some
progress on improving the transparency of the MTEF process. A table is now included in the
financial note showing forward budget estimate from prior year including the methodology
used to determine the bottom up costings and medium-term projections. However, if a review
were to be conducted today, PEFA PI 12 would likely have to remain the same, as some
criteria necessary to achieve a B rating are not met. On the other hand, PEFA PI 17 would
garner an A rating, improved from its 2011 rating of B+. The improvement is a direct result
of the issuance and implementation of PP 45/2013.

39.      The Ministry of Finance has taken fundamental steps to modernize the tax
administration system. DG Tax has begun leveraging ICT to enhance its business processes
and to improve taxpayer services. The business process improvement was partly achieved
through the centralization of the core tax system (SIDJP) and the implementation of
electronic registration and filing systems as well as improving the electronic payment system.
DG Tax has also deployed decision support tools (Aproweb) to assist tax offices in the
profiling and identifying non-compliance and tax gaps. To improve taxpayer support and
services and to strengthen governance, DG Tax is now operating and expanding an inbound
and outbound call center. DG Tax is conducting final testing of a web-based electronic
invoice application to facilitate VAT refunds for tourists. This application will also handle
business-to-business VAT transactions and provide early detection of VAT violation.

40.      Significant progress has been made in improving the integrity and effective use
and management of public funds; however, the overall achievements, based on the
predefined indicators, result in a modest rating for this area. Only 76%, or 65 out of 86,
line ministries received an unqualified opinion for FY13. The target is 84% with the baseline
value of 63% in FY2010. Furthermore, disbursement of revised APBN-P budget at the end of
Q2 of 2013 was only 18.5%, a slight improvement from the baseline value of 18.1%. The
target is 22%. These results suggest entrenched practices not easily abandoned. Despite the
challenges, 40% of the PFM related indicators are solidly in the substantial zone (See Table
2b below).

*** The rating does not reflect post-2013 performance and the slightly declining trend may have been affected by weakened
macroeconomic developments and the implementation of higher non-taxable income threshold which became effective in
January 2013.


3.3.       Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

41.     Based on the assessment of the INSTANSI series’ relevance and efficacy, the
overall outcome rating is satisfactory. In terms of relevance, the series remains highly
aligned with GOI’s objectives for sustaining medium-term growth, poverty reduction, and
shared prosperity. The design of the PDOs reflected GoI’s need to enhance capacity in
targeting poverty reduction measures and capacity in the management of public finances
towards better service delivery. The operation was intended to be a two-year two-tranche
programmatic DPL series even though the government considered a one-year extension
during the preparation of the second INSTANSI operation. The structure of the operation
also enabled the Bank to flexibly adapt the triggers and prior actions to the major policy shift
that occurred in 2013, and that in turn released resources to better target social assistance to
the poor and vulnerable. The combined rating for relevance of objectives and design is
considered substantial rather than high, allowing for the fact that some PFM indicators could
have been more robust.

42.      The combined rating for the efficacy of the operation is substantial, despite the
relatively mixed achievements across the three objectives under two pillars. In the
poverty reduction pillar, the combined achievements for both objectives are high given the
government’s breakthroughs in setting up new social assistance programs and better targeting
of the poor and vulnerable. Progress against the poverty reduction indicators generally
reached or exceeded targets. Over 50% of the indicators for the two poverty objectives are
rated as high with the remaining as substantial (see Table 2a above). The achievements within
the poverty pillar were so significant as to outweigh any weaknesses in the PFM pillar. While
achievements in PFM fell short against some of the targets, significant progress has been
made in a number of key areas. The adoption of accrual accounting standards and the
implementation of SPAN were highly ambitious and complex undertakings by the
government and do have the potential to have big impact over the medium to long term.
Seventy percent of transactions are already in SPAN with full roll-out scheduled in early
2015, which will greatly enhance transparency and efficiency of public financial management
in Indonesia.

3.4.    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development

43.     The 1997-98 Asian financial crisis highlighted the strong link between
macroeconomic stability and poverty, particularly in Indonesia. Indonesia’s poor and
vulnerable households were especially affected by the crisis. The cost of managing
Indonesia’s crisis amounted to roughly 50 percent of GDP and an estimated 10 years of
consistent progress in fighting poverty were lost in the wake of the crisis. Formal sector
employment rates also fell steeply as many households fell into poverty, and 23 percent of
Indonesia’s population was below the poverty line by 1999. Since then, the Government has
made important strides towards establishing economic recovery, with particular attention on
maintaining macroeconomic stability.

44.      The INSTANSI series addressed issues of poverty and social development
directly and advocated equitable development. In response to the medium-term
development plan (RPJMN) 2010-2014 that promotes women’s role in development, the
Ministry of Finance issued a regulation requiring all K/L budgets to include a gender
budgeting statement in their respective proposed budget. National Targeting system includes
explicit mention of households with pregnant women or headed by women to ensure social
assistance programs are properly targeted.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening (Policy Dialogue and Coordination)

45.      INSTANSI was instrumental in serving as a forum for policy dialogue amongst
government counterparts and various development partners. Reform areas supported by
this DPL series involved a wide range of line ministries/agencies and government
counterparts, including the Ministry of Finance, CMEA, Bank Indonesia, TNP2K, Bappenas,
the Ministry of Home Affairs, and the newly established OJK, all with a diverse, varied set of
priority focuses, together with institutional authorities and capacities. The INSTANSI DPL
series provided a useful forum for the necessary, multi-stakeholder policy discussions and
consensus-building. MoF played a strong leadership role in the coordination and oversight of
the reform agenda overall and the prior actions. Other development partners, such as IFC,
IMF, SECO, DFAT (formerly AusAID), and ADB also appreciated INSTANSI’s role in
serving as an effective forum for harmonizing development-partner support to the economic
development, poverty alleviation, and shared prosperity objectives.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative)

N/A


4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

46.       Overall, the reform agenda supported by the programmatic INSTANSI DPL
series was moderately strong, with a solid track record and government ownership. The
supported reforms built on measures that had been supported through previous DPL series as
well as other technical assistance and AAA. INSTANSI reflected a broad consensus that
emerged from both high level policymakers and technical staff of key institutions on the
criticality of poverty alleviation, shared prosperity, and public financial management for
improved service delivery in the medium term. The National Team for the Acceleration of
Poverty Reduction (TNP2K) took the lead in the overall policy planning and coordination of
social assistance programs. Actions under the PFM pillar were led by the Ministry of Finance

                                                                                          21
that involved a number of DGs that had been working on the related issues over multiple
years. Despite the pending change in Government at the time of the ICR, there is continued
broad-based support for the reforms implemented under the INSTANSI series, with the
prospect that reforms may even increase.


5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1.    Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

47.      The Bank worked closely with the various government counterparts and other
development partners in identifying reforms and monitoring progress. Quality at entry
benefited from the solid Bank work program, along with the strong in-country presence to
facilitate needed intensive policy-dialogues and delivery of better-targeted complementary
technical assistance and AAA work. The Bank also adequately identified and evaluated the
risks inherent to Indonesia’s social-economic-political environment for sustained poverty
alleviation, shared prosperity, and public financial management reforms. INSTANSI
supplemented the ongoing instruments—Partnership for Knowledge-based Poverty Reduction
(PKPR), PFM MDTF, and GFMRAP—to enhance synergies and lower implementation risks.

48.     The INSTANSI operations were coordinated closely with other Bank DPL
programs in Indonesia. At the end of the third DPL series (DPLs 7 and 8), the Bank moved
to prepare three sectoral DPL operations concurrently—INSTANSI, FIRM, and Connectivity
DPLs—designed to address key priorities across the different government reform programs
and to better leverage government buy-in on the entire DPL operations. Close collaboration
with other development partners, including the Government of Japan, through JICA, ADB,
and DFAT (formerly AusAID), also helped to ensure a harmonized approach towards policy-
based lending and minimized transactional costs for the government.

49.      The INSTANSI series proved to be a flexible instrument that was highly
responsive to the Government’s evolving socio-political-economic landscape by shifting
policy attention from one operation to the next. The regular meetings between the task
team, GoI and development partners as well as the ongoing engagements with agencies
responsible for different prior actions ensured close monitoring toward achievements of most
of the milestones and targets. However, some of the targets were unrealistically set for a two-
year series. The use of future PEFA ratings for some of the PFM achievements proved to be
undeterminable given there has been no update to the 2011 review. Moreover, the progress in
the implementation of SPAN and its expected benefits cannot be captured by simply
determining whether or not the system is rolled out to 100% of Treasury offices, as
transaction volume is even more important. Similarly, the number of citizens adopting e-filing
of individual tax return does not necessarily reflect the extent of the government’s efforts in
modernizing its core tax system.

50.     The Bank delivered an innovative PERISAI DPL operation during the
INSTANSI series to address the Government’s need for enhanced crisis preparedness to
continued international financial market volatility. The Program for Economic Resilience,
Investment and Social Assistance in Indonesia (PERISAI) is a USD 2 billion DPL with a
Deferred Drawdown Option (DDO) designed to provide GoI fiscal space to address potential
adverse impact of ongoing volatility in financial markets on the Government’s ability to
maintain essential public expenditures and, if necessary, to provide augmented economic
stimulus during this period of stress. PERISAI includes a set of confidence-boosting policy

                                                                                           22
measures as well as back-up financing arrangements to be available in the event that the
worsening of global financial markets prevents Indonesia from accessing financing at
reasonable rates.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

51.     All prior actions were fulfilled prior to Board presentation as standard DPL
operations. Nevertheless, supervision was performed in the context of assessing the impact
of the measures supported in this series and, more importantly, in a continuing strong policy
dialogue.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

52.     The overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory. The intensive engagement
and policy dialogues with multi-stakeholders within the government and amongst
development partners ensured development of a strategic reform agenda to be supported by
relevant program of actions resulting in delivery of results towards achieving positive
development objectives.

5.2.    Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

53.     The success of the INSTANSI operations was attributed to the Government’s
high level of commitment and ownership over the reform agenda. The operations
involved an extensive number of government agencies and institutions (CMEA, MoF, BI,
Bappenas, TNP2K, and MoHA) that required a high degree of commitment and ownership, as
well as policy coordination. The Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affair ensured
consistent and effective cross-ministerial coordination, and played a key role in convening the
forum for policy dialogue amongst a wide range of government stakeholders, facilitating
effective and efficient discussions, monitoring the reform progress, and taking any necessary
follow-up actions.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

54.      The INSTANSI operations involved the MoF and CMEA as the two
implementing agencies and also included other key government stakeholders, including
OJK, Bank Indonesia, MoHA, TNP2K, and Bappenas. Overall, these agencies
demonstrated strong institutional capacities and performed relatively well in ensuring
successful implementation of their respective policy reform areas. Despite its recent
establishment, OJK in particular performed well and assumed its supervisory and regulatory
roles and responsibilities in a timely manner. CMEA took up the role of coordination and
overseeing multiple agencies particularly exemplarily.




                                                                                           23
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

55.      The overall Borrower performance is rated as Satisfactory. Particularly
noteworthy is CMEA’s strong leadership in coordinating and overseeing the design and
implementation of policy actions, which involved multiple line ministries and agencies. The
successful design and implementation of the operation would not have been possible without
the strong leadership of CMEA and the MoF.


6.      Lessons Learned

56.     The evolution of the core DPL program into three sectoral operations resulted in
increased government ownership, a deeper Bank engagement on key topics, and an
improved focus on the Government’s most current priorities. Since 2004, the Bank has
supported a multi-sectoral DPL program in Indonesia with considerable success. In 2012, the
Government requested a shift towards a sectoral approach to maximize focus. In response, the
INSTANSI DPL came about as one of the three operations to be presented jointly to the
Board in November 2012, along with the FIRM and Connectivity DPLs. This shift proved to
be an effective strategy to advance the Government’s reform program.

57.    The extensive analytical work and technical assistance on poverty alleviation,
shared prosperity, and PFM prior to the DPL were critical in identifying the reform
program. In particular, the work undertaken by the Partnership for Knowledge-based Poverty
Reduction (PKPR) and PFM MDTF informed the INSTANSI operations.

58.     The presence of a strong government counterpart to serve as coordinator was an
important success factor in a loan involving multiple institutions. In this case, CMEA
played a strong leadership role in convening and overseeing policy discussions that involved
the MoF, OJK, Bank Indonesia, MoHA, the TNP2K, and Bappenas. These institutions
recognized the benefits of being part of the process and participated actively in the DPL
coordination meetings.
