                              Meeting of the Executive Directors

                                          November 20, 2012


      Executive Directors approved an Institutional, Tax Administration, Social and Investment
(INSTANSI) Development Policy Loan (DPL) to the Republic of Indonesia in the amount of
US$300 million on the payment terms and conditions set out in the President’s Memorandum
(R2012-0219).

         Executive Directors expressed their support for the objectives of the loan, which aims to
assist the Government of Indonesia to strengthen public finance management, poverty reduction,
and service delivery efforts. Directors applauded Indonesia’s prudent fiscal policies that have
resulted in a fiscal buffer and a decline in public debt. They noted Indonesia’s improved Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability scores over recent years, and welcomed targets for
further improvement.

        Executive Directors stressed the importance of enhanced mechanisms to strengthen
policy coordination among government agencies and the capacity of central and local
government institutions for broad based growth. Directors welcomed progress in past reforms of
the country’s public finances, and urged further progress in budget execution to redirect spending
towards the social sectors and infrastructure, particularly to address basic needs. In this regard,
Directors called for greater attention to the costs of energy subsidies and noted the target to
increase the number of female-headed households and stressed attention to rising inequalities.
Finally, Directors commended the Bank for its wide consultation with its development partners
during the preparation of the project.
