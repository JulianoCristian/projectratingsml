7a.  Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
The objective of this project is to protect critical environmental resources and services from the Leuser and 
Ulu Masen forest ecosystems during the post-tsunami reconstruction process, which is supported by 
several agencies operating under the authority of BRR.  This project will also contribute toward mitigating 
negative impacts of reconstruction on the forests of Aceh, mainstreaming of environmental concerns into 
planning processes, and building sustainable capacity and institutions for forest protection.  By helping to 
ensure that ecosystem services provided by the forest are maintained, the project will support Aceh#s 
future social and economic development.
