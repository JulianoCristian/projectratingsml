                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of this project is to protect critical environmental resources and services from the Leuser and Ulu Masen forest ecosystems during the post-
                         tsunami reconstruction process, which is supported by several agencies operating under the authority of BRR. This project will also contribute toward
                         mitigating negative impacts of reconstruction on the forests of Aceh, mainstreaming of environmental concerns into planning processes, and building
                         sustainable capacity and institutions for forest protection. By helping to ensure that ecosystem services provided by the forest are maintained, the project will
                         support Aceh#s future social and economic development.
