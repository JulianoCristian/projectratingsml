purpose of the Integrating\n            Environment and Forest Protection into the Recovery and\n            Future Development of Aceh Project for Indonesia is to\n            ensure environmental resources and services from the Leuser\n            and Ulu Masen forest ecosystems are protected during the\n            post-tsunami reconstruction process. It is anticipated that\n            few members of local communities will be adversely impacted\n            by this project. This is because the project does not\n            primarily seek to prevent access to forest resources but to\n            limit and regulate such resource use to ensure no further\n            forest loss. However, the project may seek to prevent access\n            to certain resources or certain areas through zoning. Also,\n            access to specific species may be curtailed or prevented.\n            The project will also employ appropriate, participatory\n            marking of forest boundaries. When this project does\n            identify adverse impacts - or a need to change livelihood\n            strategies (e.g., illegal loggers), local community members\n            will be directly assisted to take up alternate livelihood\n            opportunities, which may be sponsored by the project or\n            other non-government organizations (NGOs) and development\n            agencies working in the area. Community development\n            activities (e.g., nursery development, provision of seed\n            stock, assistance in land rehabilitation) will be targeted\n            to community members who are most vulnerable or most likely\n            to engage in forest encroaching activities, unless otherwise\n            employed. The project will ensure that community members\n            identified will be assisted with remedial measures necessary\n            to maintain or improve their incomes or living standards.\n            Further, appropriate mitigation measures will be identified\n            with the participation of the affected communities."}, "docdt": "2010-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
