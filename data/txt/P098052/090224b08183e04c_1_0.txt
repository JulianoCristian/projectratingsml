                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of this project is to protect critical environmental resources and services from the Leuser and Ulu Masen forest ecosystems during the post-tsunami
                         reconstruction process, which is supported by several agencies operating under the authority of BRR. This project will also contribute toward mitigating negative
                         impacts of reconstruction on the forests of Aceh, mainstreaming of environmental concerns into planning processes, and building sustainable capacity and institutions
                         for forest protection. By helping to ensure that ecosystem services provided by the forest are maintained, the project will support Aceh#s future social and economic
                         development.

                         The project has been successful in protecting critical forests ecosystems in Aceh from the pressures posed by post-tsunami reconstruction needs as well as other causes of
                         degradation, encroachment, and unsustainable resource exploitation. Nearly 97 percent of the original forest cover in the project area has been retained, and there is now a stronger
                         framework for ensuring their long-term protection. This includes improved spatial and management planning, increased awareness, better trained and equipped forest guards, greater
                         empowerment of communities in and around forest areas, development of alternative livelihoods, and more sustainable funding for forest conservation.
