        and Forest Protection into the Recovery and Future\n            Development of Aceh Project for Indonesia were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            Grantee performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the flexibility combined with opportunism enabled\n            the project to engage with emerging Government of Aceh (GOA)\n            priorities, such as Aceh Forest Redesign Team (Tim\n            Penyusunan Rencana Strategis Pengelolaan Hutan Aceh)\n            (TIPERESKA) and green Aceh, leveraging resources toward\n            sustainability that were not originally envisioned. The\n            project can thus accomplish much more by joining and\n            strengthening these initiatives. The forest monitoring\n            program clearly illustrated that reporting needs to go\n            beyond simple monitoring to include engaging governmental\n            units in understanding and taking up the information for\n            further action. Government action is essential on some\n            fronts, especially for law enforcement and prosecution. In\n            addition, demonstrating how conservation and protection\n            activities directly benefit communities is more effective\n            than rhetoric alone. Seconding staff into the administrative\n            and political structure and supporting the governor's\n            key environmental initiatives was effective at integrating\n            project aims into the policy and decision process. In\n            addition, working directly with teachers and schools was a\n            good entry point and expanded the reach of the project\n            beyond what it can do with its own resources. Through good\n            plans and partnerships, an environmental project can\n            leverage resources for its stakeholder communities,\n            including vulnerable groups like the poor or women. There is\n            also scope for developing wider business development efforts\n            and marketing linkages, but the implementing non-government\n            organizations (NGOs) have to also recognize their core\n            mission and comparative advantage if stretched too far in\n            this direction."}, "docdt": "2013-07-19T00:00:00Z"}
