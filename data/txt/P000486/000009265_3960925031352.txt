SATEGUI-DERESSIA IRRIGATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 489-CD/489-1-CD)
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Sategui-Deressia
Irrigation Project in Chad for which Credit 489-CD in the amount of US$7.5
million was approved on March 26, 1974, and Credit 489-1-CD in the amount of
US$8.0 million was approved on October 7, 1976. Credit 489-CD was closed on
December 31, 1980, and Credit 489-1-CD was closed on June 30, 1987. The last
disbursement was made on August 10, 1978, under Credit 489-CD, and on November
30, 1987, under Credit 489-1-CD.
The PCR was prepared by the FAO/World Bank Cooperative Programme (FAO-CP)
and the Sahelian Department's Agriculture Division (AF5AG), following a mission
to Chad in June 1988. It is based on reports and data prepared by the project
implementing agency, the Office for the Development of Sategui-Deressia (ONVSD);
a review of the Staff Appraisal Report No. 145a-CD, dated March 4, 1974; the
Credit Agreements of June 28, 1974, October 7, 1976 (Amendment) and May 28, 1985
(Substitution); Bank Supervision Reports; correspondence with the Borrower;
internal Bank nemoranda on project issues as contained in Bank files; and the
interviews with officials both in the Bank and in Chad who have been associated
with the project. The report also draws on oths. Bank documents to which the
reader is referred.'
This PCR was read by the Operations Evalurtion Department (OED). The draft
PCR was sent to the Borrower and the co-financing agencies on March 1. 1991 for
coments by April 19, 1991. None were received.'

PROJECT COMPLETION REPO=T
CHOD
SATEGUI-DERESSIA IRRIGATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 489-CD/489-l-CD)
S2LUTIONSUMMARY
Introduction and Obiectives
iL .        The Sategui-Deressia project was the Bank's third project in the
agricultural sector and its first operation to promote itrigated agriculture in
Chad The project is located on the Sategui-Deressia plain which is flooded each
year, allcwing the cultivation of a single wet-season rice crop. Although millet
and sorghum are the tradit4onal, staple food crops in Chad, rice is the principal
crop in this area. The project's key objective was to increase productivity of
rice production, thereby raising production and farmers' incomes. A broader
objective was to create t.e capacity--technological ezpertise, trained personnel,
and institutions--for future development of irrigated agricultvre.
2.          The project was identified in 1966 and appraiced in 1972.  The
project, as originally designed, was to construct a gravity-fed irrigated
perimeter of 4,000 heetares, a rice mill and other supporting structures, and to
provide services to farmers both inside the perimeter and in surrounding areas.
A vertically integrated parastatal--OHMVSD--a created to Implement it, handling
production support services, maintenance of the irrigation works, and rice
marketing. The project cost was estimated to be US$12 million. Irrigation works
were to be carried out by a contractor, but the cost proved to be exorbitant.
The project was reappraised in 1976 based on a successfully tested construction
method using labor and equipment operated under force account; the Bank and ADF
provided supplementary credits to cover the project cost which increased to US$25
million. In 1979, when IDA was forced to suspend disbursements due to Chad's
civil war, construction of thrse polders serving a net area of 1,500 hectares was
nearly completed. Farmers continued to cultivate the perimeter during the war,
but the hostilities resulted in darage and losses.
3.          A limlted resumption of IDA financing was authorized in April 1983
and permitted urgent maintenance and repair activities (para 3.13). In 1984 a
thirty-month rehabilitation program was prepared by the Bank, UNCDF, FAO and UNDP
for the 1,500 hectares, costing roughly US$5.7 aillion. 1 It was expected to
start-up in July 1984, but administrative and logistical problems caused a nearly
two year delay (para 2.2). The physical rehabilltation of the 1,500 hectares and
rice mill were completed in 1987.
Implementation zxperience
4.          The main investment components of the project were civil works.
1 This includes the balance of IDA Cr. 489-1 which amwunted to about US$2.4
mllion.



Implementation vas reasonably good. The new construction approach proved well-
adapted to Chadian conditions and a small group of Chadian technicians were
trained. Their expertise can be used in future projects In Chad. However,
design of the irrigation works did not take into account sufficiently the risk
of low flood levels nor wore water managemnat and maintenance actitivies
sufficiently thought out. A serious deterioration in climatic and hydrological
conditions had a severe impact on the irrigated perimeter's functioning and
substantialSy reduced the project's benefits.  Construction and rehabilitatLon
of the modern rice mill appear in hindsight to have been a mistake. The mill's
capacity was too larg relative to the iLze of the rice market and it was
designed to maximize production of high quality rice which did not correspond to
consumers' taste and cost more. Less expensive, smaller caprcity rice mills
which could be privately managed would have been better suLted to Chadian
conditions.
Results
S.          The project's achieve_ents on the agricultural production side are
poor compared to its record on civil works. U_il1 recently, extension services
were weak and messages were not being adopted by farmers, in part due to OMVSD's
inability to supply the required amount and qualLty of input.. Yield targets
were achieved, but it appears that they were too conservative. However, under
present conditions--depressed rice market and high input costs--there are
insufficient incentives for farmer to intensify rice production (5.21-5.22).
Production targets for the original project (20,000 tons of paddy a year at full
developmnt) and the rehabilltation prograu (9,000 tons of paddy at full
development) were not met because of the reduced cropping area served by the
projects   1,500 hectares under irrigation and 1,400 hectares outside the
perimeter. In 1988, project farmers are expected to produce 5,800 tons of paddy
and total paddy production in the plain is expected to be only 1,000 tons higher
than in 1974. (See Annex 1, Table 1 for details.)
6.          The creation of OKV$D was a specific condition of effectiveness for
the IDA credlt. The appraisal report was optimistic about OKVSD's prospects for
becoming self-sufficient by the end of the project's six year periodg in fact,
the IDA credit was on-lent to OKVSD by the Government and was to be repaid in
full vith revenues from rice sales and fanrers' fees for Inputs and 0K. OKVSD's
coamerciel activities faLled, in part due to external factors (para 5.25 and
6.5). Like similar parastatals in Chad (SODELAC, COTONTCHAD) and elsewhere, it
was inefficients decision-mking was centralised, overhead costs were high, and
financial mnagment and controls were weak.  Under the rehabilitation project,
Bank and UN supervision mLisions provided considerable assistance to OKVSD to
help lmprove smnagement. However, OMVSD failed to implement the internal reforms
being discussed sLace 1984. After five years, the only plausible explanation is
that OMV8SD'  senLor management does not want to implemnt then and that the
Chadian Government has not forced them to do so.   These reforms aro not
sufficient to ensure OKYSD's viability, a fundamental restructuring is required
whilch would reduce its functions. In view of OMVSD's continuing and serious
problems, In November 1987 the Kinistry of Planing and IDA agreed that before
embarking on expansLon of the irrigated area, operations of the existing 1500
hectares should be Ifpro-id, OKVSD restructured, and rice marketing problems
resolved. A joint UNDPI" )PIFAO evaluation mission came to the sam conclusion



in itay 1968.
7.          The project reached a mall number of fa£rr households--3,250  out
of 9,300--and achieved a relatively smll increase in production-- 1,000 tons
more than in 1974--relative to its cost of !X$29.7 million. Furthermore, under
present conditions. 0MVSD is unviable, requiring a larg annual subsidy stimated
at more than one million dollars in 1987. The project's UR is negative, even
if one considers the project cost prior to the war (US$21.6 million) as sunk
cost.  In oaly three out of the last twelve years did the project generate
incremental output and the amount was mnimal.
Sustainabilitv
S.          At present, this project is not sustabiable from Government, OKVSD
or the farmrs' point of view. No expansion of the Irrigated perimeter should
be considered until the oxisting 1,300 hectares is being explolted properly and
OMNSD has shown it can be self-financed. In order to achieve this, substantial
efficiency gains and a more flexible rice pricing and marketing approach are
required. The considerable potential to increase yields through lowering the
cost of Inputs, better water maagement and lmproved husbandry practices must be
exploited. Iprovweents are also needed to ensure better water availability and
distributions this may require so new lnvestment (see Annex 2). OQKVD's
manageent must be improved and Its functions xeduceds many can probably be
performed more efficiently by farmers, the private sector or other Government
agencies. Farmers groups should gradually take on greater responsibilLty for
managing the irrigated perimeter. Government took an essential step in this
directLon in 1989 when OKVSD's senior management was replaced. A diagnostic
study of OMVSD financed by the IDA technical assistance project (Cr. 1872-CD) was
completed in June 1989 and the consultants are preparing a rostructuring program
to be examined by the Government In mid-1990.
Findings and Lessons
9.          In hindsight, the Bank can be criticized for desiging an overly
complex project which did not take into account the country's implementation
capacity and logistical problems. In addition, the project conception had four
major flawas (i) design of the irrigation works did not suffLciently take into
account the risk of low rainfall resulting In low flood levels (IL) the creation
of a vertically Integrated parastatal to lmploemnt the project concentrated
resources In the public sectors (Lii) farmers' possible role In running the
scheme was completely ignored; and (iv) the decision to build an expenslve,
modern rice mill reduced OKVSD's capacity to adapt to the changing rice market;
10.         Bank staff demonstrated perseerance and creativity In a4apting this
project to the difficulties In Chad lncluding failure of the inLtial bidding
process, the disruption of the civil war, delays In the full resumption of
disbursemeats, and late start-up of UN agencies' funding. This PC& finds it
Impossible to judge, even with hindsight, how the Bank should have reacted to
OKVSD's failure to Improve its management. Fiv years of continuous efforts by
the Bank and ON agencies resulted in few concrete c=ages. The dlemma facing
Bank staff was that OISD's field staff were motivated and comitteds they
accomplished the rehabilLtation works as planned despite numerous hardships



. vii -
including not getting paid. Seeing these positive achievowents and farmers
apparent motivation, it was difficult for Dank staff ;o give up on the project
and take drastic action such as cancelling the loan.
11.  There vroe two critical decision-points after the civil war, when, in
hindsight, a change in approach may have been appropriate. First, while it is
understandable that the Bank wanted to show good will and support of the Chadian
government as it took its first steps towards recovery, the Bank's decision in
1983 to partially resume disbursements for the Sategui-Deressia project may have
been a mLstake. It might have been more appropriate to thoroughly ro-oxamine the
project conception--such as OMVSD'e role--before relaunching its activities.
Second, if the Bank had been able to anticipate the nearly one-and-a-half year
dalay in start-up of the rehabilitation program when lt was appraised in early
1984, it could have cancelled the balance under Cr. 489-1 and presented the
rehabilitation program to the Board as a new emergency operation, which in effect
it was. This would have provLded an opportunity to devoto sufficient resources
and time to roexamine and modify the project. It also would have been possible
to establish a formal coordination agreoent with the UNCDF and UNDP which might
have taken the form of the Bank accepting the role of executing agency for the
UN project agrements.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SATEGUI-DERESSIA IRRICATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 489-CD/489-1-CD)
1 INTRODUCTION
1.1            The Sategui-Doressia project was tho Bank's third project in
the agricultural sector and its fLrst operation to promote irrigated
agriculture in Chad. A succession of three years of drought In the early
1970s provoked Government and donor efforts to ldentify ways of reducing
Chad's vulnerability to climatic forces.   Chad has a large irrigation
potential and two areas, the Lake Chad regLon and the area along the Logone
river, were identified in the mld-1960s as the most promising for irrigation
investments. The Sategui-Deressia project aimed to Improve rice cultivation
on about 11,000 ha of land in the SateSui-Deressia flood plain. An irrigation
project for Lake Chad (Cr. 592-CD) was also developed around this time and
financed by the Bank. Over the subsequent flfteen years, the Bank agreed to
finance sLz other projects in the agricultural sector with IDA credits
totalllng about US$81 mllion. However, all Bank operations in Chad were
suspended from 1979-83 because of the civil war; only the Sategui-Deressia
and Rural Projects Fund (Credit 664-CD) projects were completed of the tive
projects on the books in 1979. Three projects supported by IDA funds have
been initi.a6d since 1985:  Emergency Cotton Progrm  (Credit 1716-CD),
Agricultural Rehabilitation (Credit 1775-CD), and National Livestock (Credit
1912-CD).
1.2            This report is a combined PCR for CredLts 489-CD and 489-1-CD.
It was prepared in conjunction with a study of the irrigation sub-sector and,
therefore, attempts to evaluate this project in the broader context of its
lessons for future development of irrigation in Chad. With this broader
objective in mind, Annexes 1 and 2 provide addLtional information on the
agricultural development aspects of the project and preliminary proposals
for improvement and extension of the irrigated perimeter. Draft TermS of
Reference for technical studles concenming the recoeendations in Annex 2 are
presented in Annex 3.
II. OVERVIEW OF PROJECT'S HISTORY
2.1            The history of this project Ls complicated.  The project, as
originally designed, was to construct an irrigated perimeter of 4,000
hectares, a rice mill and other supporting structures, and to provide
services to farmers both inside the perimeter and in surrounding areas. It
was approved by the Board in March 1974. The irrigation works were to be
carried out by a contractor, but after two successive tounds of bids resulted
in offers far exceeding appraisal cost estimates, a pilot scheme testing a
combination of labor-intensive methods and equipment operated under force
account was undertaken in early 1976. It was successful and In June 1976 the
project was reappraised, but costs were still much hlgher than appraisal
estimates and additLonal financing was required.   The Board approved a



2-
supplemntary IDA credit of US$8.0 Million In 1976 and the African
Development Bank also increased its credit by US$5.0 lillon. In 1979, IDA
was forced to suspend dlsbursemnts due to Chad's civil wars constructlon of
three polders serving a not area of 1.500 hectares (301 of revlsed tarpet of
5,000 ha) was nearly complete. Farmers continued to cultivate the perimeter
durlng the war, but the hostililtles resulted in dmage and losses. The
original project (i.e. activitles undertaken prlor to suspenslon) and the
post-1983, rehabilitation program descrlbed below can be considered as two
separate projects.
2.2            A limited resumptlon of IDA financing wa authorized In April
1983 and permitted urgent maintenance and repalr activities. In February
1984, a Bank mlssion approved an interim program to continue the activities
begun ln 1983 and appraised e more comprehenslve, thirty month rehabilltatlon
program prepared by the UICDF, FAO and UNDP for the 1,500 hectares completed
ln 1979. The cost of the two program was estimated at US$5.7 millon and it
was expected to get underway by July 1984. With the remaining funds under
Credit 489-1, IDA agreed to finance the project implmenting agency's--OHVSD-
- operating costs for the rehabilitation porlod in order to complete the
fiLuanclig package for whilch UKCDF, UNDP and WFP were coverlng the investment,
technical assistance and other costs. The mlsslon judged the progrm to be
financially and economlcally viable, although lt stressed that substantlal
improvements were needed ln OMVSD's management. The program's start-up was
delayed by nearly two years. There were substantial delays In finaliZing and
slgning the UNCDF and UMDP project agreoments. Purtherore, thelr financing
was contingent upon full resumptlon of IDA's dlsbursements; thie took about
one year, because lt depended on sigaing a new credit agreement and Chad's
settlement of payment arrears to IDA. When these matters were finally sorted
out in September 1985, there were additlonal delays due to adminlstrative
problem of the UNCDF and UNDP projects which seriously delayed the delivery
of vehicles and equlpment and the arrival of the five person technlcal
asistance team. Bank supervlslon mlsslons ldentified stopgap colutions to
these problems so that rehabilitation work could begin in 1986. The physlcal
rehabilltation of the 1500 hectares and rice mill were completed in 1987.
2.3            IDA Credit 489-1 was exhausted in late 1987.  An additlonal
$500,000  from  IDA Cr.  739-CD was provided  to ONVSD  to  support  the
program; 11   these funds were also fully expended by the  and of 1987.
There have been virtually no new funds released for OMVSD's operating
expenses since then. At a donors meeting on the project in early November
1987, IDA and Government agreed in principle that OMVSD's operating budget
for an 18 month perlod through July 1989 would be financed as a prlority.
rehabilitation activity under the Agricultural Rehabilitation Project (Cr.
1775-CD) provided that certain condtilons were met by OMVSD and that the
Governmeat prepared a formal request to IDA.   OHVSD and the Government
appeared to have fulfilled these conditions six months later in May 1988, but
due to continuing inadequate response to IDAs questlons only an initial
tranche of US$80,000 (25 million CIAP) out of the total budget of one millon
dollars (320 million CFA?) was authorized.   In December 1988, IDA and
1I Project completlon report, Sahelian Zone Project (Cr. 739-CD), June
1984.



a 3 a
Government agreed that the remaining funds would be released in four tranchee
based on the volume of OHVSD's rice sales.  In the meantime, a May 1988
UNCDFIUNDP mission decided to eztend their assistance to the project through
March 1989, because some project funds remined and ONVSD was in a very
fragile.
2.4            The future of OMVSD and the irrigated perimeter is uncertain,
because of its serious management and financial problems. In 1986, ezpecting
that OMVSD's problems would be resolved, IDA comissioned a study for the
preparation of a second phase project. It was carried out by engineering
consultants with Italian Government funding and was presented to Government
and donors in early 1987. Concurrently, the ADV coiaLtted itself in the
1987-89 Interim Plan to finance a second phase study and indicated strong
interest in financing a follow-on project. 21 The torms of reference of
both studies were based on the old 1974 objective of a 10,000 ha polder area.
In view of OHVSD's contintuing and serious problems, in November 1987 the
Ministry of Planning and IDA agreed that before embarking on expansion of the
irrigated area, operations on the existing 1500 hectares should be improved,
OMVSD restructured, and rice marketing problems resolved. A joint
UNDPIUNCDFIFAO evaluation mission came to the same coaclualmn in May 1988.
A number of restructuring measures have been agreed upon, but it is too early
to judge the results. In the meantime, the Bank has undertaken a study of
the irrigation sub-sector in Chad which examines the issues conceroing OMVSD
in the broader contezt of Chad's rural development strategy.   In iddLtion,
the IDA Economic and Financial Management Project (Cr. 1872-CD) has flinaced
a diagnostic study of OVSD, including a restructuring plan submltted to the
Government in mid-1990.
II I PROJECT FORMULATION. DESCRIPTION AND IMPLEMENTATION
Identification, Preparation and Appraisal
3.1            The project was identified in 1966-67 by an TBRD mission, and
following an FAO-CP mission, was prepared to feasibility standards by
consultants under UNDP financing. It was appraised in November 1972 by an
IDA mission.
Negotiations and Board Approval
3.2            During negotiations in end 1973 and early 1974 agreement was
reached with Afrlcan Development Fund (ADF) and the government on the
following principal points: (i) establishment of ONVSD, a perastatal charged
with project management, by the government: (Li) signing of a subsidiary loan
agreement between the government and OMVSD; (iii) employment of consulting
firms by OVSD to assist in implementations (iv) zexmption by government of
project-financed goods and services from taxes and dutlesl and (v) signing
of a loan agreement between ADF and the government.
21 This study was put on hold by the Ministry of Planning's November 1987
decision.



4-
3.3            At its meetUng on March 26, 1974, the Board welcomed the
project, the Bank Group's asLstance, includLng flnancing of full project
costs, and the cooperatlon between IDS and AD?. It asked for clarifLcatLon
of three main poLntes (L) reasons for the project's long gestatLon perlod
of elght years to reach Board presentatLoni (LL) arrangements with Cameroon
governLng water use from the Logone rLvers and (Lii) the high contingencLes
used to calculate project costs. Regarding the first point, Bank staff
explained that the project had been delayed whlle cofinancing was sought, but
that in order to minimize the effects of the delay IDA had asked UNDP to
finance addLtLonal hydrologLcal studies and the preparatlon of tender
documents before the project was approved so that LnternatLonal competLtive
biddlng for civll works could begin immedLately after Board approval.
Regarding the second poLnt, staff replied that there was there was no reason
tQo cpscu that Cameroon would dlvert water from the Logone rlver, in excess
of what was agreed under the terms of the Chad-Cameroon Logone Water
Agreement. RegardLig point three, staff explained that the hlgh physlcal and
price contingencles of 332 on both local and forelgn costs was intended to
cover: a risk premlum that contractors were expected to include in thelr
bids due to the remoteness of the project area, and current trends in price
increases. Purthermore, slnce IDA and AD? were financing 1002 of the cost,
a conservative provlslon for contingencLes had been made.
3.4            The high contLngency allowance proved to be lnsuffLcLent
because of worldwide inflation ln the wake of the 1973 oll crLsis and lack of
compotition in the bidding process due in part to the project's remote
location and the uncertaln business climate in Chad.   Blds were twLce
appraisal estimates. A new construction approach was tested and in February
10, 1976, the Board approved a supplementary credlt of US$8.0 millon. The
Board commended the AssocLatLon's effort to adapt the project to conditLons
in Chad by combLning labor-intenulve methods and  equLpment under force
account as a substitute for extremely expensive foreign contracting.
The Proiect Area
3.5               The project is located on the Sategul-Deressia plain, on
the east bank of the Logone rlver (see Maps 1 and 2). the plain ts usually
flooded each year, allowLag the cultlvatLon of a single wet-season x. i crop.
However, from year to year. the extent of flooding, lts onset, and its
duration, can vary greatly: thus on five occasions during the last 20 years
the river has not overflowed its banks. Rlce cultivation was introduced in
the early 19409 and lt is the prlnclpal subsistence crop ln thLs area of
Chad. Non-Lnundated areas are used for growing other cereals and for cattle
grazing during the rainy season. In 1970, the population of the plain was
estimated at about 9,300 persons. In general, the population lives at the
subsistence level.   The health situation Ls poor, and malaria, amoebLc
dysentary, bllharzla and other parasitic dLseases are endemic. The plain is
connected to N'Djamena by the main road, N'Djmna-Bongor (250 km), and an
earth road, Bongor-Lal (148 km), whlch is impassable during the wet season.
(More information on the project area is given in Annex 1.)

Obiectives
3.6            In the early 1970s, the Chadian Government Save cotton and
livestock production top priority, but irrigation was also seen as a vitally
important means of combating the effects of frequent droughts. Millet and
sorghum are the traditional, staple cereal crops in Chad, but rice is
consumed by farmers in inundated areas in the south. The key objective of
the project was to increase productivity of rice production by introducing
controlled flooding in the OMVSD irrigated perimeter and by offering
extension services and inputs for more intensive cultivation outside the
perimeter. ThLs would raise incomes of small farmers and increase the
marketed rice supply to moet the expected rising demand for rice in urban
domestic market. A broader objective of the Government for thLs project and
the Lake Chad Polders project was to etart developing irrigation 'in spite of
its cost because it offered Chad an opportunity to begin to obtain the
expertise in irrigation technology, the trained Chadian personnel, and the
evolution of institutions needed to exploit its irrigation technology
effectively...  31
Proiect's Organization and Management
3.7            The implementation of the project was the responsbiliLty of
OMVSD, initially under the general supervision of the Ministry of Public
Works and Land Development (MTPAT) and subsequently of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR). OIVSD was specifically set up as
an etablissement public a caract&re industriel et cosm(rcial. to i)
construct, operate and maintain project works; (ii) allocate among farmers
land within the polderse (iii) provide extension services to project area
farmers; (iv) produce and distribute seeds; (v) procure and sell farm inputs;
(vi) operate an equipment rental scheme for seeders and threshers; (vii)
provide agricultural credit to project participants; (viii) purchase, process
and market paddy produced in the project area; and (ix) collect project
levies from polder area farmers.
3.8            Substantial resident technical assistance was finaced under
the original project. One consulting firm handled engineering and the other
provided management asssLitance and agricultural production experts until
1979-85 when OMVSD was on its own. In 1986, ONVSD was assisted by several
experts froa the first firm and by the end of 1986 a team of UNDP-financed
consultants was in place.
Proiect Components and History of Revisions
3.9            Original Design. The project investment activities consisted
of (i) construction of two polders irrigated by gravity and serving a net
cultivated area of 4,000 hag ($i) construction of 102 km of feeder roads;
(iii) rehabilitation of the existing Boumo Agricultural Research Station to
permit applied research and seed multiplication; (iv) construction of a rice

mill (4 tonsihour capacity), storge facilities, staff housing and office
building.; and (v) feasLbility studies for a second phase project.
3.10           Biddins Process  and Pllot  Scheme. In August 1974 and June
1975, bids were sought for irrigatloan works and buildingrs both times the
bLds received ezceeded by far the appraisal estimates.   Therefore, the
government, ADF, and IDA agreed to refor mlate the project. and detailed
plans for the initial developm_nt of a 300 ha pilot schem, through force
account and using labor-intensive methods, were prepared by consultants
financed under the project. The governnt, In November 1975, offered to
provide eartbmoving equipmnt, most of which was not otherwise being used, at
no capital cost to the project. It vas acknowledged that the operating costs
of this equipmen, would raise the cost of the pilot schemes however, It was
also clear that the government proposal would mak lt possible to expedite
project implementation, Increase the volu_ of earthwork (to bulld a canal
that vould meet further requirements tha serve only 300 ha) and construct
the polder at a more suLtable location.  IplemetatLon of the scheme began
in January 1976 and vas coupleted in June 1976.  The results deonstrated
that zexcuting civil works in the project area by force account, with som
heavy equipmnt, and under engineering consultants' oupervision wes a
technically feasible solution.
3.11           Reappraisal. Eacouraged by the results of the pilot scheme,
ID reappraised the full project in June 1976. The revised project was
essentially similar to the original project, but used the new construction
methods. It also Involved the following other changes: Ci) an increase In
net irrigated area from 4,000 ha to 5,000 hag (ii) a reduction In road
construction from 102 km to 70 k1m (LLL) transfer of the program of
agricultural research and demonstratLon from Boumo to a more favorable
location at Mala in the project area; and (iv) elimination of the study of
the second phase. The project was expected to be completed by June 30, 1980.
Supplementary IDA and ADP credits were approved to cover the additional cost.
Table 1 shows how the credit was reallocated after the reappraisal.

3.12           Interruption durlna the Clvil War. Uhe the clvll mar forced
ID to suspend disbursements in 1979, the constructLon of three polders
irrLgated by gravLty and serving a net area of 1,500 ha (30S of the project's
revLsed target of 5,000 ha) was nearly completed. ConstructLon of buLldings
and installatLon of the rice mill was also practlcally completed. The
irrigated perimeter continued to function during the war, but the hostilities
resulted in damage and losses involvings (i) looting of equlpment, supplies
and furnlture; (LL) deterioration of houses and offLces; (iLL) theft of most
cars and destructLon of trucks from the garage at Lais (iv) deterloratLon of
lrrlgation works due to a lack of maintenance; and (v) loss of project
records.
3013           Partial ResumptLon of Disbursements. A limLted resumptLon of
actlvlties vas authorLzed by IDA on Aprll 12, 1983 (US$ 227,500 over a six
month perlod) and again on December 28, 1983 (US$ 250,000 over a four month
perlod) for well-defined urgent needs. These included decLlting and cleaning
out the main canal (20,000 dn), repairs to the rmaining lrrigatlon and
drainage networks, the perimeter dikes and the compensatLon basin, upgrading
of the 15 km road Sategui-Lai, rehabliLtation of buildings in Lal, and repalr
of heavy agrlcultural machinery. The fLrst full Bank missLon to supervLse
thLs work was In February 1984. The mission and OWEDB  prepared a six-month
interim program (January-June 1984) for the 1984185 agrLcultural soason whilch
covered the costs of torrassing (60,000 o3), cilvl works (270 m3 of
concrete), procurement of agrlcultural inputs, and OKVSD'  essential
operating costs. The mission lnformed the Bank's anagement that the cost of
roughly US8531,000  could be partLally  financed by  the December 1983



disbursement ceiling, but that full resumption of disbursements by Hay 1984
would be required in order to successfully complete preparation of the
1984/85 season.  The interim program was designed as a precursor  to the
rehabilitation program which was to start-up in July.  Unfortunately, as
discussed below, disbursements were not fully resumed until May 1985 when the
problem of Chad's payments arrears to IDA was resolved. However, for the
most part the urgent repairs of the irrigation network included in the
interim program were completed.
3.14           Rehabilitation Program.    In 1983, the PAO, UNCDF, UNDP, and
WFP agreed to assist OHVSD in the rehabilitation of irrigation works for the
1,500 ha completed in 1979, including (i) upgrading of 70 km of feeder roadsl
(1i) repair of the rice mill, stores, buildings and workshops (Uii) purchase
of replacement equipment, vehLcles and machinery; (iv) provision of eztension
services: (v) applied research and seed productions and (vi) project
administration. An FAO mission helped prepare the UNDPIFAO (CCD/83/020) and
UNCDP (CHD/83IC03) project   documents.   The February 1984 Bank mission
appraised the thirty-month progam and judged it financially and economically
viable, but stressed that OMVSD needed to substantially improve its
management. The total program cost was estimated at US$5.7 million and IDA
agreed to finance OMVSD's operating costs which were not covered by the other
donors.
3.15           As explained ln para 2.2, the program's start-up was delayed
by moze than one year.   UNCDF and UNDP condltioned start-up of their
operation to full resumptlon of IDA disbursements, which was delayed until
May 1985 by slow progress on resolving the problem of Chad's arrears to IDA
after  the  war. 4/    Additional  delays  resulted  from  adminLstratlve
problems. The UNCDF and UNDP designated the FAO as the executing agency for
their funds. The flve person technical assistance team to be posted In Lai
included a Principal Technical Advisor and Management advisor who were to
oversee the day to day management of UNCDF and UNDP funds. The PAO had
serious problems recruiting good candidates for these posts and several of
the designated candidates dropped out at the last minute. The tern was not
complete until the end of 1986 when the Principal Advisor arrived. Overall
project management responsibllity was held by FAO officials in Rom.
Cumbersome procedures for procurement, communications difficulties within
Chad and between Chad and Rome, and the usual logistical problems in
importing goods to Chad led to long delays in the delivery of the vehicles
and equipment needed for the rehabilitation works. Most arrived during 1987,
but the last orders were not delivered until early 1988.
3.16           In order to start the program in 1986 desplte these serious
problems, the Bank mobilized support from the Italian Trust Fund to finance
the services of an engineer to assist OMNSD in managing the rehabilitation
works, the services of a mechanic to repair the vehicules and equipment
required for this work, and the purchase of essential spare parts and
equipment to enable the mechanic to do his work. With thLs support, 600
hectares were rehabilitated and utilized by farmers during the 1986 growing

Project (Credit 592-CD).



-9-
season. By late 1986 the technical assistance tern was in place and in 1987
most  of the  equipment was  delivered.    The  physical  targets  of  the
rehabilitation program were achieved in 1987 and the rice mill started
operating in April. Agricultural extension activities improved and were
reoriented to support the formation of farmers groups. Counterbalancing these
achievements were OHVSD's failed comercial activities and poor management
which did not improve despite repeated efforts by donors (see para 3.24).
OMVSD's financial situation was desperate by mid-1987. IDA monies for
operating expenses were fully disbursed by October 1987 and employees had not
been paid for months. At the end of 1987, it was agreed that IDA would
support  operzating  costs   through  mid-1989   tmder  the  Agricultural
Rehabilitation Credit, but virtually no funds were released in 1988 (see para
2.3).
Costs and  inancing
3.17           At  appraisal  total  project  costs  over  the  six  year
implementation period were estimated at US$ 12.0 iillion, with a foreign
exchange content of US$ 7.4 million or 621 of total cost. At reappraisal in
June 1976, the total costs of the revised project were estimated at US$ 25
million. IDA contributed US$ 15.5 mIllion and ADF US$ 8.9 million equivalent.
ADF funds were virtually fully expended in 1979 when ID  disbursemeat were
suspended and it did not resume financing the project in 1984.
3.18           The cost of the rehabilitation program vas estimated to be
US$5.7 million in 1984. IDA agreed to finance OHVSD's operating costs from
the remaining funds under Cr. 489-1-CD to complemeat URCDF's financing of
US$3.1 million for capital investment costs and establishment of revolving
funds for lnput and rice purchases, UNDP's financing of $900,000 (later
increased to US$1.4 million) for technical assistance, and VFP's contribution
of food for work valued at $110,000. Due to the problems discussed in para
2.2, the actual period of IDA financing was stretched out from the original
objective of threo years (1984-86) to five years. In 1986, IDA mobilized
Italian Trust Fund resources of approximately  US$200,000 to prV.F-Le vital
technical support in view of late arrival of UNDP financed team. In 1987, IDA
transferred US$ 0.5 million from Credit 739-CD to cover OMVSD'9 operating
costs for part of the addLtional year. Another US$1 million of IDA financing
(Cr. 1775-CD) was approved to support OMVSD's budget through 1989.
3.19           The total external financing to OMVSD under the rehabilitation
program (1984-1989) is estimated to be US$7.9 million (current prices); in
addLtion, the Italian Trust lund financed the second phase study. The total
project cost is estimated to be US$29.7 million (Annex 4, Table 2).
Disbursemnts
3.20           Both IDA credits were fully disbursed. It is neither possible
nor meaningful to analyze expendLtures by project component for the following
reasons. With partial resumption of dLsbursements in 1983, no redefinition
of disburseAmet categories was made despLte som substantial changes in the
nature of costs to be financed. As a result, after 1983 most expanditures
were arbitrarily placed under the Clvil Works Category. Bank staff should



- 10 -
have modlfled the disbursement categorLes when the substLtuto credlt
agreement wae prepared in 1985.
Renorting. Accountins and AudLting
3.21           Reporting.   Project reporting was unsatisfactory, another
indicator of OMVSD's management problems. OKVSD produced annual reports, but
the reports were often received late by the ank, and tbey vere too long, too
detaLled, and oft6a contained unimportant Information. Stnce lts arrlval In
late 1986, the UNDP fiamnced technlcal assistance team has prepared regular
reports on implementation of the rehabltitation program.
3.22          As one of the governamnt's flrst efforts to increase food
productLon through better utliLzatLon of eListing flood water r eources, the
project should have been carefully monltored and lts lipact evaluated.
However, during project planning and Implementation no specLflc attentLon was
given by the Bank or project managemet to thLs and lt was not done.
3.23           Several specific studies were undertaken prior to 1979 by one
of the consulting firms assisting OMVSD, including a socio-sconoalc study In
1977 and an evaluatLon of tbe future rLce productLon and consumptLon
prospects In Chad (1979). The planned health survey In the area was not
carrLed out. Other studLes on varlous speclflc topLcs such as the functionLng
of private cereals atrketLg channels and a comparLson of returns to raf fed
and irrigated rLce production would have been useful.
3 24          Accountina and Auditins.  Supervison mLssLons repeatedly
expressed concern over the lack of proper accouting and financial controls,
particularly since 1979 when technLcal assistance was abruptly rooved due to
the war before sufficlent Chadians had been trained to take over the work.
Numerous efforts were made to help OKVSD biprove. Supervilion mLssLons drew
attention to CMfSD*s overly centralLsed organization and recommded  easures
to improve project financial controls. In early 1985, a consultant analysed
the situation and prepared detailed proposals for new accounting and
financial  sanagemsnt  ystems and for reorganizatLon of the financial.
administratlve departmnt. One year later, he returned to help introduce the
new system, Including staff trainLig and recrulint of new staff.  Despite
considerable efforts and recamaendations by supervislon missLons of both the
Bank and UP agencies, the new systm is not operatlonal, because, apparently,
of a lack of comitmat by O"VSD's managmnJt.
3 25          Under pressuros of lack of operating funds and rice marketing
problems, CSVBD was as of June 1988 unable tot tl) reconstitute the Ul-
financed rv olving accounts for buyfing rice and lputs; (IL) repay its
seasonal credit from the ITCD for rlce buying; and CllL) relburse IDA for
the funds seized by bTCD from the project acco'nt to repay the seasonal
credit. OWSD used funds from thse sourcee to finance operating costs.
3.26           The most recent financial state met and audlt report are for
M1935316 and were subh$tted In mid-1987.  As of June 1988, the joint
UVCDVIUNDP evaluation mission reported that the accounts and balance sheet
for 1966 and 1987 had not been prepared.  It recOatnded that an *epert be



- 11 -
hired for six amoths to prepare the accounting documentss he arrived In Chad
in Decmber.
3.27           Caoliance with Covenants.  Compliance with the project',
legal obligations aader the credit agreement were not fully met in two main
areas: (L) article 4.01 (c), audit covenant, mad (ii) article 4.05, surzvy
of health conditions.
IV. DMPLDNCSTATION O CIVIL WORKS
4.1            The main investment components of the project were civil works
which accounted (including engineering and manage_ent supervision) for around
85Z of the total IDA credit for the reappraised project. The works consisted
of irrigation development, roads construction, rehabilitatLon and eztensLon
of mn ezisting agricultural station, and construction of a rice mill, storag
facilities, housing and office buildings. Targets and actual achievements
are examined below. Details are provided in Anaex 2.
Irrigation Works
4* 2           Orisinal Concept. The appraisal report sugested construction
of an intake on the Logone River, a 6.2 km main canal, a compeation basin
(to control the water supplied to the polders and to provide ma early water
supply to rLce-growing areas outside the polders), primary and secondary
canal networks to distribute lrripgtion water to independent blocks In the
polders, and a drainage system. on a trial basis, a 650 ha block was Intended
to be levelled mad equipped with an irrigation layout permitting water depths
to be controlled between 10 cm and 20 cm on the fields. No land levlling
was proposed for the other polder blocks where water control was Intended to
be achieved by contour buds dividing each block into two zones, one within
which water depth would not exceed 60 cm, and the other where water depth
would not exceed 30 cm.
4.3           Modified hAuroach. The concept of irrigation by controlled
flooding was maintained throughout, but levelling of a 650 ha block was
dropped in 1976; rather denelopmwit of about 4,400 hectares was planned with
blocks where water height was 60 cm for the MI polder and 30 cm for the
other polders. Another modLfication was the construction of two lateral
irrigation channes and one central drain, instead of a single zanal-drain as
planned In 1976. The intake and main canal have a capaelty for an eventual
enlargeunt of the polders to 10,000 ha (but only two sluice gates of seven
planned were Installed).
4. t-Working Methods. The calls for bids In 1974 and 1975 for the
execution of works by contractors had to be cancelled because only a few bids
were tendered and bid amounts were much higher than expected. Therefore it
was decided in 1975-76 to construct the main canal and dewelop a 300 ha pilot
scheme through force account guided by expatriate engineers and using locally
available equipmet.   Overall this experience vas positive and it vas
therefore decided to continua construction this way. Additional equipaent vas
ordered using international competitive bidding, but it dl* not arrcve
altogether at the same time and therefore construction work did not rcach



- 12 -
full pace until the end of 1977.  Work was finally stopped in may 1979
because of the civil war.
4.5              The planned and completed earth movement for th. irrigation
systems are shown in Table 2. Use of a suLtable mix of labor and machinery
permitted the project to consLderably exceed earth movement targets. If the
civll war had not disrupted the work, construction would probably have been
completed in 1980, according to the Initial target. The decision by IDA and
the government to carry out the works using labor under force account and
machinery, supervised by engineering consultants, thus proved to be the right
one, which had the additional beneflt of training the local staff and labor
force.

4.6       Selection of EauiuLmt and Quality of Execution.  Some of the
equipment procured under the project was inappropriate.   For instance,
self-loading motor scrapers would have been more suitable than the backhoes
and trucks which were used for excavation and filling. Trucks were chosen
that were supposedly also suitable for transporting rice and chemical
fertilizer, but this additLonal benefit of multlple uses was probabq,
marginal. The earthworks were mell zexcuted, and the dikes were cover6i
(couche de roulement) with carefully selected materials.



- 13 -
4.7       The larger concrete works wore built by local contractors. However,
they were not intereosted in the smaller works, which OMVSD consequently
executed on its own. Construction of small concrete works in the DSI and DS2
polders was delayed until 1986, because the construction equipment, whlch was
ordered in 1978, did not arrive at Lai due to the civil war. The design of
these works, using reinforced concrete instead of masonry, was not favorable
for easy execution.
4.8       Ooeratlon and Maintenance.  No written instructions for operation
and maintenance of the polders were issued. According to the engineering
consultants, this was the responsibility of the management consultants. It
is Impossible to find out which firm was responsible for this and why they
did not work together on this task; as a rulo, they reportedly collaborated
well. Due to the lack of specific OSM Instructions, project management was
unable to make adequate provLsion for mainteance of the work'.
Roads
4.9       The SAR suggested construction of a 102 km all-weather earth road
network in the project area. The planned 70 km of roads on the 3.50 m wide
dikes in the polder areas were built satisfactorily, in spite of the lack of
adequate materials such as laterite for paving. The engineering consultant
wisely selected soils offering sufficient CDR, which has kept erosion low.
The existing 32 km Lai-Banga road was rl.so to be improved. A call for bids
was prepared, but because of the cost overrun of the irrigation works this
part of the project was cancelled. This was an unfortunate decision.
Agricultural Station
4.10      The SAR suggested rehabilitation of the  200 ha lrrigation system
of the Boumo Agricultural Station; renovation and repair of buildings and the
carrying out of a program of applied research and seed multiplication.
However, the station was locatud far, roughly 30 km, from OKVSD's offices in
Lai. The outbreak of civil war prevented the startup of this work. After the
war, OMVSD decided to abandon the Boumo Station and to develop a new stati$n
at Mala, which is located only 7 km fro  OMVSD.  The  applied research and
rice seed multiplication programs are discussed in paras 5.8-5.9.
Rice Hill
4.11      The rice mill of 12,000 tons paddy capacity ffinanced by the ADF was
completed as planned in 1979.  The buLldings wer  constructed by local
contractors under the supervision of the engineering consultants. When the
project came to a stand-still in 1979, the millwas still being tested and
had not yet been officially turned over to OMVSD by the supplier. There were
long delays in getting the mill working after the war, in part due to a
dispute between the supplier and OMVSD concerning an outstanding payment
dating from the war period. A UNDP/FAO consultant mission in 1985 identifLed
the repairs required as a result of damage incurred during the war and some
necessary improvements, which were subsequently carried out under the
rehabilLtation program.



- 14 -
4.12      The rlce m.ll  becam  operatLonal in March 1987. Since OMVSD had
problems in securing funds for the purchase of paddy from project farmers,
purchases began only in March, although harvesting began in December 1986.
In the mantime many farmers resorted to selling paddy on the local market to
private traders and migrant livestock producers (for transport to the north).
About 2,500 tons of paddy from the 1986187 agricultural season were callected
and 2,200 were illecd ln 1987. Mlling yielded 691 of gross paddy, which li
a satisfactory result. However some technlcal problems were ncountereds (i)
the paddy collected by OKVSD contained many Impurities (3-42 of foreign
matter); (11) since the paddy was collected long after the harvest, it was
very dry for millings as a result the share of flrst qualLty rice was low
(321 of paddy) and that of low-value broken grains (which was not likely to
cover milling costs) was high (371 of paddy): and (III) the full capacLty of
the mi  was only obtained with the varlety S. Kong-Pao  (4 t/h) but
performance was poor wLth the variety IR 46 (3 t/hour).
4 13      Due to financlal problems stexming in large part from the inabilLty
to sell the 1986187 milled rice, only 518 tons of paddy were purchased in
1987188 and 3,000 tons in 1988189.   In effect, the rlce mill has only
operated for two full seasons and even then it was not under normal
condltLons since the buying and mLlling bogan at the end of the season. From
the limited cost data avaLlable, lt appears to be operating at a loss (para
3.26).
Buildings
4.14      The offices, workshops, store, staff housing and felld warehouses
store were bullt as planned. They were constructed on force account; OKVSD
provLded the buLlding materLals to workers who were paid on a task basis. A
servlce statLon for fuel wlth a fuel auge was not installed untll June 1988,
therefore large alosses are likely to have occurred In the past.
4.15      Som  problems remains (L) the drinking water is pumped from the
Logone RLver instead of from a tubewell; and (i1) the powerful 160 HP
electrlcLty generators sere both the rlce mall and the resLdentLal area.
Generator capacity is therefore excessive when the mall is not working.
V. PRODUCTION ACTiVMTIZS AND AGRICULTURAL WHACT
5.1       The project's key objectlve was to lncraso the productivLty of
rice productLon and thereby productLon and incomes by litroducing controlled
flooding in the Lrriated perimeter and by proiding extension servLces,
inputs and equipment to farmers wthin and outside the perimter.  OXVSD*s
DLrectLon de mLso en valour (Mf) was responsible for production support
activities  Including  applied  research,  seed  production,  extenasLon,
inputlequip.ent supply and credit, allocation of parcels Ln the polder, and
water management. These actlvlties and the project's impact are discussed
below.  Since there Is a lack of rellable data, the assesmont of the
project's Impact Ls based on production statistics compiled by OKVSD (with

Intended Impact
5.2       At appraisal, it was *etimted that the project would Increase
annual paddy production from 8,000 toans to about 20,000 tons at full
development by increasing yields and the area under rice cultivation. Actual
yields in the Sategui Deressia plain prior to the project were estimted to
be as high as 1.4 to 1.8 t/ha of paddy in favorable years, with an average
yield of 0.9 tlha. The project was expected to increase yields to a* average
of 2.5 tlha of paddy on the 4,000 hectares In the Irrigated perimeter. 5/
Outside the polder area, the project was eopected to Increase yielda to an
average of 1.4 tlha - I paddy for an area of 6,860 ha based on use of good
quality seed, fertilizer (30 kgiha of urea) and phytosanitary chemlcals.
5.3       The project was ezpected tc Improve the Incom  of 2,400 farm
families (11,500 persons).   Returns from  rice growing were expected to
increase substantiallyt net income per Irrigated hectare was ezpected to
increase on average by 67Z from ClAF 14,580 to CVAF 24,379.
Revised Production Objectives and Target Grouip
5.4       Revised production targets were set In 1984 for the rehabilitation
progrm. The yield assumptions did not change significantly (2.5 tlha within
the polder and 1.5 tlba outside the polder), but the project area was reduced
to 1,500 ha under irrigation and 2.700 ha under rainfed farming which lowered
ezxpected incresmntal production at full davelop nt to 4,020 tons of paddy
per year, one third the original project's objective.
5.5       OKVSD's criteria for attributing irrigable plots to fanrs was
also modified. Originally, plots wssr two hectares and farmers were required
to own a draft animal and equipt-ait and to have suffLcient labor. Many
farmers had lost their equipmsnt and draft animals during the war and found
it dlfficult to cultivate the two hectare plot, so under the rehabilition
program the plot size was reduced zo one hectare and the other requirement
dropped. This was a positive dci*tanu which modified the project's target
group, originally consisting of ai relatively well-off farmers, 6I to
include the average smallholder.
5/ The TaiLan and MI11 varieties proposed (mainly IR 22) for the irrigated
perimeter were epected to yield 2.9 t/ha paddy ith full water control (30
cm depth) and application of 150 kglha of urea, and 2.4 t/ha with partLal
water control (30 to 60 cm) and 50 kglha of urea.
6/ A socio-economlc, sample survey of farmers in the project area conducted
in 1977178, prior to the war, found that only half of the farmers outside
the irrigated perimeter owned a plow and only half owned a draft animl.

Production Services
1. Agricultural Extension
5.6       Prior to 1980, the extension service was large and their attitude
towards  farmers was  authoritarian.   Due  to  attrition,  its  size was
substantially reduced during the war and it was reorganized under the
rehabilitation program. In 1987 over 3,000 project farmers were given advice
by a total of 27 OMVSD extensLon agents (17 inside and 10 outside the
polders), giving a farmers/agent ratio of 88 to one inside the polder and 175
to one outside.   The total number of farmers benefitting from OMVSD's
extension services was higher than foreseen at appraisal due to the fact that
starting in 1984 the size of irrigable area assigned to each farmer was
reduced from 2 to 1 ha. In order to facilitate extension, water magnaement
and maintenance activities, in 1987 OKVSD decided to encourage formation of
farmers groups by reallocating lrrigated plots. Farmers of the same
village/ethnic group were placed in the same hydraulic sub-sector. Ninety
groups with 20 to 50 members each have been formed.
5.7       Technical messages were not wvel defined during appraisal and oan
tue whole they were not widely adopted. Farmers did adopt higher-yielding
rice varieties (IR 46 and I Rong Pao) and a moderately higher planting
densLty (from 40 to 70 kg/ha). However, use of Inputs (seed. firtilizer and
insecticide) was hindered by OKVSD's failure to provide a sufflcient quantity
and to deliver them on time. First priority was given to the irrigated plots.
and therefore the objective of 2,700 hectares being cultivated with improved
methods and Inputs outside the irrigated perimeter wae not achieved; 1,400
hectares is the revised objective for the 1988 season.   Two Important
recomendations for the irrlgated plots, respect of the crop calenadr and
construction of small earth dams to delimit each plot, were not wldely
adopted by farmers. Poor water avaLlabliLty and an uncertain market for rice
undoubtedly affected the farmer's assessment of the desirability of adopting
the extension mesages.
2. Research and Seed Multilicaton
5.8       Applied research focussed on  (i) selection of suitable rice
varietiess (11) seed density and planting techniques; and (iii) type and
dosage of fertilizer application. Results obtained conflrmed the validity of
varieties already largely grown in nearby Irrigation schemes at Yagoua
(Cameroun) and Bongor; the seed rate for row planting was flzed at 70 kg/ha.
RPKSB fertilizer at a rate of 50 kg/ha was found effective to control
frequent chlorosis attributed to sulphur deflciencies and induced by the use
of urea. However, research work faLled to lnvestigite important topics like
organic manuring, development of appropriate ox drawn equipmeat for land
levelling, earth buanding and weeding, and selection of crops better suited
than rice to the non-flooded parts of the plain.
5.9       The site chosen for the seed farm vas too far from Lai and between
1976-1979 390 tons of seed were produced on 100 hectares in the polder. In
1986, a new seed farm of 70 hectares was established at Mala, but the first
production season resulted in poor quality seed, low yields and high costs.
Since seed production was insufficLent in most years, OMVSD resorted to



- 17 -
distributing seed from other sources which was often poor quality and
resulted in a mixing of varieties.   In 1987, an experiment vith seod
multiplication by a network of 50 specially-trained farmers proved
successfull they achieved yields of 3.5 tlha which halfed the production
cost. OMVSD intends to increasingly rely on fanmers for multLplication of
certified seed while the seed farm would be used for production of the
foundation seed. ONNSD should coordirate its program with the national seed
production center at Gassi. As part of Its eventual restructuring, OKVSD
should consider turning over redponsability for foundation seed production to
the national center while continuing to promote multiplication of certified
seed by farmers.
3. Farm Inputs, Eauivment and Credit
5.10      OHVSD was unable to supply the quantity of Inputs and equipment
planned by the project and demanded by farmers, primarily because of lts
financial problems. In its first phase (1976-79), the project dLitributed
278 tons of seed and 273 tons of fertilizeor in its second (1985-1988), it
distributed 564 tons of seed and 814 tons of fertilizer. (See Annez 1, Table
2 for details). Fertilizer use was almost entirely confined to the irrigable
polder. A total of 1,087 tons was distributed, of which 752 was urea and 25X
NPKSB. As discussed above, the seed distrLbuted by the project (713 tons)
did not always moet standards. InsectLclde treatments were not necessary on
a regular basis and were applied on less than 10 of the cropped area per
year.
5 11      OMVSD provided short and medium term credit to rice growers.  A
total of CFAF 26.2 million equivalent of farm inputs was dLstributed between
1976-1979, over CIAW 100 million during the war years (1979-1984), and an
annual average of CFAF 50 million in 1986 and 1987. From 1976 to 1985 credit
was restricted to farm inputs; beginning in 1986 it also covered farm
equipment. A total of 338 plows, 151 ox-drawn carts and 970 sicklers was
provided under the project. 71  Weeding implements and  mall mechanical
threshers were not distributed as foreseen, because weeding implements were
not considered necessary by project field staff, and IR 46 is easily threshed
by hand and therefore mechanical threshers were not required. Loans were
generally recovered after the harvest. with the exception of loans for plows
and carts which were given on two to three year ters. Loans for inputs they
were generally recovered in kind (paddy valued at official producer price).
Terms for fertilizer and seeds were 10 per season, whLie for plows and carts
it was 101 per annum. Repayments of loans were high (over 961) during 1976-
1978, almost nil from 1979 to 1985 during the period of unrest, and reached
881 (CIA? 67 million) in 1986/87. Part of the repayment problem in recent
years undoubtedly steumed from poor rice harvests due to the low flood level
and late purchase of rice by OMVSD.
4   Water Nanaaemnt and O&M
5.12      The appraisal mission and consulting engineers did not appear to
give much thought to issues of water management and ONM (see para 4.8). The

appraisal report Indicates that OKVSD wvii operate and maintain the irrigated
perimiter sad farmr. wLii pay a levy of 101 of gross production to cover O&
costs. other than thLs payment, farmor' particiption was not considered.
As dLscussed In para 5.14, water supply to the perimter was inadequate in
six out of tw-lv years since the project began. The problm was magnifLed
by the fact that water distribution within the perimeter was tnadequate,
because finishing works on the parcels (levelling, sub-dlvision with earth
dam, etc.) was not copleted. This resulted in scrlous disparities in water
availabililty, and farmes and OSVSD took ad hoc measures to try to get access
to water. During the last two seasons, OMVSD has trled to ameliorate the
problem by sub-dividing the perimter into 30 hectare blocs and by prowting
the formatlon of farmer groups to help manage and maintain them. sowecer,
some design improveents are needed to ensure a more reliable water supply
and better distribution of water (see Annez 2).
5.13      The lamnr lovy for O&M Is paid In kind or cash at the time of rice
marketing. It was reinstLtuted in 1966 and set at about 11,000 CAFW/ha; lt
was raised to 21,600 CVAN/ha in 1987. The PCd mission was unable to get
precise informtion on payments, but they are apparently fairly good.
However, the levy is high relatlve to farera Income (see para 5.21).
Furthermore, farmers may resent the Increased level of the levy since
services have not improved appreciably.  Several issues will have to be
seriously examined in thinking about OKVSD's futures does the levy correspond
to the real cost of 01K or is it Inflated by CKYSD's poor management, and
could the levy be reduced by gLving farmers a greater role in managing and
maintaining the perimeter,
Project's Imact
1. Climatic and Hydrologlc Conditions
5.14      The project's impact on production was ad*trsely affected by
unfavorable rainfall and hydrologic conditLons, particularly since 1984.
Climatic conditions were generally such drler thau *xpected; average annual
rainfall vas about 100 - below the standard level (1,000 m) and flooding of
the Logone was of much shorter duration and vLrtually ail in 1964 and 1965.
(See Annex 1, Table 3). The scheme's design was based on a reservoir being
filled by the annual flooding, yet In siz of the past 12 years the reservoir
was not properly filled (1977, 1980, 1982, 1984, 1985, and 1987).
2. Land Use
5.15      The appraisal mLssLon assumed that farers would increase the area
of paddy cultLvation during the project from an estimated 9,000 hectares in
1974 to 11,000 ha. However, the paddy area in the plain gradually decreased
to 6,000 ha in 1988. Rlce production appears to have become less Important,
decreasing from approprLately 80 of the total cropped area In 1974 to about
SO in 1988. The main reason for thls is farers adjusting their cropping
pattern to the deterioration in natural flooding and climtic conditions for
rice production. However, rice cultivatLon is still very Important and rice
rmains the staple food of the local populatLon and an Important source of
cash.



- 19 -
3. Paddt Production and Yields
5.16      Despite the negative factors of low rainfall and flooding, and lack
of inputs, average paddy yields obtained In the lttigable polder achieved the
target of 2 5 tons/ha.  There is considerable variability among annual
averages due to dlffercnces in climatic condltions and input/eztension
supply, and among farmers (varying from  1 to over 4 t/ha).  The latter
differences are explained by (i) variations of soil qualLty and topography
within the polders, and (ii) farmers' rates of adoption of recomended crop
calendar and cultural practices. During 1987, a dry year, seed fasers who
applied the recommended dose of 150 kg/ha of fertilizer produced on average
3.5 t/ha of paddy; this result indicates considerable potential to mprove
yields with good husbandry practices.
5.17      Information is less reliable for plots outside the polder, but lt
appears that the average yield obtained by project farmwrs under rainfed
conditions also reached the appraisal target of 1.5 t/ha. Yields vere higher
Cup to 2/t/ha) during good rainy seasons.
5.18      The original production targets of 1974 were not met (para  5.2),
due to the considerable reduction of cropped area seved by the project. The
rehabilitation program's objective was not met either, because the area
assisted outside the polder was 1,400 hectares Instead of the target of
2,700. (Refer to Annex 1, Table I for details.) In 1988, project farmers
are expected to produce 5,880 tons of paddy instead of the original appraisal
objective of 7,800. Over fourteen years, it Is estimted that the project
has increased total paddy production in the SateguL-Deressia plain by about
1,000 tons, from 8,000 tons in 1974 to 9,000 tons In 1988, despite a decrease
in rice area.
4. Farm Incomes and Production Costs
5.19      Farm budgets have been prepared for rice production on a per
hectare basis since no data were available on the entire holding. (See Annex
1, tables 4-8.) Four situations were consLdereds (1) traditional rainfed
cultivation (or the without project situation); (ii) improved rainfed
cultivation outside the polder (which benefitted from project extension);
(III) irrLgated cultivatlon inside the polder; and (iv) Intensive irrigated
cultivation inside the polder (seed farmers).
5.20      If one assume that traditional farmrs sell in the local market
at 40 CFAFikg paddy (market prices go as low as 10 to 25 CFAP/kg) and project
farmers sell their output at the price of 60 CFA1/kg whlch OKVSD paLd during
the last two seasons, net incomes and returns to labor are two to three times
higher for project frmers. However, if one assusis that all farmers receive
the lower market price then project farers are no better off (see figures in
parentheses) due to the high level of productlon costs. Farmrs are likely
to face this unfavorable situation in 1988 when innovations in ONVSD's
marketing approach Include an Initial payment for paddy based on the past
year's market price.

5.21           Production  costs  per  ha  in  the  irrigable  polder  have
substantially  increased.   Assuming the favorable price of 60 CFAF/kg,
production costs are on average 30S to 45S of farmers' gross revenues. Under
theee circumstances, farmers, incentives are insufficient and the yield
target of 2.5 tlha set at appraisal is too low compared to results obtainable
outside the polder (74? of the income with only 442 of the production cost);
they are obviously worse at the lower producer price. 8/ One of the main
cost components is the project levy for O&M set at CVAP 21,600/ha (equivalent
to 360 kg of paddy) in 1986/87. The levy appears to be high compared to the
present low yields inside the perimeter, since it amounts to 17S of th,
average gross production obtained by farmrs. If irrigated rice production is
to be remunerative, yields must be increased and production costs reduced.
This will require considerable effort by OHVSD to reduce input costs and
improve their quality, improve water management, discern actual OUM costs and
try to reduce them, and encourage better crop husbandry; new investment may
be required to improve water availability and distribution (see Annez 2).
S. Health
5.22           Health statistics are not avaLlable, and a planned survey of
the health situation in the project area was not carried out. However, local
health center officials claim that the incidence of endemic diseases rose in
those years when there was an increase in the period of inundation. Health
services and facilities in the area continue to be poor and no specific
additional measures were taken to control diseases as originally planned at
appraisal. The health situation in the relatively densely populated project
area is poor. The lack of health care may eventually become a constraint to
increasing produc:ion. A survey of the situation in the project area to
provide basic data needed for planning health servlces and facilities should
be carried out.
Economic Rate of Return
5.23           At appraisal the project's economic rate of return (ERR) was
estimated at about 14?, taking account of all project capital and recurrent
8I The BIEP's report, *Etude de la filiere rizn (Juin 1988), came to the
same conclusion for OMVSD. It also compared the seven types of rice
production systems found in Chad and concluded that under actual
circumstances of low rice prices, the more intensive production systems are
the least remuerative to farmers (in terms of both net revenue and returns
per manday).



- 21 -
costs with the exception of 402 of road costs that were charged against non-
project activities and of the studLes for the second phase project. No ERR
was calculated for the re-appraisal project. The ERR of the rehabilitation
program was estimated to be 132, considering the expenditures up to 1984 as
sunk costs. The project's actual EtR is negatlve, even if one makes highly
favorable assumptionos project cost prior to the war (21.6 million) as a
sunk cost, operating costs ($.5 million/year), Lvnistment life (20 years) and
incremental output (3,000 tons paddy/year).  In only three out of twelve
years (1979, 1985 and 1988) dld the project generate incremental output and
the amount was minimal. (See Annex 1, Table 1).  For both projects, the
implementation period was much longer than expected and the costs higher. The
financial rate of return is even les favorable, because of the low market
prices for rice and OHVSD's subsLdizing of the producer price.
Rice Marketing
5.24           The  rice  marketing  problems  which  arose  in  1986 were
unforeseeable. but OMVSD's inability to cope oteme d from its rigid pricing
and marketing system and to the project's investment in a large, modern rice
mill. 'When the project was appraised, Chad had a regulated cereals pricing
and marketing system (whic': did not work very well) In which a Governmeat
agency set prices and, in t4e case of rice, parastatals handled milling and
marketing. The project fit this system, but by 1979 lt was abolished. OKVSD
continued to pay an authorized producer and sale prlce, but it is not clear
whether it was obligated to do so. In 1978 when prices were high due to
drought, the official OHVSD price (25 CFAF/kg paddy) was below the market
price, but in 1986 cereals prices fell sharply and ONVSD's guaranteed
producer price (60 CFAF/kg) was well above the market price (35 CFAFIkg) and
its ex-mill sale price was above the consumer price. OMVSD did not adjust
its prices to the market forces which admittedly were beyond its control.
They included: (i) the unjudLcious and widespread distribution of food aid;
(Li) good rainfed cereal harvestsl (iii) low purchasing power of many
consumers, and strong cross elasticity of demand for cereals. Low prices
have persisted and for the 1988 marketing season OMVSD has taken some
measures. It has introduced marketing by farmers groups (based on the cotton
model) in order to reduce costs and has gotten farmers to agree to recelve
only 502 payment for their rice when it is sold, representing roughly the
market price of 35. This is an improvement, but objective criteria must be
established for making the second payment, so that farmers' interests are
defended.
5.25           Construction of a rice mill was in line with the conception of
0NSD as a vertically integrated parastatal which would operate as a
commercial enterprise. The mill was expected to process 12,000 tons of paddy
when the project was at full development, approzimately one-third of all
paddy marketed in Chad in 1979, and produce a large proportion of high
quality whole-grain rice. However, this did not correspond to the dynamics of
the Chadian market. A majority of Chadian rice consumers prefer to eat dishes
prepared with rice flour: this was pointed out in a 1979 study whlch



- 22 -
recomanded that a crusher be purchased for the OMVSD mill. 91 They also
prefer the flavor of hand-milled rice. Purtherore, consumers treat rice as
a substitute for staple cereals--millet *ad sorghum-.and demand for rlce is
highly elastic depending upon relative prices. lice prices have tended to be
more stable durlnn drought, due to imported food aid, than staple cereals
prLces wiLch escalated for example from 1980-1985, and consequently rice
consumption tends to go up. However, once cereals production is back to
nonmal, demand for rLce falls off and prices drop.  10l
5.26           CMVSD's rice mill was not suLted to the ChadLan market.  Its
capacity was too larle relative to the market *lsc and lt vas designed to
maoimise production of high quality rice which dld not correspond to
consumers' taste and which was more expens_ve. It was a costly lnvestmnt-.
more than one million dollars--which is costly to operate. A comparison of
rice milling costs in Chad in 1967 found OKVSD to be the most expensive.
This is not surprising since In 1987 lt only operated at 20S capacity and
depreciation costs are high, but it lndLcates OKVSD's dLfficulty in competing
with other marketing agents. More serLous attention should have been given
during preparation and appraisal to comparing the option of a large, modern
rice-mill with smaller capacity husker. (artisinal mills) which are less
expensive, suLted for private management, and whose mllled rice would have
been more suited to preferences of Chadian consumers In hindsight, both the
original 1973 and 1984 decisions to build and rehabilitation the rice mill
were mistakes.
Overall Assessment of Proiect's Imoact
5.27           Implemntation of the project's civil works was reasonably
good. The new construction approach proved adapted to Chadlan conditions and
a small group of Chadian technlcLans were trained. Their expertise can be
used ln future projects in Chad. However, design of the lrrlgation works did
not take into account suffLciently the risk of low flood levels nor were
water management and maintenance actLtivies sufficlently thought out. As a
consequence, the serious deterloration In climatic and hydrological
conditLons had a severe impact on the irrigated perimeter's functioning and
substantially  reduced  the  project's  benefits.          Construction  and
rehabllitation of the moder rice mill appear In hindsight to have been a
mistake.
5 28           The project's achievements on the agricultural production side
are weak compared to its record on civll works. Until recently, extension
services were weak and mssages were not being adopted by famers, in part
due to OKYSD's lnablilty to supply the requlred amount and quality inputs.
Yield targets were achieved, but lt appears that they were too conservative
from a technical point of view. However under the present conditions of a
depressed rice market and high input costs, there are lnsufflcient lncentlves
for farmrs to adopt the project's recomAndatione. In the past, farmers

1987. 1/
VI. INSTITUTIONAL P3RIORKANCE
6 1            Thli project was complex from an Institutional point of views
(L)  modern irrigation was a new activLty in Chad and there were relatively
few experLenced ChadLans in thLs field; (Li) a parastatal with multifaceted
responsibiltLes was created to implement the project; 111i) OMVSD was being
assisted by two consulting fIrms, but the division of labor between them was
not always clear; and (iv) both the orLginal project and rhabiliLtatLon
program were being financed by several donors who did not have experience
working together in Chad.   Problems arLsing from these  factors were
exacerbated by the clivl war's disruption and the tremendous transportation
and communicatLon difficultLes both within Chad and between Chad and other
countrles.
OMVSD
6.2            The  creation  of  OMVSD  was  a  specific  conditLon  of
effectiveness for the IDA credit.   OMSYD was to handle all operations
including constructLon and maintenance of irrigation works;  production
support actlvitLes such as research, extensLon end credits and the purchase,
mlling and sale of project produced rice.   Since OMVSD was new and
irrigation was a new activity in Chad, substantial reiLdent technical
assistance for both management/agricultural productlon and engineering
support was financed under the original project, equlvalent to 28Z of the IDA
credit amount.  The rebabilitation program  provlded for a team  of flve
experts. On the posLtive slde, ONV8D's technical perforcmnce in constructing
and rehabilitating the lrrlgation works was generally satisfactory.  IDA
supervision mLssLons and the PCR mLssLon were Impressed with the colmitment
and performance of the field staff in LaL who often went for months without
getting paid. However, most attentLon of the flild staff was concentrated on
constructLon actlvitLes, and their interest and expertLse In agricultural
activities was less.
6.3            On the negative siLd, OMVSD's poor management capacLty has
seriously impeded project implementation.   This was a Comm=  them  of

rehabliltation program found that OHVD's managment wva weak and grgued that
OMVSD must reduce lts overhead and operatlonal costs and improve lts
commerclal actlvltles Ln order to become financially self-supportLng. Like
simLlar parastatals in Chad (SODELAC, COTOKTCHAD) and elsewhere ln AfrLca,
OMVSD's inefficiency stems primarlly from Lts large offlce and centralizatLon
of declslon-making in the capital cLty, 400 km from the project slte. Senlor
OMVSD management ln N'Djamena failed to delegate authorLty to fleld managers.
AdmlnLstrative and finaneLal matters were handled in N'Djamena whLch slowed
down project actlvities in the remote SateguL-Deressia area which was
inaccessible for seeral months of the year.  The 19S4 supervisLon report
recommended that the headquarters staff in NIDjamena be substantially reduced
and that the key adminLitratlve and finan cla functLons and personnel be
reassigned to Lai. It was also recommended that the management capacity at
Lal be strentheneds ln early 1984, there was only one person (trained ln
agriculture) who was responsible for the divlsLon handling commercLal
operations--input supply, credit adminiLtratLon and rlce marketing up to the
factory gate (the rlce mill was not yet operational). Some improvements were
made in management at Lai.
6.4            As dLscussed in para 3.24-3.26, OMVSD's financ al management
and controls are weak. A new accounting and financial management system was
proposed in 1985 along wlth a plan for restructuring the Finance and
AdmlnistratLon Department: assistance was provided in 1986 to implement it.
Also, as part of the rehabilitation program, a technical assistant In
management joined the project in Aprll 1986, but he proved to be the wrong
person for the job and left after thLrteen months.   In May 1987, the
FinancLal Department was officially transferred to Lai, but this was in fact
an on-paper change and the vork continued to be centralized in N'Djamena. In
November 1987, donors and Government agreed to some restructuring measures,
but OMVSD dragged its feet. Finally, in June 1988, OMVSD agreed to transfer
some staff to Lal. In sum, a few of the proposed reforms have been
implemented in a half-hearted manner, but after five years of constant
discussion there has been no real improvement in OMSD's management.
6.5            The appraisal report was optimLstLc about OMVSD's prospects
for becoming financLally self-sufficient by the end of the project's six-year
period. By that time, it estimated that OMVSD's revenues from the sale of
milled rice and the levy paid by farmer for OW would cover its operating
costs, working capLtal requirements and funding of short term credlt to
farmers   OMVSD's financial sLtuation was expected to be so good that it
would be able to fully repay the IDA and ADF credits on-lent to it by the
Government. Unfortunately, this has not been the case.
6.6            OaWSD's costs have been high because of mismanagement and
inefficiency (para 6.3) and its revenues have been vlrtually nil most years
partly due to factors beyond its control (par, 5.24-5.25). The rice mill did
not become fully ope uational until 1987. Due to a drastic drop in cereal
prlces, 0VSD faced serious problems selling mllled rice at a prlce which
would cover Lts costs and lt was unable to replenlsh its rlce marketing
revolving fund untll recently. Due to Lts financial problems, OMNSD started
each marketing campaign late (para  * 13) whlch has limLted the quantitLes
purchased. As a result, OMVSD sold milled rlce in only four out of the last
flfteen years, and milling and transportatLon costs have consumed the



- 25 -
potential profit margin.  Concerning the other source of revenues, OKVSD
began collecting the levy for O0M recently (pars 5.13). Since the levy was
collected In kind (set quantity of rice), the rice marketing problems delayed
the availability and reduced the value of these payments.   Furthermore,
since water resources and management of the perimeter have been poor because
of weather, design and human factors, farmere have often been unable or
reluctant to pay the 014 charges.
6.7            ONVSD's financial situation is disastrous.  For the period
1983-1986, OMVSD's operating losses ranged from $1.0 to $5.0 mlIlion a year.
Its long tern debt, guaranteed by the Governamnt of Chad, is roughly $23
million, and its assets are valued at only $3 million. Glven its present
structure and the vagarLties of the rice market in Chad, there is uo hope
that OHVSD will become  financially viable.   It prerently  requires a
Government subsidy of $700,000 per year.
6.8            OMVSD has faced many problem which were outside its controls
poor rainfall, late and inadequate financing of operating costs,
deterioration of rice marketing prospects, complicated donor requirements and
lack of donor coordination. However, none of these explain why OMVSD has
failed to implement the lnternal reforms being discussed since 1984. After
five years, the only plausible explanation is that OKVSD's senLor managemnt
does not want to lmplement these reforms and that the Chadian Governmnt has
not forced them to do so. The dissolution of OKVSD is required and a
radlcally dlfferent organization should be conceived. OMVSD's current
functions could be gradually handed over to farmers, private contractors and
traders, and other Government agencies (ONDi, IICT, Ministry of Agriculture).
Consultants
6.9            Two consulting firms provided resident technical assistance to
the project until their departure due to the civil war in 1979. The
performance of the managem_ntlagricultural productLon consultants can not be
assessed,  because of lack of sufficient information.   The eo  .sering
consultants conducted the inltial design study, provided resident technical
assistance through 1979 and continued to be involved in the project at
various times since then. Their performance was sizeds (i) the initial study
was based on topographical surveys at the l:4,000 scale obtained by
photogrammetry. This was done at the request of the Bank, in an attemt to
reduce  the  duration  of the  study.    However,  this  technlque  is not
satisfactory for a rice irrigatlon scheme, and the survey had to be carried
out once more which delayed the planning; (l) the initial topographic
surveys were not refined during project executions (iii) the original
hydrological studles were not updated and the concept of the irrigation
development was not reviewed, In the light of the 1972-74 drought, when the
project was revised in 1976; it would have been appropriate at that stage,
for instance, to separate the irrigation and drainage networks in the Ml;
(iv) water levels in the polders were not measured, therefore project
managment was not in a position to continuously re-ezamlne the a arlier
assumotions on water requirements and losses; the lack of gauges in the
polders has not allowed comparison between the real outflows and those
predicted by the consultants; (vi) the procedures for operation and
maintenance of the works were not recorded in manuals and therefore were not



- 26 
readily available to project field stafft and (vLi) the planners had only
seen the occurence of years of high floods and did not propose ways to reduce
the inconvenience of weak floodsI the additional costs of deepening the main
canal and constructing cross regulators would have been low (see Annex 2).
6.10           The ezecution of project works and the 1986 rehabiltation
activLties0 under the supervision of the engineering co:%eultants, was
generally satisfactory. However, records on quantities and costs of works
and maintenance were not kept separate, and therefore an opportunity was lost
for project management to base future work programs on actual experience. A
large number of expatriate staff (up to 15 in 1977-78) was recruited; thLs
was costly and may ha" been excessive.
6.11           The second phase, feasablilty study was carried out by the
engineering consultants In 1986 under Italian Government funding and vith IQ
staff supervision. The study had a number of weaknesses Ci) the engineering
proposals are thoroughly studied; however, In our view, some are not
realistic (e.g., construction of a shoulder across the Logone River to raise
the water levl at the main intake. generation of power for the mllI by
burning rice straw); (IL) the fundamental premLso that total availability of
lrrLgation water has deteriorated to unrelLable levels should be reexamined
and confirmedg (III) the potential markets for addltional rice production are
treated naively and consideration of developents for alternative crops
(especially maize. sorghum and mllet) are almot ignorted (despite both
topics being specified In the terns-of-reference); and (v) the financial and
economic analyses are weak, especially with regard to creating a wholly self-
financing operation.
Co-financir ADF
6.12          aIVSD had difficulty coping with the different requirements of
IDA and ADl. In particular. ADV s procurement methods and delays in the
disbursemat of the ADP credit caused problems.
UN Agencies
6.13           In 1983, the project attracted sizeable grant funds from
UPCDV. UNDP and WVP. The PAO was deoigoated as project executing agency for
the first two agencies. As discussed In para 3.15, there were substantial
delays In signing the project agreements and, subsequently, in the
rehabilitation program's start-up due In part to adminstrative problem
within the = agencies. 121  OKVSD becam  so alarmd at delays In putting
In place the technical assistance toss and procuring needed equipment that In
March 1986 it requested IDA to take over responsibilty from PAO for
administering the project; Instead, the parties concroed agreed to IDA's
recommendation of hiring the engineering consulting firm to get the program
started (see par 3 *16). OVSD' s management became Increasingly dLssatisfied
during 1986 with management of the UN funding, complaining that the CGneral

ChadLn adminstration may have contributed to this delay.

Monager was not involved sufficiently ln decision-asking nor infored of
decisions taken by the management expert resident In LaL (finaced by UPDP)
and by VAO-Zame.  The problm soms to hav  leosened when the amnageent
expert left the project.
6.14           The rest of the UDP finaced technical assistance toam was
well respected and appear to have made a posLtive contribution. In fact, the
decision not to prolong the contract of the agricultural extension expert was
unfortunate since some Important new lnitiatlves with farors groups were
just beginning. There was a noticeable decline Lu the quallty of extension
activitles after his departure.
6.15           Coordination amng the UW agencies and betwoen each of them
and the Bank was difficult despite the good will of all parties; this created
additional strain on OMVSD's management capacLty which was already weak. It
would have been useful to have done more missions together and to have
established a formal coordination mechanism (see para 6.15).
6.16           All  donors  underetimated  the  difflculties  of  project
implemntation in Chad.  Good resident technlcal exprts wore difficult to
recruit due to continuing uncertainty In 1985 about the polltical and
security situation and to difficult living conditions.   The delays in
acquiring equipment and vehicles was attributable In part to FA0'  cumbersome
procuremsn't procedures, but also to comnnications difficulties vithin Chad
and between Chad and the exterior as vell as logistical problem In lmporting
good.
Bank
6 17           In hindsight, the Bank can be crlticised for designing an
overly complex project which did not take Into account the country'.
implementation capacity and loglitical problems. In addition, the project
conception had four major flaws i (i) design of the irigLation vorks did not
sufficiently take into account the risk of low rainfall resulting In low
flood levels; (Li) the creation of a vertically Integrated parastatal to
implement the project concentrated resources In the public sector; (iii)
farmstrs' possible role in running the scheme was completely lgnoreds and (iv)
the decision to bulld an epensiv, modern rice mill reduced OWVSD's capaclty
to adapt to the changing rice market.
6.18           Bank  staff  demonstrated  persoverae  and  creativity  In
adapting this project to the dlfficulties in Chad Including failure of the
initial biddLag process, the disruption of the civil war, delays in the full
r%sumptiom of disbursemnts, and late start-up of ON agencies' fuading. The
appr aral mission expected the project to require a lot of supervision,
because modern irrigation development In Chad vas new and therefore
modifications in the project would be required as experience was gained. The
Bank sent 18 supervision misslons, an average of one mission per year from
1975 to 1980, one In 1983, and two per year from 1964 to 1967. It appears
that a total of 56 staff-weeks was spent on upervision. The field visits
which were budgeted may have been sufficient Initially.   However, when
project activities were resmd after the war, supervLslon mslsions ewre
overburdened.

6. 19          Since appraisal of the rehabilitatLon program in February
1984, Bank staff expended tremendous effort to coordinate with other donors,

identify ways to rectify OVSD's management problems, and to provide
implementation assistance to OMVSD (preparationlrevision of work programs and
budgets, technical advice). The work of the supervLsion missions was
difficult, given their time constraints, and lack of continuity of staffing
and of expertise to deal with som technical issues, e.g., a rural engineer
only participated in two of the last four supervisions. Only major
implementation isiueu could be dealt with sufficiently and given the
overwhelming fina tal and manage_met problems this worked to the detriment
of technlcal super;ision activlties. Despite these pressures, the supervision
mLssions helped develop a proposal for restructuring OMVSD and making lt more
responsive to farers.
6.20           This PCR finds lt imposible to judge, even wLth hindsight,
how the Bank should have reacted to OKVSD's failure to improve its
management. Supervision missLons spent an enornous aount of time working
with OMVSD to identify ways of Improving accounting, financial controls and
overall management. After five years of continuous efforts by the Bank and
UN agencies which resulted in few concrete changes, this PC& concludes that
the OKVSD managment simply did not want to implement a restructuring
progrm. The dilemma facing Bank staff was that OVVSD' field staff were
motivated and cisitted; they accomplished the rehabilitation works as
planned despite numerous hardships Including not getting paid. Seeing these
positive achievements and fanrers *apparent motivation, it was difficult for
Bank staff to give up on the project and take drastic actLon such as
cancelling the loan.
6.21           There were two critical decision-points after the civil war.
when, in hindsight, a change in approach may have been appropriate. First,
while it is understandable that the Bank wanted to show good will and support
of the Chadian government as lt took its first steps to recovery, the Bank's
decision in 1983 to partially reame disbursements for the Sategui-Deressia
project may have been a mistake. It might ha*e been more appropriate to
thoroughly re-exasine the project conception--such as OISD's role--before
relaunching its activities. Second, if the lank had been able to anticipate
the nearly one-and-a-half year delay in start-up of the rehabilitation
program when it was appraised in early 1984, lt could have cancelled the
balance under Cr. 489-1 and presented the rehabilitation program to the Board
as a new  mrcgency operation, which In effect it vas.  This would have
provided an opportunLty to devote sufficient resources and time to reexamine
and modify the project concept. It also would have presented an opportunLty
to establish a formal coordinatLon agreement with the UNCDF and MNDP whLch
mlght have taken the form of the Bank acting as executing agency for the UN
project agreements.
VIZ. LESSONS LrARNED AND FUTURU OR3CSATION
7.1            The project's overall impact has been assessed (paras 5.24-
5.26) and various criticisms and recommendations have been made throughout

the report. This section reiterates several of these points, elaborates on
a few and recoamends a future orientation of the OHVSD.
7.2            Choice of technology. The chosen technology for this project,
gravity fed irrigation with partial water control, was briefly compared with
two altzrnatives in the appraisal reports  (C) no works, but improved
extension services and use of farm inputs, and (b) less ezpensive works
designed solely tn allow earlier flooding of the plain. It was argued that
the first alternatlve should be excluded since vlth uncontrolled flooding
inputs would often be wasted, so farmers would not want to intensLfy
productlon. In the second, it was argued that a major and expensive network
of canals would be requlred to *nsure controlled early flooding but that
uncontrolled inundztlon would place a pegmnent coLling on yLelds would would
limit farmer income. Theso two alternatives and other intermedlate, less-
costly solutions appear to have been dismissed without sufficient study; a
reconsideration was warranted when lt becaome evLdent in 1975 that the
project's cost would be twLce appraisal estimates. At current rice prlces in
Chad, intensification of rice production is not profitable for most farmers.
Simpler, less costly technlcal changes entailing lower investment costs would
probably have been more adapted to the Chadian context.
7.3            DeiLan of IrrLaatLon Works.  One of the ratLonales for this
project was the need to increase the securLty of the food supply in drought
years However, the design of the irriLgatln works failed to sufflcLently
take into account low flood levels, resulting in problem In 6 out of the
last 12 years  Annex 2 suggests measures whLch would improve floodLg of the
existing system.
7.4            CreatLon of uarastatal. A major flaw In the project's design
was the creatlon of OMVSD to Implement the project, a common approach in
irrlgation project deilgn during the 1960a and 1970..  It was a top-down
approach whlch concentrated power and resources in the public sector; OMVSD
was empected to operate as a coamerclal, self-financing entlty by the end of
the project. This approach appears to have failed in Chad and elsewhere in
Africa. OKMSD ehibLits the problems found in many parastatalst centralized
decLsion-making, excessive stakff, and poor financial managemnt. OMVSD staff
lacked the experience and mentality for coinercial activlties and they were
hampered by an administered pricing polLcy which they dld not try to change.
7.5            Farmer particivatLon. This project supported the creation of
a structure In whlch farmer had practlcally no say In decLslon-making. Thus,
there was little way of ensuring that the project really responded to
beneficlary demands and needs. Toward the end of the project, OMVSD dld
attempt to involve faramrs in allocation of plots, need productLon, paddy
coliectLon, and group developmnt actlvLtLes.  Ninety farmer groups have
been formed, but unfortunately, the technLcal assistant who was helping
introduce this new approach left the project prematurely. Alot remains to be
done.
7.6            Lice marketinas roblem     The dynamics of the ChadLan cereals
maket should have been studied more carefully to determine whether the
inclusLon of an expensive, modern rlce mill In the project was justLfLed. In



- 0o -
hindsight, it appears that small, private rice dill would have been more
suitable.
707            Regitonal cooperation.  LimLted coordination existed between
the project and the nearby SIHIY project In Cameroon, despite their common
objectlves and strategies. Same cooperation existed after 1984 in addressing
technical problems of rice milling, but a regular exchnge of information and
experience on subjects such as water managemnt, soil manageamt techniques
and rice marketing would have been useful.
7.8            Replicabilivt.  The project bonefitted a relatively small
number of farmers and created a small irrigted areas US$29.7 million in
credits and grants to reach about 1,500 farers cultivating one hectare each
under irrigation and 1.750 farers planting 2,700 hectares under rainfed
conditions. Furthermore, rice is a minor cereals crop in Chad. accounting
for 3S of cultLvated area and 6S of production.  This concentration of
resources is neither possible nor desirable to extend to other projects.
7.9            Sustainability and future orientation.   At present, this
project is not sustainable 2rom Governmt, OVSD or the farmers' point of
view. No expansion of the irrigated perimeter should be considered until the
existing 1,500 hectares is being exploited properly and OVSD has shown lt
can be self-financed. In order to achiee this, substantial efficiency gains
and a move flexible rLce pricing and marketing approach are requrted. the
considerable potential l Xo increase yields through lowering the cost of
inputs, better water managmnt and Improved husbandry practices must be
exploited. Improvements are also needed to ensure better vater avaLlability
and distributions this may require some anw lnwestmet (see Anne  2).
OKVSD's managemeat must be Improved and its functions reduced: many can
probably be performed more efflciently by farmern, the private sector or
other Govenment agencls. Farrs groups should gradually take on greater
responsibility for managing the lrrigted perimetr.
7.10.          Governmnt took an essential step In this dlrection in 1989
when OMk8D's senior  onagement was replaced.  A diagnostic study of OKVSD
financed by the IDA technlcal assistance project (Cr. 1872-CD) was completed
in June 1989 and the consultants are preparing a restructuring progr^a to be
examined by the Government In mld-1990.

CHAD
SATEGUI-DERESSIA IRRIGATION PROJECT
(Credit 489-CD/489-1-CD)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT
r   BACKGROUND
1.1       The Sategui-Deressia plain, located in southwest Chad, covers an
area of about 50,000 ha on the right bank of the Logone River, in Lai
Prefecture. The climate is of the Sudanian type with a wet season
(1,000 mm/year) from May to October and a dry season from November to April.
From August through October, the heavy rains and the overflowing of the Logone
and its branches and tributaries cause extensive flooding. The soils consist
of 50% sandy loams and sandy clays, and the rest is made up of sands (172) and
clays with calcareous nodules (331). Since its introduction in the early
1940s, rice has been the crop most commonly grown in the region, probably on
account of the frequent and persistent waterlogging of the soil during the wet
season. In 1972, when the feasibility study of development of the plain was
submitted, the area used for rice was put at some 9,000 ha (18S) while the
rest was divided among crops grown on seasonally uncovered land (5S), pasture
(71S) and forest (6S).
1.2       Animal traction quickly became widespread in the plain after the
establishment in 1960 of the Secteur Exp6rimental de Modernisation Agricole de
Lai K6lo (SENALK); in 1970 there were nearly 1,900 draft oxen, 150 plows and
700 harrows and it was estimated that over 801 of the production untts were
using animal traction.
1.3       Bteore the project, rice growing was practised under widely varying
inundation conditions and using three different varieties (farmers receiving
extension assistance):
-    Puang Ngeon, which does not require much water, has a 90-day cycle
and grows to a height of 1 m;
-    D 52.37, which needs 30-60 cm of water, has a 120-day cycle and
grows to 120 cm;



ANNEX 1
32                                  P. -2 of 20
-    Bentoubala B, which can withstand submersion under greater depths
and for long periods, has a 140-day cycle and grows to 150 cm.
1.4       Under good conditions the yield could reach 1.4-1.8 t/ha, depending
on the variety; however, the average was estimated at 0.9 t/ha in the plain as
a whole for a total production of 8,000 tons/year, 40% of which was sold.
II. AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES
2.1       The agricultural developmcnt objectives for the region had been set
as follows:
-    development of 4,000 ha by means of construction of a dike to
protect against early flooding and the possibility of gravity
irrigation using river flood water stored in a 600-ha reservoir;
plot leveling was envisaged for a part of the area together with
installation of a drainage system to make it possible to maintain a
30-cm depth (60 cm on the rest of the area);
-    popularization of high-yielding varieties of rice used in the
Chinese project in Bongor and dissemination of modern farming
techniques: application of fertilizer and pesticides, weeding, etc.
-    rehabilitation of the Boumo research station (100 ha) for seed
multiplication and applied research on double cropping;
-    raising of yields from 0.9 t/ha to 2.5 t/ha in the irrigated area
(2.9 t/ha in the part with total water control), and to 1.4 t/ha
outside the irrigated area;
-    increasing of annual paddy production from 8,000 tons to 20,000 tons
in the plain as a whole.
2.2       The institutional context for execution of the project had been set
in advance by the establishment in 1974 of the Office de Mise en Valeur de la
Plaine de Sat4sui-Deressia (OMVSD), a public industrial and commercial
establishment with financial autonomy.
III. AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Activities
3.1       OMVSD's Direction de la Mise en Valeur handled the activities
connected with rice production, in particular plot allocation, extension, seed
multiplication and applied research, while its Direction des Amfnatements took
care of the management of the irrigation system and distribution of inputs and
equipment, credit and the collection and marketing of the paddy.

Agricultural Extension
3.2       Extension was characterized by the presence of two services:  one to
serve the farmers in the perimeter (DP), and the other for the farmers outside
it (HP). The HP service was set up to serve two purposes: (i) to initiate
the traditional rice growers into the techniques used in the perimeter in
order to reduce the learning time needed by future farmers in the improved
areas, and (ii) to increase the salable output to ensure full utilization of
the planned rice mill.
The extension messages, which were not clearly specified at
appraisal, focused essentially on:
-    double plowing, after harvesting and before sowing, and construction
of small earth dams to delimit plots;
-    use of seed of selected varieties. at 70 kg/ha;
-    sowing in rows or in aligned seed holes;
-    fertilizer application:  50 kg/ha NPKSB and 100 kg/ha urea;
-    pesticide treatments when needed, and not on a systematic basis;
-    observance of the crop calendar (sowing between June 15 and July 15,
depending on the block).
Adoption of the extension messages was low, especially as regards
some essential items such as adherence to the calendar and earth-dam
construction; on the other hand, the farmers readily accepted the selected
varieties and higher sowing density, but the reco _m nded fertilizer doses were
not applied because OMVSD's financial difficulties prevented it from procuring
the necessary quantities of fertilizer.
The extension service provided was intensive and authoritarian in
approach during the early years (1976-79), when only farmers with the
requisite resources (draft oxen and labor) were eligible for plots. This
caused difficulties in transmitting the technical messages imposed.
Subsequently, during the civil war years (1980-84), the extension service was
greatly cut back and the farmers tended to revert to traditional rice-growing
practices (late sowing with low density, without fertilizer).
3.3       In 1985/86, the extension service was reorganized and OMVSD
currently has 17 officers in the perimeter (DP) and 10 outside it (HP),
resulting in a density of 88 and 175 farmers served per officer DP and HP,
respectively.
3.4       Observance of the crop calendar and preparation of earth dams to
delimit plots are two recommendations that have not been followed to any great
degree up to the present (as regards earth dams, 51% of the area in 1987/88).
Even in the demonstration plots set up by the extension staff inside the
perimeter these practices have not been systematically followed; there were 90
of these plots in 1987/88 totaling 500 ma.

The rice-crowing areas covered by the extension service (Table I)
were below the program flgure set at appraisal owing to the scaling back of
the improvement works compared with the initial program. Between 1984 and
1988 the HP target (2,700 ha) was not achieved because of lack of inputs (seed
and fertilizer), since the available resources were assigned by priority to
the DP area (1,500 ha).
The population's participation in the development of the perimeter
was good, with an occupation rate of the irrigable part that was always close
to 1002 despite some problems of a social (mixing of farmers from different
villages and ethnic groups, distances from villages to area) or economic
(sudden increase in levies, farmer indebtedness, drought) nature.
Seed Multiplication and Apolied Research
3.5       These two activities were conducted jointly since the priority
objective of the research was selection of high-yielding varieties suited to
conditions in the plain, in order to improve the homogeneity of the paddy
produced and therefore increase milling yields. Rowever, the seed production
by force account that was planned at the Boumo station was not carried out
owing to irrigation complications and communications problems between Lai and
Boumo. Nevertheless, between 1976 and 1979 some 390 tons of seed was produced
in the perimeter (IR 24, Bentoubala, Puang Ngeon and Cement varieties, of
which 278 tons was distributed (Table 2). It appears that at the start of the
project the emphasis was rather on reducing the number of varieties cultivated
in the plain and the existing blends because the superiority of the variety
introduced (IR 24) compared with those traditionally grown (Bentoubala,
Cement) had not been confirmed in field conditions.
3.6       Upon the resumption of activities in 1984 an attempt was made to
introduce the IRAT 144 variety from Burkina Faso, which had given good results
in an inundated rainfed rice project in Niena Dionkele; this attempt failed
because of the bad quality of the seed imported (5 tons). Subsequently, the
short-stemmed IR 46 variety, already widely grown in the SEMRY polders in
Yagoua, Cameroon and in Bongor, showed itself to be well suited and high
yielding (average cycle 120-135 days and possible yields above 6 t/ha). This
variety is presently the one grown most in the irrigable areas. For the
strict rainfed rice-growing areas, the Chinese I Kong Pao variety is preferred
because of its hardiness, its short cycle (90-100 days) and its better drought
resistance. However, since this variety is shorter grained than IR 46 it
creates problems in milling (milling yield 3 t/ha instead of 4 t/ha for IR 46)
and as regards acceptance by urban consumers.
3.7       Since 1986 a new 72-ha seed farm has been developed at Mala, 7 km
from OMVSD, utilizing a mixed irrigation and drainage system operated by motor
pump. The results obtained during the first year were disappointing owing to
the low yields (1.4 t/ha), the poor quality of the seed produced and the high
production costs (CFAF 240/kg). Better results have been obtained with a
network of 50 specially trained farmers who, in 1987, produced an average of
3.5 t/ha inside the perimeter.  The cost (production, cleaning and treatment)

of the seed prooaced in 1987 (230 t) was CFAF 103/kg. Currently, due to the
difficulties encountered because of the poor leveling of the Mala plots and
the inadequate capacity of the motor pumps installed, OMVSD is tending
increasingly to rely on farmers for multiplication, while keeping the station
for preserving the varieties and producing foundation seed.
3.8       The research done concentrated essentially on mineral fertilizer,
density and timing of sowing and variety selection. The most important
results were the following:
-    the chlorosis frequently observed througuout the polder in the early
years and attributed to sulfur deficiencies was corrected by
application of NPKSB cotton fertilizer;
-    sowing density has been set at 70 kg/ha in rows or seed holes spaced
at 200-cm intervals; replanting has not been adopted because of the
impossibility of ensuring that the plots will be flooded at the
right time; trialp with sowing dates have, however, confirmed the
benefits of early sowing: the calendar currently followed calls for
staggering in the different blocks (M1, M2, M3) from June 15 to
July 15;
-    the varietal trials did not lead to any new proposals , -arding the
varieties used in the adjoining regions (Bongor, Yagoua); the
varieties traditionally cultivated in the plain and suited to the
different types of rice growing practised (0; 30; 60-90 cm water) do
not appear to have received so much attention from the selectors as
the foreign varieties.
3.9       In conclusion, the research conducted in the context of the project
was governed by a conventional approach, especially in the initial years; a
large number of simple problems, although essential to the development of rice
production in the plain, -were not tackled, among others: development of
equipment for making earth dams and leveling plots, sowing and weeding,
fertilizer, other crops that would do better than rice in certain above-water
or particularly sandy parts of the polder.
Sup1yV and Distribution of Inputs and Equipment
3.10      Altogether, the project distributed 278 t of seed and 273 t of urea
during the first phase (1976-79) and 564 51' of seed and 814 t of fertilizer
(529 t urea, 285 t NPKSB) from 1985 to 1988 (Table 2). Taking into account
the area covered by the extension service within the perimeter in the same
period (9,530 ha), it appears that only this area received the recommended
quantities of fertilizer (115 kg/ha) and seed (79 kg/ha). In actual fact,
especially during the rehabilitation phase, OMVSD's financial difficulties
meant that it was only able to supply much smaller quantities of seed and
fertilizer than were calculated to be needed. On several occasions, to make
up for inadequate seed production at the station, ordinary paddy was
distributed instead of good quality seed. Pesticide use was low (less than
10% of the cultivated areas were treated per year); the pests most frequently
observed were stem borers and leaf-eating caterpillars.
I/  Of which 129 t to farmers outside the polder.

3.11      OMVSD's ability to meet the farmers' equipment needs was even
lower: a total of 338 plows, 151 carts and 970 sickles was provided. Up till
1986 no form of credit was available for equipment. Although included in the
appraisal report, no threshers, seeders or weeding implements were made
available.
3.12      OMVSD's inability to ensure availability of inputs and equipment
when needed and in adequate quantities and qualities constituted a major
obstacle that prevented accomplishment of better results as regards both
yields and total paddy production.
Plot Allcn' ti3  and Credit
3.13      Up till 1984, the land area allocated to each farmer was 2 ha;
farmers were selected from among those who possessed the means, i.e. draft
oxen and sufficient labor. During the rehabilitation phase, taking into
account the farmers' difficulties in ensuring proper maintenance of the land
in the irrigable perimeter (DP), largely on account of oxen losses during the
civil war, the area granted was limited to I ha per farmer and possession of a
pair of draft oxen was no longer made a prerequisite. This adjustment brought
about a change in the project target group, which then became no longer the
"best" farmers with above-average resources, but instead average smallholders
who needed credit to purchase equipment. The reduction in the area granted
also facilitated the introduction of more intensive farming methods.
3.14      As of 1987, the farmers were grouped by village and by quarter
hydraulique in each block (Ml, M2, M3) in order to facilitate extension and
collective maintenance work on the irrigation and drainage system. Some 90
groups with 20 to 50 members each have been formed. Although late in the day,
this step has been beneficial for resolution of the frequent conflicts between
farmers with adjoining plots who are often from different villages and ethnic
groups and for helping to encourage the farmers themselves to assume
increasing responsibility for the correct and profitable use of the perimeter.
3.15      The credit granted to the farmers in the years 1976-78
(CFAF 26.2 million) for inputs (seed, fertilixer, insecticides and jute bags)
was repaid almost entirely. The approximately CFAF 68.5 million granted in
1979-82, during the period of unrest, has not to date been recovered.
However, there is a plan to arrange repayment in installments of CFAF 20,000
per year per farmer. The repayment rate for agricultural credit was 882 in
1986/87, for an amount of CFAF 67 million (Table 2).
Collection and Marketinz of Paddy
3.16      The intention was that the DP farmers should sell two thirds of
their paddy production to OMVSD. Kowever, the proportion in the irrigable
polder did not reach 502 (Table 2). This was because of the delayed start of
collection (three to five months behind schedule) due to OMVSD's recurrent
financial crises; another reason was the persistent drought which particularly
affected production outside the-perimeter and therefore increased the
proportion of the paddy produced inside the perimeter that was consumed by the
farmers' own households.



ANNEX 1
37                                P. 7 of 20
3.17      A further consequence of the chronic delays in opening the marketing
season has been excessive paddy moisture loss (moisture content 82 instead of
12-132), which has increased the percentage of broken grains during dehusking.
An efficient collection system, possibly organized by farmer groups, together
with prompt and regular marketing, are vital for the future development of
rice growing in the region.
Management of the Irrigation System
3.18      Since the development works were not completed with plot leveling to
remove the worst irregularities in microrelief and by division into irrigable
blocks by means of contour bunds, distribution of the irrigation water has
always been a source of serious problems. In particular, block Ml, with a
gross area of over 900 ha, was subdivided into individual parcels of 85 ha
with significant variations in level of the order of 60 cm; under these
conditions, flooding was always a slow and problematic operation, especially
in light of the lack of earth dams separating parcels and the farmers' failure
to observe the crop calendar. Only during the last two crop years has OMVSD
resumed subdivision into parcels of 30 ha on average with separate irrigation
and drainage systems like blocks M2 and M3.
3.19      Since no precise instructions were laid down concerning management
of irrigation in the different blocks, and as a result of the low flood levels
of the Logone, the project personnel and sometimes the farmers themselves
sometimes had to take steps to increase the amount of irrigation water
available (dam downstream of the intake on the canal, breach in the
compensation basin dike, etc.).
3.20      Correct management of irrigation water and complementarity with the
rainfed rice-growing system being key components of the Sat6gui-Deressia
scheme, it appears that much remains to be done to ensure better utilization
of the water during low river flood levels.
IV. RESULTS
Climatic Conditions
4.1       The results of the project as regards agricultural production were
affected by unfavorable rainfall and hydrometric conditions; the levels
recorded from 1976 to 1987 were generally below the average values used in
designing the project (Table 3). The shortfall with respect to the forecasts
was more marked for the number of days' duration of the Logone's flood leveLs
(above 0 on the scale) than for annual rainfall (the 1976-87 mean at Lai was
above 900 mm/year). The reservoir was not properly filled in six years out of
twelve (1977, 1980, 1982, 1984, 1985 and 1987).
Area Used
4.2       The irrigable area is currently 1,500 ha (blocks Ml, M2 and M3),
l.e. 402 less than envisaged at appraisal in 1974. To this must be added some
2,000 ha (blocks M4, DSil DS2, DS3) where development works have been started



ANNEX 1
-38 -                              P   8 of- 20
but which cannot presently be irrigated. The gross area developed exceeds
1,800 ha; however, 300 ha has not yet been cultivated owing to the following
problems: parts above water, presence of vertisols, termite mounds.
Yields
4.;3      The annual yields obtained in the irrigable area (DP) have reached
and even slightly exceeded the target of 2.5 t/ha paddy set in the 1974
appraisal (Table 1). However, the average result over 12 seasons is 2.1 t/ha;
it should be noted that this result was obtained during times when rainfall
and irrigation water availability were well below forecast levels, while
extension services and inputs were also no more than sporadically available
during the period. There were significant variations in yields around the
annual averages (from I t/ha to 4 t/ha), due essentially to the location of
the plot in the block (topography, nature of soil) and observance of crop
calendar and cultivation practices.
4.4       With intensive cultivation (application of 150 kg/ha fertilizer) the
seed farmers obtained an average yield of 3.5 t/ha (50 one-hectare plots) in
1987, which is a good indication of the potential yields with good husbandry
practices.
4.5       The average yield in the area outside the perimeter (HP) receiving
extension services is 1.5 t/ha, which matches the appraisal target; this
figure, which has often been exceeded in years of good rainfall, was affected
by the lack of inputs and equipment.
Production and Impact at Resion Level
4.6       Because of the appreciable reduction in the irrigable area and in
the areas covered by extension services outside the perimeter, paddy
production was distinctly below the forecasts from 1974 to 1984; however,
recent estimates based on samplings made in the context of the project put the
plain's total paddy production at about 9,000 tons,1" which is above the
estimate made at appraisal in 1974 for the situation without the project
(7,800 - 8,300 t). According to these estimates, the rice-growing area shrank
from 9,000 ha in 1974 to 6,000 ha in 1988 (including the area with extension
services); this is explained by:
-    the adjustment of the husbandry system to the low rainfall
conditions of the past 15 years;
-    the higher yields obtained by means of the intensiflcation
techniques which make it possible to obtain the same output from a
smaller area;
-    contacts with outside groups which have introduced the practice of
raising crops on land that is above water (millet, sorghum, peanuts,
cowpeas, cassava).
2/   DP 1,500 ha x 2.5 t/ha a 3,750 t; HP 1,500 ha x 1.5 t/ha a 2,250 t;

4.7       The present distribution of the cultivated areas Ln the
Sat6gui-Deressia plain is estimated to be as follows:
Cultivated Areas
Crop                                                NA             I
Rice                                              6,000            49

Farmer Incomes
4.8       The operating accounts based on the results obtained during the
project (Tables 4-8) indicate that the incomes per hectare of the farmers
receiving extension services are two or three times higher than those of the
traditional farmers; the same applies as regards return per man-day.
Net Income/ha     Return/man-day
CFAF              CFAF
Traditional rainfed                           27,000              300
Improved rainfed (HP)                         59,000              590
Irrigated (DP                                 80,000              670
Intensive irrigated (DP)                     114,000              800
4.9       Taking into account the project levy which has been set at
CFAF 21,600/ha since 1986/87, the breakeven Point for a better return in the
perimeter (DP) with respect to farmers with project services outside it (HP)
is 2.5 t/la. It should also be noted that the levy (equivalent to 36 kg
paddy) presently amounts to 142 of the gross income of the DP farmers, whereas
at appraisal-in 1974 it had been calculated at 10.
4.10      The cost of paddy does not vary greatly in the four production
systems considered; the lowest (CFAF 37/kg) applies to yields of 1.5 t/ha
achieved by BP farmers with project services.
4.11      Comparison of the operating costs with those calculated at appraisal
indicates that, on average, production cost per hectare (excluding labor) for
DP farmers has risen to around 452 of gross income, an increase of 502
compared with 1974 (Tables 7-8).

V. PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED DURING EXECUTION
Physical
5.1       The appreciable shortening of the duration of the Logone's floods in
conjunction with the inadequate preparation of the irrigation blockq have
caused serious irrigation problems. This has underscored the complementarity
of rainfall and irrigation in the Sat6gui-Deressia scheme and the importance
of early sawing and interplot earth dams to gain maximum benefit from limited
water resources; unfortunately these recommendations have not been applied
sufficiently in practice.
Agronomic
5.2       The research and development unit was not able to devise quick
solutions to the problems posed by water availability and general soil
conditions that were somewhat different from those expected. Very few usable
findings were produced as regards varieties of rice and other crops better
suited to the sandy soils and the above-water parts of the perimeter. This led
to a chronic shortage of good quality seed which has, among other things,
limited the project's impact outside of the irrigated perimeter.
5.3       The essential points of the cultivation technique were not
identified in time and disseminated with sufficient conviction. Because of
this and also due to the interruption of extension work during the period of
unrest and the irrigation difficulties, the farmers reverted to traditional
cultivation in the perimeter, which explains the difference between average
yield over the years (2.1 t/ha) and the average yield obtained from intensive
cultivation (3.5 t/ha).
Socioeconomic
5.4       The changes made in the selection criteria for farmers and in their
organization and distribution in the perimeter have given rise to a sense of
insecurity which has not encouraged them to make the improvements recommended
for each plot (leveling, earth dams).
5.5       In addition, the significant increase in production cost and in the
levy in particular, which has not been balanced by an equally evident
improvement in the services (credit, input supply, paddy collection) provided
by OMVSD, has created a "somewhat passive" attitude among the farmers toward
the improvements made, the productive potential of which they do not yet
realize.
VI. LESSONS TO BE DRAWN AND DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS
6.1       The project as initially envisaged was too ambitious as regards
civil works; the works executed and the areas improved, though smaller than
originally planned, have not been properly utilized for a variety of reasons:
low rainfall, failure to complete works, civil unrest, etc.



ANNEX 1
- 41 -                                 P. 11 of 20
6.2       Compared with the civil engineering achievements, the efforts made
to improve the cultivation system were limited; the agronomic messages were
not clearly defined from the start. The yield targets were set too
conservatively in relation to the potential (su.tability of the plain for rice
growing) and the proposed improvement and maintenance costs. The fact that
the target set for the unimproved area (1.4 - 1.6 t/ha) was reached and even
exceeded as of the first crop seasons should have prompted upward revision of
the target for the irrigated area in order to take into account the margin
between traditional and improved cultivation.
6.3       The suitability of the Sat6gui-Daressia plan for rice growing has
been confirmed; however, crop diversification is necessary for certain
above-water or sandy areas where other grains (sorghum, millet, maize) and
legumes (peanuts, bambara nuts, cowpeas) can offer a better return than rice
grown on a strict rainfed basis.
6.4       Development of rice growing in the plain can be accomplished at
lower cost; simple works to facilitate the spreading ce river flood waters
(irrigation canal) and application at plot level (contour bunds) can be
constructed directly by the farmers with a minimum of technical direction.
The cost of the paddy produced by the farmers receiving project services in
the unimproved area is in fact the lowest (CFAF 37/kg) among those recorded in
the project. In the present stage, with a view to subsequent development of
rice production in the plain, priority should be given to the following
actions:
(i)    In the improved area
-    resumption of intensive extension work to ensure rapid dissemination
of intensive cultivation practices in order to achieve average
yields of the order of 3-3.5 t/ha;
-    supply and distribution of inputs, implements and equipment for use
with draft animals.
(ii)    Outside the improved area
-    multiplication and distribution of good quality seed of varieties
suitable for milling and marketing in the urban areas;
-    establishment of a marketing system that includes a bonus system for
paddy gatbered and delivered to the mill with the right moisture
content and meeting the requirements as regards impurities, etc.,
-    promotion of farmer groups and technical advice for the construction
of simple works, and participation in the establishment of credit
systems for the supply of inputs and equipment.

CHAD
SATEGUI-DERESSIA IRRIGATION PROJECT
(Credit 489-CD/489-1-CD)
Proiect Completion Report
Preliminary Proposals for Upgrading and Expanding the Irritated Perimeter
l. introduction
1.        Following the project completion mission in this case, a number of
observations and proposals were made by OMVSD division chiefs and the manager
of UNDP/FAO project 83/020 in Chad:
-    some subdivisions are too big at over 50 ha and differences in the
levels of the terrain are too pronounced.
-    the MD or compensation basin (3 million m'   see map 2) fills
only with difficulty, which means a corresponding delay in the
flooding of polder blocks M2 and M3;
-    filling was unsatisfactory in 1987 (202 of surface areas lost), but
during the 1984 flood season, the lowest on record, no filling
occurred at all;
-    polder blocks M2 and M3 empty only with difficulty because the
outlet to M4 has not been completed;
-    civil engineering works on blocks DI South, DS1 and DS2 (811 ha) and
M4 (460 ha) should be completed;
-    consideration should be given to using the dead storage capacity of
the MD basin (i.e. 3 million m' to grow an out-of-season crop;
-    validity of the proposals to use 1,500 ha for double cropping should
be examined.
2.        The mission also noted that:
-    numerous upgrading operations had gone ahead but without resumption
of the project as a whole (necessary stream flows; plot elevations
and sizes);
-    intakes are located at the highest points of block subdivisions,
making flooding more difficult;
-    water-level marking scales are no longer to be found on the plain,
except for occasional red lines on irrigation structures to indicate
the theoretical water elevation in a canal;



ANNEX 2
- 52 -                                   P. 2 of 8
-    nonsimultaneous inundation of block subdivisions is not out of the
question, but regulating structures would have to be installed on
ponder canals (sandbag dikes were used for this purpose in 1987);
-    no instructions exist for managing available water resources to best
advantage when the river floods only poorly.
3.        The intention in this Annex is to make a number of preliminary
proposals on the points discussed below, which would be an essential part of
any move to improve OMVSD's administration and its rice marketing operations.
Obviously, these proposals would have to be consistent with whatever strategy
is decided upon following completion of the irrigation subsector review now in
progress.
rr. Upgrading of Existing Polders
Subdivision of polder blocks
4.        Currently, OMVSD makes further subdivisions each year to reduce the
size of some polder block segments and the unevenness of their terrain. This
work, over and above normal maintenance, is financed from OMVSD's "current"
budget, so it is impossible to assess its exact cost. Some plots are also
given a "surfacing treatment" with bulldozer (flattening of termite mounds and
bumps, filling in of holes) which is certainly needed but seems to be carried
out on a day-by-day basis only.
5.        There is a need for:
-    A map (scale: 1/10,000) of the final division of the project area
into units that are smaller in size and of internally uniform
elevation. It should show water and surface elevations for each
subdivision, nonirrigable zones better suited to rainfed crops or
reforestation, and plots that require surfacing treatment (a map to
a scale of 1/2,000 would be necessary if a surfacing treatment
project were going to be proposed).
-    Each year, between seasons, a map should be drawn up showing the
civil works carried out during the year (with quantity surveys) and
those programmed for the coming year.
Better water management
6.        Once the foregoing maps are available and water requirements have
been assessed by readings of flood-level scales, it should be possible to
recalculate the main and secondary supply canal volumes within the polder
blocks, with particular emphasis on two points:
-    improvement of system regulation by means of gate structures that
enable blocks to be fl6oded on a nonsimulteneous basis whenever the
flood level is low. This would be a way to reduce flow demand and
flood high-lying subdivisions more easily.



-53 _                              ANNEX 2
P. 3 cf 8
-    study of the possibility of locating intake gates at the
lowest-lying point in a subdivision so that it can be flooded "from
below" via a canal that would serve as a borrow area for the
associated dike. Although perhaps not compatible with the
configuration of existing main canals, this would do away with
irrigation water runoff over farmers' plots.
7.        It will be essential in all cases to:
-    make sure that there are one or two benchmarks in each subdivision
to indicate what water level needs to be reached;
-    use water and land surface elevations and hydraulic grade lines as
the basis for instructions on opening of gates under normal-flood
and low-flood conditions.
III. Improving the Flooding Process
8.        Whatever development option is selected (i.e. with or without
expansion), the effort must be made to improve flooding. The idea of
constructing a sill across the Logone river can be eliminated for the time
being (the cost was cstimated at CFAF 4 billion by the Carlo Lotti Company,
not including access dikes, a lock and a fishway).
9.        Other courses of action can be proposed:
-    reduce the volume of the MD basin so as to speed filling of its dead
storage capacity;
-    Modify the design of the intake canal.
Reduction of MD basin
10.       The MD basin apparently has dead storage capacity of 3 million m'
at elevation 0.5 m. This has to fill up before supply can start to the
low-lying plots in the M3 block, the filling of which is therefore delayed.
This dead capacity could be reduced by building a dike within the basin,
provided it did not obstruct intakes CS1 and CS2 to polder blocks DS1 and DS2;
it would need a crest width of 3 m, a height of 1.8 m (40 cm above the water
surface), a side slope of 2/3 or, better, 1/2, which would mean minimal
scraping of 8.5 mz/lm, and a volume of 11.8 m3/lm.
11.       For a 2,000-li dike, this would mean 17,000 m4 of scraping and
22,000 ma of fill - without allowing for resumption of the outlet
regulating structure.
12.       Before such a project (with an estimated cost of CFAF 40-50 million)
is begun, it should be verified how much time could be saved (by monitoring
the filling process on a water-level marking scale at the outlet structure).
In actual fact, the modification in main canal design now proposed below
should have a much greater impact on block flooding than reduction of basin
capacity.



ANNEX 2
- 54 _                                P. 4 of 8
Modification of the main canal
13.       As things stand at present, the whole irrigation perimeter suffers a
water shortage in any low-flood year, although:
-    In all years except 1984 the level of the Logone river has exceeded
elevation 351.1 at the canal intake point for over 1.5 months;
-    the required elevations are 350.75 at the MI block intake and
roughly 350.18 at the M2 and M3 intakes (according to the Carlo
Lotti Company).
14.       Instead of planning for a pumping system that would not be
cost-effective, it would be better to look into changing the dimensions of the
intake canal as a means of ensuring that flooding of the polders meets water
flow and elevation requirements. Since the three lowest floods recorded
occurred in 1984, 1972 and 1987, the correct course would be to calculate
flooding requirements for those three occasions. Such a study should examine
a range of variants:
-    polder blocks DSI and DS2 (and possibly M4) are incorporated into
the irrigated perimeter;
-    the MD basin is reduced'in size or retained as is;
-    the plots on block MI that are located too high are abandoned of
retained;
-    blocks DS3 and D North form part of the development scheme.
15.       Although t;e calculations here obviously need to be made on a PC, an
initial estimate indicates that a canal with bottom width 6 m, longitudinal
slope of 10 cm/km, side slopes of 2/3 and an initial elevation of 349.65 would
ensure the necessary flow to existing polder blocks under 1987 flood
conditions (12 m of bottom width with the DSI, DS2 and M4 extensions). The
only way to ensure flow requirements under 1984 flood conditions would appear
to be to change the alignment of the canal: its existing slope is 10 cm/km
while that of the Logone is 22 cm/km, so that relocation of its intake 5 km up
river would increase stream head by 60 cm.
16.       Eliminating relocation of the canal (undoubtedly too costly to be
justified), tht cost of improving filling would be:

17.       Under these conditions, reducing the MD basin would no longer be
necessary as it would fill very rapidly in the initlal phase of the flood.
18.       The services of an expert would be needed to confirm that no
problems would be created by sanding up of the intake from the Logone.
Return on iMirovements
19.       Since 1981, areas put under crops and harvested have been as follows:

20.       If average yield is assumed to be 2.5 t/ha/year, thq average annual
loss would be 715 tons or, at CFAF 60/kg paddy, a total of CFAF 42.9 million
annually.
21.       Incremental production costs (fertilizer, harvesting, threshing)
because of the additional areas would be very low, less than CFAF 40,000/ba,
or CFAF 11.4 mlIlion/annually. Quite apart from any gains on processing,
annual gains would amount to CFAF 31.5 million as against initial expenditure
of CFAF 90 million, figures which amply justify the project.
IV. Polder Expansions
22.       Under present conditions, several expansions are possible:
-    DSI and DS2 (811 ha gross):  The design study is almost completed;
it only remains to cut block subdivision size back to 25-30 ha.
Approximately two thirds of basic infrastructure already exists and
can be restored to working order with minimal rehabilitation.
-    M4  (460 ha gross):  The design study is completed, but with block
subdivisions that are too large. Almost no infrastructure
investments have been made. Execution of plans for block M4 would
improve drainage of blocks M2 and M3.
-    Sector DS3 (695 ha gross):  The design study is ready, but again
with subdivisons that are too big. Execution has not begun.
-    Sector D North (1.475 gross):  Topographic surveys have been
completed, but the project study has not been started.
-    Diressia exoansion (5.000"ha):  Except for some incomplete
topographic maps a start has not been made on a study for the
project.
-    Boumo aericultural research station  (200 ha):  Established on very
light soils, this station was much too remote and.improvement by
pump irrigation was too costly. It has therefore been abandoned for
a site closer to tie Irr sated perimetar.

k3.       There would appear to be little point in developing any of the
polder blocks other than DSI and DS2 (811 ha gross) and M4 (460 ha gross)
initially, but the option to go ahead by completing the .- lies on blocks DS3
and D North (a total of 2,174 ha gross) should be kept open. In 1986, the
Carlo Lotti Company estimated the cost of the DSI and DS2 projects as follows:
CFAF millions
Overhaul of plant and purchase of equipment                  137.0
Site operating costs                                         188.8
Civil engineering works (by contractor)                      189.2
Civil engineering works (by force account)                   45.4
Contingencies and design studies (151)                       83.6
Total                                                       644.0
24.       To this estimate should be added the cost of a mechanic and perhaps
a project manager for two years: CFAF 140 million (with vehicles, housing,
supervision by design chief). According to the Lotti figures, the total would
be about CFAF 784 million, or a gross per-hectare cost of CFAF 967,000.
If the technical assistance arrangements were less ambitious, their cost
could be cut to CFAF 100 million: the mechanic for 13 months (first crop
season and start-up of the second) and the project manager for three months of
supervision visits. Total project cost would then drop to CFAF 744 million,
or per-hectare gross CFAF 917,000.
26.       Extending block M4 by 460 ha gross would cost CFAF 263 million
(excluding purchase of equipment) plus technical assistance at CFAP 30
million, for a total of CFAF 293 million, or CFAF 637,000/ha. If allowance
were made for increasing the size of the intake canal, at an additional
CFAF 55 million, the cost of the DSI, DS2 an- M4 extensions would total
CFAF 1,092 million for 1,271 ha gross, or CFAF 889,000/ha.
27.       It would be worthwhile, however, studying a version of the project
under which major infrastructure would be built on contract, since the present
very competitive business environment offers a promise of cost reductions
achievable through the use of more suitable equipment than OMVSD possesses.
Return on the expansion prolect
28.       Assuming a yield of 2.5 t/ha, net income per hectare of expansion
would be CFAF 80,165. Under intensive cropping at yields of 3.5 t/ha, income
could reach CFAF 113,767/ha. Without this further development, only 30% of
the zone is arable, giving net income of CFAF 58,962/ha. With total expansion
of the perimeter by 1,272 ha gross (1,144 ha net), the annual increase in
income would therefore be CFAF 69.2 million with present yields, and
CFAF 107.7 million under intensive farming. Expansion at a total cost of
CFAF 1,092 million therefore appears justified, although the rate of return is
a low one. It must also be pointed out, however, that the project would put
both the rice mill and OMVSD itself (since its farmer training costs would
increase only slightly) on a sounder cost-benefit footing.

V. Irrigation for Double Cropping
Irrigation from the Logone
29.       There have been several proposals for irrigating the blocks of
polder M situated closest to the river to make double cropping possible, the
necessary water being taken from the Logone by means of a sill built across it
or by pumps.
30.       None of the studies done has taken into account the inevitable water
losses from a main canal with a bottom width of 20 m and a water depth of
1.85 m (section a 42 ml; wetted perimeter * 27 m) between the Logone itself
and the block Ml intake, a distance of 4.5 km. It might well prove necessary
to excavate a small subsidiary canal between the Logone and block Ml. Soil
permeability on these blocks closest to the river is high according to the
findings of the soil study (over 1 cm/hour, or 240 m /ha/day and
24,000 ml/ha during the 100-day irrigation season!,. Unfortunately, spot
measurements can often give an erroneous picture of soil permeability across a
large irrigated polder block.
31.       This uncertainty can easily be cleared up -  by installing two or
three flood-level marking scales at low points in judiciously chosen
subdivisions which show significant water depth and are representative of the
soil types found within the irrigated perimeter: as soon as irrigation
finishes in October, the daily drop in the water level on these polder blocks
can be measured and a reliable idea obtained of the extent of infiltration and
evapotranspiration. These data, which should be taken by OMVSD, would also be
very useful in determining the actual volumes of water needed for controlled
flooding of the perimeter.
Irrigation from the MD compensation basin
32.       At the end of October, when irrigation of the paddy comes to a halt,
the MD basin would still hold 3 million m3 of water. Proposals have been
made to use this reserve to irrigate zones downstream of the basin. At a
depth of approximately 50 cm, the water in the basin would disappear through
evaporation and infiltration in less than two months, meaning that no
irrigated crop could be grown. It may be possible to supply the basin from
the Logone in November so as to keep up its water level for a longer period
probably difficult, however, since the flood subsides so quickly. The idea of
utilizing the-reservoir in this way should perhaps be put aside, therefore
although the assertions on which these proposals are based could be tested by
setting up a two-meter mark1ag scale at the outlet structure and recording the
movement of the water level wntil the basin is dry.
VI. Conclusions
33.       To summarize, the conclusions to be drawn from this brief survey of
the proposals for improvement and expansion of the Sat6gui-Deressia irrigated
perimeter are as follows:



ANNEX 2
- 58                               P. 8 of 8
-    An early study should be made on improving flooding of existing
polder blocks by excavation of the main canal (at an approximate
cost of CFAF 90 million) and perhaps by reduction of the capacity of
the MD compensation basin (at an approximate cost of CFAF 50
million). This study should be combined with assembly of an
authoritative set of documents on the existing polder blocks,
including operation and maintenance instructions.
-    A study should also be made on extending polder blocks DSI and DS2
(811 ha gross) and M4 (460 ha gross) and improving flooding. The
overall cost of the study/design component and the works themelves
would be CFAF 1,092 million for a total of 1,271 ha gross.
-    The proposals to provide irrigation for double cropping would be
very costly to implement; neither are they priority concerns,
especially not in the light of existing soil studies. However, soil
permeability measurement should go ahead; the cost would be
insignificant but the data obtained could be used to evaluate the
studies themselves.
34.       All these technical studies could be undertaken by the present OMVSD
team with help from the assistant FAO expert and support from consultants
(computer calculation of canal excavation, works design, intake construction
study). Draft terms of reference will be found in the accompanying Annex 3.

Proiect Completion Report
Draft Terms of Reference for Technical Studies
Relating to Imgrovement and Lcpansion of the Irrigated Perimeter
I. Introduction
1.1       It is anticipated that these technical studie3 Gn improvement and
expansion of the irrigated perimeter will clear up uncertainties on several
points (soil permeability, for instance) and provide necessary documentation
on civil works for both present extension proposals and possible subsequent
proposals.
II. Hydrological Study
Study of the floodina patterns of the Locone
2.1       Utilizing readings taken at Lai and at scale No. 21, and also the
correlation between these two locations, the consultants will develop a series
on flood levels in the Logone in relation to the canal Intake point. River
levels will be reconstituted in terms of five-day averages) from July 15 to
November 15 and whenever the Logone exceeds an elevation of 349. Levels will
be reconstituted day-by-day for the 1972, 1984 and 1987 wet seasons, when
flooding was the lowest on record. A statistical study in graph form should
be provided showing water depths during successive five-day periods using
various frequencies (0.8 - 0.9 - 0.95).
Water distribution and infiltration
2.2       So that water losses during distribution and by infiltratlon can be
measured, the folloving water-level marking scales should be installed and
re"d every day:
A scale 2 m in height will be associated with the outlet from the
compensation basin. It can be used to measure the time the basin
takes to fill before water is released to polder blocks M2 and M3,
as well as losses through evaporation and infiltration once
irrigation has ceased.
Two marking scales will be installed on the main canal at the
location of the MDI and MD2 intakes. Thwy will enable the hydraulic
grade line to be monitored along the canal.
Three marking scales, each I m in height, will be installed at low
lying points on three of the irrigated polder blocks. They will be
used to measure the speed with which the blocks flood and the volume
of evaporation and infiltration losses once irrigation ceases.



ANNEX 3
-60-                                P. 2 of 7
-    Two marking scales, each 3 m in height, will be installed at points
5 m on either side of the main intake structure, where they will be
used to measure head loss.
2.3       Each time measurements are taken, it will be noted whether
structures adjacent to the marking scales were open or closed. Provided it
can be done easily, an attempt should be made to gauge velocity of stream flow
in the main canal whenever marking scales are being read, as a means of
checking the appropriateness of the formulas in use. There should also be an
attempt at making a visual assessment of the velocity head of the water in the
canal as flooding begins, so that losses through soil saturation can be
estimated.
III. Topographic Surveys
3.1       Basic topographic surveys of the polders to a scale of 1/2,000
(1 point per 50 m) will be considered adequate. However, a survey of existing
dikes, roads, canals and drains on polder blocks DS1, DS2 and M4 will be
needed for monitoring purposes. Longitudinal sections on a scale of I point
for every 50 m, accompanied by cross sections every 200 m, will be
sufficient. The scale map (1/2,000) already available can be used to show
existing infrastructure on polder blocks DSI, DS2 and M4: alignment of dikes,
roads, canals, drains; location and elevation of structures; outline of works
begun but not finished.
IV. Hydraulic Studies
Comprehensive updated files
4.1       For each of the three existing blocks in polder M (M1, M2 and M3), a
comprehensive updated file is to be set up consisting of:
-    a map (scale of 1/2000) of the block and its subdivisions (showing
water levels, irrigable areas, nonirrigable areas);
-    standard longitudinal and cross sections of dikes, main and
secondary canals, drains;
-    plans and elevations of concrete structures.
4.2       A memorandum will be produced setting out the flows and elevations
needed in each canal to supply the subdivisions and verifying that the
dimensions of existing canals mean that these flows and elevations can be
achieved. If the characteristics of a canal differ too much from those
reco_uended, proposals for modification should be provided.
4.3       A study is to be made of the possibility of installing upstream
flow-regulation devices on main and secondary canals, in the form of
transverse and lateral weirs, fixed if possible. This regulation system
should make it possible - with advice from 4gricultural specialists -- to
carry out nonsimultaneous inundation of polder blocks when flood levels are
low.

Polder blocks DS2. DS3, M4 and DN
4.4       The study of polder blocks DS2, DS3 and M4 now in progress is to
allow for the following changes:
-    a reduction in block section size to a maximum of approximately
30 ha;
-*   block sections are to be equipped with intakes at their lowest-lying
point;
-    nonirrigable zones to be separated off by a small dike;
-    steps are to be taken to regulate flow in main and secondary canals;
-    the possibility of building small structures out of rough block
masonry is to be studied;
-    existing infrastructure facilities are to be rehabilitated wherever
possible and reused; this may entail slight departure from the
recommended standards, which will have to be justified in the study.
4.5       As far as block DN is concerned, the same types of study will be
required except that there is no existing body of documentation to be
supplemented and updated, and no old structures to be reutilized.
4.6       For each polder block the following should be provided:
-    a scale plan (1/2,000) showing subdivision pattern, water levels,
section surface areas, boundaries of nonirrigable zones;
-    standard longitudinal and cross sections of dikes, canals, drains
and roads;
-    designs for concrete structures (with elevation drawings for
standard structures);
-    the corresponding bills of quantities;
-    a brief statement of the reasons for selection of the solutions
proposed.
Ioorovinc fillint
4.7       On the basis of data from the low-floodtyears of 1972, 1984 and
1987, studies are to be made of the possibility of filling the irrigated
perimeter more effectively by excavating a small canal within the main
canals.  Design calculations carried out on a PC should be made for each of
the following scenrios:
-    irrigation o! polder blocks Ml - M3 only (possible abandonment of
the higher-lying section of Ml);



ANNEX 3
- 62 -                                    .4  f 7
-    irrigation of DSI, DS2 and M4 only;
-    irrigation of D North only;
-    reduction of the size of the MD compensation basin so as to speed
the start of filling.
4.8       In each case, both the rate of filling and the civil works
quantities necessary should be calculated. Since 1984 flood figures may prove
too low to provide a basis from which to achieve proper filling in the future,
even with a supplementary canal, what the consultants will need to calculate
is the filling that would have been achieved in 1984 with a canal designed to
give satisfactory inundation with a flood of frequency 0.95 or tha same as
that recorded in 1972.
4.9       An expert on river hydraulics should be retained to advise on tL)
problem of sanding up of canals. Using existing aerial photographs and
satellite images of the zone, he should propose a solution: a small canal
opening beside the old one and having a special gate, modifications to the
existing structure, groynes in the Logone, etc. in each case, the following
should be provided: longitudinal section, standard cross-sections, design of
concrete structures, bill of quantities and a brief statement giving the
reasons why the particular solution is recoumnded.
V. Other Studies
Cost estimates and works organization
5.1       On the basis of the bills of quantities accompanying the hydraulic
studies and the findings for the various hypothesis examined, works cost
estimates should be drawn up covering the two following situations:
-    all works, except major structures, to be carried out entirely on
force account by OMVSD;
-    major works to be let to contractors, with OMVSD limiting itself to
rehabilitation jobs, small dikes, small canals and minor structures.
5.2       In both instances, the consultants should indicate what equipment
OMVSD will need to purchase, what technical assistance it will need in
carrying out works on force account, ana - if applicable - what supervision
requirements will be associated with works contracted out. They should also
provide a timetable consistent with the equipment available and the exigencies
of the whole development process.
Ooerations and maintenance
5.3       In every case, a memorandum should be provided on the principles and
costs of water administration on the polders, with special emphasis on
management of the intake structure and main Lntake canal and the principles
that should govern water regulation whenever the flood level is exceptionally
low. Maintenance costs and methods of maintenance organization should be



AMEE 3
- 63 -                                     P5  of 7
evaluated in the light of experience gained since 1977. At least in the case
of new polder blocks, the current body of experience should be taken as the
basis for an attempt to institute a type of organization that leaves a muzimim
of responsibility to farmers themselves: allocation of land, water
administration, supplies of inputs, etc.
Processini and marketing
5.4       OMVSD will be able to balance its books only on the strength of its
margins on its processing and marketing operations. This being so, a study
should first be made of the impact of additional output on the rice mill
(organization, inventory, operating costs). It may be necessary to undertake
studies on the construction of a center for the storage of paddy bales
(considering experience with such facilities in West Africa) and on the
setting up of a rice-flour mill. Measures should also be proposed for
improving paddy purchases from farmers and sales of rice to the ONC (National
Cereals Board), private traders, and consumers, in light of domestic demand in
Chad. Attention should be given as well to ways of improving OMVSD
performance by transferring some functions to farmers: seed and input
supplies, water administration, etc. An assessment of the cost of these
various measures should be given.
Economic and financial study
5.5       The financial and economic study of the project should obviously
take in all agents or agencies involved in it: sm_llholder farms (not
forgetting those outside the project perimeter), the LaL rice mill, OHVSD, the
budget, trade and customs revenues of the Government of Chad, and the Chadian
economy.
Preparation rePort
5.6       The consultants' Preparation Report should present the conclusions
reached as a result of the various studies referred to above and should use
reasoned arguments to propose a choice among the various options identified,
whether with regard to works, the development process, OMVSD organization, or
processing and marketing operations.
VI. Orcanization. Plannina and Cost of Studies
OrEanzition
6.1       It is proposed that OMVSD conduct the hydrological study and
topographic surveys, and put together the comprehensive updated files,
assisted by the team of experts associated with UNDP/FAO Chad project
No. 83/020. It would be an advantage if this teas could also take an active
part in other studies (particularly the hydraulic study of polder blocks DS1,
DS2 and M4), especially If their stay in Chad were prolonged (although such
participation cannot be taken for granted). The remining concerns ehould
be referred to P consulting engineer, but it should bo remembered that a major
part of the earlier documentary material is probably still held by the Carlo
Letti Company and simply needs to be copied (some of the documents and files
held by Chad no longer exist).

_ 64 -                     ~~~~~~P. 6 of 7
Planning
6.2       It to assumed that the studies left to OMVSD could be completed
between now and the end of 1988 since they mainly deal with actions to be
taken during the flooding and emptying of tthe polders, as well as some
topographic surveys for monitoring purposes. The studies to be commissioned
from consultants ought to be completed within an 8-month period that includes
at least one full dry season for the expert on river hydraulics.
Costs
7.3       The assessment of study costs given below is based on the assumption
that the expenses incurred by OMVSD would already be covered by its operating
budget. Accordingly, only engineering consulting costs have been estimated.
.Unit costs could be brought down substantially if suitably qualified personnel
from Chadian institutions and agencies were to participate.
