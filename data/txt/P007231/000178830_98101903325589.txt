APPRAISAL OF A GENERATION, TRANSMISSION AND FREQUENCY
CONVERSION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project consisting of about 36 MW of
diesel generation, a new 69 kV transmission system and frequency conversion
facilitites for which a Bank loan of US$6.0 million equivalent is proposed.
The Government of Guyana has requested loans of £3.1 million (about US$7.5
million equivalent) and Can$4.0 million (about US$4.o million equivalent)
from the United Kingdom and Canada, respectively, to complete the financing
of the foreign exchange requirement for the project, of which the total
cost is estimated to be US$23.1 million equivalent. This would be the
first Bank loan to Guyana for power.
ii.       The proposed Bank loan would be made to the Guyana Electricity
Corporation (GEC), a public corporation supplying electricity to the City of
Georgetown and parts of the coastal area. Under legislation covering its
formation in 1957, GEC was given broad responsibilitites concerning national
electricity supply, but it has not fully exercised them, acting instead
mainly as an operating power company for its assigned areas of service.
Partly through the preparatory discussions related to this project, however,
GEC is now emerging as a national electricity supply organization.
iii.      The principal power producers in Guyana operate separate systems,
and frequencies of both 50 and 60 Hz are in use. Recently the Government
passed legislation to standardize the frequency at 60 Hz and the proposed
project includes the necessary equipment to convert the GEC systems to
60 Hz. The 69 kV transmission facilities included in the project would
interconnect GEC's several separate systems, the City of New Amsterdam
system, the Guyana Bauxite Company system, and possibly the system of
Reynolds Guyana Mines Company. The Guyana Bauxite and Reynolds systems
serve mining complexes whereas the other systems provide general public
supply.
iv.       National generating capacity (public supply and captive) totals
111 MW of which 80 MW is on the systems of the companies which would be
interconnected. The total peak load on these systems is forecast to grow
ll.b% annually from the present 62 MW to 107 MW in 1976. To meet this
growth the project would include about 36 MW of residual-oil-burning diesel
generation with about two-thirds in a plant near Georgetown and about one-
third in a plant near New Amsterdam. The units will be about 6 MW each.
v.        Since to a notable degree the project would be contingent on GEC
supplying their future load growth, power supply/interchange agreements
with GUYBAU and the City of New Amsterdam have been signed.



- ii -
vi.       The Bank loan would finance frequency converters, material
for conversion of customers' equipment, 13.8 kV distribution, engineering
services, training services and interest during construction on the Bank
loan; the UK loan would finance diesel generation and conversion of
existing diesel sets; the Canadian loan would finance 69 kV transmission,
and utility equipment for the conversion.
vii.      GEC has employed  foreign engineering consultants for the pro-
ject and detailed design is in progress. Construction is scheduled for
the period 1972 to 1976. Procurement for the Bank loan would be on the
basis of international competitive bidding,except for negotiated contracts
for cuatomerst conversion equipment; procurement under the UK and Canadian
loans would be on the basis of campetitive bidding among suppliers in the UK
and Canada, respectively. The project has no adverse environmental aspects.
viii.     In the pbriod 1972-1976, GEC's financing requirements, including
vorking capital, of some G$72.2 million (US$33.3 million equivalent)
would be provided 36% from internal cash generation, 52% from the proposed
loans, and the remaining 12% from Government and local bank loans.
ix.       Integration of the national electricity sitpply by frequency
standardization and system interconnection is less costly than continuing
to operate separate systems.  The return on the project investment is
estiiated at 16.5%.
x.        On the basis of the agreements reached the project is suitable
for a Bank loan of US$6.0 million equivalent for a term of 20 years
including a 4 year grace period.

APPRAISAL OF A GENERATION, TRAN54ISSION AND FREQUENCY
CONVERSION PROJECT
1L INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Guyana ELectricity Corporation (GEC), a government-owned
electric utility supplying the Georgetown area and several smaller centers,
has requested a Bank loan of us$6.0 million equivalent to assist in
financing the foreign exchange cost of a generation, transmission and
frequency conversion project, estimated to cost US$23.1 million equivalent,
to be constructed during 1972 to 1976. To provide the balance of the
foreign exchange financing, the government of Guyana has also requested
loans of £3.1. million (about US$7.5 million equivalent) and Can$4.0 million
(about Us$14.0 million equivalent) from the Overseas Development Administration
of the United Kingdom (UK) and the Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA), respectively. The combined Bank/UK/CIDA project would represent over
70% of the cost of the power development program of GEC for the period 1972 to
1976, estimated at US$31.1 million equivalent.
1.02      Since the UK and CIDA loans are essential to the project, the
signing of these two loans would be a condition of effectiveness of the
Bank loan.
1.03      The project would comprise about 36 MW of diesel generation, a
69 kV transmission system, 30 IMW of frequency converters, 13.8 kV
distribution facilities, frequency conversion of existing systems, engineer-
ing services and training services.
1.04      The UK and CIDA have indicated their willingness to participate
in financing the project, provided that the Bank approves a loan for its
portion of the project, under the following arrangement. The proposed
Bank loan would finance frequency converters, 13.8 kV distribution facilities,
material for frequency conversion of customers' equipment, engineering
services for the project/expansion plan, training services and interest
during construction on the Bank loan; the UK loan would finance about 36 MW
of diesel generators and conversion of existing diesel sets; the CIDA loan
would finance 69 kV transmission facilities and conversion of utility
equipment.
1.05      The Bank loan would be made directly to GEC. The UK and CIDA
loans would be made to the Government of Guyana. The UK loan would be
at 3% interest while the CIDA loan would be at no interest. The Government
of Guyana would relend the full amount of these two loans to GEC at 6.2%.
1.06      This would be the first Bank loan for power in Guyana; earlier
loans/credits have been made in agriculture, education and sea defense.

1.07      This report  was based on information gathered by E. A. Moore
and G. Prenoveau during a mission to Guyana in November/December 1971 and
by Messrs. Prenoveau and Wieseman during a mission in May/June 1972.
For well over a year, prior to appraisal, the Bank provided substantial
guidance and advice to GEC on the identification and preparation of the
project.

2.   THE POWER SECTOR
Economic Background
2.01      Guyana is a country with an area of 83,000 square miles and
a population estimated at 732,000. About 90% of the population lives
in the narrow coastal plain comprising less than 5% of the area of the
country. Most of the coastal area is below sea level and protected
by sea defenses.
2.02      Guyana's known resources are modest; the hinterland is still
being explored. Economic activity is concentrated on three basic
commodities -- bauxite and related products, sugar, and rice -- which
together account for 33% of GDP and about 85% of the value of commodity
exports. On this narrow productive base and despite poor rice crops,
real output has graon at an estimated rate of 4.0% per annum since
1965, or about 2% in per capita terms. By 1971, gross national product
per capita was about US$323.
2.03      Given the importance of bauxite to the Guyanese economy, the
country's economic fortunes over the next few years depend to a large
extent on the prospects of the government-owned Guyana Bauxite Company
(GUYBAU), which was established in 1971 to operate the bauxite mining!
processing facilities formerly owned by the Aluminum Company of Canada.
Assuming therefore that GUYBAU will substantially expand its production
capacity in the mid-seventies, that rice production will respond to the
rehabilitation program now underway with large US assistance, that
Guyana's sugar production will continue to expand slightly while main-
taining a high degree of efficiency, and that fishing and forestry
resources, over the medium term, will be more intensively exploited,
it is expected that, in the period 1971 to 1977, GDP will grow at
5.2 annually, the population at 2.4g and GNP per capita at 2.8%.
Energy Resources
2.04      Guyana has no fossil fuel deposits and therefore imports oil
for its thermal plants from Caribbean sources. The only indigenous
fuel is bagasse, a sugar cane residue, which is burned at the sugar
estate plants. All generating facilities are thermal except for one
small government-owned hydroelectric plant. The country has several
hydroelectric sites, including those at Tiger Hill and Tiboku Falls
identified by a UNDP-financed study in 1967, but the large potential
capacity of the sites identified precludes their development for the
present.
2.05      The Government wishes to exploit its hydroelectric power
resources, however, and is considering undertaking a country-wide
hydroelectric survey.  It has had initial discussions with UNDP which



- 4-
has indicated that it might finance such a study and has sent to Guyana in
June 1972 a mission to review and collect available hydro and electric power
sector information. A further UNDP mission is planned to prepare with the
Government the terms of reference and the application for such study.  The
Bank has indicated its willingness to act subsequently as executing agency.
History of the Sector
2.06      Electric power was first developed in Guyana in 1900 when local
businessmen formed the Demerara Electric Company (DEC) to supply electricity
to Georgetown. In 1925 the International Power Company of Canada purchased
DEC and, in 1928, this company constructed the Kingston 50 Hz steam plant in
Georgetown. Meanwhile the Aluminum Company of Canada had installed 60 Hz
generation at its bauxite-mining faciLities at Linden, and at New Amsterdam
the local Government had established a 60 Hz power system. The British
Guiana Electricity Corporation, which became GEC after the country gained
independence in 1966, was established in 1957 and acquired the DEC facili-
ties in 1960. During the sixties the Reynolds Guyana Mines Company (Reynolds)
started its bauxite-mining operation using 60 Hz generation. Over the years,
in the absence of a national electricity supply, many private plants were
established to supply sugar estates, mining operations, rice mills, and
centers of population.
2.07      This evolution of the power sector as a number of separate
systems established by industries and municipalities has resulted in
the systems having differences in operating characteristics, for
example, some use 50 Hz and a customer's voltage of 240 volts, some
50 Hz and 115 volts, and others 60 Hz and 115 volts. The use of two
frequencies makes integration impossible until conversion to one frequency
is effected at substantial cost.
Sector Facilities
2.08      The installed generating capacity in the country is shown in
Annex 1. The principal power producers are GEC, GUYBAIJ, Reynolds, the
City of New Amsterdam and Bookers Sugar Estates, Limited (Bookers).
Of a national generating capacity of 111 MW, 80% is government-owned and
20% is privately-owned. The operating characteristics for the principal
systems are shown in Annex 2; 55% of the installed generating capacity
is at 50 Hz and 45% is at 60 Hz.
2.09      GEC is responsible for power supply in Guyana, except in
locations already served by captive industrial plant or municipal systems.
The GEC main system (33 MW demand) serves Georgetown and nearby areas
and is supplied by the 38.5 MW Kingston steam plant and diesel sets.
GEC also operates separate systems with small diesel sets (total load
2 MW) at Anna Regina, Onverwaagt and Bartica. All GEC systems operate
at 50 Hz. The 60 Hz GUYBAU system (23 MW demand) at Linden, sixty
miles inland, serves the bauxite-mining operation and local loads and
is supplied by a 27.5 MW steam plant and diesel sets. The City of
New Amsterdam and Reynolds operate small 60 Hz separate systems supplied
by diesel sets. Annex 3 shows further details of the sector facilities.



Sector Organization
2.10      The Government exercises control of GEC through the Guyana State
Corporation (GUYSTAC), a public corporation which the Government
established in 1971 to supervise, control, coordinate and hold the State
interest in other public corporations (Annex 4). In addition, the
Ministry of Finance has jurisdiction over regulatory matters including
service areas, franchises, tariffs and inspection of electrical
facilitites.
2.11      The legislation which created GEC in 1957 set the stage for
the eventual centralization of power sector planning by assigning GEC
broad responsibilitites, including advising the Government on generation,
transmission, and distribution matters. GEC has fulfilled its function
as a generation and distribution company but there has been little central
coordination within the power sector, that is, with respect to the power
plans of industrial and municipal systems. However, partly due to the
preparatory discussions with the Bank resulting in this project, GEC has
assumed increasingly more responsibility in the power sector and is now
emerging as a national electricity supply organization.
2.12      In 1971, after full review, including discussions with Venezuela
concerning that country's recently completed frequency conversion program,
the Government of Guyana enacted legislation establishing 60 Hz as the
national standard and requiring imported equipment to be adaptable to it.
This legislation forms the basis for the GEC frequency conversion program.
The Government's action was well considered; it will standardize the
supply for the customers, facilitate national interconnection and, with
the 50 Hz and 60 Hz loads being combined, open the way for the development
of hydroelectric sites. It will facilitate interconnection with Guyana's
neighbours, Venezuela, Surinam and Brazil which have 60 Hz power systems.
2.13      The transmission facilities to be provided in the proposed
project will interconnect the GEC, GUYRAU, New Amsterdam and possibly the
Reynolds systems and permit the coordination of their system operations.
In the future GEC would provide generating capacity to meet system load
growth and power supply/interchange agreements with GUYBAU and the City
of New Amsterdam have been signed (Annex 9).

3.  THE BORRCWER
GEC Organization
3.01      GEC is a public corporation with responsibility for public
electricity supply as vested in it by the 1957 Electricity Ordinance
and subsequent legislation, including the 1971 Public Corporations
(Amendment)Act which established GUYSTAC to control government-owned
corporations. Under existing legislation GUYSTAC has very broad powers
to exercise supervision and control over GEC (Annex 4). During negotia-
tions GUYSTAC therefore agreed to use its powers to enable GEC to
fulfill its commitments under the proposed loan.
3.02      GEC's Board consists of a Chairman (the Vice-President of
GUYSTAC), a Deputy-Chairman (the GEC General Manager), the Chief
Accountant, Chief Mechanical Engineer and Chief Electrical Engineer
of GEC, a representative selected by GEC's employees and three other
members appointed by the President of GUYSTAC.
3.03      GEC's responsibilities include operation of its existing
facilities, development of additional facilities and financing of its
operations (Annex 6). In addition to the four systems it now operates
(para. 2.09) under Government franchises, GEC has obtained franchises
to extend its service on the Wakenaam/Leguan Islands, to Linden and tc
the Corentyne coastal area, and has made plans to supply the prospective
pumping loads for drainage of the coastal farming areas. The supply of
the Linden and Corentyne area is an integral part of the project (para.
3.06, and Annex 6).
300o      GEC has three divisional officers--the Chief Mechanical
Engineer responsible for generating plant operations, the Chief
Electrical Engineer for distribution system operations, and the
Chief Accountant for accounting, purchasing, stores and contracts.
The Staff totals 800, which is a reasonable size. There is a shortage
of experienced managerial personnel. The General Manager, who has been
on loan to GEC is returning to private industry at the end of 1972 and
Is to be replaced by the Chief Mechanical Engineer who appears satisfac-
torily qualified.
3.05      During negotiations GEC has agreed to maintain a Planning and
Construction Division, with terms of reference, organization and staff
arrangements satisfactory to the Bank, as shown in Annex 5.
GEC also plans to decentralize its distribution staff, presently in
offices at the Kingston plant in Georgetown, by establishing local
offices in the Corentyne and Essequibo Districts.



-7-
GEC Power Development Program
3.06      Before the decision had been taken to unify frequency, and before
the project proposed for Bank financing had been formulated, GEC was projecting
generating capacity deficits in its isolated systems and accordingly arranged
to purchase 19 MW of small light-oil-burning diesel sets in j970 for installa-
tion by 1973 (Annex 6). In addition to installing these diesel sets, and
not part of the US$23.1 million project (para. 4.07), GEC plans during 1972-76
to construct distribution facilities for its new service areas and its system
extensions. To ensure distribution of the power provided by the project
facilities, GEC has agreed to complete the construction of the self-financed
distribution facilities as provided for in the 1972-1976 program and has
agreed to review with the Bank its financing and construction plan thereof
from time to time.
3.07      Due to the uncertainty concerning the form of major generation
that will be developed subsequent to the planned 1972 to 1976 program
(pending the results of the UNDP financed hydroelectric survey-see para. 2.05),
GEC has not prepared a long term power development program beyond 1976. However1
in anticipation of a need for additional interim generation prior to the avail-
ability of either hydroelectric or steam generation, GEC has made tentative
plans to install two 6 MW diesel generators, in addition to the six units
provided in the project, for service in 1978 (para. 4.03).

4. THE PROJECT
4.o0      The project would constitute the major portion of GEC's 1972-1976
power development program estimated to cost US$31.1 million equivalent.
Interconnection of Systems
4.02      To interconnect the Georgetarwn, Onverwaagt and Corentyne systems of GEC
and the GUYBAU, New Amsterdam and possibly the Reynolds systems, a 69 kV, 60 Hz
transmission system would be constructed for commissioning in 1973/74 comprising
135 miles of 69 kV wood-pole transmission line, the 69 kV crossing
over the Berbice River and seven 69/13.8 kV substations. The West Demerara
portion of the Georgetown system including the diesel generation at Versailles
would be converted to 60 Hz during 1973 to permit its connection to this new
transmission system. About 20 MW of frequency converters would be installed in
1974 at the new Georgetown substation to connect the Georgetown 50 Hz system to
the 60 Hz system. More converter capacity would be added in 1976 to raise the
total to about 30 SW.
Diesel Generation 1
4.03      To supply the increasing loads on the prospective interconnected
system 36 MW of residual-oil-burning diesel generating capacity would be
installed comprising four 6 MW units at a new plant (Garden of Eden) on the
east bank of the Demerara River about 15 miles south of Georgetown, and two
6 MW units at the Rotterdam plant on the east bank of the Berbice River.
Location of the plants on the rivers w11 facilitate fuel delivery and
provide a source of cooling water. Each plant would have space for one
additional unit (para. 3.07)-.
Frequency Conversion
4.04      The project would include the conversion to 60 Hz of the 50 Hz
diesel generators at Anna Regina and Versailles (Annex 6), the conversion
to 60 Hz of equipment on the Onverwaagt, Anna Regina and Georgetown systems,
and the frequency converters which would serve as a permanent system connec-
tion for the existing three 50 Hz, 10 MW steam units of the Kingston plant
(these units have about 15 years of additional life; their conversion to
60 Hz would be very costly). The twenty-year old, 50 Hz, 3.5 and 5.0 MW
steam units would be taken out of continuous service after completing the
frequency conversion. Special tools and equipment required by GEC for the
frequency conversion work, including a mobile workshop, would be included
in the project. Map IBRD 3917R1 shows the final arrangements; on the basis of
the present plant the only 50 Hz facilities remaining would be at Kingston
plant. The frequency conversion portion of the project would require
j   This appraisal is based on the addition of six 6 MW diesel units of the
"medium speed-residual oil burning" type. Its conclusions and recmnmenda-
tions will not be affected if, in order to obtain optimum competitive bids
for same type units, the individual unit size should deviate from 6 MW,
provided a total of approximately 36 MW is added under the project.



particular attention from the standpoint of coordination and logistics.
During negotiations GEC agreed to have a master plan for the frequency
conversion prepared in collaboration with its consultants within nine
months of the signing of the loan.
Distribution Facilities
4.05      The project would include the provision of distribution facilities
in the new service areas. In addition,GEC will complete the construction of
the distribution facilities it finances (para. 3.06).
Training
4.06      The project would include a management training program for senior
personnel to improve the quality of management (para.3.0h). During loan
negotiations GEC agreed to engage consultants, satisfactory to the Bank, to
develop an appropriate management training program to be submitted to the
Bank within nine months of the effectiveness of the loan and thereafter to
carry out the program. CIDA has indicated that an amount of US$200,000
equivalent would be provided to GEC, independent of the project, for
technical assistance in system engineering, system operations and equipment
maintenance; under the CIDA training program GEC would receive exqpatriate
technical assistance and some GEC engineers would go to Canada for training
with Canadian utilities and engineering firms.

4.08      The cost estimate includes a physical contingency of about 10% for
both local and foreign costs to allow for uncertainties in design and
construction. It also includes a price contingency of about 6% for both
local and foreign costs based on estimated price increases of 4% per year.
The cost estimate was prepared by GEC's engineering consultant (para. 4I.10)
and is reasonable.
4.09      The proposed Bank loan would amount to US$6.0 million equivalent
and would finance the equipment and services listed under Bank financing
in paragraph 4.07. The proposed loan would represent 26% of the US$23.1
million equivalent total cost of the project and 37% of its US$16.4 million
equivalent foreign exchange cost.
Engineering and Construction
4.10      GEC has employed the 8hawinigan Engineering Company Limited
(Shawinigan), a Canadian firm, as its engineering consultant for the
design, construction, supervision, procurement and management of the project
(including the UK and CIDA financed portions) and to advise on the remainder
of the power development program (Annex 6). Shawinigan is also to train
GEC's engineering personnel and utilize them in the project work. During
negotiations GEC agreed to retain engineering consultants satisfactory to
the Bank throughout the design and construction of the project. Installation
of major equipment would be carried out by the suppliers (para. 4.11). Civil
engineering works would be by local contractors and would not be financed by
the Bank.
Procurement
4.11     lThe procurement of the frequency converters and 13.8 kV distribution
equipment financed by the Bank loan would be on the basis of international
competitive bidding and contracts would be let on a "supply and install" or
"supply" basis,respectively. Due to the variety of items involved and the
need for matching the original equipment, competitive bidding would not be
used for some of the material and equipment required for the conversion of
customers' equipment; the amount expended from the proposed loan in this
respect is not expected to exceed US$400,000 equivalent. During negotiations
the Guyanese delegation stated that Guyana does not produce and would be
unable to supply domestically any of the goods to be financed from the Bank
loan; the question of preference for domestic supplies therefore does not
arise.  Since GEC is exempt from import duty on equipment and material im-
ported for its 1972-76 construction program (para. 6.14) the margin of
regional preference (of the Caribbean Free Trade Association) allowable
under the Bank's guidelines for procurement will also not be applicable.
Disbursements
4.12      Disbursements would be made against the foreign exchange costs of:
(i) imported equipment and materials; (ii) "supply and install" contracts;
and (iii) engineering and management training services, as listed in para.
4.07 under "Bank Financing".  In order to meet the installation schedules,
GEC's engineering consultant has commenced the engineering work for the
project; it is proposed that the foreign exchange cost of engineering
services would be financed retroactively to December 1, 1971 involving an



- 12 -
amount of up to US$750,000 equivalent  j/. No other disbursements would
be made for expenditures made prior to signing the loan. Annex 7 shows the
estimated schedule of disbursements for the Bank loan. Any funds remaining
undisbursed on completion of the project would be cancelled unless needed
for concurrent work related to the project and/or feasibility studies for
further power investment subject to B3ank approval.
14.13     The equipment and material financed by the UK and CIDA loans
would be procured on the basis of competitive bidding among suppliers
in the United Kingdom and Canada, respectively.  The consultants are to
provide procurement services for the project (para. 4.10); in this
respect, arrangements for the coordination of disbursements for facilities
financed by the Bank, the UK and CIDA were discussed during negotiations.
Project Suervision
4.14      Bank supervision missions would review progress of the project
including work in connection with UK and CIDA financed facilities. The
latters' representatives would be expected to participate as they feel
appropriate. This was discussed during negotiations.
Ecological Considerations
4.15      As the two diesel plants would be located some distance fram
heavily-populated areas, noise and the exhaust gases would not be
bothersome. As heat exchangers would be used on the engine cooling systems,
the possibility of polluting the rivers with oil from the cooling water will
be eliminated. The 69 kV transmission line would be routed some distance
from the Demerara River road and from the coastal roads which it would
parallel. The project should mtcause any adverse environmental effects.
jl This has been reported in the Monthly Operational Summary.

5. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Background
5.01      Given, until recently, the uncertainties of frequency standardiza-
tion and that a hydroelectric survey has still to be made, no long-term power
development program beyond 1976 had been prepared in Guyana. The proposed
project, which marks the first Bank involvement in power in the country, will
provide a base for the formulation of a long term program after the hydro-
electric potential is known.
The Power Market
5.02      The load growth was examined for each of the present systems which
when caabined will form the interconnected system. The 1971-76 peak loads
for the separate and interconnected systems are shown in Annex 8 and the
sales forecast is shown in Annex 9. An average annual growth rate of 11,4%
is estimated for the interconnected system in 1972-76, resulting in an estimated
demand of 107 NW in 1976 as described in Annex 9. The forecast is reasonable.
Installed Capacity 2.
5.03      GEC's forecast indicates that even after the installation of 4x6 MW
diesel electric generators in 1974 there will be a deficit (after provision
for reserve) of 9 MN on the Georgetown, GUYBAU and Corentyne systems, unless
they are interconnected (Annex 11). By combining reserve capacities, inter-
connection would result in providing a surplus of about 8 MW in 1974 and
would provide correspondingly larger savings in capacity in later years.
5.04      As indicated in Annex 12, the additional 2x6 MW generators would be
required in 1975/76. This would provide adequate capacity until 1978. With
interim diesel capacity added by GEC after this project (para. 3.07), additional
capacity might be provided by hydroelectric power if appropriate sites for
development are identified in the hydroelectric survey.
Interconnection and Frequency Unification
5.05      Interconnection of the power systems in Guyana would lead to
substantial economies. Required capacity will be less and reserve capacity
kept minimal. Larger sized units, with their lower unit costs, could be
installed. Savings in fuel and additonal operating economies will result,
and service will be inproved by coordinating maintenance outages in
generating plant.
5.06      To achieve many of the economies of interconnection described it
is necessary to standardize the frequency in Guyana. As the neighbouring
countries use 60 Hz and the predominantly residential 50 Hz load can be
converted more readily than the industrial 60 Hz load, use of 60 Hz is
advantageous. Historically many systems have found it essential to unify
I/ See also comments in footnote for para. 4.03.



- 14 -
the freqi4ency in the interests of standardization of their own facilities,
of industrial equipment and domestic appliances, and of obtaining economies
of scale and in aggregate generating capacity.
Least Cost Solution
5.07      If the present pattern of separate systems and two frequencies in
Guyana is continued, by 1976 the installed generating capacity will be about
15 MW greater than for an interconnected system and a US$1.0 million higher
fuel cost would be entailed each year due to the operation of high-operating-
cost, light-oil-fueled diesel sets instead of the residual-oil-fueled diesel
generators provided in the project in conjunction with interconnection of
the systems. The diesel generators were found to be the most economical
form of generation to install; steam generating capacity could not be installed
by 1974 and gas turbines would require high-cost light oil (US$1.12 per MBTU)
as they cannot burn the high sulphur/vanadium-content residual oil fuel
(US$0.53 per MBTU) used by the project diesel generators. The higher cost
of fuel would more than offset the lower capital cost of gas turbines.
5.08      The consultants have determined that interconnection of the systems
with frequency standardization and the installation of residual-oil-burning
diesel generating plant is the least cost solution for any rate of interest
less than 20%.
Return on Project Investment
5.09      A conservative estimate of the rate of return on the project,
consisting of generation, transmission and distribution expansion and the
frequency conversion of the GEC system, is 16.5%. In this calculation,
the stream of costs includes capital and operating costs (taking into
account fuel cost savings at existing plant but excluding taxes and depre-
ciation). Shadow pricing was not considered necessary for foreign exchange
or local labor costs. The stream of benefits consists of the increase in
GEC revenues from sales attributable to the project. Raising or lowering
attributable revenues by 15% would provide rate of return estimates of
20.5/o and 12.5% respectively.

6. FThAIICIAL ASPECTS
6.01      After a long period of financial difficulty, GEC's financial
position improved considerably in the last 3 years. However, with the
planned expansion, which includes a substantial one-time capital
expenditure for frequency conversion, tariff action will be necessary
in the construction period of the proposed project in order to maintain
an adequate return.
GEC's Finances, Past and Present
6.02      GEC started operations in 1961 upon acquiring the assets of the
Demerara Electric Company Limited (DEC). Payment for these assets was
made largely out of the internal cash generation of GEC over a period of
about 3 years. Between 1962 and 1966, GEC expanded its Kingston plant
with short/medium term supplier financing. It received Government
assistance in the form of capital contributions and tax deferments, and
resorted heavily to commercial bank borrowings. But because of these
financial arrangements, which stemmed to a great extent from inadequate
tariffs, insolvency appeared imminent in early 1968. At that time, the
Ccmmonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) came to the assistance of GEC
with a L400,000 (US$1 million) loan, in the process assuming the manage-
ment of GEC which it proceeded to reorganize. The new management improved
the tariff structure and raised electricity rates and changed the depreciation
policy to conform to general utility practices.  It embarked on a four-year
expansion program which, however, was stopped about one year later when GEC
and CDC mutually agreed to terminate the CDC management contract.
6.03      During the years 1969-71, GEC expanded relatively little,
obtained excellent returns on its investment, retained all income in the
business, continued to receive income tax deferments and was therefore
able to reduce its long term debt to manageable size. Indeed at the end
of 1971, GEC long-term debt including tax deferments amounted to
US$3.2 million, barely 27% of its capital structure and its debt service
presented no problem. Its long term debt consisted of the CDC loan of
t400,000 which is repayable over ten years beginning in 1973; this loan
carries a first floating charge but CDC has already given its consent
to ranking the proposed Bank loan pari passu with it; a commercial bank
loan of US$1.0 million which is repayable in equal amounts in 1973 and
1974; and finally tax deferments of US$1.3 million part of which has
recently been reduced by means of a second commercial bank loan of
US$1.0 million repayable over 5 years, commencing in 1973.
GEC's Financing Plan 1972-1976
6.o4      With the assistance of the Bank, GEC has established its
1972-76 expansion program and requested from the Bank, the U.K. and CIDA
loans totalling US$17.5 million equivalent. These loans will cover the
bulk of the foreign cost of the program as well as the portion of the
local cost associated with the UK financing.



- 16 -
6.05      Annex 17 shows in detail GEC's financing plan  for 1972-76, This
plan assumes a minimum return on total investment of about 10% throughout the
period, a level which will require tariff increases of some 10.7% in
1974 and 6% in 1976.  The rate of return on investment is equal to net
operating income after taxes as a percentage of average net fixed assets
in operation plus a working capital allowance consisting of 4% of average
net fixed assets in operation and 10% of annual cash operating expenses.
During negotiations, GEC agreed to earn not leas than 10% return on
investment throughout the life of the proposed loan. The financing plan
is summarized below.

6.06      In the period 1972-76, internally generated funds are expected
to finance about 36% of GEC's construction program and increase in
working capital. Of the remainder, the IBRD/UK/CIDA combined loans would
provide 52%, the Government of Guyana 9% and Commercial Banks 3%.
6.07      It is assumed the proposed Bank loan of US$6 million will be
made to GEC at 7% interest for a period of 20 years, including 4 years
of grace. The loan would include US$1.1 million for interest during
construction on the Bank financed facilities; this is considered
necessary to complete the financing plan. The Government has indicated
it would charge GEC a fee of 1% on the unpaid balance of this loan to
cover its guarantee to the Bank.
6.08      The UK and CIDA would make their loans to the Government.  The
UK loan would be for 25 years, including a 4-year grace period, with



- 17 -
interest at 3%; the CIDA loan would be for 50 years, including a 10-year
grace period, without interest.  The Government would relend the proceeds
of these loans to GEC at 6.2% interest for a period of 25 years including
a 4-year grace period. Signing of the UK and CIDA loans would be a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan.
6.09      The Government would loan GEC the remainder of its financing
requirements in the period 1972-76, which would build up to about
US$2.9 million by the end of 1975 and go down to about US$2.2 million at
the end of 1976. This loan would be for 20 years, including a grace
period of 8 years, with interest at 8%. During negotiations the Govern-
ment confirmed this arrangement. In addition the Government agreed to
make up any shortfall in GEC's finances in order that the program may be
completed as planned.
6.10      The financing plan assumes that the financial resources of GEC
in the period 1972-76 will be devoted to the construction program, the
servicing of debt and an increase in working capital. GUYSTAC, GEC's
owner, agrees with the necessity for these arrangements. During
negotiations GEC confirmed these understandings.
Future Financing Situation
6.11      GEC's financial outlook depends largely on its ability to
obtain tariff increases when required (para. 6.05), and to complete its
expansion program as planned in order to obtain the additional revenue
which would be required.
6.12      Sales of energy will more than double in the period 1972-76.
Average revenues are forecast to decrease until 1976 because sales to
bulk consumers at lower average tariffs are expected to grow faster than
those to other consumers. Thereafter average revenues are expected to
increase because in that year, income tax abatements (para. 6.13) will
not be so important as in previous years and a tariff increase will be
required. Operating expenses have been projected on the basis of GEC's
experience and appear reasonable. The cost of fuel is expected to rise
from US$0.005 per kWh to US$0.006 per kWh effective January 1973, when
the existing fixed-price fuel contract will expire. Depreciation has
been applied at rates which reflect the useful life of the assets and are
consistent with utility practice. During negotiations GEC agreed to
maintain depreciation on the same basis.
6.13      GEC is subject to income tax at the rate of 45% but each year
in periods of expansion it is allowed to reduce its taxable income by
amounts up to 40% of the value of new plant additions made during the
year. During negotiations GEC agreed to avail itself of this income tax
relief.
6.14      Since GEC's 1972-76 program is one of capital investment, the
Government has indicated that it will exempt GEC frcm a 10% duty which would
otherwise apply to all imported material and equipment to be purchased for
the 1972-76 capital expenditure program. During negotiations the Government
agreed that in the event of a policy change it will make equity contributions
to GEC in amounts equal to any import duties GEC may have to pay on materials
and equipment included in the 1972-76 program.

6.15      As indicated in the Forecast Sources and Applications of Funds
Statement (Annex 17) annual debt service coverage by internal sources
is expected to be around 2.3 during the period 1972-76. However, given
the planned financing arrangements, the bulk of the amortizations would
not start until after 1976, when it is expected the annual debt service
coverage would be reduced substantially.  During negotiations GEC agreed
that during the life of the proposed loan it would not incur debt other
than for carrying out the program, unless net revenues of the previous
consecutive 12-month period (revenues less operating expenditure before
depreciation and interest) cover the maximum debt service of any
subsequent year 1.5 times.
Tariffs
6.16      The Minister of Finance sets the maximum price per kWh at which
electricity may be sold to consumers throughout Guyana. The prevailing
maximum was set at G$0.15 per kWh in March 1968.
6.17      GEC last revised its tariffs in February 1970 (Annex 14).  They
are of the block type with monthly minima and appear to be well
structured. As explained in para. 6.05 tariff increases will be required
during the expansion program period, 1972-1976.
Audit
6.18      Audited financial statements of the past several years were
submitted to the Bank during the appraisal. During negotiations GEC
agreed to retain independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank and to
submit audited financial statements each year for the duration of the
loan.

7. AGREEMNTS REACHED AND RECOMXENDATION
7.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
points:
(a)  GEC will:
(i)  maintain a planning and construction division satisfactory
to the Bank (para. 3.05);
(ii) complete the construction of the distribution facilities
planned for the 1972-1976 program to be reviewed with the
Bank from time to time (para.3.06);
(iii) submit to the Bank a master plan for the frequency conversion
within nine months of loan signing (para. 4.04);
(iv)  engage consultants satisfactory to the Bank to conduct a
management training program (para. 4.06);
(v)  retain engineering consultant satisfactory to the Bank
throughout the design and construction of the project
(para. 4.10);
(vi)  take action as required to ensure a minimum of 10% return on
investment throughout the life of the loan (para. 6.05);
(vii) devote its financial resources in the period 1972-1976 to
the construction program, the servicing of debt and an
increase in working capital (para. 6.10);
(viii) maintain depreciation in accordance with actual practice
(para. 6.12);
(ix)  avail itself of the income tax reliefs which are allowed
in proportion to its annual investment in electric plant
(para. 6.13);
(x)  not incur debt during the life of the loan other than for
carrying out the program, unless net revenues of the
previous consecutive 12-month period (revenues less operating
expenditures before depreciation and interest) cover maximum
debt service of any subsequent year 1.5 tiaes (para. 6.15);
and
(xi)  retain independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank and
submit audited statements to the Bank each year during the
life of the loan (para. 6.18).
(b) The Guyanese Government will:
(i) lend GEC US$2.9 million equivalent in the period 1972-75
on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank (para. 6.09);



- 20 -
(ii)  make up any shortfall (including coat overruns) in GEC's
finances during the expansion program on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank (para. 6.09); and
(iii)  make equity contributions to GEC in amounts equal to any
import duties GEC may have to pay on materials and
equipment in the 1972-76 construction program in the
event of a change in present Government policy (para. 6.14).
(c) GUYSTAC will:
(i) use its powers to enable GEC to carry out its undertakings
under the proposed loan (para.3.01).
7.02      As a condition of loan effectiveness, the Government has agreed to
obtain loans for the project of £3.1 million (about US$7.5 million equivalent)
and Can$4.0 million (about US$l4.O million equivalent) fram the UK and CIDA,
respectively and to relend the proceeds of these loans to GEC on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank (para. 6.08).
7.03      On the basis of the foregoing, the project is suitable for a Bank
loan of US$6.0 million equivalent for a term of 20 years including a 4-year
grace period.

POWER SECTOR FACILITIES
GEC
1.        GEC operates 50 Hz isolated power systems at Georgetown, Anna
Regina, Onverwaagt and Bartica. In 1971, the total peak load on these
systems was 31.2 NW, of which 29.2 MW was on the Georgetown system.
2.        The GEC Georgetown system supplies the city of Georgetown, the
coastal area west of the Demerara River (by submarine cables), and, over
long distribution feeders an area east 32 miles along the Atlantic coast
and an area south 26 miles along the east bank of the Demerara River. The
generating capacity on the system comprises the 38.5 MW residual-oil burning
Kingston steam plant, two 1.0 NW railroad-type diesel sets (rated 60 Hz but
operating at 50 Hz) at Ruimveldt near Kingston, and a 750 kW diesel set at
Versailles in West Demerara.
3.        The Anna Regina, Onverwaagtand Bartica separate systems supply
these towns and nearby coastal areas from small diesel sets.
GUYBAU
4.        At Linden, sixty miles inland on the Demerara River, GUYBAU
mines over 3 million tons of bauxite annually in an open-pit operation
using electric-powered equipment. The output is processed for shipment
as either metal-grade bauxite, calcined bauxite or alumina.
5.        The generating capacity on the 13.8 kV, 60 Hz, GUYBAU system
includes a 27.5 MW residual-oil-burning steam plant, which also provides
steam for alumina production, and a 3.0 MW diesel standby plant. GUYBAU
also provides electric service to residential/commercial customers in
the Linden area (25,000 population); the load breakdown is as follows:
Mine equipment                    5 Mw
Bauxite and calcining plants      4 MW
Alumina plant                    10 lW
Residential/commercial load      4 MW
Total  23 MW
REYNOLDS
6.        Reynolds has a bauxite mine at Kwakwani about 80 miles inland
on the Berbice River, from which it barges the bauxite to its mill at
Everton for processing before shipment. The Reynolds generating capacity
consists of 60 Hz diesel sets totalling 2.7 MW and 4.5 MW at the mine



ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 2
and mill, respectively.  The Reynolds generation supplies only the company
load.
NOW AMSTERDAM
7.        The City of New Amsterdam has a Government franchise for electricity
supply in the city and an area 5 miles beyond the city limits and operates a
60 Hz system supplied by 4.5 MW of diesel generating capacity. Included in
this capacity are two 1.5 MW sets which were installed in late 1971.
MIESCELLANEOUS
8.        Bookers operates separate thermal/diesel plants on its ten sugar
estates, aggregating 15.6 MW of capacity. During sugar production generation
is from bagasse-fired thermal units; diesel sets are operated during the off-
season and as standby capacity. (Bookers is not considering interconnecting
its ten systems with the GEC system at this time because they are largely
self-sufficient and the load growth is forecast at only 2% annually).
9.        There are miscellaneous small plants in the country aggregating 5 MW
in capacity as shown in Annex 1. All of this generating capacity operates at
50 Hz except the 1.9 MW government-owned Tumatumari 60 Hz hydroelectric plant
on the Potaro River in the interior.

GUYANA ELECTRICITY CORPORATION (GEC)
Responsibilities
1.        Under the existing legislation GEC has the following responsi-
bilities:
a)  to operate efficiently its existing generating and
distribution facilities;
b)  to plan and develop new facilities as required to
supply electricity at a reasonable price within its
assigned service areas;
c)  to promote the use of electricity with a view to
assisting Guyana's economic development;
d)  to advise the Government on matters relating to
the generation, transmission, distribution and
use of electricity;
e)  to borrow money, with the approval of the Government,
through loans or the issue of stocks and debentures,
to finance new facilities, or for debt refinancing or
working capital;
f) with the Government's approval to set electricity
sales tariffs within the limit prescribed by the
Government; and
g)  to prepare an annual report covering its activities
and financial position.
Service Area
2.        GEC's presently franchised service area includes Guyana's coastal
area from the mouth of the Corentyne river westward to about 10 miles
northwest of Anna Regina (except for the City of New Amsterdam) and extends
inland about: 50 miles up the Corentyne river, 30 miles up the Berbice river,
60 miles up the Demerara river and 70 miles up the Essequibo river.
Power Development Program
3.        In 1970, while the Government was giving consideration to the
question of frequency standardization, GEC ordered 15 diesel sets totalling
19 PW in capacity, 12 NW rated 50 Hz and 7 MW rated 60 Hz. GEC's intention



ANNEX 6
Page 2 of 3
at the time was to adopt 60 Hz as the frequency for new areas while retaining
50 Hz for use in its existing service areas. In late 1970, GEC proposed a
major development program based on installing this diesel capacity, to be
followed by the installation of two 20 MW steam units. In the light of the
Government's subsequent decision to standardize at a frequency of 60 Hz, in
mid-1971, GEC engaged The Shawinigan Engineering Company Limited (Shavinigan)
a Canadian finm, to carry out a feasibility study covering future system
development. The present program for the period 1972 to 1976, which
necessarily must include the use of the diesel sets ordered in 1970, is
based on Shawinigan's proposals. In addition to the project, the program
includes the following plan of diesel set installation and distribution
system construction:
a) two 1.0 MW 60 Hz diesel sets will be installed
on Wakenaam Island with a submarine cable connec-
tion to Leguan Island and distribution systems
will be constructed;
b) four 1.0 MW 60 Hz diese'l sets will be installed at
Onverwaagt, atd the distribution system will be
extended and converted to 60 Hz;
c) two 0.5 MW 60 Hz diesel sets will be installed at
Bartica and the system will be converted to 60 Hz;
d) two 1.0 MW 50 Hz diesel sets will be installed at
Anna Regina and the distribution system will be
extended;
e) four 2.0 MW 50 Hz diesel sets will be installed at
Versailles (the Anna Regina and Versailles sets will
later be converted to 60 Hz as part of the project);
f) a 60 Hz generator will be purchased to permit the
conversion of one 2.0 MW diesel set for installation
at a new GEC plant to be called "Rotterdam", near
Everton, (two 6 MW diesel generators will be installed
here later as part of the project 2/). The first stage
of the Corentyne distribution system will be constructed
and will be interconnected with the New Amsterdam and
possibly the Reynolds systems;
g) additional distribution facilities will be constructed
as required throughout the system; and
h) tentatively, two 6 MW diesel generators will be installed
for service in 1978 (dependent on future decisions concerrning
a long-term development program).

ANNEX 6
Page 3 of 3
4,        These installations will be financed from internal resources and
to the extent required by a Government loan (para. 6.09); it is estimated
that the 1972-76 portion will cost US$9.3 million equivalent. The small
light-oil-burning diesel sets will be installed in 1972 and early 1973.
5.        GEC has adopted 13.8 kV as the standard primary voltage for its
new distribution systems and plans to convert its existing systems to this
voltage as part of the 1972-76 program. As GUYEAU and Reynolds already use
13.8 kV, GiC's plan will standardize most of the primary distribution systems
in Guyana at 13.8 kV.

INTERCONNECTED SYSTEM LOAD FORECAST
GFX
1.        For the Georgetown system the average growth of electricity generated
in the period 1951-70 was 11% annually while the average growth of peak demand
was only 9% annually because the load factor increased gradually (Annex 10).
The Georgetown system is forecast to grow at 9.5% annually on the basis of the
following assumptions: a 9% annual growth in residential consumption due to new
housing in the Georgetown suburbs, an 8.5% annual growth of commercial
consumption, a small growth in the industrial component, a 13% annual growth in
the bulk supply of power to rice silos, pumping for drainage and other Government
projects, an 8% annual growth in the municipal consumption due to increase in
pumping water, and a 17% annual growth in street lighting consumption. This is
reasonable.
27        The GEC's Corentyne system will supply the coastal area which has a
population of 85,000 in 45 villages. The present electricity supply is very
limited and a market survey estimated that there are 10,000 potential
residential and commercial customers in the area. A pumping load of 3.8 NW to
drain coastal farming areas is to be connected by 1976. Additionally, a rice
silo project is under construction and there are many engine-driven drainage
and irrigation pumps which GEC expects will be converted to electric-drive once
electricity is available. The 1976 peak load in this area is forecast to be
10.9 SW on this basis.
3.        GEC plans to extend the distribution feeders on its Onverwaagt system
to supply sections of the Berbice coastal area presently without electricity.
A rice silo/research station project with a 1.0 1I load will be inaugurated in
1972. The 1976 peak load on this system is estimated at 4.5 MW including
1.5 M1 drainage pumping load. GEC also plans to extend distribution to the
Linden and Wismar areas involving a load forecast at 3.5 NW by 1976.
GUYBAU
4.        In addition to other facilities GUYBAU plans to expand its calcined
bauxite production by 50% by 1977 and a 7% annual growth rate, resulting in a
peak load of 31.3 1W by 1976, is forecast. The power supply/interchange
contract between GEC and GUYBAU (para. 2.13) specifies the obligations of
GUYBAU for the purchase of power and minimum annual payments to GEC.
Other Loads
5.        An annual growth of 22% is forecast for New Amsterdam, a city of
20,000, and a peak load of 5.3 MW by 1976 is indicated. The power supply/
interchange contract between GEC and the City of New Amsterdam provides for
interchange and sale of energy and of generating capacity when mutual-ly beneficial.
6.        The small Reynolds load is forecast to grow substantially but
it may not be interconnected for some time, and no sales to it from GEC have
been assumed.

1. In 1951-71 compounded average growth rate for energy  enerated was 11.1%
and for system peak demand 8.2% annually.  In 1971 tfe sytem losses
were 21.1% (with sales of 124,855 MWh).
2. Due to insufficient generating capacity available during annual peak

CAPACITr SITUATION IN 1974
The following tabulation shows the capacity situation for the main
area systems in 1974. Without an interconnection there would be a capacity
deficit of 8.7 NW on the Georgetown, GUYBAU and Corentyne systems. With an
interconnection there is an equivalent surplus of 8.3 MW.

ANNEX 13

GUYANA ELECTRICITY CORPORATION
RETURN ON PROJECT INVESTMENT
1.        The return on project investient has been determined by discounting
the net cost/benefit stream attributable to the project over its 20 year life and
finding the discount rate at which the present worth of the stream becomes
zero. The following elements were taken into consideration:
Costs
i)  Capital investment (net of duties and taxes) for diesel
generation, frequency converter and transmission plant
of the project, and for the distribution facilities
needed to distribute the energy generated by the project;
ii)  all frequency conversion costs of the project;
iii) project engineering and training costs;
iv)  all increases in operating, maintenance, and general
administration costs, exclusive of depreciation,
attributable to the project;
v) fuel costs for the production of energy by the project's
generation calculated as the net fuel cost increase
incorporating the fuel cost savings at light-oil-burning
plant; and
vi) purchases of power by GEC in 1974.
No shadow pricing has been considered necessary for foreign exchange or
labor costs.
Benefits
The revenues from sales attributable to the project are
considered to represent the minimum economic benefit.
They were estimated on the basis of the indicated tariffs
through the project's life, as the increase in sales until
1978 when generation will have to be added again on the
interconnected system. For the period after 1978 the
concept of supplying a partial block of the total load by the
generation of the project was used. Even though base load
generation additions after the project will tend to decrease
future energy sales attributable to the project, resulting
combined generation mix will tend to be more economical than
supplying only the future additional blocks of load with
such future base load generation.

2.        On this baBsi  the project  return is at least 16.5% plus or minus
4% if the revenues are raised or lowered 15% respectively.  The cost and
benefit streams are shown below.
3.        Additional benefits accruing from the frequency conversion portion
of the project are difficult to quantify due to incomplete surveys of frequency
sensitive equipment in the interconnected system. Substantial savings are
expected, however, to the Guyanese econoEy from eliminating the need for
future dual frequency rated equipment and inherently lower cost of 60 Hz
equipment.
