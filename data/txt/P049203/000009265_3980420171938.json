structural reforms necessary to lay the\n            foundation for renewed economic growth and to maintain\n            macroeconomic stabilization over the medium term; and to\n            finance an adequate level of pubic services during the\n            fiscal transition from a centrally planned economy to a\n            market-oriented economy. Provided that the government\n            demonstrated its commitment to accelerate the pace of\n            structural reform, the Bank will provide an accelerated\n            program of policy advice, fast-disbursing adjustment\n            lending, and project financing in support of high priority\n            public and private sector investments over the next two\n            years. This lending will include the present structural\n            adjustment loan, which is closely coordinated with the\n            IMF's Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program, to address\n            key reforms in private sector development, specifically,\n            banking sector and natural monopoly reform, as well as\n            fiscal issues relating to the sustainability of the\n            financial stabilization program of tax reforms, budget\n            management, and intergovernmental fiscal relations. The SAL\n            provides a crucial vehicle for intensive technical support\n            to the government both in the detailed design and in the\n            implementation of measures under the program. The lack of\n            such support in 1996 was an important reason for pervasive\n            implementation problems on the structural side of the EFF."}, "docdt": "1997-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
