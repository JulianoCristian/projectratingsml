               Amendment to Section 4.06 of the Loan Agreement
Dear Mr. Azar:
     Please refer to the Loan Agreement dated February 10, 1988,
between the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
and Jordan Phosphate Mines Co., Ltd.  (the "Loan Agreement").
Pursuant to your letter dated November 12, 1989, we hereby agree to
amend Section 4.06 of the Loan Agreement as follows to facilitate
progressive reduction of spare parts inventory:
     "Section 4.06.  Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, the
     Borrower shall provide to the Bank:  (i) by August 31, 1990,
     a statement concerning the status and value of all fast and
     slow moving spare parts; (ii) by December 31, 1990, a
     statement confirming disposal of obsolete spare parts
     identified as such in the letter dated January 9, 1990, from
     the Borrower to the Bank; and (iii) by December 31, 1990, a
     statement outlining procurement procedures adopted to ensure
     that the level of inventory of spare parts will be maintained
     at levels satisfactory to the Bank, consistent with the safe
     and secure operation of mines and the fertilizer plant."
     Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment to
the Loan Agreement by signing and dating the form of confirmation on
the enclosed copy of this letter and returning the same to us.
                          Very truly yours,
