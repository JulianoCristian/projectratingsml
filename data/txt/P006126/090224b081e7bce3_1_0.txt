agreed between the Borrower and the Bank and shall be
made only to the extent that the Bank shall be satisfied
by the evidence furnished in support of the applications
for such withdrawal that all payments by the Borrower
out of the Special Account were made on account of the
reasonable cost of local goods or services required for
Part A of the Project and to be financed out of the
proceeds of the Loan in accordance with this Agree-
ment;".
