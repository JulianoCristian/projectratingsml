MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA FOR AN
AGRICULTURAL DIVERSIFICATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Ghana for SDR 12.5 million is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be for 40 years on
standard terms to help finance an agricultural diversification project.
2.        Background.  Agricultural diversification is important to
reducing Ghana's vulnerability due to excessive dependence on cocoa and
gold for export earnings and revenue. At the Consultative Group Meeting
for Ghana in early 1989 the Government of Ghana emphasized its policy to
diversify agricultural production and exports. This strategy is designed
to exploit areas of comparative advantage for greater efficiency of
resource use and for the enhancement and stabilization of smallholder
incomes which are priority objectives endorsed by IDA. Changes in trade
policy and exchange rate reform have had a positive impact on tree crop and
pineapple exports and import substitutes. Ghana has a comparative
advantage in the production of cocoa, coffee, rubber and pineapples for
export and for palm oil for domestic consumption. However, exploitation of
this comparative advantage requires policy and pricing reforms, and
investments in improved infrastructure, additional plantings and expanded
related support services. Natural conditions are favorable for oil palm
and robusta coffee; and excellent for cocoa, rubber and pineapples.
However, a prolonged period of disincentives coupled with public sector
dominance in production activities, and poor management, have led to low
efficiency in cultivation and processing.
3.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA supports the objectives of
the Government of Ghana to diversify agricultural production on the basis
of comparative advantage. An important approach within this strategy is to
promote private sector development and supply response. Given the
supportive framework of the Ghanaian Economic Recovery Program and the
progressive liberalization that has taken place, both tree crop and
horticultural (as reflected by pineapples) development is timely. IDA
involvement would facilitate investments in response to market-based
producer incentives; strengthen technical expertise and managerial skills;
and promote greater private sector involvement in the oil palm, coffee,
rubber and horticultural subsectors.
4.        Project Objectives.  The major objective of the project would be
to revitalize and expand the cultivation of non-cocoa tree crops and
horticultural crops, which can be efficiently and competitively cultivated
in Ghana for export and import substitution, within the framework of an
agricultural diversification strategy aimed at diminishing the importance
of cocoa in the agricultural sector and, therefore, the economy. The
project would expand the area of high-yielding private smallholder oil palm
farms and increase the number of improved technology artisanal small-scale
privately owned mills. In coffee, the goal would be to rehabilitate
existing private smallholdings and replace small private coffee farms



destroyed during the bush fires of 1983. This would sustain exports at
pre-1980 levels through higher yields, and in so doing provide a buffer
against future low export prices. High-yielding small-scale outgrower
farming of rubber would be introduced to initiate a longer term response in
improved private smallholder cultivation largely aimed at export. In
horticulture, the project aims to increase production and exports by
improving technical support and marketing and export facilities for
pineapples in particular, but generically relevant to most horticultural
exports. To complement and support these objectives, the project would
strengthen government technical expertise and promote competent private
sector management.
5.        Project Description:  The main components are:  (i) Public
sector investments in agricultural extension, export promotion, research,
and physical infrastructure to support private tree crop smallholder
development, private horticulture production and export, and private
milling; (ii) Private sector investments in oil palm, coffee, rubber ard
pineapple cultivation and palm oil milling; and (iii) Support activities
for public and private institutions involved. The oil palm program would
involve planting of 3,500 ha of outgrower smallholdings with extension and
input supplies provided by an existing oil palm nucleus estate and
establishment of 60 intermediate technology small-scale palm oil mills.
Coffee extension and improved planting stock supply activities would lead
to planting/replanting of 3,000 ha and rehabilitation of 1,500 ha of
robusta coffee. The rubber program would lead to the planting of 1,200 ha
by outgrower smallholders serviced for extension and input supplies by an
existing large rubber estate. Improved technology, infrastructure and
export marketing assistance would increase pineapple exports threefold by
1995. The research and technology improvement components would support the
Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana (CRIG) for coffee research, and Crop
Services Department (CSD) of MOA for pineapple and rubber technology.
Support activities would strengthen technical expertise, managerial
competence and supervisory capacity in the public sector in the following
institutions: GOPDC, GREL, COCOBOD, MOA, GEPC and ADB; and in the private
sector provide access to export marketing expertise. The economic returns
for oil palm and rubber outgrowers, coffee smallholders, pineapple
exporters and palm oil millers range from 18 to 104 percent with the
cverall project ERR at 23 percent.
6.        The total project cost is estimated at US$22.4 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange, component of US$13.5 million (60
percent). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, as well
as the disbursement schedule are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Ghana
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map of Ghana is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 8133-GH, dated September 5, 1990,
is being distributed separately.
7.        Agreed Actions:  Key actions are: (i) GOPDC and GREL would avoid
the use of toxic chemicals, follow sound environmental practices, and pay
particular attention to erosion control as essential elements of technical
packages provided to outgrowers; (ii) GOPDC would purchase oil palm fruit



- 3 -
at prices reflecting supply and demand; (iii) COCOBOD would institute by
June 30, 1991 a coffee producer pricing mechanism of not less than 65
percent of the FOB price; (iv) COCOBOD would not involve itself in input
distribution in areas where registered private dealers already operate; (v)
COCOBOD would encourage and permit the hulling and export of coffee by
private entrepreneurs; (vi) that the rubber outgrower project
implementation plan would be agreed to with IDA; and (vii) GREL would sell
its rubber in the domestic and international markets on the basis of
prevailing market prices. Additionally, conditions of disbursement would
include: signing of Subsidiary Loan Agreement by GOPDC and GREL with
Government of Ghana (GOG) on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA for
managing their outgrower programs.
8.        Justification and Risks.  The policy reforms and components
specifically designed to restore efficiency in the long neglected tree
crops subsector and the creation of an enabling environment for the
development of horticulture crops are the principal justification of the
proposed project. In addition, the project would increase the supply of
palm oil, a basic consumption item, by 10 percent; coffee threefold; rubber
by 80 percent; and pineapples threefold. For these Ghana has a comparative
advantage and this would enhance export earnings.  The main risks
associated with the project are: (i) possible slowing down or reversal of
the economic and trade lil'eralization, and privatization, that would
inevitably result in a deterioration of the incentive framework; (ii) an
unstable political climate; (iii) failure of delivery systems to provide
access by smallholders to the recommended planting material, credit, inputs
and extension, reducing the uptake of improved technical packages, and
therefore, also productivity and incomes; and (iv) delayed improvement and
development of basic infrastructure and marketing outlets preventing
smallholders selling, processing, and marketing their output. While the
risks of deterioration in macro economic management and political
instability are real, and may be unavoidable, the risks stated above can be
mitigated through the proposed project as well as through other upcoming
projects. The latter include the Rural Finance Projcct, the .iational
Agricultural Research Project, the National Agricultural Extension Project,
and the Feeder Roads Project. Privatization of fertilizer supply and
distribution under the ongoing Agricultural Se.vices Rehabilitation Project
would further minimize project risks. All of these project initiatives
with their emphasis on market determined producer prices, strengthening of
rural credit institutions, improved extension, support for agricultural
research, construction and resurfacing of feeder roads, and improved
processing facilities would, in one way or another, contribute to reduced
project risks. The risks would be further minimized through the use of
existing nucleus estates for the transfer of technology critical to tree
and horticulture crop development.

9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
