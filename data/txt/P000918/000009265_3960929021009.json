horticultural crops, which can be efficiently and\n            competitively cultivated in Ghana for export and import\n            substitution.  The main components are: (a) public sector\n            investments in agricultural extension, export promotion,\n            research, and physical infrastructure to support private\n            tree crop smallholder development, private horticulture\n            production and export, and private milling; (b) private\n            sector investments in oil palm, coffee, rubber and pineapple\n            cultivation and palm oil milling; and (c) support activities\n            for public and private institutions involved.  The oil palm\n            program involves planting and establishment of intermediate\n            technology small-scale palm oil mills; coffee extension and\n            improved planting stock supply activities will lead to\n            planting/replanting and rehabilitation of robusta coffee;\n            and the rubber program will lead to the planting of 1,200 ha\n            by outgrower smallholders.  Improved technology,\n            infrastructure and export marketing assistance will increase\n            pineapple exports and the research and technology\n            improvement components will support coffee research, and\n            pineapple and rubber technology.  Support activities will\n            strengthen technical expertise, managerial competence and\n            supervisory capacity in the public sector and provide access\n            to export marketing expertise in the private sector."}, "docdt": "1990-09-05T00:00:00Z"}
