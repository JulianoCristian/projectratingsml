AREAS", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Project ratings are as follows: Project\n            outcome is satisfactory; sustainability is likely;\n            institutional development impact is substantial; Bank\n            performance is satisfactory; and Borrower performance is\n            satisfactory. Among the several lessons the project offered\n            were these: 1) Due to various internal and external\n            pressures, there is a common tendency to define overly\n            ambitious project development objectives, relative to the\n            project's starting point, time frame, and available\n            resources. This problem is compounded if the indicators for\n            measuring whether the objective has been achieved are\n            broadly defined or difficult to measure. 2) Strong\n            leadership and continuity in managing the implementing\n            agency and project unit are critical ingredients for a\n            project's success. 3) Assume that there will be changes\n            in the key persons leading the Bank and government teams\n            during project implementation due to a variety of factors,\n            including political changes. Given that, it is important to\n            build into the process means to make these transitions\n            smooth and reasonably short. In this regard, written\n            documentation is key including: translated versions of key\n            project documents, preparation of a Project Implementation\n            Plan, Annual Operating Plans and analysis of achievements\n            under each plan, and aide memoires recording the findings of\n            supervision missions. 4) When the Bank decides to change\n            procedures and policies which affect clients, it needs to be\n            aware of and minimize the cost for the Borrower. In this\n            case was the Bank's required that all new projects\n            adopt the Loan Administration Change Initiative (LACI)\n            system of disbursements, which led to considerable time and\n            expense to design such a system during the project's\n            start-up phase. Less costly, though frustrating for the\n            implementing agency, were the reorganization of the\n            procurement function in the Latin America and Caribbean\n            Region, and the conversion of GEF grants from SDRs\n            (IMF-created money based on several national currencies,\n            called Special Drawing Rights) into U.S. dollars. 5) Given\n            the fact that in many regions indigenous people occupy some\n            of the best lands for biodiversity conservation, it is\n            critical to ensure that they are full participants in\n            determining how that biodiversity is best conserved. 6)\n            Community subprojects can help generate community support\n            for biodiversity conservation. They can also transform the\n            image of a protected areas agency from one focused on\n            punitive actions to one that supports communities in looking\n            for more sustainable alternatives."}, "docdt": "2005-01-23T00:00:00Z"}
