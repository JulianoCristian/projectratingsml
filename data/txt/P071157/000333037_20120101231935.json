The\n            success and sustainability of land reforms require a longer\n            term perspective and support from development partners and\n            other social actors to help the government overcome social\n            and political inertia. Since the restructuring of the LAP\n            and launching of LAP2, a longer-term perspective has been\n            the key guide to planning and implementation. Donor\n            commitment to long-term programs of land management and\n            administration is essential to their success.
