1.     Status of Project Implementation
3.      Project performance during the first two years of implementation was poor due
mostly to weak implementation capacities and the failure of project implementing
agencies to coordinate, facilitate and execute project activities, develop terms of
reference and bid documents, and supervise and monitor procurements. These resulted in
procurement delays and slow disbursements, affecting overall progress in the
implementation of activities under the project. The restructuring, in 2008, addressed these
problems and implementation has improved. The major accomplishments of the project
since inception of implementation in 2004 are: (i) the passage of the Lands Commission
Act 767 (2008) by Parliament on October 29, 2008. The Act seeks to merge four land
sector agencies into a single entity ­ The Lands Commission (LC); (ii) decentralization of
deeds registry to all the nine regional capitals, effectively bringing the registration of
deeds closer to the clients and reduction of the turnaround time for registering deeds from
36 months to 2,5 months, as of May 13, 2010; (iii) the establishment of Customary Lands
Secretariat (CLS) in 38 traditional authority jurisdictions ­ exceeding the 30 CLS target
of the project; (iv) reduction of backlog of land cases in Accra courts and the automation
of five land courts in Accra; and (iv) the completion of inventory for state acquired lands
in 29 districts. Also completed is the first phase of Geodetic Reference Network (GRN)
covering the golden triangle of Accra, Kumasi and Takoradi.
4.    Out of a total approved Credit of SDR 15.1 million, the project has disbursed
SDR 13.2 million (88percent) as of December 23, 2010. The balance of SDR 1.9 million
is committed to completing the remaining activities.
5.      The project has performed satisfactorily as regards compliance to financial
covenants through the regular and timely submission of financial reports and annual
audits. The 2009 audited reports were received on August 3, 2010 and the auditors issued
an unqualified opinion.
2.     Justification for Reallocation of Credit Proceeds and Extension of the
Closing Date
6.       Reallocation of proceeds is necessary in view of the fact that certain critical
activities must be completed before the project closes. Yet the budget categories from
which funds will be obtained have been overdrawn while other categories have excess
funds. The allocation of uncommitted funds, as of March 31st , 2010, showed that the
budget for training and workshops as well as goods had been overdrawn and funds
available for operating expenses were inadequate while there were more than enough
funds for consultancies. This was largely due to modifications in the planned project
activities after the initial restructuring which impacted significantly on operational
expenses. For example, it became evident that the legal reforms required a much longer
period and wider stakeholder consultations with tenant farmers, traditional authorities, the
judiciary, land owners and land sector agencies and this required additional resources for

                                             3
training, workshops and operational expenditures. Furthermore, the project experienced a
turnover of two Procurement Specialists, which resulted in significant delays in the
procurement process. Consequently, a number of project activities which should have
been completed before December 2010 were started late and therefore require additional
time for completion.
7.     The extension of the closing date would allow the completion of the following
outstanding key activities:
   ·   The passage of the new Lands Bill. A draft Bill has been prepared and it is
       expected that the Bill will be presented to the parliament in January 2011.
   ·   Following the passage of the new Lands Commission Act 2008 (Act 767), the
       following key activities related to the institutional reforms under the project will
       have to be completed: (i) support to all institutions including Lands Commission
       (LC), Town and Country Planning Department (TCPD), Office of the
       Administration of Stool Lands (OASL), including Customary Lands Secretariats
       (CLSs) to prepare the five year Business and Strategies rolling plans, with
       financial cost, budgets and financial projections; (ii) the strengthening of the
       institutional arrangements, in terms of their leadership, operational management
       and supporting communication; and (iii) the building of the management
       competencies and the completion of institutional reform in LC and its Secretariat,
       TCPD, OASL and its links and status of CLSs and all their regional structures.
   ·   Complete the key pilots in the areas of eight (8) systematic land Tilting exercises,
       and seven (7) customary boundary demarcations across the country. Whilst the
       consultancy services for these activities are borne by Kreditanstalt Fur
       Wiederaufbau (KFW) support to the project, the public and stakeholder
       sensitization, consultation, validation workshops as well as operating expenses
       with regard to field inspections are to be paid out of IDA funds.
8.      A second phase of the project is under preparation and is likely to be presented to
the Board during the third quarter of FY11 and it is likely to be become effective in the
fourth quarter of FY11. The extension of the closing date will also facilitate a smooth
transition between Phase 1 and 2.
