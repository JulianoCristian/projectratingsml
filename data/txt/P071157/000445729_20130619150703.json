Independent\n            Evaluation Group (IEG) derives five lessons from the project\n            that are of broad relevance to other operations of this\n            nature: (i) attempts to 'harmonize' customary and\n            statutory land tenure institutions will not be successful if\n            the conflicts of interest over rent allocation are not\n            addressed, and if priority is not given to distributing\n            rents in accordance with the public good;(ii) land tenure\n            reform calls for a long term commitment by the government\n            and its development partners; this commitment may be\n            facilitated by a programmatic lending instrument but the\n            commitment must precede the choice of instrument the\n            instrument by itself will not create the necessary\n            commitment; (iii) the bank's annual doing business\n            survey may give a misleading impression about trends in the\n            efficiency of property registration services; (iv)although\n            the bank's good practice guidelines indicate that the\n            efficiency of land administration services tends to be\n            higher when they are handled by a single agency, in\n            practice, consolidating land agencies does not in itself\n            ensure that their efficiency will improve; and (v) projects\n            with multiple co-financiers are risky: if each insists on\n            imposing its own procurement and disbursement procedures\n            implementation may be delayed; and the strategic priorities\n            of the partners may diverge in the course of project\n            implementation, undermining support for achieving the\n            project outcomes that were originally agreed to."}, "docdt": "2013-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
