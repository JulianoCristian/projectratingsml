 Land Policy:
 Securing Rights to Reduce Poverty and Promote Rural Growth




 SYNOPSIS
  Modern, efficient and transparent land administration systems are important in reducing poverty, and
  promoting growth and sustainable development. Security of property rights is central to preserving live-
  lihoods, maintaining social stability, and increasing incentives for investment and for sustainable,
  productive land use. Making land rights transferable allows the landless to access land through sales
  and rental markets or through public transfers, and further increases investment incentives. Since the late
  1960s, the World Bank has provided financing, technical help and training to strengthen national land
  administration laws, policies and investment programs.
