Reallocation is necessary to view the fact\n            that certain critical activities must be completed before\n            the project closes. The allocation of uncommitted funds, as\n            of March 31st , 2010, showed that the budget for training\n            and workshops as well as goods had been overdrawn and funds\n            available for operating expenses were inadequate while there\n            were more than enough funds for consultancies. This was\n            largely due to modifications in the planned project\n            activities after the initial restructuring which impacted\n            significantly on operational expenses. The closing date of\n            the project will be extended from December 31, 2010 until\n            June 30, 2011. The extension of the closing date will also\n            facilitate a smooth transition between phase one and two."}, "docdt": "2010-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
