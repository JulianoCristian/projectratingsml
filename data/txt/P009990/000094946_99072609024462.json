In terms of timely implementation of\n            components, the project did not give a satisfactory\n            performance. If delays and cancellations are ignored, the\n            project outcomes for the State components covering 85\n            percent of project costs are satisfactory. In summary,\n            sectoral policy objectives were generally achieved;\n            institutional development objectives were only partially\n            achieved; physical objectives were generally achieved in the\n            States schemes but only partially in the central schemes;\n            and the poverty reduction objective and gender concerns have\n            been adequately achieved. Key lessons learned include:\n            Project appraisal should take a closer look at institutional\n            capacity relative to project complexity and identify\n            institutional and systemic weaknesses that delay project\n            implementation. The Expenditure Finance Committee (EFC) memo\n            should discourage the labor ministry from being selective in\n            component approval, provide some flexibility during\n            implementation, take into account normal price escalations\n            and currency fluctuations, and prefer the use of SDRs. The\n            project should be more decentralized and flexible in\n            selecting trades, procuring equipment, and developing\n            curriculum. Participatory approaches could improve project\n            ownership and outcomes. Frequent changes in senior\n            implementation staff should be avoided and technical\n            assistance provided. Land acquisition and architectural\n            design of buildings should start before negotiations."}, "docdt": "1999-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
