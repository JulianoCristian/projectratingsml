Rural Development\n            Project aims at improving the productivity, income and\n            general living conditions of 10,000 poor rural families\n            (about 65,000 persons) living in the western foothills of\n            Ecuador's Andes. Project components include: (i)\n            extension, credit and other agricultural support services;\n            (ii) regularization of land tenure; (iii) construction and\n            improvement of rural roads; and (iv) provision of potable\n            water, primary health care services and school facilities.\n            The main risk which this project faces is an institutional\n            one. Ecuador's agricultural public sector has\n            traditionally been weak and uncoordinated, resulting in\n            frequent delays in project execution. Close supervision and\n            technical assistance have been included in the proposed\n            project to help compensate such risks. Additionally, the\n            Government has established a Secretariat for Integrated\n            Rural Development in order to provide the coordination that\n            is needed for this type of multi-sector project. This new\n            agency is expected to facilitate this project's execution."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
