objectives\n            are to improve the utilization of human and financial\n            resources and strengthen institutions, particularly at the\n            municipal level, to increase the delivery of affordable and\n            efficient urban services.  Within these overall program\n            objectives, the Municipal Strengthening Project will  (a)\n            strengthen federal and state agencies in the area of\n            municipal development through provision of financial\n            resources and effective training programs; (b) strengthen\n            the municipalities' organizational, administrative and\n            financial management systems and performance; and (c) assist\n            municipalities in expanding and upgrading urban\n            infrastructure.  The project objectives would be achieved\n            through the implementation of several components. They\n            include:  (i) Municipal Staff Development and Organizational\n            Strengthening; (ii) Federal and State Staff Development and\n            Organizational Strengthening; (iii) Infrastructure and\n            Related Investment Fund for Municipal Development; and (iv)\n            Project Administration."}, "docdt": "1986-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
