1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)


1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

Sector Background
Mexico is among the top four mega-diversity countries in the world, with an estimated 10 - 14%
of the planet's biodiversity. Its forest surface extends over approximately 57 million hectares,
where 13.0 million people live, out of which 5 million are indigenous peoples of 43 different
ethnic groups and represent 55% of extreme poverty of the country.

At the time of the appraisal, the terrestrial biodiversity in Mexico was being compromised due to
rampant deforestation and land degradation resulted from population growth, expansion of the
agricultural frontier, over-exploitation, poorly regulated tourism, accelerated economic
development, and arbitrary settlement policies. Up until 1986, the incentives for sustainable forest
and natural resource conservation were perverse. Commercial wood extraction relied upon a
system of industrial concessions or inefficient parastatals that had no incentives for long-term
sustainability and were not responsive to the needs or interests of indigenous communities or
ejidos ­ the legal owners of much of the country's forest lands as a result of land reform. At the
same time, agricultural policies fostered clearing of forests for subsistence and commercial
agriculture or cattle-rearing and private land tenure was linked to forest clearing. Large-scale
cultivation of illegal drugs began to proliferate in remote forested areas in the 1960s as a response
to acute poverty, and continues to create social conflict and local violence in some areas.

In the early 1990s, a series of policy changes in the agricultural sector introduced reforms to land
administration system to strengthen land markets, while preserving ejido and indigenous
community tenure. As part of this reform process, a new Forestry Law was passed in 1986 and
revised in 1992, providing the legal framework for indigenous community and ejido management
of forests in their boundaries, based on a Forest Management Plan which requires government
approval. Although this provided a positive framework for community forestry management,
little additional support was provided by government in the form of TA, links to stable markets,
or other positive incentives to facilitate change in this direction, apart from a few soft loans for
industrialization of the forest communities and ejidos. There were however, small-scale NGO-
supported initiatives in promising regions were carried out, particularly in Oaxaca.

Government's Actions. Under the guidance of the Convention on Biological Diversity, (ratified
on March 11, 1993) Mexico developed a National Strategy for Biodiversity (NSB) with
participation from academia, the private sector and other relevant stakeholders. The NSB
indentified four priority areas for action: (i) protection of biodiversity rich ecosystems; (ii)
sustainable use of Mexico's biological resources; (iii) expansion of the country's knowledge base
related to its biodiversity; and (iv) promotion of green market/valuation of biological resources.
Rainforest, dry forest and marine and coastal ecosystems are among the particular ecosystems
identified as priorities for federal protection status and for a major mainstreaming of biodiversity
considerations in economic and public investment programs. The NSB also recognizes the
importance of indigenous and community conservation practices that have long prevailed,
especially in rural/mountainous regions in South-Central Mexico, and supports development of
innovative programs to strengthen such approaches to natural resource management.




                                                    1

SEMARNAP's own programs have been reoriented to be consistent with this framework, and is
working with other federal and state entities to mainstream this approach in related sectoral
programs. GoM and CONABIO are now developing a more detailed Action Plan for
Conservation, Use and Equitable Distribution of Benefits from Biodiversity. SEMARNAP has
also initiated a range of programs for biodiversity conservation and sustainable natural resource
management with the aim of balancing environmental values with societal interests and needs. In
particular, SEMARNAP has promoted a set of programs to foster sustainable land use, as a
complement to the strategy to develop a national system of protected areas (SINAP). In keeping
with the country's strategic shift towards increased decentralization of environmental
management to states and municipalities and the objective of increased public participation,
SEMARNAP's programs emphasize local responsibility and participation.

At the time of the appraisal, GOM had several forestry programs, including: (i) an integrated
model of sustainable development with a regional focus (PRODERs); (ii) a sustainable forestry
management sinking trust fund for private producers, ejidos and indigenous communities
(PRODEFOR) in those states willing to provide counterpart financing; (iii) a pilot forestry
management project to text community forestry mechanisms (PROCYMAF); (iv) a restructured
reforestation program (PRONARE); and (v) on-going policy work on international environmental
issues and the global commons, including environmentally friendly markets. At the appraisal,
there was no government-supported program for community-based conservation areas and
sustainable use of biodiversity.

Bank's Involvement. The Bank-assisted Community Forestry Project (PROCYMAF), initiated
in 1998, is piloting a positive model for channeling technical assistance to interested communities
in Oaxaca to defray the cost of forest management plans and complementary studies while
improving the quality of private technical services available to the 248 forest communities and
ejidos in the state of Oaxaca.

In addition, the GOM has recognized the importance of expanding forestry development support
to include assistance to communities for conservation efforts. Under this new expanded forestry
strategy, the GoM wishes to develop and implement a program to conserve biodiverse community
and ejido lands, while supporting financially sound complementary activities of sustainable use.
This model would provide a more decentralized, grass-roots led conservation program,
responding to unmet needs at the community level. The GOM proposes to test this new program
in the states of Oaxaca, Michoacan and Guerrero; if successful, it would be expanded to other
forest-rich states.

The project would address the lack of support for community-driven conservation initiatives and
the need to build capacity at the local level. The project would support the creation of
conservation areas based on voluntary choices by communities in areas of known high
biodiversity, developing a mechanism for more systematically recognizing these customary law
commitments at the national level to foster legitimacy and permanence. By financing investments
and capacity-building complementary to the studies and training financed by PROCYMAF and
the PRODEFOR sinking fund, the proposed new project would link communal conservation areas
to sustainable use activities in adjacent forest and agroforestry lands, and link conservation
actions across individual communities.

Communal areas provide an ideal focus for conservation efforts in Mexico, because of clear land
and resource property rights derived from colonial degree and/or later land reform legislation. In
the case of indigenous communities, two national constitutional articles (Nos. 4 and 27), and a
state degree, in the case of Oaxaca, legitimate the right to establish land as individual parcel or as



                                                   2

areas of restricted use, recorded as customary laws (such as community by-laws, community
statutes) at the community level to establish long-term, legally binding community conservation
areas, registered formally in the National Property Registry. Where large expanses of land with
high biodiversity value exist under indigenous community or ejido ownership, there is a
comparative advantage to seek a model of biodiversity conservation that is voluntary and on
private (communal) land.

The joint IBRD/IFC Mexico Country Assistance Strategy was discussed by the Board of
Directors in May 1999. The CAS is structured along three main, interrelated themes: (i) social
sustainability; (ii) macro-economic stability and sustainable growth; and (iii) effective public
governance.

The project would simultaneously promote the various strategies in the CAS. The CAS strategy
of working within the scope of and reinforcing local and indigenous cultures in Mexico was one
of the main objectives of this project, as it would seek to reinforce indigenous community and
ejido structures to promote the creation and maintenance of community protected areas.
Environmentally, the project reflected the CAS strategy in working to enhance biodiversity
conservation and strengthen institutional frameworks.

Global Operational Strategy
Mexico ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity on March 11, 1993. The proposed project
is consistent with the GEF Operational Strategy, supporting long-term protection of globally
important ecosystems. Oaxaca, Guerrero and Michoacán are the repositories of significant global
biological diversity with high endemism. The project supports Operational Programs 4 (Montane
Ecosystems) and 3 (Forest Ecosystems), and would target three GEF priorities: in situ
conservation of globally unique biodiversity; sustainable use of biodiversity; and local
participation in the benefits of conservation activities. The project was fully consistent with
Mexico's first report to COP IV as with the principles of the CBD by supporting all three levels
of biodiversity (ecosystems, species, and genes) and supports COP Decisions I/8, II/8, II/9, III/9,
III/10 and III/12, and SBSTAA Recommendation I/3.


1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The GEO was to achieve more effective biodiversity conservation in the states of Oaxaca,
Michoacán, and Guerrero by strengthening the capacity of indigenous and ejido communities to
manage and protect their biological and cultural resources based on traditional values and
practices.

The key indicators designed to follow project implementation and outcomes were listed in the
PAD and include: (i) 150,000 hectares under community conservation in different ecozones in the
project area, and 150,000 hectares of complementary area under sustainable use; (ii) seventy
organizationally advanced communities (Category 3 and 4) with active conservation (and
integrated resource use) on communally owned land of high biodiversity in Oaxaca, Guerrero and
Michoacán; (iii) Number of incipient communities (Category 1 and 2) with increased capacity
and willingness to engage in conservation activities; (iv) Institutional framework at state level to
channel resources to communities for their conservation initiatives and to support inter-
community networking and collaboration on shared conservation goals; and (v) Positive market
for sustainable use products generated and income increased in communities in high biodiversity
areas without environmental loss.

1.3 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The GEO remained pertinent and did not change throughout project execution. Indicators were
unchanged.


1.4 Main Beneficiaries
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD and as
captured in the GEO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected to benefit from
the project)

The primary target group of COINBIO was the indigenous communities1 and ejidos in
biodiversity rich states of Oaxaca, Michoacán, and Guerrero. Beneficiaries included indigenous
and ejido communities with collective use of land under forestry livestock husbandry, organic
coffee production, and tourism among other activities. The municipal government and state and
national agencies were also expected to benefit from strengthening of organizational capacities as
well as the improvement in their relationships with these communities to achieve other goals.

Local and National benefits envisaged included: (i) enhanced maintenance of natural resources
(ii) preservation of cultural heritage and traditional knowledge (iii) access to resources to
capitalize on environmentally sound practices to generate income. The global scale benefits
foreseen included long-term preservation of critical ecosystems through development of
incentives, capacities, and generation of new knowledge for sustainable management and
community conservation.


1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The project had four components.

Component 1. Local Capacity Building (US 1.70 million; 22.7 % of total project cost). This
component would finance the costs of the three state committees and the state coordinating units,
which would be the decision-making and oversight bodies respectively for activities at state level.
Activities to be financed would include coordinating unit consultant fees, funds for technical
assistance to communities and ejidos, training of the coordinating unit in financial and technical
monitoring, operational expenses, and costs of consultation and regional meetings.

During the first few years, these coordinating units would be legally constituted and, over time,
procurement responsibilities transferred completely to them during the course of project
implementation. Over the long run, these committees might evolve as independent entities,
serving the needs of those communities that are not sufficiently advanced to cover their own
conservation investment needs or directly seek resources from external sources. The coordination
units would transfer knowledge and experience during project implementation both to
participating communities and to state committees on fundraising, investment practices and grant
management.

  Indigenous groups identified in the project areas included: Zapoteco, Chontales, Mixes, Mazatecos, Chinantecos,
Chatinos in Oaxaca; Mazahuas, Purepechas, Nahuas in Michoacan; and Tlapaneco, Amuzco, Nahuatl, and Mixteco in
Guerrero.




                                                           4

Component 2. Community Conservation and Sustainable Use Sub-projects (US 4.58 million;
61.0 % of total project cost). This component would channel grant resources to communities to
finance a progressive series of community conservation and sustainable use subprojects tailored
to the level of organization and willingness of participating communities to undertake long-term
conservation. Incipient communities, defined as those with limited organizational skills and
insufficient experience with conservation investments (Category 1), were eligible for grants to
help finance land use planning, community conservation action plans, diagnostic studies, resource
inventories, and training events that build their capacity for conservation. The more advanced and
experienced communities (Category 2, 3, 4) were eligible for grants to help finance activities that
assisted them to actively manage and protect areas designated for conservation, including area
management and activities that promoted sustainable use in adjacent resource areas to generate
income while reducing pressure on conservation areas.

As a member of the state committees and in its role as enforcer of the 1992 Forest Law,
SEMARNAP was to ensure that environmental standards were applied to proposals under review.
Grants would be given directly to communities. In some cases, communities would provide their
own labor and technical assistance; in others, the community would contract private service
providers or purchase small goods and services. Four types of activities (Types A-D) were
eligible for grant allocation, each with a different community counterpart requirement, and each
with progressively larger grant sizes:

Type A: Land Use Planning for the Establishment of Biodiversity Conservation Areas (Total $4.8
million; GEF $1.7 million)
Type A activities include workshops, participatory rural appraisals, land use planning, mapping,
inventories of existing biodiversity resources, and delimitation of conservation areas, including
preparation of by-laws or communal statutes (where appropriate) for the creation of permanent
conservation areas.

Type B: Training and Capacity-Building, including Horizontal Exchanges (Total $1.7 million;
GEF: 0.6 million)
This component would finance two types of activities: (i). capacity-building for conservation
activities, including training for communities provided by third parties and by more advanced
communities to less advanced ones, and (ii) carrying out feasibility studies as under Type C
activities.

Type C: Community Investments for Conservation Areas and Sustainable Use (Total $4.6
million; GEF: $1.65 million)
This component would finance investment in conservation areas or in complementary sustainable
uses of biodiversity, including investments to protect or improve the administration of
conservation areas, as well as investments (and feasibility studies) that generate sustainable
alternatives for communities. The potential scope of activities included forest certification
studies, market studies, seed capital for eco-tourism projects, and non-timber forest product
enterprises. Investments for protection could include infrastructure and management of
conservation areas.

Type D: Community Green Venture Funds (Total: $1.8 million; GEF: $0.63 million)
Communities that had developed the capacity to invest in more substantial projects of sustainable
use and which have a longer-term commitment to conservation of their permanent areas were to
be eligible for a fourth type of grant investment, which would be a payment into a revolving fund
established at the community level as a separate conservation account (see Annex 15 PAD).

Component 3. Biological Monitoring and Evaluation (US 0.42 million; 5.6 % of total project
cost). Project implementation monitoring would be carried out throughout the project
implementation period to follow both physical execution as well as biodiversity changes over
time. An important aspect of this component would be generating the needed information to
assess the viability of the biodiversity conservation areas being established. Participatory
evaluation studies would be designed and carried out to document social organizational processes
and issues. An important part of the M&E system would be the Integrated Information System
(SII), an interactive and dynamic geo-referenced data base. Evaluation activities would include an
initial review at the end of the second year and a mid-term review at the end of the fourth year,
which would be carried out to assess project experience and make adjustments as needed in
project design. All biodiversity monitoring data generated through this project will be forwarded
into the Clearing House Mechanism (CHM) that the GOM is developing to provide decentralized
access to biodiversity conservation information.

The evaluation activities would include an initial revision at the end of second year of the
implementation, another revision at the mid-term, at the end of fourth year, which will be
conducted to analyze the experiences generated on behalf of the project and implement the
necessary adjustments to the system design.

Component 4. National Coordination (US 0.8 million; 10.7 % of total project cost). This
component would finance the costs of the national coordination unit, the national oversight
committee, the supervision and monitoring activities, establishment of the legal and conceptual
framework for community conservation as a valid protected areas model, and reporting to the
Government and the Bank. Evaluation and dissemination activities would include documenting
project lessons and sharing these findings with other community and indigenous groups in
Mexico and the Latin American region, to facilitate cross-fertilization of experiences with

1.6 Revised Components
Not applicable - no revisions to components


1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding allocations)


Amendment: The Grant Agreement was amended in August 2006 to revise the implementation
arrangements for the Project, reallocate funds among categories (including increasing their
respective disbursement perecentage in accordance with country financing parameters). Specific
modifications included:

    ·    M&E component ­ modified to focus on participatory and local monitoring of natural
         resource and biodiversity impacts
    ·    Eligible subprojects ­ community venture fund (Type D investment)' subprojects were
         dropped by mutual agreement
    ·    Technical assistance for the analysis, design and promotion of institutional arrangements
         included ­ to set up a financial mechanism for conservation and sustainable use activities
         and thus to ensure that project outcomes are sustained and expanded.

Institutional arrangements. From 2001 to 2002 the project implementation was decentralized and
included a National Committee and three State committees with their own coordination units (a
coordinator and administrator) while a national level Liason Officer supported the States. In
2003, the officer was replaced by a National Coordinator.

The National Committee was composed of (i) three representatives of the communities/ejidos
(one for each State Committee), (ii) one representative of SEMARNAT (iii) one representative of
CONABIO (iv) one representative of CONANP and (v) one representative of CONAF. After
2003, a representative of CONAFOR was added and in 2004 a representative of CDI, a
representative of each State government and one representative from NAFIN. These aditions
were included in the grant amendment of 2006.

At inception, the State Committees had one representative of the ejidos from each region of the
project, one State government representative, one delegate from SEMARNAT, and one
representative from conservation NGO. In 2003 a representative of CONAFOR was included and
in 2004 a state delegate of CDI was included. While each State Committee was initially supported
by an administrator, this post was terminated, due to the few administration needs. In addition,
the State Coordinator posts were converted to Technical Coordinators (see section 2.2)

Project Extensions. The project was not extended from the original date of June 30, 2008.

Reallocations. On February 1, 2008, the Bank approved a requested reallocation of the Grant's
funds and on October 27, 2008, NAFIN confirmed that USD$19,860.61 was being refunded to
the Bank. (see table below for details).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes


2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

Project Preparation3. Oaxaca, Guerrero and Michoacán have a significant concentration of
globally important biodiversity that Mexico harbors, with almost all ecosystems of the country
represented in these states. The priority areas were identified during project preparation (Block
B) through technical analyses and consultations, and according to CONABIO's national priority
setting and WWF-Mexico studies. The priority areas identified in the biological assessment
included 1,300 communities within the priority biological zones of the three states, all with
relatively equivalent biodiversity values. Participating communities were identified through a
participatory social assessment process using criteria for measuring interest and capacity for
conservation (Annex 11 PAD) and over the life of the project approximately 300 communities
and ejidos were expected to come forward to participate in project activities, either capacity-
building or investment.

Within the 1,300 communities, social assessments helped categorize a subset of communities
according to their capacity, organization, and commitment to conservation. A typology of four
categories, ranging from the least organized for conservation (Category 1) to the most organized
(Category 4) has been developed and activities tailored to these different levels of organization
(Annex 12 PAD). All of the 1,300 communities were eligible to present proposals for project
financing. Other communities not included in the social assessment, could also present proposals,
but were required to undergo a social assessment and capacity analysis first.

Lessons learned and incorporated. Based on experience from the PROCYMAF I Project, the
design was based on a strategy to provide communities with adequate information and with
financial incentives to carryout conservation activities. Information was to be disseminated and
shared among communities through the inter-community networks promoted by the project.


3The preparation was initiated under a Block A grant from the GEF for a Medium-sized Project (MSP).
However, as the concept generated through the initial preparation grant proved promising as a larger
operation, it was scaled up under a Block B and implemented as a full-size project.




                                                    8

Financial incentives were not to be based on unsustainable subsidies, but rather facilitate the
adoption of sustainable alternatives for natural resource use that maintain or enhance
conservation. Where communities have timber and non-timber forest enterprises, conservation
becomes a natural extension of their resource management. For other high biodiversity areas,
sustainable livelihoods linked to landscape management are key incentives. Therefore, activities
for encouraging community-driven conservation were included to promote sustainable activities
in areas adjacent to lands under protection. This would help to broaden economic benefits from
conservation. In a number of cases, sustainable use activities were to build on traditional
indigenous practices, which offer a host of management strategies that allow for biodiversity-
friendly land uses to complement strict conservation in neighboring forests (e.g., mesophilous
forests in Sierra Juarez in Oaxaca).

Initially, it was expected that about 150 communities would be eligible for financing ­ about 100
for land use planning and capacity-building activities and about 50 for conservation and
sustainable use investments related to community conservation areas. As local capacity would
increased, an additional 150 communities were expected to request land use planning and training
support, and conservation investments would be financed in another 70 communities and ejidos,
with about twenty of these demonstrating the capacity and interest to manage their own
conservation-related ventures over the longer-term.

Rationale for Bank and GEF Involvement. As one of the most biologically diverse of all Mexican
states, Oaxaca is recognized to be of exceptional importance for biodiversity conservation. Within
Oaxaca, the Sierra Juarez stands out as an especially high conservation priority. The World Bank-
World Wildlife Fund Conservation of the Terrestrial Ecoregions of Latin America and the
Caribbean (1995) assigns a "Highest" conservation priority rating to two of the four Sierra Juarez
ecoregions (Tehuantepec Moist Forests and Oaxacan Dry Forests) receive a "High" rating.
Among many animal and plant species endemic to the Sierra Juarez are the endangered Dwarf
Jay Cyanolyca nana, the cloud forest tree Oremunia Mexicana, and several showy butterly
species, including the threatened Papilio esperanza. The Sierra Juarez is also notable as perhaps
the largest remaining extent of mid-montane cloud forest in Mexico, with an unbroken forest
corridor extending from the high ridges (3,200m) all the way to the Gulf lowlands (200m).

The project also proposed to work with indigenous communities located in the Chinantla and
Costa regions of Oaxaca. The Chinantla region includes a diverse set of ecosystems, including
moist forest on karst limestone hills, which harbors highly localized endemic species such as the
globally threatened Sumichrast's Wren (Hylorchilus sumichasti). The Costa region encompasses
the coastal Sierra de Miahuatlan, which also supports species found nowhere else and
encompasses the Oaxacan Moist Forests ecoregion (rated "Highest" as a conservation priority).

The proposed project areas in the states of Michoacán and Guerrero are also globally significant
for biodiversity conservation. For example, in Michoacán, the Meseta Purepeche (Tancitaro) area
contains an important sample of the Mexican Transvolcanic Pine-Oak Forests ("Highest"
priority) Ecoregion. In Guerrero, the Sierra Madre del Sur (also known as Sierra de Atoyac)
encompasses a substantial portion of the ("Highest" priority) Sierra Madre del Sur Pine-Oak
Forests Ecoregion. It is also recognized as an Endemic Bird Area by Birdlife International due to
its concentration of range-restricted birds, including the Short-crested Coquette (Lophornis
brachylopha), a hummingbird found only in this mountain range.

Project Design. A major aspect of the project design was to emphasize inter-community capacity-
building. Recognizing that leader communities played an important role in fostering forest
management in the PROCYMAF project, the COINBIO project would work through the



                                                  9

communities with more experience in collective forest conservation and management, helping
them to implement biodiversity conservation on their own lands, as well as to build alliances and
transfer knowledge to other communities. About thirty-five Oaxaca communities were identified
as potential leaders for this "campesino-a-campesino" arrangement. Another premise was that
there were traditional community practices and knowledge that were already encouraging
conservation in Oaxaca, Michoacán and Guerrero, and the project would help to promote these.

Risk Assessment. The initial risk assessment included the following:

    (i)      That many communities had not incorporated by-laws for establishment of
             community natural protected areas, and therefore would not be able or willing to
             participate in the project. This however did not become an impediment to the project
             as community organization and capacity building was included as an important
             element in the project design. In some cases, community participation in
             conservation projects became a catalyst for overall community organization, as it
             helped to rally communities around an issue that was perceived as non- or less-
             divisive.
    (ii)     That the absence of existing coordination mechanisms between national and state
             governments and indigenous communities for elaborating management plans might
             prove an obstacle to implementation. To mitigate the risk, significant resources were
             dedicated (US$2.7M or 14% or project resources), establishing a platform for
             increased coordination at all levels of government and with communities. The focus
             of component 1 was primarily to achieve the establishment of these coordination
             mechanisms and state committees. At closure it was determined that though a strong
             sense of ownership and participation generated through the state committees, the
             project was carried to completion and mainstreamed into national and state
             governmental institutions. (The Inspection Panel noted the strong sense of ownership
             and support for the project by stakeholders and acknowledged that mechanisms were
             in place to resolve issues arising regarding implementation.)

Borrower Commitment. Borrower commitment evolved over the course of the project and was
considered strong by closure. Initial implementation was slow due to the change in government
administrations in 2001, and the establishment of CONAFOR that same year, resulting in an
overlap of some responsibilities with SEMARNAT relative to project management. While the
bureaucratic arrangements were being sorted out, NAFIN stepped in as both executing and
financing agency, and maintained that role throughout the project. NAFIN provided office space
and administrative support to the project implementation unit in Mexico City and maintained
routine contact with the Bank team.


2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status,
and actions taken, as applicable)


The project became effective in 2001. However, given the changes at the federal and state
governments associated with recent elections, and a relatively complex decentralized project
structure, disbursements were low through year two (see section 2.1). Time was also needed to
help make in-roads with the beneficiary communities and gain their trust. By 2003, the project
reached expected levels of implementation and disbursements, and by 2005 the disbursement lag
had been corrected. In 2008, the project closed on schedule with a near full disbursement of
funds. (US$ 19 thousand were not disbursed.)



                                                  10

Project Administration. The State Committees decided which community initiatives to support,
while the administrative, social and environmental safeguards were managed by NAFIN,
SEMARNAT, and CONAFOR.


MTR. The project Mid-Term Review (MTR) was conducted in early 2006. The MTR exercise
evaluated project progress as satisfactory except for the delay with the M&E component and
uncertainty with the Type D (green ventures) subproject investments. The beneficiary survey
indicated a high level of satisfaction with the project and confirmed the pertinence of the
activities. The MTR also verified that conservation areas formally established by communities
participating in the project increased from around 8% to 51%. Sustainably managed areas (with
certification or other formal recognition) increased by 12% during the first years of the project.


Changes. The composition of the National Committee and State Committee from each of three
participating states was modified based on changes in the institutional landscape and to improve
stakeholder representation. In 2003 and 2004, CONAFOR, State Representatives, NAFIN, and
CDI joined the Committees. These additions were reflected in the 3rd modification to the Grant
Agreement (August 18, 2006).

Expansion of geographic coverage. The project did not have any significant change in the scope
of its implementation. However, two minor expansions within the principal project area were
made to include conservation activities in Chinantla Alta and the Costa Chica of Guerrero.

Inspection Panel (IP) . In early 2004, representatives from the Oaxaca State Committee sent a
complaint to the Inspection Panel. Representatives of the Committee contended that they should
have been consulted regarding the conversion of State Coordinators to Technical Coordinators,
and therefore violated Bank policies concerning supervision and indigenous peoples. However,
the Bank's Management Response stated that the complaint actually stemmed from a labor
dispute between an individual and the government, and that the indigenous policy had not been
violated. It noted that, in fact, indigenous peoples' participation in the project was very high.

The IP eligibility review, likewise, found a high level of indigenous participation and
"widespread enthusiasm about the COINBIO Project" and concluded that an investigation was
not warranted. In addition, it found that "...the people of these communities repeatedly stressed to
the Panel that the Project was of great importance to them because it was driven by their needs
and priorities and their definition of conservation. Thus, the Panel notes the importance of
continuing the Project and finding a way to overcome the present difficulties." While an
investigation was not undertaken, an independent evaluation was carried out to review the
project, and a workshop held to address concerns relative to the structure and management of the
project (see details below). In November 2005, a Management Status Report on the action plan
(agreed in advance with the Inspection Panel) showed that the Bank and Project had completed
all the required actions.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The project design included the requisite indicators for outcomes and intermediate outcomes. The
project personnel updated the indicator measurements regularly and supplied the information to
the Bank for input into the corporate reporting system (PSR and ISR). The indicators were simple
and straightforward. No major difficulties were encountered. Indicator information at this level is
considered to be satisfactory overall. Variables for the M&E included both social and
environmental parameters needed to assess the project's progress and impact (see Data Sheet for



                                                  11

complete M&E results and indicators.)

One of the activities of the project was to develop a system for biological monitoring (Component
3). Though implemented by closure, this additional technical monitoring was slow in its
development and start up. Delays were incurred initially as communities resisted external
monitoring. This was overcome by including them in the monitoring process, training community
data collectors, and carrying out information collection with the communities. Another delay was
encountered in finding and procuring qualified technical contractors that could also manage the
work with communities.

The final system emphasis was on establishing a participatory process for information capture
and the integration of both natural (bio-physical) data and social (socio-economic) information.
The system includes a wide range of both alphanumeric and spatial (GIS) data and is resident on
the internet at http://coinbio.iacatas.org.mx/ . The information is classed by themes and
geographic locales and includes thousands of detailed entries, which are well organized and
integrated into a user-friendly interface. Despite delays, the system has proven to be an excellent
tool and will be considered for mainstreaming into the next phases of the PROCYMAF project
for M&E. It also provided the needed information to determine impacts at project completion.
However, it was less useful in providing real-time feedback for the project during
implementation, given the delays in start up.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Fiduciary Compliance

Procurement: Three ex-post reviews were conducted by the LC1 procurement team, the first one
in June 2006 covered CY2005, the second one in June 2007 covered CY2006 and the third one
carried out in January 2008 included the period January 2007 to the end of the procurement
transactions of the Project in 2008. In addition the procurement team participated in supervision
missions in February 2007 and April 2008. The results of these reviews were satisfactory and
confirmed that procurement in the Project was being handled in accordance with the agreed
procedures. Before 2005 all procurement transactions were subject to prior review and were
handled by a procurement specialist based in HQ. The Mexico Office procurement team took
over responsibility of the Project in early 2007. The Project had no cases of misprocurement.

Financial Management. Financial management supervision missions were carried out in 2007 (2),
2008 (1) and at mid-term. Based on the supervision work, it was concluded that Nacional
Financiera (NAFIN) complied with the Bank's FM requirements and provided adequate
implementation support and oversight, contributing to the overall satisfactory financial
management of the project. The Bank determined that FM arrangements were adequate to provide
reasonable assurance that the grant proceeds were being used for the intended purposes.

NAFIN, as financial agent, maintained records and accounts adequate to reflect project's
operations and financial condition. (This included records and separate accounts for the Bank-
financed projects under implementation.) Internal control arrangements for the project fulfilled
Bank's requirements. The project was audited by an external private firm on an annual basis.
Neither the auditors nor the Bank identified any major FM-related issues. The Bank FM team
reviewed and commented on the grant audit reports each year.




                                                  12

Through 2006, NAFIN prepared and submitted semiannual project Progress Reports, including an
FM section that was considered acceptable to the Bank. However, beginning in financial year
2007, the project submitted PMRs, based on the general framework for audits agreed between the
GOM and the Bank. The successive reports were submitted on time and were considered
acceptable by the Bank.

Based on the results of the final FM mission (April 2008), the FM team concluded that at the end
of the project, the FM risk was modest and although minor shortcomings in financial management
existed, they were negligible and did not prevent the timely and reliable provision of information
required to manage and monitor the implementation of the project. The main identified weakness
is the lack of an integrated system for the operation of NAFIN as financial agent and
implementing entity.

Safeguards Compliance

The Bank team included foresters, biologists, and sociologists/anthropologists trained and
qualified to review the environmental and social safeguards compliance during the project.
Compliance overall was considered fully satisfactory (see details for each safeguard below).

Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01, BP 4.01, GP 4.01). The project was assessed as a Category
B project as its impacts were to be largely positive given its focus on globally important
biodiversity. The investments planned were relatively small, and focused on conservation or
sustainable use of natural resources, among other activities. SEMARNAT screened proposals for
activities, which helped to ensure negative impacts were avoided. The Bank supervision team
included biologists, sociologists and foresters trained in the applicable Bank safeguards policies.
The team participated in field visits and reviewed safeguard compliance with beneficiaries and
counterparts.

The overall experience in the application of the EA safeguard was positive. The project's focus
on strengthening social capital in indigenous communities and their natural resources
significantly enhanced beneficiary awareness and their capacity to protect natural habitats and
forests. The participation of SEMARNAT and state environmental authorities in the project
steering committees provided a value-added to safeguard compliance, as well as with compliance
with national standards (country systems), which are considered good in Mexico. The overall
impact of the technical assistance provided, land use planning, participatory evaluation has been
recognized as a contribution to conserving the common resources of the communities and there
were no reports, or evidence, of negative environmental impacts as a result of the project. An
additional measure of environmental protection was the active involvement of the National
Commission of Natural Protected Areas (CONANP) which certified a number of community
areas, which provides additional support to them through the conservation community and the
Federal Government.

Natural Habitats (OP 4.04, BP 4.04, GP 4.04). The protection of natural habitats was a major
focus of the project, as it was designed to have positive impacts on the environment. During the
project, over 166,000 hectares of natural habitats were put under community conservation
management. In addition, over 156,000 hectares of additional adjacent lands were subject to
improved natural resources planning and management.

Forestry (OP 4.36, GP 4.36). The project design included forest utilization through sustainable
forest management subprojects, small-scale agroforestry, or non-timber forest products. However,
few sub-projects were supported with forestry activities as the semi-blended PROCYMAF carried



                                                  13

out the bulk of these activities. Field reviews verified compliance with the safeguard, when
applicable. A Bank forester trained in safeguards participated in the project and most field
missions.

Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20). The project was conceived as an indigenous peoples project given
the high level of representation of these communities in the target areas. In this regard, it was
designed to have a positive effect on indigenous people and indigenous communities. A Bank
sociologist or anthropologist participated in the project and in most field missions.

The project's core strategy was to incorporate indigenous people in the establishment and
management of five new protected areas, following a participatory approach under the principle
of informed decision making. During project design extensive consultations were carried out as
part of the social assessment implemented in the three states to include safeguard previsions for
indigenous peoples as indicated in OP 4.20. One of the main mandates of the social assessment
was to identify the principle socio-cultural and socio-economic background of indigenous peoples
including; degrees of social organization; typology of communities; traditional knowledge for
biodiversity conservation; and land tenure issues to ensure sustainability of both cultural and
natural patrimony. The principle of free, prior, and informed consultation was one of the main
factors included in the project for any activity project-financed activity.

Socio-cultural values: The project respected and included socio-cultural values and traditional
forms of organization of ejidos and communities in the project design, thereby strengthening their
social capital and enhancing the prospects for success. The project also worked to ensure that
sacred sites, which frequently correlate positively with high biodiversity and environmental
services, were protected.


2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

Institutions and Sustainability. In January 2008, CONAFOR assumed the operation of
COINBIO-type activities and integrated them into its community forestry program. Most of the
field staff that participated in the COINBIO project were hired or retained by CONAFOR to
ensure continuity. In June 2008, CONAFOR announced that they had approved 6 million
Mexican Pesos for 2008. The state governments of Michoacán and Oaxaca also allocated 2
million Mexican Pesos as counterpart funds. The budgetary commitment demonstrated by both
federal and states governments in this transition phase represents significant potentials for
sustaining project advances and expanding on outcomes. Moreover, the state governments have
agreed to: (i) create a specific budget line for 2009; (ii) allocate a designated amount that should
not be fungible in CONAFOR or SEMARNAT's budget, but clearly in separated allocation; and
(iii) discuss the adequate allocation of counterpart funding by the participating states. The level of
commitments by the policymakers reflects their confidence in the COINBIO model and its
effectiveness in promoting biodiversity conservation and its sustainable use. The national and
state committees also endorsed the participatory and transparent decision-making processes put in
place by COINBIO.


3. Assessment of Outcomes


3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation



                                                  14

(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The project objectives and activities continue to have a high degree of relevance to the country
and development priorities. This is reflected in the current (2008) CAS, which emphasizes
environmental sustainability and promoting social inclusion, and strengthening institutions. In
July 2008, Mexico requested assistance from the Bank for a new forestry project that will inter
alia mainstream biodiversity conservation into community development in 12 states with high
forest cover, thereby scaling up community conservation efforts to 70% of all forested areas of
the country.

In 2008, COINBIO's activities (and staff) were incorporated into CONAFOR, which allocated $6
million in pesos to support community conservation in calendar year 2008. In addition, the States
of Oaxaca and Michoacán allocated $2 million pesos each. As the world's fourth most bio-
diverse country, the country currently receives the second highest allocation of GEF resources
(US$55 million) to conserve globally important biodiversity (next only to Brazil with US$66
million). In November 2008, Mexico had apx. US$24 million in projects in the GEF pipeline that
focus on global biodiversity concerns4.


3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)

The GEO to achieve more effective biodiversity conservation in the states of Oaxaca, Michoacán,
and Guerrero by strengthening the capacity of indigenous and ejido communities to manage and
protect their biological and cultural resources based on traditional values and practices was fully
achieved. The project planned 98 community and ejido conservation areas, establishing 78 of
these over 167,776 ha (111% of target) in the globally important ecosystems of the Tehuantepec
Moist Forests, Oaxaca Dry Forests, the Costa and Chinantla eco-regions, the Oaxacan Montane
Forests, Sierra Madre de Oaxaca Pine-Oak Forests, Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt Pine-Oak
Forests, Sierra Madre del Sur Pine-Oak Forests, Mexican South Pacific Coast Mangroves,
Tehuacan Valley Matorral, Jalisco Dry Forests, Balsas Dry Forests, Bajio Dry Forests, and
Southern Pacific Dry Forests. The project placed another 156,206 ha under sustainable
community management (104% of target), developed community land use plans with 95
agricultural ejidos for 871,101 hectares, and demarcated 120,443 ha for protected areas. These
actions furthered protection of biodiversity through community efforts. Some 77 communities
with low capacity and organization skills increased their capacity to carry out conservation
activities through the project (110% of target).




4COINBIO's community conservation approach was highlighted in the 2003 World Conservation
Congress. Key elements to reaching global conservation goals (a GEF priority) from the Durban Congress
included developing a "new deal...for protected areas, local communities, and indigenous people" as well
as the need for "new and innovative approaches need to be applied to protected areas, linked to broader
agendas".

One positive impact of the project was highlighted in a legislative reform proposal which used
COINBIO as a best practice for demonstrating the value and effectiveness of community-driven
conservation. The now approved measure (Article 59 of the General Law on Ecological
Equilibrium and Environmental Protection of July 2007) includes legal recognition for voluntary
conservation areas within the national protected areas system. Since the approval of the new
legislation, 6000 hectares of community protected areas have since been certified by CONANP,
while another 100 thousand hectares have been formally recognized in community by-laws.

To strengthen the capacity of communities to implement the community-conservation work, 152
communities actively participated in, inter alia, community-to-community seminars, workshops,
and training courses. By closure, a total of 64 of 78 beneficiary communities (91% of target) had
active conservation and integrated resource use programs on communally-owned lands with high
biodiversity. An institutional framework was successfully established at the state level to channel
resources to communities for their conservation initiatives and to support inter-community
networking and collaboration on shared conservation goals through committees established in
each of the three target states (100%). The state committees, which have been maintained beyond
closure, include state government representatives, representatives of participating communities
(or ejidos), and federal-government representatives (CONABIO, CONAFOR, CDI,
SEMARNAT, CONAF and NAFIN). Oaxaca and Michoacán provide ongoing funding for
community conservation work as does CONAFOR.

The project carried out 489 sub-projects, which helped to strengthen community capacities,
develop markets for sustainable-use products and increase income in communities in high-
biodiversity areas without contributing to environmental loss. Specific initiatives included, among
others, (i) the production of organic coffee in Oaxaca, (ii) development of a collective brand of
mescal in Guerrero, (iii) promotion of a community-collective brand of mescal in Oaxaca, (iv)
consolidation of the organic production of anil (indigo) and jamaica in Tierra Caliente of
Michoacán, (v) consolidation of ecotourism network in Sierra of Guerrero (Costa Grande), (vi)
formation of an ecotourism network in the region norte of Guerrero, (vii) consolidation of the
ecotourism network in Sierra Norte in Oaxaca, (viii) consolidation of ecotourism regional
network in Michoacán, (ix) development of productive capacity of UMAS (wildlife mgt. areas) in
three states, (x) promotion of water-bottling enterprises in three states, and (xi) payment of
environmental services (water/watersheds) in three states.

Economic analyses of representative subproject investments show moderate to excellent financial
rates of returns of 12.5% to 23.4% (see sec. 3.3 on Efficiency for details), reflecting the
subprojects' good potential for sustainability over the long term. Because of the project's focus
on conservation (and application of the Bank's safeguards), the subproject investments were
designed and implemented to be highly compatible with the objective of ensuring productivity
without environmental loss.


3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

Due to the nature of the project (biodiversity conservation), economic and financial analyses were
not carried out during preparation. However, such analyses were deemed important to be
undertaken at project closure given the innovative character of the project and to shed some light
on the financial and economic benefits associated with community conservation.

Economic analysis: COINBIO supported a total of 205 communities or ejidos to place a total of
166,776 ha of natural areas under strict protection for conservation. As the project supported the


5"Type D" subprojects for "green ventures" was formally dropped by mutual agreement between the Bank
and Grant Recipient. Considering the good performance of the other sub-project ventures, the impact of
dropping the activity on the project is considered to be negligible.

building of social capital in communities to reach agreement on the use of their natural resources
and develop territorial as well as natural resource management plans, it appeared opportune to
estimate an economic value of the asset `social capital' as major outcome of the project.

Given the fact that communities could only agree jointly on the use of their commonly owned
land and, its natural resource, the approach taken is the following: social capital built through
COINBIO = total incremental net benefits per ha under conservation (estimated as total ha under
conservation times amounts of payments for environmental service US$ 34.23/ha).

The overall Project's NPV is estimated at US$ 4.3 million with an EER of 26.9% (assuming that
all 166,776 ha declared as protected areas by COINBIO would receive environmental service
payments). The social capital increment per year would be for year 1 (US$ 1.14 million), for year
2 (US$ 2.3 million), for year 3 ( US$ 3.4 million) for year 4 (US$ 4.5 million) and for year 5
(US$ 5.7 million). The switching value of the NPV tends towards 0, if 65-66% of the project's
total protected areas would receive payments for environmental services.

Cost effectiveness: During the evaluation, an exercise was carried out to estimate costs and time
needed for the development of a community based sustainable management plan guided by
COINBIO technicians. The cost per ha identified was approx US$ 49 ha with the effective time
of 50 days and during a time period of 165- 175 days6.

Financial analysis: To assess possible future financial impacts, four productive sub-projects were
selected to estimate their income generation. They were (i) an ecotourism subproject, (ii) a
community water bottling enterprise, (iii) the production and harvesting of medicinal plants, and
(iv) the sustainable raising of deer. Basic data for the calculations were collected through direct
consultation with local authorities and service providers during the ex-post evaluation.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of GEOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Satisfactory

COINBIO was highly successful at achieving conservation of globally important biodiversity at
the landscape level, site, and species levels. Over 323 thousand hectares were placed under
community conservation and sustainable forms of land use in Oaxaca, Guerrero, and Michoacan
States. Prior to COINBIO less than (apx.) 8% of community and ejido lands in the target area
were under some kind of conservation, compared to 20% at closure, with about half engaged in
land-use planning (ordenamiento territorial comunitario) for sustainable management. Forty-six
communities established conservation areas, 24 integrated sustainable land-use plans, while 16
communities included both sustainable land-use plans and conservation areas within their
holdings.

The community model requires investments of about US$49/ha to place an area under
conservation, which includes community investments and strengthening social capital to achieve
effective conservation and mainstreaming into the community's legal framework7. Community
conservation efforts cover both core and buffer management activities simultaneously with higher
levels of participation and commitment than traditional park management models. The model can
also be self-replicating through the community-to-community promotion mechanisms pioneered
by COINBIO.

Biological monitoring sub-projects and research projects conducted independently have verified
the important biodiversity harbored by the conservation areas established by the project at the
species level. Among the species found are Heteroflorum sclerocarpum, a new species
discovered in the Balsas Dry Forests region in the ejidos of Palmita de Cayaco and Guadalupe
Oropeo during COINBIO-financed studies; and 15 endemic species of reptiles, including the
threatened Ctenosaura pectinata and C. clarki. The monitoring and evaluation system
determined that of 22% of the surface area of ejidos of the COINBIO project were found to fall

7In 2008, a GEF-financed project in Argentina for developing traditional national parks found that
investment costs for bring areas under conservation in that country were about US$43/ha. (Although
Mexico's National Protected Area system invests only US$3/ha for bringing an area under conservation, it
is not a good comparator to the community model, as most of Mexico's parks are private holdings with
land-use restrictions, and many of them are not managed.)

within Important Bird Areas considered the key for global bird conservation by BirdLife
International, underscoring the role of community conservation for maintaining globally-
important biodiversity.

The project met or exceeded the indicator targets with over 200 communities participating in
capacity building and sub-projects of different types. The communities increased their
organization capacities for conservation and sustainable development and the areas they
established were an important reference for the Senate to launch the initiative to modify the
General Law of Ecological Equilibrium and Environmental Protection (Ley General del
Equilibrio Ecologico y Proteccion al Ambiente). This modification incorporates and recognizes a
protected area category Voluntary Conservation Areas within community conservation schemes,
as part of the National Protected Areas System ­ the national conservation strategy of Mexico.
One of the ejidos participating in COINBIO (Santiago Lachiguiri) was specifically mentioned in
the presentation of the November 2007 proposal to Congress.

The degree of appropriation of the project at the state level was high, indicating a real potential
for the project activities to evolve and be sustained at the state level, which greatly influences the
likelihood of long-term sustainability of community biodiversity conservation and natural
resources management. Moreover, two of the three states have co-financed (with equivalent
levels of resources) the 2008 call for community conservation proposals of COINBIO with over
US$2 million in financing. CONAFOR has incorporated the regional coordinators into their full-
time staff that continue to support the state committees and contributed $6 million pesos for
continued funding of the project activities.

From a social standpoint the project helped to establish a new focus for community development
and cohesion (ie. community conservation). This enabled beneficiary communities to access
knowledge and helps them gain an understanding of their own natural resources, as well as
support to carryout sustainable productive subprojects. Incorporation of environmental issues in
the community assemblies helped bring communities together, introducing a new and positive
process of searching for alternatives for breaking vicious cycles of poverty and violence.

The community conservation model developed with the communities of Oaxaca, Guerrero, and
Michoacan has been highlighted internationally as a best practice.8 The community conservation
model developed with the communities of Oaxaca, Guerrero, and Michoacan has been
highlighted and reviewed internationally as a best practice. Further evidence of this is that the
project has been visited by representatives of forestry agencies and community leaders from the
Govt. of India in 2007. The most recent IUCN World Conservation Congress has called for
greater use worldwide of community-based conservation models advanced through COINBIO to
achieve global biodiversity conservation goals.

The strengthening of the existing "social capital9" as the basis for community conservation and
development is one of the most important outcomes of the project. Methods developed and
applied in the project included consensus building with community members for community
action, transparency in decision making and community approval of conservation activities
financed through the project, community-to-community seminars, community monitoring and
evaluation and others.

The project contributed to building social capital through the development and application of
instruments which stimulated and encouraged community action for biodiversity conservation
with 46 communities establishing conservation areas, 24 implementing integrated sustainable
land-use plans, resulting in 166 thousand hectares of conservation areas and another 156 thousand
hectares of sustainable-use areas around globally important ecosystems.

Given the fact that communities could only agree jointly on the use of their commonly owned
land and, its natural resource, social capital built through COINBIO is considered to be the total
incremental net benefits per ha under conservation (estimated as total ha under conservation times
amounts of payments for environmental service US$ 34.23/ha)1011. Therefore, the overall
Project's NPV is estimated at US$ 4.3 million with an EER of 26.9% (assuming that all 166,776
ha declared as protected areas by COINBIO would receive environmental service payments).

The project approach was at the forefront of developing Community Conservation Areas and
focused on community capacities and governance several years before they were highlighted in
the 2003 World Conservation Congress. Key elements to reaching global conservation goals (a
GEF priority) from the 2003 Durban Congress included developing a "new deal...for protected
areas, local communities, and indigenous people" as well as the need for "new and innovative
approaches need to be applied to protected areas, linked to broader agendas" all of this also
highlighted in the article 8 (j) of the CBD. In this regard the COINBIO project has been fully
consistent, innovative, and successful in piloting these approaches, also this is one of the first
Bank projects prepared under the framework of the article 8(j) of the CBD.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

COINBIO was a laboratory for developing innovative ways to implement conservation. The State
Committees, by helping to establish and support COINBIO, helped to promote decentralized
operations and local community ownership of projects. Community representatives, academics,
NGOs, service providers, and the state governments cooperated in the selection of subprojects.

 "The social capital of a society includes the institutions, relationships, attitudes and values that govern interactions
among people and contribute to economic and social development. It includes the shared values and rules for social
conduct expressed in personal relationships, trust and a common sense of "civic" responsibility, that makes a society
more than a collection of individuals" (The World Bank 2008).

This cooperation laid the foundations of trust and collaboration that is helping to sustain project
activities after closure and strengthen associated institutions. Increased transparency in decision
making has also helped to establish means for conflict resolution and improved governance. The
state committees continued beyond closure and the state governments are now allocating financial
resources for project activities.

Institutions, including CONABIO (Comision Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la
Biodiversidad) or CONANP (Comision Nacional de Areas Naturales Protegidas) were originally
considered as the main institutions to foster COINBIO. However, they were unable to sserve as
executor for COINBIO12 which opened the door for CONAFOR to play a greater role in
addressing biodiversity issues in forested lands.

Initially, with NAFIN acting as the financial and executing agency, environment and forestry
sector institutions were skeptical. However, the final evaluation determined that COINBIO
benefited from NAFIN's relatively independent role as administrator of the project. The agency
also benefitted from the experience in project management and operations, and this may have
made NAFIN more aware of other areas for involvement in regard to conservation and
community-level investments.

COINBIO had significant influence in the academic sector as well. The project's concept became
a topic of seminars, research projects, and theses. In addition, several books on use of biological
resources and community land-use planning have been published. The publications produced over
the seven years of the project implementation period provide rich and diverse information to
further promote efforts on community biodiversity conservation and sustainable natural resources
management.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

Communities/Ejidos
    ·     The demand for subprojects came mostly from areas of dry forests y mesofilos forests,
          ranging from dry, sub-humid or very humid climates. At the launching of the project,
          there was an expectation that most of the demand would come from communities located
          in areas of high commercial potential, since it was anticipated that such communities
          would have greater capacity to manage and make use of opportunities offered by
          COINBIO. However, the communities less attended by other programs were the ones
          most interested in working with COINBIO.
    ·     One positive impact of the project was highlighted in a legislative reform proposal which
          used COINBIO as a best practice for demonstrating the value and effectiveness of
          community-driven conservation. The now approved measure (Article 59 of the General
          Law on Ecological Equilibrium and Environmental Protection of July 2007) includes
          legal recognition for voluntary conservation areas within the national protected areas
          system. Since the approval of the new legislation, 6000 hectares of community protected
          areas have since been certified by CONANP, while another 100 thousand hectares have
          been formally recognized in community by-laws.

Civil Society Organizations
     ·   Civil society organizations were expected to play more of a leadership role in the
         subproject execution and access financial and technical resources, and
         infrastructure in tandem with the producers' organizations in high biodiversity
         areas. However, CSOs functioned more as technical service providers in
         subproject implementation.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low
The project strengthened and supported the concept of community conservation through
community capacity building and organization that has been mainstreamed into the GoM natural
resource management institutions including SEMARNAT, CONANP, and CONAFOR. The
method was validated and promoted by academic and NGO groups throughout the country and
region. CONAFOR incorporated COINBIO personnel into their institution and now provides
financial resources for the program. The semi-blended PROCYMAF project has internalized
community conservation and environmental services in its next phase of activities that will be
expanded from 6 to 12 states.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)


5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Satisfactory
The quality of the preparation from a technical standpoint was demonstrably high and based on a
significant body of conservation work in the region of Oaxaca. Preparation included a social
assessment of ejidos and community management models, which helped to establish a roadmap
for community conservation. Because the PROCYMAF project started before COINBIO,
COINBIO was able to benefit early lessons learned in implementation. The risks were
adequately assessed including the potentially substantial risk resulting from the use of a
decentralized approach taken and the lack of mechanisms for coordination between the
government and indigenous communities.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank supervision team included foresters, biologists, sociologists/anthropologists,
economists, and fiduciary specialists. The project had four Task Managers during the life of the
project. On average, supervision missions were carried-out 2 to 3 times per year and most
included substantial field visits. The project was highly decentralized, which demanded
additional supervision efforts by the Bank team.

While Bank management supervision was indicated as deficient in the Inspection Panel
complaint, the Bank considered the issues raised to be result of a project-management dispute
unrelated to Bank oversight. The supervision team demonstrated a high degree of professional


                                                23

integrity and was pro-active in helping to resolve the complaint and bring it to successful closure
­ without advancing to a full inspection panel investigation. In fact, the project is one of the few
that was referred to, but did not advance to full inspection panel review. After the dispute was
resolved and a National Coordinator recruited, project implementation and disbursements
improved demonstrably. Moreover, the Panel found the project to have a high level of ownership
by the communities and that the Bank had made satisfactory efforts to resolve the issues and
therefore, it did not merit a full IP investigation.
.
The operation is considered highly successful in the rural development and conservation
community in Mexico, by the State Governments of Oaxaca, Guerrero and Michoacan, in
SEMARNAT, CONANP, NAFIN, CONAFOR and the role of the Bank has been widely
recognized for its commitment and flexibility, which contributed in consolidating an innovative
and highly participatory approach now widely accepted by indigenous communities and ejidos.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank fostered and supported a project that was innovative in its approach to conservation
through community participation, organization, and empowerment (especially indigenous
groups). The project was implemented in a highly decentralized way. The Bank team managed
the risks and challenges and was able to guide the project to a successful closure in concert with a
wide range of stakeholders (communities, federal and state governments, and beneficiaries) and
meet or exceed most of the targets.


5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The Government of Mexico generated a successful model and platform for community
conservation that is an example for Latin America and the global environmental community.
Participation in the processes and sub-projects was high and resulting capacity-building generated
important conservation impacts in globally important ecosystems found within Mexico.
Sustainability is high given the fact that the project is on-going beyond closure and receives both
federal and state level funding for continuing the process in 2008 and beyond.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The project was implemented successfully and with a high sense of ownership from the State
Committees. Projects with substantive social inclusion elements frequently experience a learning
curve during the first year, which is reflected in the initial low disbursements and slow climb in
progress against indicators. The first year of implementation was slow due to the change in
government administrations in 2001, and the establishment of CONAFOR, which resulted in an
overlap of responsibilities with SEMARNAT relative to project management. (The project also
needed time to develop relationships with the communities for implementing the work.) While
the bureaucratic responsibilities were being sorted out, NAFIN stepped in as both executing and
financing agency, and maintained that role through project closure. NAFIN provided office space
and administrative support to the project implementation unit in Mexico City and maintained
routine contact with the Bank team, and participated in supervision missions.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
This was the first project financed by the Bank/GEF which focused on indigenous peoples and
biodiversity conservation, and was also a new theme for the Mexican Government. Institutional

arrangements were complex due to the nature of the effort and involved indigenous communities,
local authorities, civil society, state and local actors in the development of operational plans,
approval of subprojects, and implementation. While this increased the ownership and
transparency of the work with a range of stakeholders, the burden of implementation was carried
by the grant recipient to orchestrate the participation and simultaneously keep it focused on the
project objectives.

From the bio-physical perspective the substantial conservation impact of establishing over 166
thousand hectares of conservation areas and another 150 thousand hectares of sustainable-use
areas around globally important ecosystems is justification for the highly satisfactory rating for
borrower performance. The efficiency of the model is comparable to traditional top-down
conservation management models and was applied effectively by the GoM agencies.


6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

Wide Application
Decentralized management models including multiple levels of governance are difficult to
implement in the short-term, however they generate large gains from a governance point of
view over the long-term. While decentralized management and a strong focus on participation
from stakeholders creates the best long-term impacts, they are complex and difficult to control
from an administrative perspective. Participation in decision making during execution also
increases the likelihood that activities will be sustainable following project closure, as ownership
by stakeholders is increased. At the same time, participatory mechanisms are frequently viewed
with skepticism by institutions, due to perceived risks that participation processes will overtake
the focus on development objectives.

Participatory monitoring and evaluation processes cannot be a "catch-all" process and should
be utilized primarily as a means to provide feedback and understanding to communities and
their natural resource management processes. Monitoring and evaluation can be used for
several purposes related to project development, management, and oversight. However, the
information to be gathered for reporting to a global entity such as the GEF may not necessarily be
the same as that which is needed for decision-making in an ejido. Defining how M&E data will
be gathered and used is important from the design stage.

Social capital is an important result of investments but difficult to quantify under traditional
economic and financial analysis methods. Proxies or models must be found to highlight the
value of the gains. Traditional economic valuation methods of internal rate of return and net
present value do not always capture the value of generating social capital. Investments that do
not generate directly measureable financial returns must be measured indirectly. New tools are
needed to help analysts cope with these demands, which are of increasing importance.

Community conservation projects can serve as a focal-point for organization and breaking
cycles of conflict within communities. Many communities face internal conflicts related to land
disputes, politics, financial management, and leadership while others may suffer from a
breakdown in social cohesion and focus for development. The conservation model and approach
promoted by the project generated a relatively non-controversial theme for communities to focus
on, and helped to reinvigorate their dialogue and cooperation in other community matters.

Typologies and categories facilitate implementation however community capacities exist along
a continuum and provisions must be made to attend differentiated capacities not encompassed
in typologies. The COINBIO generated four typologies regarding investments. However, the
needs of a community may be multiple and some capacities may be more advanced than others.
The structure that mandates a single annual call-for-proposals may not be the most adequate to
address community technical, social, economic and environmental needs. Alternatives in project
design should be generated to tailor capacity building based on a more complete profile of
community needs.

Demand-driven approaches are more effective when community organizational capacities are
relatively high. Demand-driven approaches to implementing projects place much of the burden
on communities to prepare their presentations, paperwork, legal documents, while also requiring
specialized technical assessments and assistance. However, when target communities have very
limited capacity, the learning curve can be quite high, and can delay implementation. This is
especially problematic, when short implementation periods are required or expected.

Market-based programs within conservation projects require specialized skills and service
providers as well as adequate financial vehicles for these investments to be effective
conservation tools. Highly specialized knowledge and skills are required to adequately advise
beneficiaries on access to markets. However, they are frequently difficult to find in marginalized
areas of the country. Studies to analyze markets can and should be carried out during preparation,
and during implementation, but must be included in the design and budget for both.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

General Comment on the Report (16 December 2008): The report clearly demonstrates the
project's success in the conservation of natural resources and the development of protected areas
in indigenous communities, which is helping to safeguard the country's valuable biodiversity and
ecosystems. NAFIN is grateful for having the opportunity to serve as administrator for this
successful project, and for the assistance of both SEMARNAT and CONAFOR in providing
technical support during its implementation.

Specific Comments: On page 33, sub index 17, the correct executing agency is the NACIONAL
FINANCIERA (instead of Nacional financiero); please note the correct spelling of GUERRERO
and correct as needed, for example pages 33, 34 and 37; and in the participants list omit the last
names.

Bank Response: The corrections have been made as requested above.

Component 3

Under component 3 a biological monitoring system was competed. The system includes a wide
range of both alphanumeric and spatial (GIS) data integrated into a user-friendly interface and is
resident on the internet at http://coinbio.iacatas.org.mx/ .

Component 4

The component financed the national coordination unit, the supervision and administrative
fiduciary/progress monitoring, and the establishment of the legal and conceptual framework for

community conservation model, and handled the reporting to the Government and the Bank over
the 7 years implementation period.


Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

During project formulation no economic and financial analysis for the GEF project was carried
out. However, such analysis was seen as important to be undertaken at project closure given the
innovative character of the project and to shed some light on the financial and economic returns
of community conservation forestry projects. The following approaches were taken to derive
quantitative assessment of the project's outputs:

a) Estimation of the overall project's NPV and ERR based on the potential incremental benefit
    of environmental service payments/ha of total protected areas facilitated by COINBIO and
    the validation of social capital built in the communities;
b) Financial analysis of individual illustrative case studies of productive activities stimulated
    through COINBIO.

It should be recalled that the principal outcomes expected from COINBIO were: (i) to establish
permanent conservation areas; (ii) building capacity among communities; and (iii) to support the
creation of state and regional institutions that promote community conservation initiatives. In the
PAD there was no economic indicator included. During early stages of the project, no baseline
was developed on economic data which made it difficult to assess the incremental benefits
achieved during project implementation. Furthermore, the M&E system was only established
towards the end of the project.

2. Execution of Sub-projects under component II

Under component II the project implemented three types of sub-projects:

    ·    Type A: Land use Planning for the Establishment of Biodiversity Conservation Areas
    ·    Type B: Training and Capacity-Building, including Horizontal Exchanges
    ·    Type C: Community Investments for Conservation Areas and Sustainable Use
         Ca: Sustainable Use Sub-projects (certified products and environmental services)
         Cb: Productive Conservation Sub-projects

At project evaluation, COINBIO supported a total of 205 communities/ejidos and 498 sub-project
activities with a total of US$ 4.96 million. The project had conducted three `call for proposals'
(convocatorias) in 2002, 2004, 2005, respectively and in all three participating States: Guerrero,
Michoacán and Oaxaca17.

         Most sub-projects were conducted in Michoacán (192 sub-projects); secondly ranked was
         Guerrero (150 subprojects) and third came Oaxaca (147 subprojects). COINBIO supported, in
         Guerrero and Oaxaca, a total of 70 communities/ejidos each, whereas in Michoacán only 65. The
         difference between number of communities and project activities supported can be explained by
         the fact that many communities received funding for more than one sub-project over the five
         years of project implementation.

         Forestry communities willing to participate in COINBIO usually received assistance by local
         service providers for the write- up and the development of technical proposals. Upon sub-project
         approval by COINBIO it was often the very same service providers who would assist in the
         implementation of the project. For most forestry communities participating in COINBIO it was
         the first time to: (i) get direct community financial support by the public sector; and (ii) manage
         project funds at the community authority level.

         Regional distribution of funds and types of sub-projects

         In terms of regional distribution of funds to sub-projects activities, the largest part was allocated
         to Michoacán with 37%, second was Oaxaca with 33% and third Guerrero with 30% (of total
         budget of component II):

         Grants given for sub-projects were relatively small amounts and widely distributed between
         communities. The table below indicates the range of funding provided to communities per
         typology of sub-project.

Summarizing, the nature of the activities funded under Component II, and in particular under the
category Cb, "productive conservation sub-projects" were mainly capacity-building workshops,
studies, development of plans (sustainable management, territorial development plans, among
others), delimitation of territories, some were infrastructural projects such as: protection of water
sheds, ecotourism, etc. During project evaluation, it was highlighted by technicians that most
communities supported by COINBIO had no forest community enterprises such as logging
companies, and thus no regular cash income. Therefore, it should be noted that most of the sub-
projects were just on the brink of commercial activities and were not covering recurrent
expenditures of the activities at project closure. Finally, communities depend largely on
remittances sent by migrated family members.

Leveraged Resources

Despite the relatively small financial contribution which COINBIO made to the communities, the
amounts allocated had a considerable impact on natural resource management. In many cases,
COINBIO was financing one of or the first community-based workshop of capacity building and
development of territorial/natural resource management plans. Based on COINBIO's innovative
character it could leverage an elevated amount of additional resources. A considerable number of
government, donor and NGO projects and programs financed additional and complementary
activities such as marketing studies on non-timber forest products, construction of eco-tourism
cottages and environmental learning centres, among others.

These projects and programmes were for example the Community Forestry Project (PROCYMAF
II), the Commission on Indigenous Issues (CDI- in e.g. Oaxaca), community financial
contributions through the payments of environmental service through the program ProArbol with
CONAFOR.

The executing Agency National Financiera reported that between 2001 and 2007 at least a total of
US$ 6.18 million (US$ 5 million by international agencies , US$ 57,036 by the national
counterpart and US$ 1.12 million of local contributions) were mobilized as additionally resources
by COINBIO . There were no records available for amount of leveraged additional resources
from international agencies after the mid-term review. In 2008, the PROCYMAF II project
reported US$7.98 million (IBRD), US$1.04 million (National counterpart) and US$1.51 million
(local/state counterpart) for eligible co-financing expenditures for the COINBIO Project. (see
Annex 1)

 Quantitative Evaluation

Economic analysis of the project's NPV and ERR

COINBIO supported a total of 205 communities or ejidos and managed to put under conservation
a total of 166,776 ha. As the project supported the building of social capital in communities to
reach agreement on the use of their natural resources and develop territorial as well as natural
resource management plans, it appeared opportune to estimate an economic value of the asset
`social capital' as major outcome of the project.



                                                  32

Given the fact that communities could only agree jointly on the use of their commonly owned
land and, its natural resource, the approach taken is the following: social capital built through
COINBIO = total incremental net benefits per ha under conservation (estimated as total ha under
conservation times amounts of payments for environmental service US$ 34.23/ha)18.

For the calculation, the following assumptions were taken:
     · Number of ha under conservation facilitated by COINBIO (excluding ha under
          sustainable use)
     · Implementation schedule: distribution of the number of ha over 5 years (20% in year 1,
          20% in year 2 (+ ha of year 1) etc are considered as net incremental benefits
     ·    Annual discount rate is taken at 12%19

The overall Project's NPV is estimated at US$ 4.255 million with an ERR of 26.9%, assuming
that all 166,776 ha declared as protected areas by COINBIO would receive environmental service
payments.

The social capital increment per year would be for year 1 US$ 1.14 million, for year 2 US$ 2.3
million, for year 3 US$ 3.4 million, for year 4 US$ 4.5 million and for year 5 US$ 5.7 million.

The switching value of the NPV tends towards 0, if 65-66% of the project's total protected areas
would receive payments for environmental services.

Cost efficiency of a Community Forest Management Plan

During the evaluation, an exercise was carried out to estimate costs and time needed for the
development of a community-based sustainable forest management plan guided by COINBIO


18 US$ 34.23/ha is currently paid in Mexico by CONAFOR via the programme PROARBOL and
represents the opportunity cost to plant an ha of maize in the area of Mexico City. The calculation is an
estimate of the factor 6.5 times the daily rate of a minimum salary of $ 52.59= US$ 5.3. US$ 34.23/ha is
taken as an economic price as it represents the cost to society/opportunity cost to maintain the ha under
conservation.

technicians. The cost per ha was approx US$ 49 ha with the effective time of 50 days and during
a time period of 165- 175 days.

Financial Projection of Productive Sub-projects

To assess possible future financial impacts, four productive sub-projects were selected to estimate
income generation to be induced by the sub-projects. As already mentioned, only a few sub-
projects at project closure (December 2007) had generated any income out of the investments
made (and not yet at a cost recovery level), needed to conduct the analyses.

The illustrative models, which are presented below, were constructed based on the availability of
data and local staff to collaborate in the exercise in order to quantify possible project results. Four
illustrative productive sub-projects of COINBIO were selected: (i) ecotourism project; (ii) a
community water bottling enterprise - both estimated with considerable investment and with
average incremental net benefits and financial returns; (iii) production and harvesting of
medicinal plants; (iv) sustainable rearing scheme of deer - both with modest investments and low
incremental net benefits and financial returns on investments. Basic data for the calculations were
collected through direct consultation with local authorities and service providers during the ex-
post evaluation. The models assume the following hypothesis:

·    Investments     were not      fully covered by COINBIO            but   co-financed by other
     institutions/programs and/or community counterpart funds
·    Years of investment projection vary according to sub-project from 5-20 years.
·    The discount rate is 12% according to the standard discount rate of public investments in
     Mexico (see footnote on page 4)

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

During the end of March to early May 2008, evaluation workshops were carried out in the three
COINBIO states as part of the final evaluation


Methodology


Interviews with the members of the State Committees, government staff (CONAFOR,
SEMARNAT at state offices), and technical service providers with the objectives of: (i) learning
the functions/roles of the State Committees from different members; (ii) validate the analytical
instruments used in the focus group meetings; and (iii) to enrich the process with their relevant
knowledge of the selected sample communities.


15 communities and ejidos in total were selected (5 from each state)


Selection criteria of the samples

    ·   Executed subprojects
    ·   Located in diverse ecosystems (dry forests, temperate forests, and humid forests) assuring
        representation
    ·   Physical accessibility and disposition of the ejidos to provide information


    The selection was done in accordance with the number and amount of the investment. The
    methodology developed by the M&E process was taken into account and that all the
    subprojects analyzed had at least one year of operation.


    Field visits along with project staff to confirm the selection.


    Sample Analysis. A series of interviews


The work methodology consisted in the first series of interviews in the capitals of each state to
COINBIO state coordinators, members of State Committees, state staff of CONAFOR and
SEMARNAT, technical service providers and academics. The workshops were developed in the
beneficiaries' communities with COINBIO subprojects where authorities of community and
ejidos as well as principal actors of the project participated.

The issues covered in the interviews were:
    ·   Communities to visit
    ·   Progress of subprojects in communities
    ·   Performance of the State Committees
    ·   Effectiveness e of annual calls for proposals to develop subprojects
    ·   Achievements, errors and difficulties that developed throughout the project
        implementation
    ·   Quality of service providers



                                                  37

    ·   Recommendations

Workshops were developed with focus groups in communities and ejidos. Individual
questionnaires were given to people involved in the subprojects and answered by authorities of
ejidos and communities, project chief and staff and workers of the project, as well as different
beneficiaries.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Introduction
The COINBIO was designed to be consistent with the World Bank's Country Assistance Strategy
seeking to reduce poverty and creation of economic benefits through conservation of biodiversity
and sustainable management of natural resources. It was also consistent with the Global
Environment Facility operational strategy in regard to its focus on ecosystems of global
importance in particular the pine-oak forests, humid forests (mesofilo), and dry forests of
southwest Mexico.

Within the national context COINBIO was consistent with the National Biodiversity Strategy
developed by CONABIO and was important in integrating community and indigenous
conservation as part of a national policy. The project was also consistent with the SEMARNAT
strategies that sought to increase decentralization of environmental and natural resource
management towards the states and municipalities while increasing local community
participation. SEMARNAT played a key role in supporting the creation and implementation of
COINBIO in its work as the primary entity for environmental policy and regulation of the
country.

COINBIO and National Biodiversity Objectives
The project must be considered a pilot project oriented towards conservation of biodiversity and
sustainable management of biological resources of Mexico. The project was designed to establish
a model for community conservation replicable throughout the country and in a global context. It
is unique in several Basedways including: (i) It was developed and promoted initially by
Zapoteca indigenous communities of Oaxaca, later taking on a regional scale including other
states. (ii) Its design was oriented to link community and ejido conservation areas with
sustainable use areas within biodiverse regions of Mexico. The cultural aspects and traditional
knowledge of communities was recognized within this context. (iii) Conservation action was
achieved through community capacity-building and increasing information and economic
incentives. (iv) It generated a decentralized model of conservation and a model of conservation
replicable at national and global scale.

Results
Based on the indicators in the PAD the following results were obtained in the COINBIO: (i)
166,776 hectares conserved in community conservation areas, a 111% achievement of the 150
thousand hectare indicator established at the project outset. (ii) 156,206 hectares under
sustainable use or 109% of the indicator of 150 thousand hectares established initially. In
addition 95 agricultural ejidos developed land use plans (OTC) over 871,101 hectares and
demarcated protected areas (120,443 ha) and sustainable extractive areas (156,206 ha). (iii) 64
communities of the 70 planned initially with advanced level of community organization
integrating sustainable management and community conservation (91% of target). (iv) 77
incipient communities with increased conservation capacity (110% of target 70 communities). (v)
Established a state-level institutional framework for channeling resources to communities for
conservation and establishment of inter-community network. The project achieved investment of
2 million pesos from Oaxaca, 1 million in Guerrero and Michoacan committed 3 million
(although not implemented in 2008 due to government change). CONAFOR has committed a
similar amount in co-financing and integrated the state project personnel however the state
administrative personnel have not been integrated nor has a National Coordinator been hired. (vi)
positive markets from sustainable use of natural resources include organic coffee in Oaxaca,
collective brand of mezcal in Guerrero and Oaxaca, organic production of hibiscus flower tea,
ecotourism network in Guerrero Costa Grande and Michoacan, and bottled water facilities in the

three states among others. (vi)Increase in community income by 50% was an unreasonable
indicator given the magnitude of the investment (vii) An integrated monitoring and evaluation
system was to be implemented at the outset of the project but was not implemented until the final
year. However the development of a participatory monitoring system was significant in this
regard.

Lessons Regarding Design
    1. During the development of the project and startup, a greater expectation was generated
        than the institutions were capable of delivering.

    2. The idea of implementing the project through decentralized autonomous state committees
        was not achieved fully given that it conflicted somewhat with the contracting system and
        administration system of the GoM. Bank regulations also limited the autonomy possible
        in regard to execution.

    3. The original M&E system focused heavily on biological monitoring and less so on social
        aspects and proved less interesting to the project participants.

    4. Community green ventures were not implemented by mutual agreement between the
        Bank and the project participants.

    5. The design did not permit support to regional organizations or networks for sustainable
        production or services.

Unexpected Impacts
    1. NAFIN as project implementation agency permitted greater flexibility and
        decentralization. It did however generate some doubts from conservation and forestry
        institutions at the outset. CONAFOR taking on a lead role and integrating the project was
        also important given that the conservation aspect is secondary to the institutional
        mandate.

    2. Participation was higher from communities that were located in ecosystems that were less
        oriented towards commercial forestry when the opposite was expected.

    3. Participation from civil society organizations was lower than expected. Possibly this was
        due to the view as potential technical service providers rather than allies in the
        conservation efforts.

Results by Component
Component 1: Local Capacity Strengthening
The state committees functioned continuously during project implementation although some
capacities were noted to be limited and require strengthening during the next phases.
Although community conservation is not fully recognized and mainstreamed into conservation
policy and programs, there has been significant recognition at a national level through COINBIO.
In particular it was important in the Senate initiative to modify the General Law on Ecological
Balance and Environmental Protection to include voluntary conservation areas within the national
protected areas system.
Component 2: Community Conservation and Sustainable Use
The M&E process and field evaluations verified the achievement of the target coverage in
conservation areas and sustainable use areas. Regarding sustainable use, the projects in coffee-
growing areas and wildlife management areas are more developed while the projects had too little
time to establish clearly their economic viability and financial returns within the evaluation of the



                                                  41

ICR. Several initiatives seem to have potential to generate positive returns on investment while
community strengthening activities have generated capacities to establish projects through other
government programs and initiatives.
Component 3: Monitoring and Evaluation
The M&E generated an important tool for this type of project, allowing information to be
accessed readily through the internet and with a related GIS system. In regard to community use
of the monitoring and evaluation system, the results are more limited given the lack of
infrastructure in communities to access the system while the participatory process of monitoring
is difficult to sustain over the long-term and in absence of the project. The project also was
limited in the dissemination and information aspects to maintain communities, academics, and
government agencies informed of advances, best-practices, and lessons-learned.
Component 4: National Corodination
The project maintained its operations throughout the allotted period for implementation. The
M&E system was established while the project achieved mainstreaming into institutional, legal,
and community conservation and development strategies. Lack of National Coordinator was a
problem at the outset while inconsistencies between the Operational Manual and the Grant
Agreement caused some conflict. The National Committee and SEMARNAT were not able to
intervene and resolve the conflict adequately and there were delays in implementation of the
project and in establishing the M&E system as a result.
Assessment of Bank Performance
Satisfactory ("Good")
Bank maintained its supervisory presence throughout the project implementation with informal
communication and specific missions on a regular basis. The Task Managers insisted on the
adherence to financial norms and safeguards allowing fluid project execution. It should be noted
however for consideration in future operations that the frequent change of task managers
generates a lag period to reestablish fluid communication and understanding regarding
implementation. Expectations created by the project were too high given the Bank and NAFIN
capacities generating a somewhat negative environment during 2001-2003 resulting in lower
disbursements for that period.
Assessment of Grantee Performance
Satisfactory ("Good")
The GoM maintained an operational framework that allowed the project to be implemented
although there was an adjustment phase with the change of government in December 2000.
CONAFOR was created in 2001 and changed the structure for supervision of the COINBIO. The
change of oversight from SEMARNAT to CONAFOR was not formalized and created some
misunderstandings regarding implementation.
Lessons Learned
    1. Indigenous and small-farmer communities of Mexico are diverse in their nature and
         characteristics therefore there is no single conservation strategy that can be recommended
         but rather they must respond to this cultural and natural diversity of the country.

    2. CONAFOR, CONABIO, CDI, CONANP, and SEMARNAT should all coordinate their
         programs and objectives with COINBIO. Projects with common conservation objectives
         should come together to improve the chances of breaking poverty cycles in communities.

    3. Monitoring and evaluation systems should be based in community needs and allow them
         to become involved in the process while generating local capacities for self-regulation
         and oversight.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Based on the interviews in the States (May 26, 28 and 29, 2008) and a workshop held in Mexico
on May 30, 2008, comments were received and compiled from key partners and stakeholders
regarding the COINBIO. Following is a summary of these comments:

Regarding Community Conservation
·        Community conservation cannot be viewed as a project but rather as a process
·        Some of the principles that must guide community conservation include that they must be
community driven and respect their customs and uses of natural resources. The model must
therefore focus on building community capacities for sustaining the efforts and not based on
permanent external support systems.

Regarding the Principal Achievements of COINBIO
·        A demonstration of success of the COINBIO was its contribution in establishing several
legal reforms regarding community conservation.
·        Greater understanding and appropriation by indigenous communities of conservation
tools and legal mechanisms.
·        COINBIO was a process developed over 7 years that supported awareness towards
community conservation. Three different periods must be recognized: (i) Establishing formal
paths for conservation (ii)Developing conservation strategies with the participants and (iii)
Support conservation within the surroundings of communities.
·        Advanced in citizenship, decentralization, and decision making thanks to the design
having incorporated State Committees.
·        An important achievement was financing projects that others were not financing and the
first to support land-use planning and resource inventories.
·        It allowed the training of technical service providers
·        Improved relations between State governments and with people disenchanted with
governmental projects

Regarding Difficulties or Mistakes of COINBIO
·        Using the agrarian interpretation of ejidos and communities limited the support to those
with "land rights" (derechosos). In addition there was no integrations of youth, women, children,
and avecindados (those with no land rights) that are the ones that can help follow-up and
generally do not make up part of the emigrating population of the communities. The issue of the
weakening of the community assemblies (asambleas) because of emigration was also not
considered.
·         Lack of greater coordination with other projects like PROCYMAF and with other
government institutions.
·        The Operational Manual was inadequate from the outset.
·        Lack of a link to the academic sector that did not permit greater incorporation of their
views as well as those of NGOs and the Technical Service Providers especially in Michoacan.

Regarding a Second Phase of COINBIO
·        COINBIO should be extended to other States although not necessarily a national level,
rather it should advance in stages respecting different communities structures and approaches.
Eliminating or simplifying the State Committee structure would not be recommended.
·        State Committee structures should be strengthened and technical support models
improved according to the social needs identified. CONAFOR should be careful how it
mainstreams the project in following phases.




                                                  44

·       COINBIO must be made into a public policy or a national program of sustainable and
integrated development with the objective of collective understanding of this type of
management. The COINBIO should not depend on donations but on the national budget
resources.
·       Support a municipal model to promote long-term projects with more local level access to
the communities.
·       Need to incorporate an educational component and information feedback to communities.
·       Develop new impact indicators for a second phase, not only output indicators.
·       Create synergy with other conservation projects.
·       Strengthen and train local service providers.
