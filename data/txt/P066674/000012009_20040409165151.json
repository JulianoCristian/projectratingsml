The Panel received Bank\n            Management's Response to the Request on March 2, 2004\n            (Management Response). This report  determines the\n            eligibility of the Request, and makes a recommendation as to\n            whether the Panel should investigate the matters alleged in\n            the Request. The objective of the Project is to conserve\n            high biodiversity areas in the states of Oaxaca, Michoacan,\n            and Guerrero, by strengthening and promoting community\n            conservation initiatives on communally-owned lands, building\n            on their cultural values, and practices, developed in\n            relationship to the resources in these areas. According to\n            the Request, the Bank has violated its policies and\n            procedures on project supervision and indigenous peoples,\n            because it has proposed a restructuring of the Project\n            without involving the State Committees. It alleges that the\n            Bank has proposed modifying the Project so as \"to\n            divest the State Committees of their authority and vest the\n            national coordinator with full powers.''\n            Management states that \"as of October 2003, discussions\n            had not yet advanced to the stage of specific restructuring\n            proposals to be considered by the State Committees,\"\n            adding it \"will continue to involve systematic\n            consultation with Project stakeholders.\"  The Panel\n            observed that the Bank's supervision of the Project\n            appears to have been inadequate in certain respects, and, an\n            issue of broader concern to the Panel is the proposed\n            restructuring of the Project, particularly given the\n            Project's \"demand-driven\" nature. The Request\n            and Management Response contain conflicting assertions, and\n            interpretations about the issues, the facts, and compliance\n            with Bank policies and procedures. Moreover, the Panel\n            continues to be very concerned that a restructuring of the\n            Project not be detrimental to the interests of the\n            indigenous communities. In light of the foregoing, and in\n            fairness to all the parties concerned, the Panel cannot take\n            a position at this time on whether the Request merits an\n            investigation, and awaits further developments."}, "docdt": "2004-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
