BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION PROJ", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Indigenous and Community\n            Biodiversity Conservation Project for Mexico were as\n            follows: outcome was moderately unsatisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: the\n            lack of a common understanding of the respective roles and\n            level of autonomy of all parties in a decentralized\n            management structure can undermine implementation. In this\n            case differences in interpretation of the level of autonomy\n            delegated to state level actors contributed to an impasse\n            between some of the state coordination units and the\n            national implementing agency that threatened to end project\n            implementation and contributed to an inspection panel\n            request. The project's experience reveals the\n            challenges associated with developing monitoring tools that\n            are adequate for both conservation and capacity building\n            objectives. Participatory monitoring is important for\n            enhancing community capacity to monitor and make decisions\n            over the management of their natural resources. The\n            project's experience in carrying out participatory\n            monitoring demonstrates the need to employ methods that are\n            useful to communities and can be continued beyond the\n            project's closure. While community participation was\n            included in the monitoring exercise, the methods used were\n            out of step with the community's capacity to continue\n            monitoring over the long term. A recurring shortcoming in\n            the implementation of small grant type projects is the\n            failure to monitor subproject outcomes. Since the\n            demand-driven nature of participatory operations like this\n            one limits the ability to specify objectives of\n            sub-projects. Up-front extra effort is required in the\n            course of implementation to document the goals communities\n            for themselves, their plan for achieving these goals, and to\n            monitor resulting outcomes."}, "docdt": "2012-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
