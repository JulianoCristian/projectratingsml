prioritized ecological zones in\n            the States of Oaxaca, Michoacan, and Guerrero, building on a\n            previous operation, by initiating a parallel, demand-driven\n            program

The\n            components will: 1) finance the costs of the three state\n            committees and coordinating units, which will oversee\n            activities at the state level. This financing will include\n            consulting fees, funds for technical assistance to\n            communities, training in financial, and technical\n            monitoring, and operational expenses; 2) provide grants to\n            communities to finance subprojects on community\n            conservation, adjusted to the needs, and organizational\n            level of participating communities, within four types of\n            activities: land use planning; training and capacity\n            building; community investments; and, green venture funds,\n            applicable for long-term conservation sustainability\n            projects; 3) monitor physical execution of the project, as\n            well as bio-diversity changes over time, and, information\n            will be generated to assess the viability of bio-diversity\n            conservation, through an Integrated Information System; and,\n            4) finance national coordination, to facilitate knowledge\n            sharing between regional innovative programs."}, "docdt": "2000-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
