"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Indigenous and Community\n            Biodiversity Conservation Project (COINBIO) for Mexico were\n            as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, Bank performance\n            was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: social capital\n            is an important result of investments but difficult to\n            quantify under traditional economic and financial analysis\n            methods. Proxies or models must be found to highlight the\n            value of the gains. Traditional economic valuation methods\n            of internal rate of return and net present value do not\n            always capture the value of generating social capital.\n            Investments that do not generate directly measureable\n            financial returns must be measured indirectly. New tools are\n            needed to help analysts cope with these demands, which are\n            of increasing importance. Community conservation projects\n            can serve as a focal-point for organization and breaking\n            cycles of conflict within communities. Many communities face\n            internal conflicts related to land disputes, politics,\n            financial management, and leadership while others may suffer\n            from a breakdown in social cohesion and focus for\n            development. The conservation model and approach promoted by\n            the project generated a relatively non-controversial theme\n            for communities to focus on, and helped to reinvigorate\n            their dialogue and cooperation in other community matters.\n            Market-based programs within conservation projects require\n            specialized skills and service providers as well as adequate\n            financial vehicles for these investments to be effective\n            conservation tools. Highly specialized knowledge and skills\n            are required to adequately advise beneficiaries on access to\n            markets. However, they are frequently difficult to find in\n            marginalized areas of the country. Studies to analyze\n            markets can and should be carried out during preparation,\n            and during implementation, but must be included in the\n            design and budget for both."}, "docdt": "2008-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
