the Special Account shall be made as follows:
(a)
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Recipient shall furnish 
to the Bank a request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of an amount or

behalf of the Recipient, withdraw from the GEF Trust Fund Grant Account and deposit 
into the Special Account such amount as the Recipient shall have requested and as 
shall have been shown by said documents and other evidence to have been paid out of 
the Special Account for Eligible Expenditures.  Each such deposit into the Special 
Account shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the GEF Trust Fund Grant Account under one 
or more of the Eligible Categories.
3.
The Bank shall not be required to make further deposits into the Special 
Account, once the total unwithdrawn amount of the GEF Trust Fund Grant minus the total 
amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to 
Section 5.02 of the General Conditions, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount 
of the Authorized Allocation.  Thereafter, withdrawal from the GEF Trust Fund Grant 
Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of the GEF Trust Fund Grant shall follow 
such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Recipient.  Such further 
withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been 
satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the 
date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for Eligible Expenditures.

Description of the Project
The objective of the Project is to conserve high biodiversity in the states of 
Oaxaca, Michoacán and Guerrero by strengthening and promoting community conservation 
initiatives on communally-owned lands, building on the cultural values and traditional 
management practices that such communities have developed in relationship to the

formulation, presentation, financial administration and monitoring of Community 
Subprojects.

Community Subprojects
Provision of grants to Communities and Ejidos to carry out conservation 
activities of the following types:
1.
Type A Subprojects.  Establishment of biodiversity conservation areas in 
Community and Ejido lands through:  (a) the identification of such areas; (b) their 
delimitation; and (c) their formal inclusion in by-laws or statutes of Communities or 
Ejidos.
2.
Type B Subprojects.  Development of the information base and institutional 
framework to maintain such conservation areas, by:  (a) carrying out conservation 
capacity-building activities (related to, inter alia, the legal, financial, technical, 
administrative, institutional, and entrepreneurial capacities of Communities and 
Ejidos); (b) strengthening conservation networks among Communities and Ejidos (through 
the carrying out of activities such as research and study tours within Mexico); and 
(c) carrying out feasibility studies (including studies with regard to the relevant 
legal and institutional framework) for productive activities of the type listed in 
Part B.3 (b) of the Project.
3.
Type C Subprojects.  Investments in such conservation areas and sustainable use 
activities, including:  (a) investments to protect or improve the administration of 
conservation areas, such as building guard towers, placing identification markers, 
fencing, development of fire control mechanisms, and rehabilitation of forest fringes; 
and (b) investments and feasibility studies (including studies with regard to the 
relevant legal and institutional framework) for productive activities that may 
generate sustainable economic alternatives for Communities and Ejidos, such as, inter 
alia, eco-tourism, water bottling plants, demarcation of nature paths, nature guide 
training, adaptation of traditional agricultural practices, mushroom cultivation,

the Project, through the establishment of an integrated information system which shall 
include information about biodiversity in priority areas affected by Community 
Subprojects and about the socio-economic status of the Communities and Ejidos carrying 
out such Community Subprojects (so as to allow such information to be correlated with 
models of predicted species distribution, of the relationship of biodiversity within 
geographic clusters, and of movement of species among the conservation areas 
Page  15
established under the Project).
Part D:
National Coordination
Coordination of Project implementation through the National Committee and the 
National Coordination Unit, so as to supervise and monitor the execution of the

of the Project or $50,000 equivalent in the case of type D Community Subprojects 
referred to in Part B of the Project); and
(b)
the Community or Ejido shall:  (i) use those proceeds exclusively for 
carrying out the Community Subproject in question; (ii) provide, from its own
