The first, promotion\n            of input use and distribution systems, includes farmer\n            access to seasonal credit for modern farm inputs; advisory\n            services for the adoption of modern farm inputs; and access\n            to credit, multiplication, and distribution of improved\n            seeds. The second, support to local agricultural marketing\n            systems, is comprised of crop conservation, processing, and\n            marketing technologies; strengthening of rural agricultural\n            marketing poles; and support to private trader investment in\n            marketing services. The final component consists of\n            technical support, monitoring, and evaluation."}, "docdt": "1999-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
