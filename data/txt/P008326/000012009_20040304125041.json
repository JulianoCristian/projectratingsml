unsatisfactory project\n            outcome, with negligible institutional development impacts,\n            although sustainability is likely, but both performances by\n            the Bank and Borrower are also rated unsatisfactory.\n            Significant lessons address the following. The development\n            of a detailed operational strategy between several countries\n            is a daunting effort under any circumstance, further\n            aggravated when differences in power, wealth and political\n            systems exist. It is thus suggested not to spend substantial\n            resources in developing detailed strategies, neither\n            specific studies with broad objectives due to the\n            difficulties of often divergent opinions. Such divergence\n            also creates difficulties, particularly to Global\n            Environment Facility (GEF) operations, where emphasis is on\n            the need for substantial cofinancing. Moreover, the\n            responsibility of the project unit in implementing certain\n            activities, would have better been implemented by\n            country-level line agencies, such as the countries'\n            Ministries of Agriculture/Environment or National Hydromet,\n            so as to enhance country ownership, and strengthen national\n            institutions. However, the project did validate an\n            underlying assumption of the Aral Sea Basin Program: while\n            restoring the Aral Sea to its former size and productivity\n            will not be possible, it is feasible though to recreate much\n            of the lost value by restoring wetlands in the deltas of the\n            Amu and Syr Darya Rivers, determined by the successful\n            restoration of Lake Sudoche. Notwithstanding, lessons\n            emphasize that the design of regional programs would be\n            better approached by separating projects and activities,\n            into efforts at the national level, consistent with regional\n            goals and coordination."}, "docdt": "2004-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
