likely, although the\n            institutional development impact is negligible. Lessons are\n            as follows. Policy-based lending has been an effective\n            mechanism of support in Mali, but structural adjustment\n            credits may not be the best mechanism for supporting public\n            enterprise divestitures. Privatization is a complex process,\n            particularly given the fragility of Mali's economy and\n            high vulnerability to exogenous shocks, thereby forcing the\n            Bank to either amend its conditionality, or penalize the\n            government for good performance under difficult\n            circumstances. The Bank supported a process that would not\n            only be anti-competitive in outcome, but which was also\n            likely to be markedly less attractive to potential\n            investors; similarly, the Bank's acquiescence in the\n            government's decision not to use an investment advisor,\n            in a country fraught with capacity weaknesses, further\n            weakened the likelihood of privatization success. This also\n            suggests the need to ensure up-front that key implementing\n            institutions have sufficient resources, since the shortfall\n            of other donor funding had the potential to substantially\n            undermine credit implementation. Instead, future operations\n            should explicitly ensure that funding, technical assistance,\n            etc. be reliably available; alternatively, provision of such\n            funding should be included in the Bank's operation to\n            make certain that it is forthcoming. Other lessons outline\n            the need for maintaining a tight focus on a limited number\n            of reforms; for an effective partnership with donors; and,\n            for an effective partnership with the International Monetary Fund."}, "docdt": "2004-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
