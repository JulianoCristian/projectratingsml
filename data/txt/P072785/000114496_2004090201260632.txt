RE: Third Structural Adjustment Credit  (Credit No. 3582 -MLI) 
Amendment to the Development Credit Agreement
Excellency, 
 
We refer to the Development Credit Agreement (the “Agreement”) between the Republic 
of Mali and the International Development Association (the “Association”), dated December 12, 
2001, and recent discussions we have had concerning the interest of your government to achieve 
disbursement of the second tranche of said Credit before the end of this fiscal year. You proposed 
a
change in the conditonalities of the second and third tranches. We are pleased to confirm the 
Association's approval to this request – subject to some revisions as discussed -  and agree to 
amend the Agreement as follows: 
 
1.  
In Part B: Specific Conditions for the release of the Second Tranche, paragraph 1. is 
deleted and the subsequent paragraphs are renumbered accordingly; 
 
2. 
In Part C: Specific Conditions for the release of the Third Tranche, Paragraphs 1 and 2. are 
deleted and replaced by the following words, and the remaining paragraph is renumbered 
paragraph “2” : 
 
“The Borrower has: 
 
1. 
brought to the point of sale: 
 
(a) 
not less than 84% of HUICOMA’s shares, pursuant to paragraph 13 (ii) of the 
Development Policy Letter; and 
 
(b) 
all assets belonging to CMDT and OHVN in the OHVN Zone pursuant to 
paragraph 7 (ii) of the Development Policy Letter; “ 
 
All other provisions of the Development Credit Agreement except as amended herein, 
shall remain in full force and effect.
