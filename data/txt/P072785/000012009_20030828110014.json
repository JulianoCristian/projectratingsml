reform\n            agenda, notably the following priority reform areas: a)\n            public expenditure reforms aimed specifically at advancing\n            the Government's poverty reduction objectives; and, b)\n            recovery and restructuring of the cotton sector to restore\n            positive economic growth. Satisfactory progress of the\n            reform program, and of the macroeconomic policy framework\n            grant the release of the third tranche, conditional to the\n            privatization of two cotton sector companies - Office de la\n            Haute Vallee du Niger, and Huilerie Cotonniere du Mali -\n            and, on progress in preparing the medium term expenditure\n            frameworks, particularly for the education, and health\n            sectors. All conditions for the release of the Third Tranche\n            have been met, being the execution of the program broadly\n            satisfactory, thus the tranche amount is now available for disbursement."}, "docdt": "2003-08-18T00:00:00Z"}
