3. Program Description


3.a      A new Government took over in mid-2001 and, with the support from the Bank, defined a
medium-term program whose specific objectives were: (a) the achievement of average annual growth
rates of 4.5-5.0% during 2002-05; (b) the reduction of the poverty rate by half of its 2001 level by 2005;
and (c) the reduction of the unemployment rate from 18.1% in 2001 to 12-14% in 2005. The strategy to
achieve these objectives focused on two main themes: (a) private sector investment and productivity as
the engine of growth; and (b) empowerment as the mechanism to ensure wide participation in anticipated
growth.


         The program to achieve the objectives and implement the strategy has five major pillars:


         · Sustaining structural reforms in the enterprise sector with emphasis on the restructuring of
             the energy, railway, telecommunications, and water sectors;
         · Establishing a market-friendly business environment, focusing on entry and exit policies,
             regulatory costs, delivery of public services, competition, and strengthening of market
             institutions;
         · Deepening the financial sector, addressing the constraints to increased lending by the banking
             system and the development of financial markets;
         · Improving public sector governance, including implementing the anti-corruption strategy,
             strengthening local governments, and reforming public administration and the judiciary;
         · Investing in human capital and strengthening social programs, focusing on education, health,
             and pension reforms and social assistance effectiveness.


         The abovementioned structural and institutional reforms were accompanied by a macroeconomic
program supported by an IMF arrangement.


3.b.     The PAL series was designed as a comprehensive effort to support the components of the
Government's medium-term program described above, focusing on the design and implementation of
policies and sector programs, and the strengthening of markets and institutions. Each PAL intervention


                                                           - 2 -

would focus on specific themes, while at the same time sustaining reforms which began during previous
PALs, and preparing reforms to be implemented in succeeding PALs. The main thematic areas are: (a)
structural, business environment and financial sector reform in PAL-1; (b) public sector governance in
PAL-2; and (c) human development and social agenda in PAL-3.

4. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs


        In terms of program objectives: (a) growth rates have been on target; (b) progress in the reduction
in poverty rate is still to be confirmed; and (c) unemployment has decreased from 18.1% in 2001 to
14.3% in 2003. In addition, international financial markets have responded favorably to the achievements
of the reform program. In the summer of 2003, Bulgaria's credit rating was upgraded with two rating
agencies assigning investment grade rating to long term local currency debt. Spreads of Brady and Euro
bonds are continuing to decline.

        In terms of results by pillar, there has been notable progress in Pillars 1-3, which were the areas
of focus of PAL-1:

             · Pillar 1: (a) privatization of the Savings Bank and the Bulgarian Telecommunications
                 Company; (b) reduction in energy intensity by 13% between 2001 and 2003; (c)
                 reduction in subsidies to district heating companies by half between 2001 and 2003; and
                 (d) reduction in telephone connection time from 21 months in 2001 to two months in
                 2003.

             · Pillar 2: (a) FDI inflows at $1.4 billion in 2003 ­ of which about 30% were privatization
                 receipts ­ the highest among CEECs in terms of FDI as percent of GDP; (b) the private
                 sector share of GDP in Bulgaria was about 65% in 2002; and (c) 21% reduction of
                 number of regulatory regimes - the impact on cost of doing businesses is being evaluated
                 by the ongoing second Administrative and Regulatory Cost Survey.

             · Pillar 3: (a) private sector share of banking assets increased from 85% at end-2002 to
                 98% at end-2003; (b) credit to private sector as percent of GDP increased from 19% in
                 2002 to 27% in 2003; and (c) there has been no deterioration the banking system
                 prudential indicators which have been satisfactory.

        The progress in Pillars 4 and 5 has mainly been in terms of the completion of important actions,
with more concrete results or outcomes expected beginning 2005:

             · Pillar 4: (a) establishment of policy and legislative framework for merit-basis and
                 depoliticization of the civil service; (b) introduction of performance related pay and
                 performance evaluation system; and (c) establishment of legislative framework for
                 improving accountability, selection, and performance appraisal of judges.

             · Pillar 5: (a) implementation of measures to improve coverage and efficiency of social
                 assistance programs; (b) NHIF administrative costs kept at below 3% of revenues; (c)
                 increase in mandatory contribution to the second pillar of the pension reform.

        The Second Programmatic Adjustment Loan was approved by the Board on June 10, 2004. PAL-
2 is designed as a two tranche operation to take into account the new privatization strategy for
Bulgartabac. There were several additional actions completed in PAL-2 under Pillar 4 which were not
identified during PAL-1.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome


        Legal challenges led to a delay in the privatization of Bulgartabac. Nonetheless, the
Government remains committed to the Bulgartabac privatization and has begun implementation of a new
strategy which is being monitored by the PAL program. The privatization of the Bulgarian
Telecommunications Company, which was also a subject of a legal challenge, has been successfully
completed.

        A major Government reorganization in mid-2003 did not cause a substantial disruption to
the program. PAL-2 had a new lead counterpart who assured the Bank that the reforms articulated in the
PAL-1 document would be sustained. Nonetheless, there were delays in certain actions envisioned in the
program as new officials took over certain offices. The Inter-ministerial Working Group for Regulatory
Reform will have to be revitalized to ensure implementation of the program of regulatory reform, and
should consider the inclusion of private sector representatives.

        Program coordination within the Government is a critical success factor to program
outcomes. The Council for Economic Policy (formerly the Council for Structural Policy) under the
Council of Ministers has been effective in managing the program and coordinating among different public
sector institutions. The Directorate for European Integration and Relations with IFIs has been performed
the secretariat function effectively. To manage the expanded public sector governance pillar, the CoM
established a Council for State Administration Modernization under PAL-2. The public administration
reforms of PAL-2 also helped improve policy and program coordination.

        Donor coordination remains important to the implementation of the program. The PAL-1
design placed the lead role for donor coordination with the Government. To strengthen this role, the
Government revised its arrangements by introducing in December 2003 certain amendments to the
Council for Structural Policy that transformed it to a Council for Economic Policy and codified its lead
role in donor coordination. The amendments also established sector working groups under the oversight
of the Deputy Prime Ministers. Nonetheless, this is one area where there could be more improvement.

        Sustained macroeconomic and financial stability will continue to be a pre-requisite for the
PAL program. The Fund program has been an effective complement to the PAL and a new arrangement
is currently being negotiated. The PAL program supports macroeconomic and financial stability through
reforms that rationalize expenditures and advance structural and institutional reforms.

        Mitigation of adverse social and economic impact of certain reforms will continue to be part
of PAL program. The increases in consumer electricity prices ­ about 35% over the past two years ­
were accompanied by social mitigation measures. A Poverty and Social Impact Analysis has been
conducted on the impact of the privatization of Bulgartabac on tobacco farmers, and programs to cushion
the impact are under development. A similar PSIA has been made on the railway reforms.



6. Bank and Borrower Performance


        Bank performance was highly satisfactory. PAL-1 was prepared by the country team (as
opposed to a separate PAL team) with significant contributions by country office staff, which played a
crucial role in both substance (by providing local knowledge) and coordination (both with the
Government and HQ). Cross sectoral cooperation and coordination have been effective. The operation



                                                    - 4 -

complied with all relevant Bank environmental and business policies. While OP4.01 does not apply,
PAL-1 had an environmental component; in addition, the Environment and Privatization Support
Adjustment Loan provided the framework for environment considerations covering the privatization
program.

         Borrower performance was highly satisfactory. The new Government had to establish
organizational arrangements to ensure effective management of the PAL program which involved 13
ministries and 9 offices and agencies. The role played by the Council of Structural Policy (which was
recently transformed into the Council for Economic Policy) and the support provided by the Secretariat
were noteworthy. Despite the large number of actions to be undertaken, the Government was able to
complete the PAL-1 actions in about 12 months.


7. Findings and Implications for Subsequent Operation(s) in Series


         Establishing and maintaining an effective coordination mechanism in the Government is a
key success factor for the PAL. The Council for Economic Policy as the focal point of coordination has
been effective, especially with the experience gained so far. Subsequent PALs should continue using the
Council for program coordination.


         An effective communications strategy would help to ensure buy-in of the reforms. With
positive outcomes from the program, a government led communications effort would help reach several
segments of the internal stakeholders who may be uninformed of the program. There has been more
success with the external (international) audience.


         Coordination and collaboration among sector units in the region will continue to be a major
determinant of the effectiveness of the PAL program. Because the PAL uses a multi-sectoral approach
to growth issues, there is need for enhanced team effort. The PAL TTL will have to establish appropriate
methodologies for team building.


         The system for monitoring and evaluation will have to be implemented and enhanced. The
current program for M&E training covering relevant Bank and Government staff is an important
initiative. Timely implementation of survey instruments (e.g. Administrative and Regulatory Cost
Survey) and assessments (Poverty and Private Sector Development) would provide inputs towards
appropriate adjustments to the program.


         There should be clarity in Bank-Fund relations. The PAL Program Document contains an
annex that describes the division of work between the Bank and the Fund. Future PALs should ensure
that there continues to be clarity in this relationship.
