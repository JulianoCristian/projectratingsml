conveyed\n            regarding the project outcome, sustainability, and\n            institutional development impacts, achieved through highly\n            satisfactory performances by the Bank, and Borrower. This\n            simplified Implementation Completion Report (ICR) offers\n            major factors affecting implementation, and outcome as\n            follows. Despite the fact that legal challenges led to a\n            delay in the privatization of Bulgartabac, the government\n            remains committed to privatization, and, in other cases\n            privatization have been successfully completed. Nonetheless,\n            certain delays in program actions suggest that the\n            Inter-ministerial Working Group for Regulatory Reform, will\n            have to be revitalized to ensure implementation of the\n            reform program, which should consider the inclusion of\n            private sector representatives. Other lessons reinforce the\n            importance of ensuring the program coordination within the\n            Government, as a critical success factor to program\n            outcomes; donor coordination as a remaining element to the\n            implementation of the program; a sustained macroeconomic,\n            and financial stability, as a pre-requisite for the\n            continuity of the program; the rationalization of\n            expenditures, and advancement of structural and\n            institutional reforms; and, mitigation of adverse social and\n            economic impacts of certain reforms, as a continual part of\n            the program."}, "docdt": "2004-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
