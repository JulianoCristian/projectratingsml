Lessons are\n            divided in two sections, a) those relevant to program\n            development prior to project effectiveness, and, b) those\n            applicable during program implementation. Prior to project\n            effectiveness, lessons address the need to minimize the time\n            period between appraisal, and effectiveness, noting the\n            project should have begun with a review of activities, and\n            components focused on sectoral priorities; the need to\n            ensure appropriate counterpart funding, to facilitate\n            effectiveness, through the availability of resources; while\n            given the weak implementation capacity of the public sector,\n            consideration should be given to alternative management\n            strategies, based on adequate assessment of institutional\n            capacity; and the development and application of effective\n            evaluation strategies. During implementation, Government\n            commitment should be ensured, through demonstrated\n            improvements to the health sector. Moreover, stronger\n            attention should be paid to the achievement of the\n            project's development objectives. This was evidenced in\n            the overly ambitious development objectives, without an\n            established institutional analysis to support objectives,\n            nor to gauge program implementation, experienced through the\n            weak performance indicators, or lack thereof. However, it is\n            fair to say that flexibility allowed support for the health\n            sector reforms, and the Drug Fund. Finally the lack of\n            training hindered the appropriate use of medical equipment\n            and technology, which will be further jeopardized if\n            operating budgets are not ensured."}, "docdt": "2002-09-16T00:00:00Z"}
