EIXiSYJ    ANDS AKQ%RMWEDAIO  OF THE PRID=EN
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE ECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TQ THE REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
FOR A FA4ILY HEALTH PRWJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed credit to the Republic of Yemen for SDR 18.8 million (US$26.6
million equivalent) to help finance a project for family health. The credit
would be extended at standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years.
2.   Backgrgun.   Yemen's health status indicators depict serious problems.
The current population is 13.1 million (1992), with the growth rAte a high 3.6
percent; life expectancy at 48 years is 14 years less than the average for
low-income countries, 30 years less than that for industrialized countries;
maternal mortality, at 1,000 deaths per 100,000 births, is 100 times that of
industrialized countries; infant mortality, at 124 per 1,000 live births, is a
reflection of the factors affecting maternal mortality cnd is also very high
compared to other countries of similar socio-economic development. The
incidence of endemic diseases is high, reflecting the lack of preventive
health services, including effective health education programs, unsafe
drinking water, and poor sanitation facilities.
3.    The Ministry of Public Health (MbOPH) is responsible for managing the
health care system. Health services in major urban centers, where about 22
percent of the population lives, are provided by specialized civilian and
military hospitals (for tertiary care) and by a thriving private medical
practice. Provision of health services outside of the major urban centers
rests with the primary health care (PHC) system of 949 health units in
villages, supported by 345 health centers in larger towns; 60 district
hospitals, the point of referral for the primary health care network, provide
secondary care. The country is divided into 245 districts which cover large
geographic areas; 35 percent of the districts have a catcbment population of
over 50,000 people.
4.    Government policies give highest priority to improving the quality and
quantity of basic curative services and preventive activities, and particular
attention is being given to the most vulnerable groups of the population:
women of reproductive age and children.  Implementation of these policies is,
however, hampered by serious constraints. Sector administration is highly
centralized in Sansa and Aden and weak at governorate and district levels.
Financial resources from the government budget are largely inadequate, and
much improvement is needed in the coordination of donor assistance. Health
care delivery is unsatisfactory, in terms of both the quality of services and
their coverage. Poor quality of services is due to various weaknesses ranging
from the lack of qualified staff and the shortage of essential drugs to the
poor condition of the physical infrastructure. The result is inappropriate
utilization of the health care delivery system, as patients tend to bypass
lower-level facilities, which are generally poorly equipped and staffed, in
favor of hospitals. As for coverage, physical accessibility, only 45 percent
of the population is served by the existing health care delivery system.



5.   Although the government objective to achieve greater coverage of the
health care delivery system is fully justified in the long-term, improved
quality of existing services deserves higher priority in the short-term. At
the same time, however, innovative, cost-effective approaches to service
delivery need to be developed to reach the large number of small, isolated
communities scattered throughout the country.
6.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. The previous IDA projects aimed at
developing management and training capacity while establishing the basic
infrastructure for health care delivery. The proposed project represents
continuity with those aims by specifically focusing, on improving three key
areas: health staff training and development, health education, and management
of medicul supplies. These areas are directly relevant to the needs of the
population groups at highest risk, particularly among the rural poor. As to
health infrastructure. tais project represents a departure from the previous
ones because it would focus on improving existing facilities, rather than
constructing new ones, and on upgrading the quality of health services,
especially for women and children, offered at those .acilities. In addition,
the project would initiate limited pilot activities to examine appropriate
ways to improve the coverage of services for remote rural communities.
Assistance to expand the health care delivery system would be considered under
subsequent projects, conditional to improved quality of current services and
based on the lessons learned through the development of outreach services to
be supported by this project.
7.    The proposed project would address key weaknesses that affect sector
performance nation-wide while improving quality of service delivtery in
selected rural districts. As an initial step toward improving coverage, pilot
activities would be undertaken in two districts to examine ways to provide PHC
to remote rural communities. The project also presents opportunities for
strengthening donor coordination in the sector. In primary health care
services, the proposed project would complement other-donor assistance by
selecting only those areas (health districts) with no significant support from
any other donor. In health education, the project would complement the
efforts of other donors by targeting assistance in areas not sufficiently
covered, i.e., messages on maternal health and in women's participation in the
health sector. And in the pharmaceutical subsector, the project would, in
concert with bilate;.ll and other international donors, support the development
of a single national drug procurement and distribution system. IDA presence
in the sector and continuing dialogue with the Government are significant
considerations in some donors' decision to continue with their own assistance
programs.
8.    Project Obieetives.  The proposed project would assist the HOPH in
contributing to the implementation of the national population policy,
articulated in 1991, to reduce fertility and maternal and infant mortality.
The objectives of the proposed project are: (i) to improve the access to, and
quality of, maternal-child health and family planning (NCH/FP) services within
the PHC system; and (i1) to improve management effectiveness in the health
sector more broadly.
9.    Project DeserLition,  The projeet includes three interrelated
components: (i) strengthening the delivery of NCH/FP services in seven



- 3 -
districts in rural areas through the rehabilitation of district hospitals,
health centers, and health units, establishment of referral and supervision
systems, and conducting pilot activities; (ii) enhancement of training and
health education programs sector-wide by increasing the capacity of existing
health training institutes, curriculum improvement, strengthening training
supervision, and supporting the Government's program for the delivery of
media-bornm messages ln maternal health, family planning and the role of women
in the health sector and the delivery of health education messages through
interpersonal means; and (iii) improvement of sector management through the
development of a health information system, strengthening the research
capacity of the OPH, strengthening the pharmaceutical logistics system, and
strengthening the maintenance and procurement capacity of the MOPH.
10.   Proleet Coat and Financing.  The total project cost is estimated at
US$30.2 million equivalent, of which US$22.2 million equivalent (73 percent of
the project cost) is the foreign exchange component. The proposed IDA credit
of SDR 18.8 million (US$26.6 million equivalent) will finance about 90 percent
of the total project cost excluding taxes and duties. The Government will
finance US$3.2 million equivalent. Project costs and financing plan are
presented in Schedule A. The amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursement, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. The
timetable of key processing events is in Schedule C, and the status of Bank
Group operations in Yemen is in Schedule D. A map of Yemen is also attached.
The Staff Appraisal Report. (Report No. 11900-YEM) for the project is being
circulated separately.
11.  Project Implementation.  The project would be implemented by the OPH
over a period of six years and disbursed over the period 1994-2000. Project
implementation would be overseen by a Project Coordinating Committee (PCC)
c-haired by the Vice Minister and composed of key MOPH officials, each
responsible for a major project activity, and a representative from the
Ministry of Planning and Development (NOPD). The PCC would be assisted in
overall project coordination by the existing Project Management Office (PMO)
which would serve as secretariat to the PCC. The PMO would monitor project
performance, accounts, expenditures, costs, and compliance with IDA
Guidelines; consolidate progress reports; and serve as the NOPH contact agency
with IDA. Implementation of project components would be the responsibility of
existing OPH line departments at the central level, strengthened with the
appropriate technical assistance services where necessary; in the project
areas, implementation would be the responsibility of training-supervision and
district management teams.
12.  Project SustainabiLity.  The  OPH has played an integral role in the
analysis and development of the project, and project ownership by those
responsible for implementation is high. Further, the project components would
be implemented by regular units of the 1OPH, ensuring operational continuity
and institutional memory. Project districts have been selected on the basis
of accessibility, population catchment area, existence of facilities, and
availability of staff--factors that contribute to the maintenance of sustained
operations. In addition, to the extent possible, the district management
teams would be recruited from regular NOPH staff at local levels. While
incremental recurrent costs are deemed sustainable, Government investments are



-4-
needed to maintain an acceptable supply of essential drugs in public health
facilities in the field.
13. Lessons Learned from Previous IDA I2volvement. Of the four projects in
the health sector since 1982, two (amounting to US$18.7 million in IDA
credits) have been completed, the two others (amounting to US$19.5 million in
IDA credits) are ongoing.. For the northern governorates, the First Health
Project (Credit 1294-YAR), completed in 1989, financed the construction of
essential infrastructure and the training of central MOPH management staff;
the ongoing Health Sector Development Project (Credit 2151-YEN) is financing
the construction of training institutes, drug warehouses in selected
governorates, and medical equipment maintenance workshops. For the southern
governorates, the Health Development Project (Credit 1377-YDR), successfully
completed in 1989, established PHC facilities in Abyan, Lshej, and Hadramout;
the ongoing Second Health Development Project (Credit 1972-YEN) is
constructing PHC facilities in Aden, Shabwa, and Mahra.
14.   The principal lesson learned from the First Health Project was that
creating a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) outside of the mainstream MOPH
management structure isolates the PIU and project activities. In the proposed
project, NOPH management has been involved in all phases of project
development (fostering ownership of the project), and regular NOPH management
will constitute project management.  The principal lessons learned. from the
Health Development Project were that project design should be simple, and
having many cofinaciers complicates implementation of this type of project.
The design of the proposed project is for IDA financing alone, without
cofinaciers, but the proposed project has developed a simple methodology for
selecting health districts in order of priority, that could be adopted by
other donor agencies wishing to assist the sector on the basis of objectives
similar to those of the project. Moreover, project component activities are
coordinated with other-donor assistance, e.g., WHO and other bilateral
programs in pharmaceuticals, and UNICEF and UNFPA programs in health
education.
15. Agreements Reached. Agreement has been reached with the Government on:
(1) the Government's provision of budgetary allocations for essential drugs;
(ii) priority in the selection of trainees and fellows to be given to staff
and key managers, especially women, from the districts covered under the
project; (iii) a National Drug Policy to be developed by June 30, 1993 and
incorporated into the National Health Policy, which would be submitted to the
Ministerial Council during FY94; an essential drugs list to be adopted by
December 31, 1994; (iv) plans for follow-up actions of the project's pilot
activities and for implementing a policy on cost recovery for essential drugs.
16. Environmntal Apaects. The project is classified under the
Environmental Category C: "No appreciable environmental impact". In the
construction and essential drugs components of the project, measures will be
taken to ensure that materials are selected, stored and used (and wastes are
disposed of) in environmentally sound ways.
17. Program Objective Categories. This project will improve the quality of
existing health services generally; specifically, it will improve the health
conditions of people deprived of adequate health services, targeting women of



-5-
reproductive age and children, almost all of whom are poor. The project will
also provide incentives for women to become providers of health care. The
longer-term effects of reduced fertility and lower population growth rates
should help to reduce disparities in living standards, alleviate poverty, and
moderate the deterioration of the environment.
18.   Project Aenefits.  The direct and immediate benefits of the project
which would be expected during the project implementation period would be: (i)
improved quality and coverage of health care services for about 906,000 people
residing in the seven project districts (especially at-risk rural
populations); (ii) greater number of trained staff as some 7,000 personnel
would be trained under the training component; and (iii) institutional
development at both central and district levels of the MOPH. Innentives to
attract and retain women as health care providers would include the
opportunity to participate in the fellowship program and the provision of
housing at the health centers in the seven project districts. The longer-term
benefits of the project would be the establishment of a basis for more rapid
expansion of quality health care coverage and possible models for a better
delivery system based on the experience in the seven project districts and the
pilot activities. Finally, the project can well be the springboard for
mounting future, possibly sector-wide, projects.
19.   Risk&.  The principal risks are as follows.  (i) The recruitment and
retention of women as health care providers in the requisite numbers may not
be realized, for cultural and socio-economic reasons. This risk would be
minimized by strengthening health education messages which focus on women's
participation in the health sector and by providing incentives to women to
encourage their participation in training (fellowships) and to work in -heir
own communities (housing).  Moreover, the pilot activity on coaunity
participation would include an assessment of ways in which the community might
support women's participation in the delivery of services. (ii) There could
also be resistance to the implementation of a national drug program because of
a lucrative black market. The Government's commitment to a national program
as expressed through the passage of appropriate legislation and the support of
IDA and other donors committed to the development of a national program would
mitigate the effects of this risk. (iii) The Government may not be able to
finance the cost of maintaining facilities and equipment and of essential
drugs on a nation-wide basis. In addition to the assurances contained in the
project, the dialogue between IDA and the Government would be expected to
result in additional allocation of resources to the health sector as well as
more effective utilization of resources allocated to the sector.
20.   Recommenda. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Sxecutive Directors approve it.
