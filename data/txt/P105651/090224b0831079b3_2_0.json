In this\n            context, the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) planned to\n            increase access to electricity to 50 percent in five years,\n            under the universal access expansion program (UAEP), which\n            will be implemented by the state-owned utility Ethiopian\n            electric power corporation (EEPCo). However, despite the\n            government\u2019s efforts to expand the hydro-generation capacity\n            and the electricity network, the pace of access to\n            electricity services remained slow. In 2008, a global\n            partnership on output-based aid (GPOBA) grant of 8 million\n            dollars was signed to accelerate the pace of connections\n            among grid customers by making the connection charge\n            affordable to the poor population through a credit scheme. A\n            socio-economic assessment funded by GPOBA suggests that\n            living and working conditions in the households benefiting\n            from electricity connections under the project have\n            generally improved. Financial and institutional arrangements\n            to cover internal wiring can be considered for future\n            electricity access projects under the OBA model."}, "docdt": "2015-06-01T04:09:02Z"}
