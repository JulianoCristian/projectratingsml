ETHIOPIA ELECTRICITY ACCESS RURAL EXPANSION PROJECT PHASE II

     GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP ON OUTPUT-BASED AID (GPOBA) GRANT

                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER




SUMMARY
1.     The restructuring paper recommends the extension of the closing date for the
Grant Agreement (GA) of the Ethiopia Electricity Access Rural Expansion Project, Phase
II – Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid Grant (the "GPOBA Grant"), from
December 31, 2011 until June 30, 2013 and to change the disbursement schedule of the
subsidy provided to the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo) under the Grant.
The GPOBA Grant is financed by the Department for International Development (DFID
– TF092600-ET) and the Swedish International Cooperation Agency (SIDA – TF092601-
ET) trust funds, which will be extended accordingly.

2.      The Grant is being extended in order to allow the disbursement of the US$8.0
million grant with the goal of facilitating grid connections for 228,571 poor households in
rural areas and the distribution of 457,142 compact fluorescent energy efficient lamps
(CFLs). The proposed disbursement schedule of the subsidy is expected to provide
incentives to the utility to proceed with an accelerated pace of electrification under the
GPOBA.



PROJECT STATUS
3.      The Grant Agreement was signed on October 30, 2008 (became effective on May
31, 2009) with a closing date of December 31, 2011. The GPOBA Grant implementation
was delayed for about two years due to a major supply crisis that hit Ethiopia from
September 2008 until end of 2010. The power crisis was caused by a combination of poor
hydrology affecting the impounding of Tekeze hydro plant, delays in commissioning of
Gibe II, and subsequently an accident in the tunnel of this plant. To bridge the supply-
demand gap, EEPCo took several actions. Expensive diesel generation had to be leased,
and a significant energy efficiency improvement program had to be carried out, the latter
with the support of the World Bank. Despite these measures, load shedding became
unavoidable. Some energy-intensive industries, such as cement factories, were instructed
to stop production. The crisis had a major impact on the economy of the country.

4.      Due to this backdrop of power shortage, the government decided to impose a
moratorium on residential connections to ease the supply crisis, thus significantly slowing
the pace of electrification. The moratorium policy delayed the implementation of all
access expansion programs, including the GPOBA. The number of connections dropped
significantly during the moratorium, as shown in the following chart.

Number of customers connected per Fiscal Year1




5.      After commissioning of Tekeze (300 MW), Gibe II (420 MW) and Beles (460
MW), the power crisis ended in late 2010. Since then, EEPCo has been actively working
to reduce the large backlog of about 450-500 thousand connections accumulated over a
two-year period. During the first six months of 2011, priority was given to a significant
number of customers that paid the full connection charge. This backlog further delayed
the implementation of the GPOBA Grant that provides five-year loans to poor customers,
with only 20% upfront payment. However, since June 2011, EEPCo has proven its
readiness for the implementation of the GPOBA and procured basic materials. About
100,000 energy meters and all CFLs are already secured to support the implementation of
the program. Moreover, the utility is pursuing an active information campaign on the
GPOBA Grant for poor communities through its regional offices, in cooperation with the
local administration. As a result, EEPCo has received more than 40,736 applications to
date for connections under the GPOBA Grant, has signed more than 19,087 contracts
with effectuated down payment (20% of the connection charge), and connected more
than 12,018 households. Even during the rainy season (July-August 2011), EEPCo
connected a significant number of households.

6.     Due to the moratorium on connections, the implementation of the GPOBA Grant
has been subject to an unfavorable rating. The progress towards achievement of the PDO
and overall Implementation Progress (IP) were rated Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU) in
March 2011. However, taking into consideration the implementation progress since June
2011, reflected in a significant number of connections of poor households to the grid, the
PDO and IP rating have been upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory (MS) as of November
2011.

7.      Disbursements under the Grant are based on the physical verification of the
outputs by an Independent Verification Agent (IVA), so there is some delay between
actual connections and disbursements. The IVA firm has been hired by the Bank to
pursue three tasks: a) verify and certify project deliverables as evidence of achievement
of the outputs claimed; b) obtain information on the electricity market in selected towns
and villages; c) assess the socio-economic and gender impact of electrification in selected
towns and villages. The IVA prepares the output verification reports that represent the
basis for disbursements.

8.     The IVA has completed the first verification of connections. Therefore, it is
expected that EEPCo will submit the first withdrawal application in December 2011.



PROPOSED CHANGES
Closing date

9.     The paper recommends the extension of the closing date of the GPOBA Grant
from December 31, 2011, until June 30, 2013, which would allow access of poor
households in rural towns and villages to electricity service by assisting EEPCo in its
connection charge financing program, extending five-year, interest-free loans to low-
income customers to make access to electricity affordable. This would be the first
extension of the project.

10.     The Government of Ethiopia (GoE) attaches high priority to the provision of
adequate and cost-effective electricity supply and is rapidly scaling up electricity
coverage and access for all its citizens. The stated goal of the new Growth and
Transformation Plan (GTP) for FY2011-15 is to increase electricity service coverage
from the current coverage rate of 41%2 to 75% (coverage rate is measured as a
percentage of towns and villages with access to low-voltage distribution network)
amounting to 4 million consumers and to achieve power-generating capacity of 8,000
MW by 2015. By the end of June 2011, the total number of customers connected to the
grid is estimated at 2 million and the installed power-generation capacity installed is
estimated at 2,000 MW.

11.     The GPOBA Grant is targeting the poor households from rural areas, primarily
those who cannot afford to pay the full connection charge to benefit from electricity
service. Without this financing scheme designed under the GPOBA Grant, a significant
segment of poor population in rural areas (representing about 10% of EEPCo’s target for
the upcoming years) will not be able to benefit of electricity service due to high
connection charges. In addition, the GPOBA Grant would allow the poor households to
have access to CFLs (2 CFLs per household) that would ensure affordable bills and
promote energy efficiency. The increased access to electricity will improve the quality of
life, enhance educational and health services, and provide income-generating
opportunities. Therefore, the implementation of the program will support the GoE’s

    Total percentage of population actually connected to the grid is about 14%.

access scale-up objective and it is in line with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS),
Africa Region Strategy, and the Energy Strategy of the Bank. Moreover, extension of the
project would allow piloting innovative OBA approaches aimed at increasing access of
the poor to electricity that could be scaled up in the future to support the network
densification efforts of the utility, which otherwise may not have economic incentives to
reach the low-income population in rural areas.

12.      The Project objectives continue to be achievable. Despite the implementation
challenges caused by the moratorium, EEPCo has achieved satisfactory results over the
last six months, proceeding with connections during the rainy season (July-August 2011)
and with an accelerated pace of electrification during September-October 2011.
Moreover, EEPCo’s management has expressed commitment to the implementation of
the GPOBA Grant.

13.    The GPOBA’s Panel of Experts (PoE) has been informed on the proposed
extension of the closing date. This will be the first extension of the project.

14.     The following action plan has been agreed with EEPCo for the implementation of
the project in the proposed timeframe:

   -   Procurement of basic materials for the implementation of the GPOBA project.
       The procurement of additional meters is necessary to avoid potential
       implementation delays in the future since the GPOBA Grant requires metered
       connection.

   -   Information campaign on the GPOBA Grant. EEPCo would continue the active
       information campaign on the GPOBA Grant and its socioeconomic benefits.

15.     Taking into consideration the ambitious 2015 access target of the utility and the
significant backlog of connections caused by the moratorium, EEPCo is facing
operational capacity constraints in the implementation of all access programs, including
the GPOBA. Moreover, the company is also involved in the entire supply chain,
including generation and transmission, which compete for management attention. The
Bank supports EEPCo to expand the generation, transmission and distribution capacity
through the ongoing projects. Moreover, the Bank aims at continuing to strengthen
EEPCo’s operational capacity through new projects, currently under preparation: the
Access Expansion and Reinforcement of Electricity Networks Project, the Eastern

Corridor of EAPP (Ethiopia-Kenya transmission line) and Halele-Warabesa Hydropower
Project.

16.    There are no outstanding audit reports from EEPCo.

Disbursement arrangements

17.    The paper proposes a change in the subsidy disbursement schedule ratio
connections/three successful billing cycles from 50/50 to 80/20, which is expected to
provide incentives to EEPCo to proceed with an accelerated pace of electrification under
the GPOBA.

18.     Under the current arrangement of the GPOBA Grant, EEPCo has to use its own
capital to connect customers to the grid and it receives a subsidy of $35 per connection
(covering the cost of financing pertaining to the five-year loan for the connection charge
and two CFLs) in two tranches: 1) 50% based upon physical verification of the outputs
and 2) 50% after three successive billing cycles, which include issuing bills that reflect
metered consumption and outstanding debts with the utility (consumption and
amortization of the loans). Due to the verification process required for disbursement
under GPOBA, there is a delay between actual connections and the payment of the first
part of the subsidy per outputs that averages about three months and between actual
connections and the payment of the second part of the subsidy per three successful billing
cycles that averages about six months. It is proposed to change the subsidy disbursement
schedule as follows: 1) - 80% based upon physical verification of the outputs and 2) -
20% after three successive billing cycles, which include bills being issued reflecting
metered consumption and outstanding debts with the utility (consumption and
amortization of the loans). The proposed subsidy disbursement schedule
connections/three successful billing cycles – 80/20 would advance the payment to EEPCo
and provide available funds necessary for procuring materials to speed up the access
scale-up programs.

19.     The proposed subsidy disbursement schedule is expected to expedite connections
of poor households to the grid under the GPOBA Grant. Due to the backlog of
connections accumulated over the moratorium period and the large access plan for the
upcoming years, there is a significant demand for electricity service coming from both
households that can pay the full connection charge (average $75) upfront and lower-
income households that can only afford to pay the connection charges in several
installments (the main target of the GPOBA Grant). Therefore, incentives to the utility
would be important to expedite connections under the GPOBA and reach the target of
228,571 connections by the new proposed closing date.
