                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The main objective of the GPOBA project is to increase access to electricity in rural towns and villages with grid-access, by assisting EEPCo in its connection fee
                         financing program, extending loan tenors of five years to poor household customers. In addition, the GPOBA grant will finance two energy efficient Compact Fluorescent
                         Lamps (CFLs) for poor households (hhs). Those CFLs will be delivered as part of the connection package to both ensure an affordable bill for hhs and promote energy
                         efficiency. The increased access to electricity will improve the quality of life, enhance educational services, and provide income-generating opportunities.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project implementation was affected by the moratorium imposed by the government from 2008 to 2010 to connect new consumers. This was in response to the severe electricity
                         supply shortage caused by drought and delay in power plant construction. As this project agreement was signed in October 2008, EEPCO could never start the project until the
                         moratorium was lifted in late 2010, after the power supply situation improved. Over the two years of the moratorium, the backlog of consumers who applied for connection grew to
                         several hundred thousand and, following the lifting of the moratorium, EEPCO initially concentrated on connecting the commercial and industrial consumers, as well as households
                         who paid the connection costs in advance. Since June 2011, EEPCO started to connect poor consumers eligible under GPOBA project. As of April 18, 2012, a total of 24,703

                         households have been connected under the GPOBA Project. EEPCO has received about 52,689 applications for connection under GPOBA and has signed agreements with 31,170
                         customers for connections.

                         The Independent Verification Agent (IVA) completed the first verification of connections (7,079) in December 2011. The first disbursement took place based on the output verification

                         report submitted by IVA after the first verification. The second verification of connections (about 14,135) takes place during April 23- June 10, 2012.

                         At the request of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MOFED), the Bank approved the extension of the closing date from December 31, 2011 until June 30, 2013 to
                         allow the client reach the final target of 228,571 customers under this project. The subsidy disbursement schedule connections/three successful billing cycles was changed from
                         50/50/ to 80/20. The current disbursement schedule is the following: 1) - 80% based upon physical verification of the outputs and 2) - 20% after three successive billing cycles, which
                         include bills being issued reflecting metered consumption and outstanding debts with the utility (consumption and amortization of the loans).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The moratorium imposed on new connections from 2008 to 2010, due to the severe power supply crisis, delayed project implementation. After the supply situation improved, the
                         moratorium was lifted and, as of April 18, 2012, a total of 24,703 households have been connected under the GPOBA Project. EEPCO has received about 52,689 applications for
                         connection under GPOBA and has signed agreements with 31,170 customers for connections.

                         The Independent Verification Agent (IVA) completed the first verification of connections (7,079) in December 2011. The first disbursement took place based on the output verification
                         report submitted by IVA after the first verification. The second verification of connections (about 14,135 connections) takes place during April 23- June 10, 2012.

                         At the request of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MOFED), the Bank approved the extension of the closing date from December 31, 2011 until June 30, 2013.
