                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The main objective of the GPOBA project is to increase access to electricity in rural towns and villages with grid-access, by assisting EEPCo in its connection
                         fee financing program, extending loan tenors of five years to poor household customers. In addition, the GPOBA grant will finance two energy efficient
                         Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) for poor households (hhs). Those CFLs will be delivered as part of the connection package to both ensure an affordable bill
                         for hhs and promote energy efficiency. The increased access to electricity will improve the quality of life, enhance educational services, and provide income-
                         generating opportunities.
