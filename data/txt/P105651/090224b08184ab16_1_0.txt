                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The main objective of the GPOBA project is to increase access to electricity in rural towns and villages with grid-access, by assisting EEPCo in its connection fee
                         financing program, extending loan tenors of five years to poor household customers. In addition, the GPOBA grant will finance two energy efficient Compact Fluorescent
                         Lamps (CFLs) for poor households (hhs). Those CFLs will be delivered as part of the connection package to both ensure an affordable bill for hhs and promote energy
                         efficiency. The increased access to electricity will improve the quality of life, enhance educational services, and provide income-generating opportunities.

                         The moratorium on new connections, implemented from 2008 to 2010 due to the severe power supply crisis, delayed the project implementation. After the supply situation improved,
                         the moratorium was lifted and, as of today, a total of 24,703 households have been connected under the GPOBA Project.

                         The Independent Verification Agent (IVA) completed the second verification of about 14,135 households connected over the period November 2011-April 2012. The verification of
                         three consecutive billing cycles for about 21,000 households - the second disbursement condition- is ongoing.

                         At the request of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MOFED), the Bank approved the extension of the closing date from December 31, 2011 until June 30, 2013.
