The lessons learned from this project\n            were as followed: Outsourcing connections requires the\n            establishment/enforcement of effective quality control\n            mechanisms; A proper assessment of utility's practice\n            and technical and safety standards of connections is needed\n            to avoid a high rate of connection rectification after\n            verification; Risk of a negative impact of supporting a\n            major connection program on the electricity supply-demand\n            balance should be carefully assessed; In a low capacity\n            environment, even when relying on an existing institution,\n            it is important to assess the institution\u0092s ability to\n            coordinate internally to assure successful implementation of\n            the proposed activity; Since poor rural hhs targeted by\n            GPOBA grants do not provide a significant revenue stream to\n            the service provider, analyzing the government pro-poor\n            access policy and crafting incentives for utilities to reach\n            low income hhs is crucial in project design; All major\n            barriers to access should be addressed by OBA financing; and\n            OBA innovative projects may require flexibility in order to\n            make adjustments to the design during implementation to\n            achieve the PDO in a changing sector or country specific environment."}, "docdt": "2014-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
