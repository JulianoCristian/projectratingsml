7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The main objective of the GPOBA project is to increase access to electricity in rural towns and villages
with grid-access, by assisting EEPCo in its connection fee financing program, extending loan tenors of
five years to poor household customers. In addition, the GPOBA grant will finance two energy efficient
Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) for poor households (hhs). Those CFLs will be delivered as part of the
connection package to both ensure an affordable bill for hhs and promote energy efficiency. The increased
access to electricity will improve the quality of life, enhance educational services, and provide income-
generating opportunities.
