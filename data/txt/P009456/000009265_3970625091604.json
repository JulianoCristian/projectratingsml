imports and\n            rationalize the supply of petroleum products.  To this end,\n            the project will include:  (i) a Refinery Modification\n            Component to enhance the flexibility of the Eastern Refinery\n            Limited facility at Chittagong by bringing about a better\n            match between refinery output and domestic demand for\n            petroleum products.  The project will also include (ii) a\n            first phase LPG Recovery, Storage and Distribution Component\n            designed to establish the institutional framework and\n            facilities to promote the consumption of about 11,000 mTpa\n            of LPG with a view to developing the capability for\n            eventually marketing up to 120,000 mTpa expected to be\n            recovered from natural gas fields in the future."}, "docdt": "1986-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
