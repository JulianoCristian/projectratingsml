Some lessons learned included:\n            diversification is a slow process as farmers are very\n            cautious to adopt new technologies and production systems\n            relying rather on the cropping systems they are certain will\n            provide a sustained income. Government has a potentially\n            positive role to play by giving the appropriate policy\n            support to the diversification process. Their role also\n            entails investing in agricultural research and extension,\n            and rural infrastructure such as roads to facilitate the\n            process. Improved post-harvest handling, storage facilities,\n            and efficient marketing systems are important components of\n            the diversification process and must be put in place to give\n            farmers the confidence to change their cropping patterns.\n            The quality and availability of marketing information\n            services for non-traditional crops must be improved. The\n            identification of specific requirements for market niches\n            and broad scale penetration of foreign markets is also needed."}, "docdt": "1997-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
