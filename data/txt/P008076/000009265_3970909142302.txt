(LOAN 3016/CREDIT 1980-STV)
Preface
1.          This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Agricultural
Rehabilitation and Diversification Project, for which Loan 3016-STV in the amount of
US$1.4 million equivalent and Credit 1980-STV in the amount of SDR 1.1 million
equivalent were approved on January 26, 1989 and made effective on September 8, 1989.
2.          The Loan/Credit Closing Date was December 31, 1996, and the grace
period granted for the submission of final application ended on April 30, 1997. The
undisbursed balance, to be determined after the Bank receives a full accounting of the
Special Account advance, will be canceled.
3.          The ICR was prepared by Samuel Wedderburn, Natural Resources
Management Specialist, Natural Resources Management and Rural Poverty Division,
Country Department III, Latin America and the Caribbean Region. The ICR was
reviewed by Jonathan Parker, Acting Division Chief, Natural Resources Management and
Rural Poverty Division, and Robert Crown, Project Advisor, Country Department III.
4.          Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final
supervision/completion mission in December 1996. It is also based on material in the
project file and discussions with the Borrower's staff and beneficiaries. The Borrower
contributed to the preparation of the ICR with its own evaluation of the project, which is
attached as Annex B.






ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION AND DIVERSIFICATION PROJECT
(LOAN 3016/CREDIT 1980-STV)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
A. Introduction
1.          The Agricultural Rehabilitation and Diversification Project was the first
Bank group operation in the agricultural sector in St. Vincent. It was designed at a time
when continued preferential access to EU markets for bananas was very uncertain, which
made promotion of increased agricultural production together with crop diversification
important goals. The project was also meant to support the Government's on-going land
reform program, which was intended to address the problem of land shortage and
insecurity of tenure among small holders. It was also consistent with the Bank's
development strategy for St. Vincent which encouraged investments to increase
productivity and expand exports.
B. Project Objectives
2.          The project's objectives were to: (a) promote growth and diversification
of agricultural production and exports; (b) improve income distribution; and (c) promote
more efficient use of underutilized and idle scarce land resources.
3.          These objectives were both valid and timely. Agriculture is the most
important sector in the economy and stood to be significantly affected by the proposed
change in the EU banana protocol. Diversification was, therefore, an appropriate strategy.
Shortage of land and lack of secure tenure were identified as constraints to expansion of
agricultural production. The project rightly sought to address these issues. At appraisal,
the main risks associated with the project were correctly evaluated as changes in
marketing opportunities for non-banana export crops, and weaknesses in key institutions.
C. Implementation Experience and Results
4.          The project has achieved most of its objectives. It has partly achieved the
objective of promoting growth and diversification of agricultural production. Yields and
production of bananas and several other crops have increased as a result of project
actions. Provision of better access to each cultivator's plot and the availability of technical
support encouraged better application of inputs and more intensive cultivation, which in
turn contributed to increased production. It is expected that a greater proportion of
impact would occur during the operational phase of the project because of lags in
beneficiaries response to the provision of secure tenure, and road access to the last estates
developed was completed in 1996.



iii
5.          The project's promotion of crop diversification achieved limited impact
because of the continued profitability of the banana business, its secure market and well
developed marketing facilities, and its provision of regular cash income. In contrast, there
were limited market opportunities for the alternative crops that were being promoted.
6.          The project has resulted in improved income distribution by targeting small
holders. The land divestiture program benefited the rural poor comprised of squatters,
agricultural laborers in the vicinity of estates and micro-plot holders. The provision of
secure land rights to this group improved their access to increased income earning
opportunities.
7.          The carefully planned subdivision of land on the estates, including the
development of 33.5 km of roads (20 km planned at appraisal) provided improved access
for each farmer. The projec. was able to develop the planned number of plots on each
estate and achieve the expected pace of registration of titles.
8.          At appraisal total project cost was estimated at US$4 million. The loan
and credit of US$1.4 million each, would finance 100 percent of foreign exchange costs,
and it was estimated that GOSVG would provide US$1.2 million out of the
US$1.7 million for local costs. At closure, total project cost was US$5.1 million,
US$2.2 million had been disbursed from the loan and credit while Government's
contribution was US$2.2 million, 83 percent higher than the appraisal estimate. Higher
project costs resulted from the larger roads development program and increased technical
assistance for land divestiture. GOSVG obtained grant funds from the Norwegian
Government to finance additional foreign costs while a PHRD Grant was obtained to
finance project management costs.
9.          Among the key factors affecting the performance of the project were:
(i) the decision by the EU to maintain preferential access of bananas beyond 1992;
(ii) increased competition from other Caribbean countries for non-traditional export crops;
(iii) strong commitment by the borrower, timely appointment of key staff and adequate
provision of counterpart funds; (iv) poor coordination among the many agencies involved
in promoting crop diversification; and (v) good project management.
10.         The provision of secure tenure to land and improved access to farms has
encouraged a large number of small producers to undertake development of their farms
without fear of eviction. Sustainability of these and other project benefits will also be
enhanced by Government's decision to use STABEX funds in financing a follow-up
national roads maintenance project, in restructuring the banana industry and in
strengthening the process of technology generation, testing and transfer, particularly for
non-banana crops. The Land Management Unit established under the project has been
suitably equipped, with trained staff, vehicles and surveying equipment, to complete the
registration of titles.



iv
11.          Overall Bank performance was rated satisfactory. Project preparation
and supervision were satisfactory but appraisal was considered deficient because of the
omission of measures to address marketing constraints for non-traditional crops, the
absence of an inter-agency coordinating mechanism, and inappropriate designs for the
roads program, which ignored the Borrower's advice. The Borrower's performance was
rated satisfactory. GOSVG consistently showed strong commitment to the project, was
timely in making appointments of key staff, and exceeded its planned counterpart funding
contribution. The main implementing agency performed effectively, and the Borrower
generally adhered to the major loan covenants, followed the Bank's guidelines for
procurement, and made timely presentation of financial statements, audits and progress
reports.
12.          The overall project outcome was rated as satisfactory, most of the
performance indicators set at appraisal were achieved, or exceeded in some instances, and
the development objectives have been largely attained.
D. Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
13.          Arrangements are well advanced for future operations of the project.
GOSVG is in the process of preparing two projects to be financed with STABEX funds
that would provide for the maintenance of roads and drains developed under the ARDP,
and enhance technical support to farmers.
14.         The key lessons learned from implementation of the project are:
(i)    The results demonstrate the effect of market incentives -- attractive
output prices and available markets -- on producer decision-
making.
(ii)   Where new crops are being introduced or a shift in production is
being encouraged it is important to have proven technologies
available to farmers together with the means of effecting their
transfer. The profitability of these technologies should be
continuously analyzed and this information also transmitted to
farmers.
(iii)   The positive contribution that can be made by borrower
commitment in facilitating project implementation is seen in the
performance of this project.
(iv)   Although this project was planned before the importance of
stakeholder participation in project design was fully recognized,
there were signs that a sound assessment of local socio-economic
conditions would have improved project design.






ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION AND DIVERSIFICATION PROJECT
(LOAN 3016/CREDIT 1980-STV)
PART I - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Background
1     .     Up to the late 1980's agriculture was the dominant sector in the economy
of St. Vincent and The Grenadines, contributing 20 percent to GDP. By the time the
sugar industry was closed in 1985, however, the economy had become increasingly
dependent on bananas as the leading export crop. As uncertainty arose in the second half
of the 1980's regarding its preferential access to EU markets, the need to diversify the
sector became very important, and other crops in addition to banana were identified with
potential for export. There were, however, several factors which constrained agricultural
development, critical ones being shortage of land and insecurity of tenure among some
small holders. Government had already begun to address these issues through the first
part of a three phased land reform program that involved divestiture of land to small
holders. The Bank's country assistance strategy aimed at financing investments that
would contribute to improved productivity and exports. The project complemented this
strategy, and was a suitable mechanism for implementing the second phase of
Government's land reform program, which was expected to encourage increased
agricultural production and diversification.
B. Project Objectives
2.          The project's objectives were to: (a) promote growth and diversification
of agricultural production and exports; (b) improve income distribution; and (c) promote
more efficient use of underutilized and idle scarce land resources. These would be
achieved through divestiture of certain state lands, rehabilitation of roads serving such
lands, and strengthening MAL.
3.          The aim of increasing production and promoting diversification was valid,
given the importance of the agriculture sector in the economy, the likely change in
preferential access of bananas to the European Union (EU) market (expected then to
occur in 1992) and the need to expand exports. Diversification is still an objective of
Government policy but progress is slow because of the continued profitability of bananas
(see para. 9). In promoting growth it was also important to achieve equitable distribution
of income, thus, small holders, who were the major agricultural producers, were to be the
main beneficiaries of the project. One omission from the project's design was provision
for improving agricultural technology. It was assumed instead that for most crops this
would be made available through an on-going project being funded by USAID. It was



2
also expected that the organizations providing support services, in credit and market
information, were capable enough and therefore did not require strengthening through the
project.
4.          The project's design was not complicated, although the management unit
was located in the Ministry of Finance and Planning, and required to coordinate the
activities of two other Ministries, the Ministry of Agriculture (MAL) and the Ministry of
Works (MCW), which implemented individual project components. Implicitly, it also
called for the active participation of other related organizations: the Development
Corporation (DEVCO), St. Vincent Banana Growers Association (SVBGA), Caribbean
Research and Development Institute (CARDI), Inter-American Institute for Cooperation
in Agriculture (IICA) and the USAID supported Agricultural Research and Extension
Project (AREP) all of which were involved in the diversification drive. The main risks
identified at appraisal were changes in marketing opportunities for (non-banana) export
crops, and weaknesses in key institutions, which turned out to be valid concerns.
5.          The project consisted of three parts:
*  Part A:  Divestiture of 2,500 acres of cultivable land on seven Government
owned estates to 745 small farmers, including surveying, mapping and
demarcation of plots;
*  Part B:  Construction, Rehabilitation and Maintenance of roads on the
divested estates, providing access to farms; and
*  Part C:  Strengthening the extension and land administration capability of
the Ministry of Agriculture through training of its staff
C. Achievement of Objectives
6.          Promotion of Agricultural Production and Diversification: The most
important objective of the project was to promote increased agricultural production and
diversification. With greater security of tenure it was thought that farmers would
undertake more short-term investment in the use of improved farm technology, be more
willing to grow any crop (including bananas) in response to the market and to undertake
long-term investment in perennial crops. Diversification through expansion in the area of
non-banana crops was expected once previously unutilized land was brought into
cultivation. To date the project has partly achieved this objective. Full achievement is
expected during the operational phase because of the lagged response to the provision of
land title, and the fact that road rehabilitation works on the last estate were only
completed in 1996. Thus, a greater proportion of expected impact is likely to occur
during the operational phase to come.
7.          Expected yield increases were quantified at appraisal, 20 percent for
bananas and 50 percent for other crops. Development of production potential was



3
expected to come through the provision of better access to each cultivator's plot and from
availability of technical support to assist farmers in adopting rational land use. Although,
there have been no systematic evaluation studies to accurately measure yield and
production changes as a result of the project, there is evidence that provision of these
project inputs did promote development of production, particularly of bananas, which
remained a profitable crop.' Prior to the project yields from land on the estates cultivated
by squatters were significantly less than on neighboring privately owned farms. On Sans
Souci, Colonarie, Grand Sable, Langley Park and Richmond estates farmers continued to
grow bananas after allocation of plots. On the first three estates, where previously
unutilized land was brought into cultivation, farmers also mostly planted bananas on this
new land. These farmers reported intensified application of inputs received from the
SVBGA, and they now obtain yields of five to six tons per acre compared with 4.5 tons
per acre before the project. There was also a noticeable increase in the intensity of
production on the Windward estates from improved access to farms through the roads
rehabilitated by the project roads. In addition, better roads reduced the damage to
bananas while being transported, which would have increased the market value of the
crop.
8.           The most obvious shift in production occurred on Cane Grove estate where
there was a major uptake in vegetable cultivation. Here, farmers invested in irrigation, and
with advice from the French and Chinese agriculture missions, increased the production of
carrots, tomatoes, pineapples and other crops. On other estates there was also new
planting on previously unused land: tannia in Langley Park and to a lesser extent Grand
Sable, and eddoes and dasheen at Wallilabou. For these crops, yield increases were in the
range of 20 percent to 30 percent, somewhat less than the 50 percent projected at
appraisal. Easier farm access has also been provided to Traffickers (itinerant traders).
This has given incentives to farmers while the volume of produce purchased by Traffickers
from some of the estates affected by the projects is reported to have increased.
9.           The project achieved limited results in its promotion of crop diversification
primarily because of the continued profitability of bananas, their guaranteed market and
well developed marketing system, and their provision of a regular flow of cash income
throughout the year. Nevertheless incentives for development of alternative crops through
greater security of tenure could have been better supported by improvements in
technology development, and marketing for alternative crops. The institutional
strengthening of MAL, for example, overlooked inadequacies in the system of technology
generation, development and transfer. One subject matter specialist and six extension
officers were trained, and extension demonstration equipment provided, but this proved
inadequate. Although, significant increased demand for credit was not expected, DEVCO
still could not provide effective promotion and administration of the lines of small farmer
credit that were available, and which could satisfy existing demand. These factors,
however, were far less significant than the attractiveness of bananas, and were not

4
included in the project because of the assumption at appraisal that they would be
adequately covered by the relevant agencies.
10.          Improve Income Distribution. The project has largely achieved this
objective. The small average size of holding (less than 3 acres) meant that limited land
resources were distributed among as many as possible of the rural poor. Beneficiaries of
the land divestiture program comprised squatters, agricultural laborers in the vicinity of
the estates, who were mostly unemployed, and holders of micro-plots which produced
incomes mostly below the poverty line. The provision of secure land rights through the
project provided these disadvantaged groups with access to increased income earning
activities thereby improving overall distribution of income. Nevertheless, while the
distribution maximized the number of owners, it may not have been the best approach
based on economic efficiency grounds. There are some concems about the economic
viability of the smallest plots but in many cases such farmers also cultivate other plots,
albeit through a mixture of short and long-term rental.
11.          Promote More Efficient Use of Underutilized and Idle Scarce Land
Resources. The project carried out rational subdivision of land on the estates thereby
providing improved access for each farmer. On seven estates 743 plots were developed
which consisted of 1,563 acres of arable land, 96 percent and 94 percent respectively of
the revised target. The SAR had overestimated the quantity of arable land available. The
registration of titles has also been on schedule with 60 percent registered so far, while on
the first five estates developed, 86 percent of recipients have registered their leases.
Access to land was improved by the roads development program where 33.5 miles of farm
access and feeder roads were developed, far in excess of the SAR estimates of 20 miles.
The higher figure resulted from a greater need once the project began. During the project
MAL provided TA which ensured that farmers adopted environmentally sound land use
practices.
12.          The project has also resulted in some previously idle land being brought
under cultivation. However, the desired increased efficiency in utilization has not yet been
fully achieved because of some of the reasons mentioned in para. 9 above, which limited
the shift in resources to what was perceived as higher value crops.

13.         The estimated economic rate of return (ERR) for the project at appraisal
was 23 percent. The recalculated ERR of 17 percent (Table 9) is lower mainly because of
the smaller area divested by the project, but higher cost of roads development and
maintenance, and a slower rate of increase in the build up of incremental production due
to the phasing of divestiture and rehabilitation at different estates. The drought year of
1994 also reduced output. Given the plan for the operation phase, the recalculation
assumed that increased crop yields would peak two years later than originally expected.
D. Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
14.         Without delay, the project was declared effective on September 8, 1989
and did not experience any significant delays during its implementation. Activities under
Part A were mostly completed ahead of schedule. Farmers who accepted the land
allocated to them were expected to sign a twenty year lease agreement to receive title on
successful completion of the lease. The task of registration of these leases is uncompleted,
but this was expected to last beyond the project and should be completed within two
years. Implementation of Part B was coordinated with Part A, the length of roads
targeted for improvement being increased in response to the layout of farm plots
developed on the estates. Under Part C of the project a Lands Management Unit was
established in MAL which will complete the lease registration process. The project
provided 108 person months of training for staff of this Unit. The extension arm of MAL
was strengthened through staff training, which improved its ability to deliver extension
services.
15.         Factors not Subject to Government Control. Project performance was
significantly affected by the decision of the EU to maintain preferential access of bananas
beyond 1992. In the case of non-traditional crops competition increased from other
Caribbean countries. This was particularly so in the case of the Trinidadian market, where
local producers in particular, displaced Vincentian products. St. Vincent faced the further
problem of being a small island state with limited airport facilities, preventing the use of
medium-haul aircraft, and resulting in high marginal cost of freight because of low
volumes. This prevented direct access to the UK and US markets, cargo having to be
transshipped through Barbados. Delays in procurement that did occurred were
attributable to the small island status of St. Vincent. Many companies have little interest
in supplying goods to Eastern Caribbean states because of high cost and limited cargo
routes. This delayed the purchase of extension demonstration equipment, which were to
be used by the Extension arm of MAL to promote diversification.
16.         Factors Subject to Government Control. Project performance was
enhanced by Government's strong commitment, timely appointment of key staff and
adequate provision of counterpart funds. On the other hand, performance was adversely
affected by weaknesses in sector policies. While individual incentives were made available
to agricultural production and agro-processing enterprises, these were disparate, not
supportive of each other and not applied across sectors. For example, little attention was
given to promoting linkages between agro-processing enterprises and producers, and



6
between tourism and agriculture. This could have encouraged domestic producers and
local hotels to forge closer ties to increase domestic sourcing of products by the tourism
industry, and to promote improved quality of local produce.
17.         There were also too many institutions involved in promoting diversification
(about fourteen at one stage), some key ones did not perform effectively, and there was
weak coordination among them. The IFAD supported Small Holder Crop Improvement
and Marketing Project (SCIMP), for example, was expected to play a key role in
enhancing the national export capability and developing an overall marketing system that
could respond to regional and extra-regional market conditions. It has only recently been
reorganized and should now have a greater impact. The organizational structure of MAL
was also not supportive, it was cumbersome, consisting of a single multipurpose
agricultural extension department.
18.         Factors Generally Subject to Implementing Agency Control. The
project was well managed by a team which was unchanged for its duration. Staff required
were promptly recruited or assigned as in the case of the Ministries of Works and
Agriculture. Initially, some delays were experienced in procuring road construction
equipment, which delayed arrival of the technical assistance team. Subsequently, the pace
of implementation increased, although additional minor delays were experienced as a
result of frequent breakdown of construction equipment. Another cause of delay, which
also prompted a change in the procedures for selection of beneficiaries was the presence
of squatters on several estates. The Bank advised that their claims be considered by the
project's Land Settlement Committee, and this took more time. Once this problem was
resolved the pace of divestiture increased and was completed on schedule. The project
adopted a very transparent procedure in the identification, selection and allocation of land
to beneficiaries, which has resulted in few complaints or unsolved disputes, and this
contributed to the efficient and timely execution of the divestiture program. This is
especially so in the circumstances as the number of squatters already on the estates had
been underestimated at appraisal. In reality they were about 700 of the total of
1,162 applicants.
19.         Technical assistance under the project was effective. A consultant team
carried out the preparatory work associated with the land divestiture program, while
individual consultants and UN volunteers supported MCW in implementing the roads
program.. Monitoring of financial and physical progress was adequate, but there was no
baseline survey, and beneficiary-contact monitoring and evaluation of project effects were
absent. This meant that project management received little feedback on beneficiaries'
response to some of the inputs provided, such as information on changes in land use and
performance of the extension services. Very little data have been collected to measure
changes in either yield, production or income.
20.         The total cost of the roads development program (Table 8A) was
44 percent higher than expected at appraisal, but the unit costs remained the same and
were similar for other roads in St. Vincent. The quantity of roads was underestimated at



7
appraisal (20 miles planned, 33.5 actually improved). Also, some of the designs proposed
at appraisal --gravel surfaced roads-- were inappropriate for the steep terrain and high
rainfall on some estates, resulting in high maintenance costs, including construction of
additional drainage. It is now necessary to apply concrete or bitumen surface to some
roads, remodel drains, and towards the project's closure, a study was carried out to
identify a labor intensive maintenance program. The costs of the land divestiture
component were also higher than estimated at appraisal by 83 percent, as additional
technical assistance was utilized and financed by grant funds. The actual costs of
strengthening the Ministry of Agriculture were similar to appraisal estimates. Project
management costs were slightly higher than at appraisal with a PHRD Grant being
obtained and used to mainly finance this component. Total project costs were 32 percent
higher than at appraisal. The higher expenditure was financed with grant funds and an
increase in Government's counterpart contribution by 84 percent over the appraisal figure.
E. Project Sustainability
21.          Through the land divestiture program the project has enabled a large
number of small holders to obtain secure tenure to land and provided access to farms
through construction and rehabilitation of feeder roads. The road maintenance plan which
was prepared towards the end of the project is to be incorporated into a follow-up
national road maintenance project to be financed by the EU. Design proposals are to be
submitted to the EU by December 1997. Sustainability of the roads would be ensured by
the plan under this project to introduce labor intensive maintenance methods which are
easier for farmers to adopt, together with an emphasis on beneficiary participation.
22.          It now seems likely (given the recent dratt WTO ruling) that bananas will
lose preferential status to the EU market by the year 2002, which, should encourage
producers to raise productivity significantly and diversify production. They would be
supported by a new project under preparation to be financed with STABEX funds, which
will strengthen the process of agricultural technology generation, testing and transfer.
This includes restructuring the banana industry (intensification of production thereby
releasing land for other crops), and strengthening support services for other crops,
including technical advice (reorganization of MAL, revamping SCIMP and better
coordination of the main organizations), and upgrading port facilities.
23.          During implementation the problem arose of delinquency in the payment of
leases, which could cast some doubt on cost recovery for the Government. Until recently,
the project did not have an effective system for collection, relying simply on writing to
inform tenants of the amount due. Now that the Land Management Unit has been
established and provided with trained staff, office equipment and vehicles, it is expected to
complete the process of registration of leases and collection of lease payment. With
adequate budgetary support and political will from Government, which so far has been
provided, the unit is expected to collect payments due. In addition, as tenants do not
receive titles until payments are satisfactorily completed, Government has some leverage
in the collection of payments. Slow collection of leases is a fiscal problem, being a



8
transfer payment, and would not affect the economic return of the project. The
institutional procedures established under the project for beneficiary selection, land
distribution and conflict resolution were successful and are to be used for the third Phase
of Government's land reform program, which will involve divestiture of Mt. Wynne/Peters
Hope estate.
F. Bank Performance
24.         The Bank's overall performance is rated as satisfactory. The Borrower
was assisted in preparation of the project by the FAO-CP whose perfornance was rated
satisfactory. While the Bank's performance in identification and preparation is rated
satisfactory, its appraisal was rated deficient. The strong commitment of the Government
and the beneficiaries to the project was rightly assessed. Similarly, the capacity of the
implementing agency was correctly estimated, including the availability locally of qualified
management personnel. However, a proposal made during preparation to establish a
market information system in MAL was dropped. This became one of a number of
marketing constraints experienced by project farmers and was eventually included in the
SCIMiP. Having decided to rely on other organizations to generate improved technology,
a suitable inter-agency coordinating mechanism to ensure their participation should have
been proposed. Subdivision and settlement of Government lands was a primary activity of
the project. The Bank should have investigated the social dimensions of this process and
developed with the borrower a plan to deal with squatters rights before implementation
began. During appraisal the Borrower's engineers pointed out some inadequacies in the
proposed designs for the roads program, given the heavy rainfall and steep slopes on the
estates. This was ignored by the Bank's engineer with the result that faster deterioration
of some project roads occurred and high maintenance costs were incurred.
25.          Supervision missions were timely, provided useful advice to the Borrower
and were well received. For example, the Government accepted the Bank's advice on the
problem of squatters, while supervision missions identified other problems such as the
difficulties with crop diversification; the limited monitoring and evaluation; and the
inadequate coordination among organizations. The missions made good suggestions to
overcome these problems, including designing evaluation survey instruments, and advising
on ways of achieving better coordination, while factors affecting diversification were
beyond the project's scope. On the whole, there was little if any deviation from Bank
policies and procedures. The Bank's performance during supervision is considered
satisfactory.
G. Borrower Performance
26.         From the outset Government showed strong commitment to the project. It
supported preparation by ensuring the participation of appropriate technical staff, who
provided good advice. During implementation Government was prompt in appointing
staff and in provision of counterpart funding. The main implementing agency, the Project
Management Unit in the Ministry of Finance and Planning, was effective in its



9
implementation of the project, and considering the potential political conflicts associated
with land distribution, there was no noticeable interference from Government.
Performance of MCW, which implemented the roads component was also satisfactory.
Within its staffing and organizational limitations, MAL was mostly responsive to the
project's needs. One of its major problems was the inability of the Planning Unit to carry
out evaluation studies on behalf of the project. MAL is expected to carry out its
responsibility during the operation phase of completing the land registration program,
because it has received adequate institutional strengthening to achieve this. The Borrower
generally adhered to the major loan covenants, while audits, financial statements and
progress reports were mostly on time, and procurement followed Bank policies.
H. Assessment of Outcome
27.          The project achieved most of its objectives and they are likely to be
sustainable, so it is rated satisfactory. It promoted increased production through the
divestiture of land and provision of secure tenure (Part A), by improved access to farms
(Part B) and to a lesser extent, by institutional strengthening of MAL (Part C). The main
beneficiaries were small farmers whose ability to improve their income was enhanced by
the provision of land. Some production gains are already evident but the bulk should
come during the future operation. The recalculated ERR is 17 percent. The limited effect
on diversification was mainly due to factors external to the project. If as expected the
profitability of bananas declines after the year 2002, then the diversification objective
should meet with more success. The few shortcomings of the project appraisal did not
affect its overall favorable outcome. For example, on some estates, the type of roads
recommended was inappropriate, the degree of squatting on some estates was not
properly evaluated and the capability of supporting institutions was overestimated. The
Borrower, however, with flexibility and initiative was able to deliver project inputs as
planned and to meet or exceed most targets. Its achievements have also provided an
appropriate framework for GOSVG to use as the basis for implementing follow-up
projects.
I. Future Operation
28.          The Borrower's Plan for the Operation Phase (Annex B) sets out the
following tasks: (i) completion of issuance of leases; (ii) collection of lease payments;
(iii) conversion of leasehold to freehold; (iv) maintenance of roads and drains; (v) technical
support to farmers; and (vi) monitoring and evaluation. The objectives and activities
associated with these tasks are reasonable and achievable. Tasks (i) to (iii) are to be
implemented by the Land Management Unit in MAL. These activities will be ongoing
over the next two to three years and performance monitoring indicators are listed in the
Table in Annex B. These indicators should be readily verifiable as a database was
established during the project. The indicators consist of the number of leases registered as
a percentage of the amount outstanding, lease payments collected as a proportion of
amount due, and the proportion of leasehold title converted to freehold as a proportion of
those qualifying.



10
29.         Responsibility for maintenance of roads and drains rests with MCW. A
project proposal, which has already been prepared for submission to the EU, presents a
national farm road maintenance plan, and implementation is expected to begin by
December 1997. GOSVG has also obtained STABEX funding to strengthen the
diversification program which would also secure the gains made under the project. It is
intended to strengthen MAL, form more effective linkages with CARDI, involve NGOs,
strengthen the marketing information system, improve inter-agency coordination and the
effectiveness of the IFAD supported project, SCIMP. As part of the strengthening of
MAL the Planning Division would be reorganized and have clear responsibility for
systematic monitoring and evaluation of agricultural projects.
J. Key Lessons Learned
30.         The results of this project show clearly the link between market incentives
and producer decision-making. Attempts to encourage farmers to switch production will
have limited success as long as the primary crop offers them higher profitability at a lower
risk.
31.         Where new crops are being introduced or a shift in production is being
encouraged it is important to have proven technologies available to farmers together with
the means of effecting their transfer. The profitability of these technologies should be
continuously analyzed and this information also transmitted to farmers.
32.         A borrower's strong commitment to project objectives is a key factor in
determining successful project outcomes.
33.         Although this project was planned before the importance of stakeholder
participation in design was fully recognized, a sound assessment of local socio-economic
conditions involving land distribution and squatters would have better prepared the project
for dealing with these problems.

ANNEX A
ST.VINCENT AND TIHE GRENADLNES
AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION AND DIVERSIFICATION PROJECT
(Loan 3016; Credit 1980-STV)
AIDE-MIEMOIRE
1.    This Aide-Memoire sumnmarizes the findings of a World Bank Mission comprising
of Mr. Samuel Wedderburn (Jamaica Resident Mission) that visited St. Vmcent during the
period December 10 - 18. The purpose of the mission was to undertake Final Supervision
of the above-mentioned project and preparation of the Implementation Completion
Report. The findings of the mission are subject to confirmation by World Bank
Management in Washington DC. The Mission held discussions with several officials who
were directly or indirectly involved in the implementation of the project. Field visits were
made to five of the seven estates where land was divested and interviews held with a
sample of farmers who benefited. The mission wishes to thank Mr. Karl John, the Project
Director, for his support and hospitality, and all officials met for their cooperation.
Overview of Project Progress
2.    Land Divestiture: The project has completed all of its planned implementation
activities under this component, the bulk of the program, together with roads
rehabilitation, having been essentially completed by June 30 this year. On the seven
estates slated for divestment 743 farm plots have been developed comprised of 1563 acres
of arable land, representing 96% and 94% respectively of estimated revised targets. A
delay in the allocation of thirty remaining plots was caused by the need to re-survey at
Richmond and "Vallilabou estates, and this will be completed shortly.
3.    There is a' i expected lag in the provision of leases to farmers who have oeen
allocated lana To date 60% of those who were allocated farm plots have registerec their
leases, but for the first five estates developed (422 plots) 86% of allottees have completed
this process. Based on the earlier experience, however, where several unforeseen problems
arose, most recently a reluctance among some beneficiaries on Richmond estate to pay
their deposits, the process could take another two to three years to be completed. A
sizable delinquency rate has also arisen in the payment for leases. At present, about 57%
of the amount due is outstanding. Reasons for non-payment include apathy, unwillingness,
claimed unaffordability, and the perception that the enforcement mechanism might be
ineffective.



-2 -
4.    Roads Development: The roads developed on these estates, 33.5 mniles, is in
excess of the 20 miles planned at appraisal, the higher figure being a response to need as
farm plots were demarcated. Maintenance has been a recurring problem on some roads
since they were built. To address this problem, a study has recently been undertaken to
design a sustainable road maintenance program that is likely to be implemented through a
planned Roads Improvement Project to be financed with funds from CDB and the
STABEX facility. The consultant's report is due on December 20.
5.     Procurement of Extension Equipment: The project was able to sign a contract
with Hummert International for the provision of extension demonstration equipment,
which should be delivered before the project's closing date. The Bank agreed to the
procurement of pedestrian tractors under direct contracting because of the proprietary
nature of this equipment. A suitable supplier was eventually identified and it is expected
that these will also be delivered shortly.
Project Implementation Experience
6.    The project became effective on schedule and did not experience any significant
delays throughout its implementation. There were no changes in objectives or phasing,
and minor modifications in scope. It was well managed by a small coordination unit based
in the Ministry of Finance and Planning which directly implemented Part A, and carried
out day to day activities including operation of a centralized accounting system. Parts B
and C were implemented by the Ministry of Construction and Works (MCW) and Ministry
of Agriculture and Labor (MAL), respectively. Throughout implementation the Borrower
has shown strong commitment to the project, and among the implementation agencies
there was a high sense of ownership by MCW, but less by MAL.
7.    Among the project's development objectives the most discernible achievement so
far is the more efficient use of underutilized and idle scarce land resources by the
successful divestment of state lands and rehabilitation of related roads. The evidence is
less clear on the extent to which it has fulfilled the other development objectives of
promoting growth and diversification of SVG's agricultural production and exports and
improving income distribution. To a large extent this depended on policy and institutional
factors external to the project, which tumed out to be less favorable than expected at
appraisal. The extension arm of MAL has been only partly effective, and some lagged
benefits can be expected for a project involving land divestment. In retrospect an
interagency coordinating mechanism should have been established to formally link this and
other related projects and organizations.
8.    Divestiture of State Land: The project executed this component quite
efficiently. A consultant team was employed to carry out the preparatory work, which
consisted of land classification, surveying and mapping, engineering designs and structure
plans. The identification of beneficiaries, selection and allocation of land, and preparation
of leases was done by the PMU and a Land Settlement Committee. This process was very
transparent -- there have been few complaints or unsolved disputes -- and offers lessons



- 3 -
for future projects. The SAR, however, had overestimated the arable area available on the
estates, and underestimated the number of potential beneficiaries, thus average size of
plots allocated was smaller (.75 acres to 5 acres, but mostly less than 3 acres) than
estimated at Appraisal. This made it difficult to adhere to the criterion of economic
viability of plots, which was relaxed on some estates, in order to acconmmodate the higher
demand for land.
9.    An important issue that arose during implementation, which partly accounted for
the higher number of applicants, was the presence of squatters on some estates, whose
claims had to be considered by the project, although some were eventually evicted. This
prior occupancy also complicated the determination of subdivisions as the project
attempted where possible to retain existing boundaries. It also exposed some of the
inadequacies in the institutional framework for dealing with illegal occupation of land,
such as the lack of political will to enforce existing laws, and this could adversely affect
the collection of payments from lessees in future.
10.   Construction, Rehabilitation and Maintenance of Roads: MCW, with support
from consultants and UN volunteers, carried out the road rehabilitation program. This was
done through a combination of force account, using equipment purchased by the project,
and contracting for specialized activities such as drainage construction, using petty
contractors. Unit costs were on average, similar to those for other roads in the country.
Designs were based on the SAR recommendations, which in many instances turned out to
be inappropriate for the terrain and rainfall. The gravel surfaced roads especially on steep
slopes, were unable to withstand heavy rainfall, resulting in erosion, and gullying in a few
places, while earthen drains could not support the high velocity of runoff. This resulted in
high maintenance costs and the need to now apply concrete or bitumen surfacing to some
roads, and the remodeling of some drains using concrete and stones.
11.   It is noticeable, however, that a major part of the problem is due to blocked drains.
Farmers generally do not clean the drains adjoining their properties. This is due in part to a
dependency syndrome -- government being expected to provide this function - and local
political divisions which prevent individuals in some communities from cooperating. It is
possible, however, that a more participative approach involving greater consultation with
prospective beneficiaries at the time of plot allocation, might have resulted in agreement
on their responsibility for maintenance.
12.   Strengthening the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands: The project provided
support to MAL in land administration and extension. Training at degree level was
provided in Land Valuation/Administration. A Land Management Unit was established
and equipped with survey equipment and computers to manage a database of project
beneficiaries for land administration and monitoring diversification. Six middle level
extension staff were trained, but limited higher level staffing prevented the Ministry taking
full advantage of the training opportunities in specialized areas available through the
project



-4-
13.   Project Impact: The impact of the project is difficult to quantify because of the
absence of systematic monitoring and evaluation data, impact studies or disaggregated
yield and production data. In many instances it is also too early for participants to obtain
production benefits that could be attributable to the project because of the phased
divestiture program and time lag in farmers taking possession of plots and developing the
land. Nevertheless, the mission was able to collect some data that will be later analyzed to
estimate impact, and some preliminary impressions are given below.
14.   Agricultural Production: The project was expected to generate increased
agricultural production. Its design, however, somewhat optimistically, called for much of
these stimuli to be externally induced. Crop diversification was expected to occur because
of the anticipated loss of preferential status for bananas in EU markets by 1992, and the
technology transfer process was to be improved to support development of new
alternative crops, but mainly through the actions of other donor funded projects. The
most direct impact of the project was expected to come from security of tenure, with
which it was thought, farmers would seek credit for investment in crop development.
Roads improvement was also expected to stimulate production.
15.   Crop Diversification: There has been lirnited crop diversification as a result of
the following factors:
* the continued profitability of banana, its provision of regular cash flow, and
farmers familiarity with growing the crop
- absence of assured markets for other crops
- unavailability or failure of agricultural extension to convincingly promote
technological packages for other crops
* institutional constraints within and among organizations responsible for
promoting diversification;
*  farmers on small and sometimes marginal holdings are less likely to take the
risk of growing an alternative and unfamiliar crop
16.   There is evidence, however, that many farmers are not only aware of the need to
diversif;y but are probably now more prepared to respond to appropriate incentives. This
has resulted from a downturn in the price of bananas and the imposition of more stringent
quality standards by the EU. Some less efficient farmers are being forced out of the crop,
and some marginal land is now being converted for production of alternative crops.
Government has also indicated its willingness to put in place a more supportive policy and
institutional framework for crop diversification, emphasizing intensification of banana
production, which by default would release land for other crops. The most important
factor, however, will be the future market status of bananas.
17.   Credit and Investment: In general, there has been a low demand for credit in St.
Vincent. There is no evidence as yet of higher demand among project beneficiaries. Some
have invested in irrigation (Cane Grove estate) and others show an interest in planting tree
crops and establishing land conservation structures, now that tenure is secure. However,



- 5 -
there has not been widespread increase in investment. The limited interest in credit is
attributable to the following factors:
*  farmer aversion to indebtedness;
*  risk averse farners unwilling to use their land as collateral given the uncertain
future of bananas and uncertainty of alternative crops
*  inadequate institutional arrangements for promotion and distribution of credit.
18.   Roads: The roads rehabilitated by the project have improved access to farmers
fields allowing easier delivery of inputs, but more significantly, produce is being collected
at the farmgate and transported with less damage, which is reported to have encouraged
higher intensity of production among some project beneficiaries.
19.   Institutions: The main institutional impact expected from the project was
strengthening MAL. Although some training was provided, the agricultural extension
service was not significantly improved, but it is expected that extension demonstration
equipment recently provided by the project will contribute to the promotion of crop
diversification. It is also proposed to reorganize the service, additional specialized staff
positions are to be created, and with STABEX funds a project is being prepared to
strengthen technological development, testing and transfer. Thus, there is an expectation
that project beneficiaries would be receiving more effective support.
20.   Project Finance: The project was financed through a Bank Loan and Credit, a
PHRD grant, GOSVG funds and a small grant from the Danish Government. The
Development Credit was fully disbursed, there are savings of US$0.6m on the loan, but
GOSVG's contribution was much higher than planned (US$2.2m compared with
US$1.2m) because of the increased road maintenance costs.
The Borrower's Implementation Completion Report
21.   The mission provided advice and support on preparation of the Borrower's ICR
(guidelines were presented and discussed during the last supervision mission). The report
was being drafted (the Borrower employed a consultant for assistance) while the mission
was in the field and it was discussed in detail.
Plan for the Operation Phase
22.   There are four particular areas of concern that should be addressed during this
period: completion of the issuance of leases and collection of lease payments, and
establishment of a mechanism for the conversion of leasehold to freehold; maintenance of
roads and drains; technical support to farmers in land management and crop
diversification; and monitoring and evaluation. The mission discussed government's
proposed options for carrying out these activities and agreement was reached that the plan
would be presented in the forrn of a matrix summarizing the objectives, activities,
implementation responsibilities and performance monitorable indicators, and would be

attached as an Annex to the Borrowers ICR. It was agreed that the final report of the
Borrower's ICR would be forwarded to the Bank by December 31, 1996.
Audits and Reports
23.   The final audit of project accounts is due by June 30, 1997 (4.0 lb (ii)), but
agreement was reached that this report would be sent to the Bank by March 31, 1997.
24.   It was agreed that the progress report for calendar year 1996 would be presented
on schedule by January 31, 1997 (3.06).
25.   It was also agreed that a copy of the final report of the consultant carrying out the
study on road maintenance would be forwarded to the Bank by January 15,1997.

St. Vincent and the Grenadines
Dear Mr. Cato:
St. Vincent and The Grenadines: Agricultural Rehabilitation and
Diversification Project (Ln. 3016/Cr. 1980-STYV)
The mission comprised of Mr. Samuel Wedderburn, which visited St. Vincent
between December 10 and 18, to undertake the final supervision and Implementation
Completion Report (ICR) mission for the above project, has now reported its findings
to us. I would like to thank you and the staff of the project and various ministries for
the exeellent cooperation extended to the mission.
First, let me express my congratulations on the successful completion of the
project. According to the Mission's findings, as expressed in the Aide-Memoire, a
copy of which is attached for your easy reference, the project will be completed on
time having achieved nearly all of its implementation targets. We note that there was
particular success in the divestiture of land and that the approach and methods
developed offer some valuable lessons for the implementation of future projects. As a
result of the project, greater security of tenure has promoted more efficient utilization
of land. Similarly, it is pleasing to note that the roads constructed and rehabilitated in
support of this activity have encouraged production by improving access to farmers
fields, thereby facilitating input delivery and crop extraction with less damage to the
produce.
We understand, however, that there has been more limited impact from the
institutional support provided to the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands' While training
provided by the project in surveying and land administration has contributed to the
successful establishment of a Land Management Unit that will complete the
administration of leases, the Ministry was unable to take full advantage of the training

offered in agricultural extension. Thus, we are pleased that Government plans to
further strengthen the Ministry's technology transfer capability during the project's
operational phase, which would also be complemented by the availability of extension
demonstration equipment purchased under this project.
It is noticeable that there are still several obstacles to achieving a higher level of
crop diversification. The mission's findings suggest that factors external to the project,
namely the continued profitability and secure market for bananas, together with the
absence of assured markets for other crops, have made farmers less interested in
diversifying production. We are in full support of government's continuing efforts to
achieve this difficult objective, which we understand would be elaborated in the Plan
for the Operation Phase. We also share your concern regarding the maintenance of
roads rehabilitated under the project and await the findings of the recently completed
consultancy which was to recommend more sustainable maintenance practices.
Finally, we were pleased to learn from the mission's report that the Borrower's
evaluation of the project and Plan for the Operation Phase are almost completed and we
look forward to receiving these documents. We will also be sending you within the next
few weeks the draft ICR for your comments.
Because of his interest and responsibilities we are copying this letter to Mr. Karl
John, Project Director, ARDP.

AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION
AND DIVERSIFICATION PROJECT
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
Prepared by the Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines
with the assistance of Howard F. Batson
December 20, 1996






EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
I.   Introduction
The Agricultural Rehabilitation and Diversification Project (ARDP) commenced on April 28,
1989 with the signing of the loan agreement between the Government of St. Vincent and the
Grenadines (GOSVG) and the Intemational Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the
World Bank). The expected completion date is December 31, 1996.
The following report is the contribution of the GOSVG, the Borrower, to the Implementation
Completion Report of the Project. The purpose is to provide a retrospective evaluation of the
Project design and objectives, and assess the implementation and achievements of the Project
from the Borrower's perspective.
II.   Project Execution and Initial Operation
A.   Objectives
The key objectives of the Project were:
to promote growth and diversification of agricultural production, and
to improve income distribution of smallholder farmers through more efficient use
of scarce land resources.
B.   Components
The main components of the Project were:
divestiture of state-owned land to small-scale farmers,
(the planned divestiture of 2,500 acres of government owned land to 745
farm families on seven government estates, Langley Park, Grand Sable,
Colonarie and San Souci on the windward side, and Cane Grove,
Wallilabou and Richmond on the leeward side)
farm access road rehabilitation,
(the planned rehabilitation of 20 miles of access roads within the estates to
be divested, and the development of access to individual plots)
*     technical assistance and training to support the program and strengthen the
supporting services of the Ministry of Agriculture and Labour (MAL).
The Project was implemented by the line agencies of the Government under the direction of a
management unit attached to the Ministry of Finance and Planning which had the main
responsibility for the divestiture programme.
v



B.   Relevance of Project and Suitability of Project Design
The concept of the Project was definitely in harmony with the policies of the GOSVG. It
supported the Government's policy of divestment of state lands and the strengthening of the
agricultural sector in general, and agricultural diversification in particular.
The design was, however, short-sighted in not providing adequately for the construction of all
weather roads and more effective drainage. The steep slopes and high rainfall in some of the
Project areas necessitated a more durable road surface and drains. This soon becarne evident
during Project implementation from the extent of the erosion of road surfaces and drains.
Whereas one of the objectives of the Project was to increase agricultural diversification, there
was no funding mechanism for the introduction and adoption of new cropping systems, or post-
harvest and marketing infrastructure. There was the assumption that these would have been
provided by other organizations, or related projects.
Funds were not provided to conduct a baseline survey to verify existing cropping systems, and to
determine yields and income levels of farmers.
C.   Risks and Constraints
The SAR described the main risk of the project as the extent to which the country would be able
to market the crops to be produced under the Project. This was said to depend on:
(a)   whether or not the country would continue to receive preferential treatment for the
export of bananas to the U.K., and
(b)   whether the country would be able to seek new outlets or expand the export of
non-banana crops.
This risk did not affect the implementation of the major components of the Project, divestiture of
state lands, the rehabilitation of the roads, and the institutional strengthening of the Ministry of
Agriculture. The risk pertained to the achievement of one of the broad objectives of the Project,
that is, to promote growth and diversification of agricultural production.
The Lome IV Convention did not reverse the preferential access for the country's bananas to the
U.K. or alter the market conditions as drastically as expected. St. Vincent and the Grenadines
were given a quota of 82,000 tonnes, a production level which it has not been able to achieve
since the signing of Lome IV in 1990. In spite of the Government's best efforts to promote
agricultural diversification, farmers continued to produce bananas because of the guaranteed
market, a well developed marketing system, and the assurance of a steady income from the sale
of bananas throughout the year.
vi



Alternative crops have been identified and markets do exist for non-banana exports. Failure to
take advantage of this potential is due mainly to the continued preferential treatment for the
export of bananas to the U.K., and the weakness of the transportation and marketing system for
non-traditional crops.
D.   Implementation Problems and Delays
There were no major problems during the implementation of this project. The minor delays with
start-up were in keeping with the kind of inertia generally experienced with any new project.
The planned Project completion date has not been extended.
Initial delays were due to difficulties with procurement. This affected the placement of long-
term technical assistance and the arrival of essential equipment for road construction and
rehabilitation. Once the technical assistance team and equipment were in place, the pace of
implementation quickly gained momentum.
Some problems and delays were created by squatters, some of whom had occupied the land for 5-
15 years. They had to be assessed for eligibility to obtain leases under the Project. Those who
were not eligible had to be evicted, a process which proved to be difficult. The nature of the
problem also made it difficult to impose simple subdivision layouts on areas in which persons
were occupying parcels of various sizes, some of which were too small to be developed into
viable farms.
The high rainfall, steep slopes and consequent erosion of the roads and associated drainage
channels in some of the Project areas resulted in higher maintenance costs than anticipated.
The extension demonstration materials intended for the MAL have still not been delivered. The
delay has been due to the late identification of the items of equipment required and difficulties in
identifying sources of supply. These difficulties have now been resolved and the equipment is
expected to be delivered before the Project completion date.
E.   Evaluation of Borrower's Performance
The Project was implemented by a Project Management Unit (PMU) within the Ministry of
Finance with the full support of the GOSVG. The PMU consisted of a Project Manager, an
Accountant, and an Executive Secretary. They were supported by a technical assistance team
provided by Darudec, and United Nations Volunteers.
The GOSVG met all the covenants and conditions precedent to disbursement in a timely manner
avoiding any delays in Project implementation. The technical progress reports and audit reports
were submitted as required and were of an acceptable standard.
vii



The Government's counterpart contribution to the Project was US$2.2 million, 84% more than
was programmed in the SAR. This demonstrated the level of commitment that the Government
had for the Project.
The PMU was more proactive than reactive in its management style. In so doing, many possible
implementation difficulties were obviated. With the concurrence of the Bank, the PMU became
even more involved in the planning and execution of the Project than was intended in the Project
design.
F.    Evaluation of Bank's Performance
The supervision of the Project by the Bank has been satisfactory. The supervision missions
were conducted by professionals of a very high caliber who engaged in meaningful discussions
with the PMU and Government representatives. The missions always resulted in useful guidance
and helpful suggestions to address the issues at hand.
The Bank has very promptly addressed any difficulties and implementation problems brought to
its attention by the Borrower and resolved them effectively and to the satisfaction of all the
parties involved. The Bank was amenable to most changes in the Project design that were
suggested by the Borrower.
viii



The funds were used to purchase materials and equipment for road improvement and surveying,
technical assistance, and the operations and staffing of the PMU.
B.   Benefits
The SAR estimate of the planned outputs under the Project had to be revised during the course of
implementation. The actual outputs under the Project have met the revised targets in most cases,
and exceeded the target in some cases. The number of man months of training fell short of that
which was planned but was adequate for the needs of the MAL.
(i)    Divestiture of State Land
The total number of lots distributed and, therefore, beneficiaries were 743. The total acreage
distributed was 1,563 acres. The farm plots ranged from 0.75-5.0 acres each. Of the 743
recipients of farm plots 28% were women.
Whereas the SAR estimated the total amount of arable land to be 2,500 acres, the land survey
conducted under the Project revealed that the actual amount was 1,660 acres. The Wallilabou
and Richmond estates contain large amounts of protected and inaccessible areas which were
originally estimated to be arable. On the Richmond and Wallilabou estates there were thirty
plots representing about 97 acres that had not yet been allocated.
(ii)   Access Road Rehabilitation
The rehabilitation work involved the reduction of slopes on some stretches by minor realignment
and excavation, application and compacting of road surface material on the roads. There was
also construction of masonry check dams at required intervals to reduce the flow speed of ditch
water to avoid soil erosion, and installation of concrete paved stone fords on steep slopes. A
total of 33.3 miles of gravel roads was actually rehabilitated, exceeding the SAR estimate of 20
miles, over the seven estates.
(iii)  Strengthening of the Ministry of Agriculture
The main output from this component was the institutional strengthening of the Ministry of
Agriculture through the training of several members of its staff. Although 216 man-months of
training were planned, 180 were actually achieved. This was, however, deemed adequate to meet
the needs of the MAL. The candidate selected for training in Land Valuation/Administration
pre-qualified for a 36-month degree programme rather than the 48 months which were budgeted.
The MAL decided that it was not necessary to train a subject matter specialist in root crops at the
masters level. Six people were trained in various disciplines. This strengthened the extension
capability of the MAL as a whole. It enhanced the ability of the MAL to bring appropriate
technology to farmers in the Project areas.

IV.  Project Impact and Sustainability
A.   Impact
The land reforrn programme was expected to create more productive, market-oriented
commercial farms, specializing to take advantage of export opportunities rather than just
producing at subsistence levels and supplying only local markets. The production and export of
non-banana crops were expected to increase as farmers, having security of tenure, would have
more freedom to grow any crop in response to market signals.
The reality is that banana is still the most attractive export crop in terrns of price and marketing
arrangements. In the last couple of years, however, the more stringent quality requirements of
the market have caused some dislocation among farmers who are unable to meet these standards.
Farmers, particularly those on more marginal lands, are beginning to recognize the need to seek
alternative crops. The Project, however, did not have the expected impact on agricultural
diversification, demand for credit and other inputs and farmers' income. The collaboration with
other donor projects concentrating on agricultural marketing and strong Government support for
the process is expected to increase the pace of agricultural diversification in the next couple of
years.
T'he improvement in the road network and the quality of roads on the Project estates have been of
tremendous benefit to the local farming communities. Access to individual plots has increased
and farmers no longer have to "head out" produce as their plots are now accessible by vehicles.
B.   Sustainability
The Ministry of Agriculture has been working in collaboration with the ongoing IFAD/SCIMP
project, the OECS/ADCU, and the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute
(CARDI) to strengthen the support systems for the production and marketing of non-traditional
crops. The Ministry has been working with CARDI to develop and extend new production
technologies to farmers. A marketing information system has been put in place by the
OECS/ADCU which provides up to date information on prices, trends and quality requirements
for the European and North American markets. IFAD has been working with exporters to build a
strong exporter's association.
The people who have been trained in crop production, agricultural extension and land surveying
will continue to serve the country and employ their expertise to further the objectives of the
Project.
Upon completion of the Project, outstanding responsibilities for the divestiture programme will
be taken over by a Land Management Unit (LMU) which has already been established in the
x



Surveys Department which falls within the portfolio of the MAL. The LMU will have
responsibility for:
(a)   collection of lease/purchase payments,
(b)   conversion of leasehold tenure to freehold tenure,
(c)   monitoring performance of land use, and
(d)   settlement of boundary disputes.
A computerized data base has been set up in the LMU for the purpose of monitoring both land
administration and crop diversification.
The high rainfall and steep slopes on some of the estates have subjected the roads to tremendous
erosion resulting in severe damage. This has already caused an increase in the Government's
recurrent expenditure on road maintenance. Some of the drains in the worst affected areas have
been paved at the Government's expense. The Government plans to seek grant funds from other
sources to finance the surfacing of Projects roads. The undisbursed funds from the Japanese
Grant will be used to finance a study to prepare an inception study report on the maintenance of
feeder and farm access roads, and to identify technical assistance and financing requirements for
the preparation and implementation of a phased labour-based maintenance programme for such
roads.
Most of the equipment purchased for road construction is suitable to carry out maintenance work.
It is estimated that at least 50% of the useful life of the major pieces of equipment remains.
The SAR projected that collections from leases over 20 years would recover 60% of the
discounted present value of the investment and administrative expenses chargeable to the land
divestiture programme. To date, US$69,093 has been collected, representing about 43% of the
total amnount due and payable from leases. It seems that a greater effort has to be made to collect
the outstanding amounts in order to recover some of the Project costs.
V.   Lessons Learned
1.    Diversification is a slow process as farmers are very cautious to adopt new
technologies and production systems relying rather on the cropping systems they
are certain will provide a sustained income.
2.    Government has a potentially positive role to play by giving the appropriate
policy support to the diversification process. Their role also entails investing in
agricultural research and extension, and rural infrastructure such as roads to
facilitate the process.
3.    Improved post-harvest handling and storage facilities, and efficient marketing
systems are important components of the diversification process and must be put
xi



in place to give farmers the confidence to change their cropping patterns.
4.    The quality and availability of marketing information services for non-traditional
crops must be improved. The identification of specific requirements for market
niches and broad scale penetration of foreign markets is also needed.
5.    Agricultural feeder roads and drains in most of the agricultural areas in St.
Vincent and the Grenadines require some sort of paved surface. This has to be
taken into consideration in the planning of road construction so as to reduce the
cost of future maintenance.
VI.   Recommended Follow up Actions
The following are some of the follow up actions that are considered necessary after Project
completion.
1.    Continue the process of registration of leases.
2.    Institute a closely monitored programme for the collection of outstanding amounts
due for leases and amounts currently due.
3.    The Ministry of Agriculture needs to work more closely with collaborating
institutions (CARDI, OECS/ADCU, IICA) and coordinate the work of other
donor agencies to develop appropriate production technologies and ensure that
sustainable production systems are in place on the steep and fragile slopes that
exist on some of the estates.
4.    Develop a market driven production system with appropriate market support to
give farmers the confidence to diversify out of bananas.
5.    The linkages between agriculture and the tourist industry should be strengthened
to increase the viability of the local market and provide farmers with increased
incentives to produce.
6.    Conduct a study to prepare designs, specifications, cost estimates, and economic
analysis for road improvements to minimize future maintenance of the Project
roads.
7.    Strengthen the monitoring and evaluation system within the Ministry of
Agriculture for ongoing evaluation of donor-funded projects and to capture
meaningful data on agricultural diversification.

VII. Conclusion
This has been a well-managed Project with no major implementation problems. All the planned
outputs for the three main components of the Project have been achieved.
The Project did not have the expected impact on agricultural diversification. The overall pace of
the diversification process has been slow. This has been attributed to the fact that the expected
loss of the preferential U.K. market for bananas did not materialize as was expected with the
formation of the single European market in 1992.
The decline in banana prices in 1994 has prompted the SVBGA to reduce the areas targeted for
rehabilitation and replanting, to exclude marginal areas. The recent demands of the market for
much higher fruit quality have put considerable pressure on small producers. These factors are
expected to open up opportunities for expanding the crop diversification efforts already started.
