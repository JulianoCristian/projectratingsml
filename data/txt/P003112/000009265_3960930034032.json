Project constitutes the first five-year phase of a long term\n            support program to strengthen the national agricultural\n            research system in Zaire in order to make it more responsive\n            and relevant to farmers' needs and constraints.  The\n            project will:  (a) support the reorganization of the\n            National Agricultural Research Institute of Zaire (INERA)\n            through:  (i) the integration of all government executed\n            agricultural research activities under a single structure;\n            (ii) the separation of research and station management;\n            (iii) the improvement of communication and information\n            systems and the development of research data bases.  It will\n            also:  (b) strengthen INERA through:  (i) the provision of\n            support for priority research programs focussing upon\n            improved quality and better technology transfer to farmers;\n            (ii) rehabilitation, construction and re-equipping of a\n            network of ten research stations and INERA's\n            headquarters; (iii) support to human resources development\n            through training, scholarships and improvement of conditions\n            of service."}, "docdt": "1991-07-30T00:00:00Z"}
