MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:       Project Completion Note on ZAIRE -
National ALgricultural Research Project (Cr. 2292-ZR)
Attached is the Project Completion Note on Zaire National Agricultural Research
Project (Cr. 2292-ZR) prepared by the Africa Regional Office. Under the circumstances, there is
no Part IL
The project had the objective of reestablishing an agricultural research capacity
responsive to farmers' needs in a cost-effective way. It was to complement Credits for agricultural
extension and rural roads as IDA's basic support strategy for the sector. Preparation was thorough
and the project concept was based on a Research Master Plan prepared with assistance from ISNAR
in 1989. There was effective coordination of all major donors to participate in the project.
Inadequacy of government funding was appreciated as a risk and steps were taken to minimize this
by introducing a monthly payment system to the research agency by govemment. Unfortunately,
social unrest disrupted the program before it was firmly established and in July 1993 the Credit was
suspended; it was eventually canceled in November 1993 due to Zaire's failure to meet its debt
obligation to IDA. The obvious lesson is that reasonable social and economic stability are essential
for successful institutional development.
The project preparation process alone had an institutional impact in reorganizing the
research agency, in obtaining full donor collaboration, and in focussing the research program.
However, the demise of the project has not yet allowed expression of these measures in significant
research output. The project is rated as unsatisfactory and sustainability of even the modest
institutional reforms is uncertain.
The Project Completion Note satisfactorily explains the events surrounding the aborted
project. No audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE
ZAIRE
NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROJECT
(Cr. 2292-ZR)
1.    This is a Project Completion Note for the Zaire National Agricultural Research Project
(Cr. 2292-ZR). The Credit, in the amount of SDR 12.4 million, was approved by the Board
on August 20, 1991 and became effective on December 8, 1992. As with other projects in
Zaire, disbursements were suspended indefinitely on July 15, 1993 (see para. 4). On March 4,
1994, IDA closed the Credit and canceled the undisbursed balance in the amount of SDR 11.5
million (only eight percent had been disbursed, of which three-quarters as part of project
preparation), following Government's failure to meet its debt service obligation to IDA and
the country being placed in non-accrual status on November 15, 1993.
Project Description
2.    The project was appraised in May-June 1990. It was to be the first five-year phase of
implementing the National Agricultural Research Master Plan, prepared by the Borrower with
assistance from the International Service for National Agricultural Research. It was to
provide a means to integrate all ongoing research activities and support Government's policy
of food security and increased cash crop production. It was to focus primarily on adaptive
and applied research and give priority to the needs of small farmers. The project provided for:
(i) the execution of 12 priority research programs; (ii) institutional strengthening through a
reorganization of the implementing agency (the National Agricultural Research Institute,
INERA), strengthening internal and extemal links, provision of technical assistance and
operating funds, and donor coordination; (iii) long-term and short-term training programs; (iv)
the rehabilitation and improvement of physical plant and equipment; and (v) the development
of an internal communication and information system. Total project costs were estimated at
US$65.2 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$26.6 million (42 percent). Other
donors (United Nations Development Program, UNDP; United States Agency for
International Development, USAID; and Belgian and Italian bilateral aid) were expected to
contribute about US$29.0 million to project financing.
Project Implementation
3.    Shortly after Board presentation in August 1991, military-led riots broke out in several
parts of Zaire, which led to widespread looting and the evacuation of most foreigners,
including the research technical assistance staff financed by USAID, and by the Belgian and
Italian governments. Most bilateral donor financing was put on hold (including USAID's
support) and activities related to effectiveness came to a halt. It was therefore not until
December 8, 1992, that conditions for effectiveness were met.

4.    Following effectiveness, project activities moved slowly because of the difficult
political and economic circumstances, which followed the 1991 riots. These included non-
payment of civil servant salaries, lack of counterpart funding (US$10,000 for 1993), liquidity
problems in the banks, which made it impossible to utilize what little counterpart funds were
available, hyper inflation, and the continuing absence of technical staff formerly provided
under bilateral agreements.  Additional riots in January 1993 further complicated project
implementation because of widespread looting and deteriorating security.  On-station
activities, apart from such exceptions as the Mulungu station in the Kivu, which benefited
from regional and international research program funding, were limited to survival. The
leader of the UNDP team, which was to represent the main source of technical support, had
stayed on following the disturbances in 1991 and was joined during 1992 and 1993 by other
team members. Given this support from a major cofinancier, the renewed Italian support for
the rice research program in 1992 and 1993 and confirmed commitment from the project
management team, IDA continued its support for the project through late 1993.
5.    During project implementation, IDA provided funding for consulting services to set up
an accounting system for INERA and to assist in research programming (US$120,000), for
the rehabilitation of the Kiyaka research station (US$100,000), where an Italian upland rice
research team was present, and for incremental operating costs (US$100,000). All other
disbursements (US$870,000) took place against the PPF as part of project preparation.
Disbursements remained low after effectiveness in part because of Project management's
reluctance to commit itself to major new investments given the prevailing political insecurity
and deteriorating institutional relationship between the Bank and the Government of Zaire.
6.    On July 15, 1993, disbursements were suspended, following Government's failure to
meet its debt service obligations to IDA. On November 15, 1993, Zaire was placed in non-
accrual status and the decision was taken by the Bank to close all credits to the country.
Project Achievements
7.    The project appropriately focused on establishing a national approach to agricultural
research, institution building, manpower development and donor coordination. It included
establishing regular and operational links with the national extension service. Agricultural
research was considered a core activity in the lending program, together with extension and
environment, aimed at improving food security and poverty alleviation and for which IDA
support was essential. The project was therefore designed in such a way as to insulate it as
much as possible from the perennial problem of insufficient counterpart funding. The annual
budget approval process involved all cofinanciers and the IDA credit was to represent a safety
net to ensure funding of ongoing research programs, even if other cofinanciers (including the
Government) fell short on their commitments. However, the project could not be fully
insulated from the macro-economic and political environment, which finally accounted for its
demise.
8.    One notable achievement during project preparation was the close collaboration of all
donor agencies funding agricultural research, including agreement to merge independent

research programs under a single national structure. This provided a potentially strong basis
for future coordination. For example, the USAID funded National Service for Agricultural
Research and Extension of the Ministry of Agriculture, merged with INERA to become part
of the national program of agricultural research.
