The project\n            was useful and, by contributing to cash requirements during\n            a period of rapid expansion, helped to establish FONADE\n            (government preinvestment agency) as a central point in\n            project preparation. The transfer of Bank experience in\n            project preparation in general and in certain sectors in\n            particular was only partially successful, due in part to\n            staff changes in FONADE. The main areas which could be\n            addressed by FONADE, apart from internal procedural\n            improvements are: i) institutional assessment of\n            non-traditional sub-borrowers, with technical assistance\n            where required; ii) monitoring report implementation, with\n            early identification of areas of difficulty and technical\n            assistance where required; iii) monitoring of relationships\n            between study forecasts and final outcome, and use of the\n            resultant material to improve study design and supervision;\n            iv) improving access to foreign exchange when required; v)\n            assessing the objectives of the relationship between foreign\n            and local consultants, and serving as a center for\n            suggestions for legislative reform; and vi) further\n            development of FONADE's promotional role to achieve a\n            better sectoral balance of projects."}, "docdt": "1982-11-23T00:00:00Z"}
