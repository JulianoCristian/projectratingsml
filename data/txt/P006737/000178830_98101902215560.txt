INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECONNENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF COLONBIA
FOR A PREINVESTMENT STUDIES PROJECT
1.  -     I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Colombia for the equivalent of US$8.0 mil lion to
help finance a preinvestment studies project.   The loan would have a
term of 20 years, including five years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4%
per annum,
PART I:   THE ECONOMY
2.        The Bank's most recent economic report (Economic Position and
Prospects of Colombia, 138-CO) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on May 18, 1973.   A number of indicators drawn from the economic report
are presented in Annex I.
3.        The Colombian economy has shown impressive gains in the recent
past.   The rate of economic growth has accelerated to more than 7% per
annum, and the expansion of non-traditional exports has been remarkable.
Such improvements are very much needed in order to accelerate employnent
generation.   Colombia also needs to spread more widely benefits from
growth in order to surmount problems of poverty and population pressures in
both rural and urban areas.   Concentration of land ownership, technical
backwardness, and under-employment characterize most rural areas.    In urban
areas, pressures of population growth, compounded by heavy migration from
the countryside, have generated serious unemployment and a severe housing
deficit.   Prospects for coping with these problems seem brighter as a result
of the accelerated growth path upon which the Colombian economy has recently
embarked.
4.        Recent Government administrations have reacted to rural poverty
and urban unemployment in a more systematic fashion than in the past, but
much remains to be done.    In spite of the passage of an Agrarian Reform Law
and the creation of the Agrarian Reform Institute (INCORA) in 1961, only
modest results have been achieved in alleviating rural poverty.    Recently,
additional agriculture legislation has been enacted, enabling a faster advance
in land reform and introducing a tax on presumptive agricultural income. In



- 2 -
recognition of the problems of urban concentration and unemployment the
Government is now placing greater emphasis on urban development, parti-
cularly in the housing field. Through this program it hopes to stimulate
a pattern of demand that will maximize urban employment.   Ihe programs
have necessitated and will continue to require a strengthening of the
fiscal effort.
5.        During the 1969-73 five-year period current revenues of the
national government rose at an average of 9? per annum in real terms
(1973 estimated).  At the latest Consultative Group meeting held ln Jmne
1973, members of the Group expressed the view that growing needs for public
investment and other public expenditures called for increases in domestic
fiscal efforts. The Government expressed the intention to further increase
revenues by new tax measures and by increasing the savings of public enter-
prises.  Action so far has focussed on improving tax administration which should
increase collections. Discussions between the Government and the Bank are continuing.
O.        Colombiafs  efforts to expand exports have been amply rewarded in
recent years.  Nerchandise exports amounted to more than US$1,000 million
in 1973, of which half came from non-coffee items. This represents a
400o increase in such exports since 1965-67, when they averaged just over
US$100 million per year.   Flowers, clothing, emeralds, cotton thread and
cloth, chemical and pharmaceutical products, sawnwood, and wood products
enjoyed particularly large relative gains, although raw cotton, sugar, meat,
and other agricultural products continued to account for the greatest absolute
amounts. Coffee receipts were up purely because of high international prices;
had it no-t been for such favorable prices coffee's relative importance would
have slipped to well below 50%.
7.        The net foreign exchange reserve in the Bank of the Republic at
the end of December was more than US$500 million. This compares very
favorably with the US$345 million held at the end of 1972 and the deficit
positions that were cormon prior to 1968.   it may become increasingly
difficult to maintain these official reserves in the future, however,
because Colombia is expected to become a net importer of crude petroleum
in 1976. Colombia's relatively small annual exports of petroleum are
expected to be reduced to 1.5 - 2.0 million barrels of crude petroleum
in 1974 plus $10 million in petroleum products (mostly fuel oil).   Neither
crude nor products are likely to be available for export in 1975. A high-
LWvel Energy Council is studying exploration incentives, taxation and
forei-n-exchange arrangements, product pricing, and other aspects of this
problem.  Given the lengthy gestation periods that are often encountered
-n the oiL business, however, Colombia may have to import sizable quantities
of crude during the 1976-80 period.   Should world prices remain near the
current high-levels, this could add considerable pressure to the balance
of payments.



- 3 -
8.       nTe rapid growth of Colombia's GDP in 1972-73 was accompanied
by a sharply accelerated rate of price inflation.   Blue-collar consumer
prices jumped 22% in 1973, as compared with 14% in 1972, 12% in 1971, and
an average of 7.5% yearly in 1967-70. Food prices, which have a weight
of 50% in the blue-collar index, increased by 30% in 1973. The authorities
have taken a number of measures to dampen price pressures, including
liberalization of import controls and tightening bank credit, which
together with the good harvests now coming in should slow the rate of
inflation this -rear.
9.        The public external debt repayable in foreign currency amounted
to US$2.2 billion at the end of 1972, or US$1.4 billion excluding un-
disbursed commitments.   Service on this debt is not excessive   (about
13% of foreigrn exchange earnings in 1972), relative to other developing
countries.   Since exports have risen at the same rate as debt service in
recent years there has been no increase in the debt service ratio, at a
time wAhen economic growth has accelerated.   The debt service ratio may
rise to 20-21% in 1977-78 as a result of greater capital inflows associ-
ated with a high growth rate.    Should economic growth continue at a rapid
pace, which appears feasible, and should that growth be accompanied by a
further strong expansion of non-coffee exports and the maintenance of sound
economic and financial policies, Colombia should find it possible to secure
the amounts of external capital it needs and to service the indebtedness.
that this borrowing would generate.    Some of this capital will have to be
provided to finance local costs if foreign assistance is to make a signi-
ficant contribution to projects of high priority such as those in the
social sectors, which frequently have a low foreign exchange componentu
PART II:   BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN COLOMBIA
10o       The proposed loan -- the fifty-sixth to be made to Colombia --
would bring the total amount of Bank loans to Colombia to US$1,080.9
million (net of cancellations).    Of the foregoing amount, US$866.8 mil-
lion is now held by the Bank.    IDA has made one credit ofUS$19.5 million
for highways in Colombia in 1961.
11.       Disbursements have been completed on 31 loans and the one IDA
credit.   IFC has made effective investments and under-writing commit-
ments in 19 enterprises in Colombia, totalling about US$20.0 million of
which IFC now holds US$7.8 million.    Annex II contains a summary state-
ment of Bank loans, the IDA credit, and IFC investments as of December 31i,
2973, and notes on the execution of the 24 on-going projects.

12.       Bank disbursements as a percentage of total disbursements by
official lenders to Colombia are expected to peak at about 40% in 1973-74
and then decline.   The Bank's share of total debt service is projected
to peak at about 31% in 1974-75, and the Bank group share of total debt
disbursed and outstanding can be expected to fall from 28% in 1972 to
24% in 1978.
13.       Over i5he past few years, Bank lending in Colombia has become
increasingly diversified as activities have expanded and as the Bank assumed
greater responsibilities as head of the Consultative Group for Colombia.
Increasingly, projects involving Bank loans in agriculture, industry and the
social sectors were developed. While so far our efforts have been mainly
production-oriented in support of economic growth and related export
expansion objectives, we are now developing projects in such a way as
to combine increasing output with maximum benefits in terms of employment
and improving the income of the poor, particularly in rural areas.
14.       We expect over the next several years to make an increasing
contribution to the agricultural and industrial sectors, with particular
emphasis on projects involving small and medium size farmholdings and
smaller industrial enterprises. The other major focus of our activities
would be in such social sectors as education and water supply, as well
as in other project areas such as the traditional sectors of Bank lending--
electric power and transportation--particularly in cases where support can
be given to surengthening institutional development. In addition, the Bank
would continue to cooperate with the Government in its efforts to improve
the fiscal system and in developing institutions capable of increasing
public savings.  Projects are currently in an advanced stage of preparation



for water su.ply, teIlecorlriun,ications, small scale industry, land settle-
ment and irrigation rehabilitation..
1$.       The operations of' external lenders in Colombia are showni in
Annex I, pages 3-.   Whi3le UBRD, IDB, and A1D provided about four-fifths
of total externTal financing to Colombia in the 1961-71 period, their
share has decreased since then.  The IDB has assisted projects in low-
cost housing, urniversity education, agrarian refor-m, ports, electric
power, water supply, transportation, and industry. AID has shifted the
emphasis o. its lending in recer,t years from program to sector loans,
particularly for education, urban development, and agriculture.
PAIRT III   THE PROJECT
16.       The proceeds of the loan would be used to finance consultan, services
required to perfo.rm preLnvestment studies.  'The loan would be passed as a
grant to the Fondo Nacional de Proyectos de Desarrollo (FONADE), a Gov-
ermient agency whose primary objective is to finance preinvestment studies
of projects which accord with the Government's investment priorities.
FONADE would land the proceeds to agencies (mainly public) carrying out
such studies0   Repayments of capital and interest on the onlent funds
would acc.rue t,o FOIADE 's own resources and wo-u_ld be re-used for further
lending operations.   Loan negotiations were held. in Noveinber 1973.  Tie
Borrower w-as represented by Mr. Cristian Mosquera, of the Ministrg of F.inance,
and the Beneficiar-y was represented by Mre Miguel Rivera.  A l6aA-and project
summary is attached as Annex TII to this report.
Genera   acgond and Purposes6
17.       A sustained preinvestment studies effort designed. to promote
the growth of Colombia's investment program is ijmportant for the steady
flow of well prepared projects susceptible to financing from the Bank.
Consultative Group members and other sources. FONADE -w.7as created to
encourage this flow in an expeditious and orderly manner. Up to now,
external financing of preinvestmnent studies in Colombia has been provided
by a number of sources: the UNDP, bilateral assistance program, the IDB
and the Bank. Bank financing of such studies so far has been included
in loans for specific projec-ts and has been aimed at preparing f'urther
projects in the same sector (and in appropr.iate cases this practice will
continue). - lThe UNDP s indicative planning 'iga.re for its five-year program
in Colombia amounts to $20 million, but only a portion of this will be for



-6-
for studies. The UND? will not be able to fully meet the need for pre-
investment studies and has indicated that it concurs in the Bank under-
taking the proposed loan. Bilateral sources have also financed feasibility
studies, usually on a grant basis and generally in connection with specific
projects for which they have had an interest in providing financing.    The
only general loan for feasibility studies from a bilateral source was from
USA ID which provided US$3 m,illion in 1963, the administration of which was
assumed by FOXAD= when it was established in 1968.    The IDB has provided
financing for studies as components of project loans as well as through two
loans to FONADE, in 196G and 1971 totalling $10.1 million.    The last of
these fu.nds were conmitted by FONADE to specific studies at the end of 1973
18.       FONADE will have insufficient funds from budgetary allocations and
from reflows from its earlior loans to meet the demand of agencies for pre-
investment loan funds.   In seeking further external financing, FONADE has turned
to the Bank in order to benefit from the Bank's approach to and wide expe-
rience in the conduct and supervision of preinvestment studies, particularly
in those areas where its own experience has thus far been limited. Thnese
areas include the urban and agricultural sectors as well as social areas. In
this and in other ways specified in the documents, Bank involvement will con-
tribute to a strengthening of FONADE as an institution.    Another consideration
in FONADE's request for Bank financing is to diversify further its sources
of foreign consultants which have not been fully multilateral, given the
bilateral and regional restrictions placed on the funds provided by its pre-
vious financing sources.
FONADE's Organization and Objectives
19.       FONADE, established by decree in 1968, is an autonomous Government
agency with its o-w-n legal personality and funds.  By financing preinvestment
studies, it has become an important link between government planning and project
implementat-on.  it is emerging as a fore-runner of such institutions in
Latin America.  FNADE3 has provided advice to the Governments of Costa Rica,
Ecuador, 2eru, and the Dominican Republic with respect to establishing
similar instiTutions.



-7-
20.       FOILUJE is well organized and managed.  Its professional staff
is qualified and experienced in the fields where it has been most active.
It is headed by a Board of Directors which approves all loans, and an
Executive Director.   FONADE's organization includes a sub-director, a
legal office, a loan division, and a financial-administrative division.
FCNADE has 12 full-time professionals, but pays the salaries of about 35
mora, organizationally placed in NPD.   This arrangement allows FONAIE to
use, whenever needed, the experience of NPDs total technical staff.   The
salary cost to FONADE was about Col$6 million in 1972.   Though legally an
autonomous Government agency, it operates in close cooperation with NPD.
The Executive Director of FONADE concurrently holds a senior position in
NPD.   The Chief of NPD and some of its senior officials are members of
FONADE's Board.
21.       FONADE approves terms of reference for the studies, the selec-
tion of consultants and the contracts between borrowers and consultants.
It supervises ongoing studies through reviewing intermediate and final con-
sultants reports, but leaves the bulk of detailed supervision to the bor-
rowers.   Where external lenders for projects are identified in advance,
FONADE obtains their participation in the studies at the outset or during
the course of the study.   It has developed experience in drafting terms
of reference and selecting consultants for studies in a number of fields,
particularly infrastructure, but lacks experience in other areas, such as
in major urban studies, agrizulture and some social sectors.   FONADE will
expand its capabilities in these fields, initially by drawing on experts
in governmental agencies and by utilizing consultants while building up its
own staff.   The Bank staff would help FONADE to strengthen its lending
capabilities by reviewing terms of reference, approving consultants and
reviewing progress and final reports.
22.       Procedures for selecting consultants are consistent with Bank
policy.   FO0NADE keeps a register of consultants who have submitted satis-
factory information on their organization and past experience.    Consultants
from all countries are free to apply.   At present, about 500 consultants
are registered, of which 250 are foreigners.   For each preinvestment study
proposal over US$100,000 equivalent a short list of consultants with capa-
bility in the particular field concerned is drawn up and proposals are
invited.   The contract is awarded to the firm selected by the borrower, on
the basis of its qualifications to perform the study, and approved by FONADE.
It is FONADE's intention to invite consultants from Bank member countries and
Switzerland to submit their particulars for this register.
23.       FONADE's operating regulations have been reviewed and are con-
sidered satisfactory, having served as a basis for the fruitful use of the
funds borrowed earlier from AID and the IDB.   They will be modified slightly
to conform with the conditions of a Bank loan.



-8-
FONADE's Resources and Past Operations
24.       In the five years from 1968 to 1972, FONADE's financial re-
sources have come from (a) allocations in the National Budget (28%);
(b) external loans (42%); and (c) income from its lending activities and
loan repayments (30%).  Annual allocations from the Government Budget
so far have totalled Col$94 million.  External loans from IDB
(US$4.1 million in 1968 and US$6 million in 1971 ), and USAID (US$3
million in 1963) have been obtained by the Government and the proceeds
of these loans have been passed on to FONADE in the form of grants for
onlending to finance preinvestment studies.  The USAID and the first
IDB loan have been fully disbursed.  The second IDB loan was _fuUly
committed around the end of 1973 and should be disbursed by January
1975. Interest and capital repayments on FONADE's loans represent its
second major source of funds and will soon become the largest as repay-
ments of loans increase.   So far, there have been no defaults on
repayments.   (FONADE's cash flow for the period 1970-77 and balance
sheet for 1972 are attached in Annexes IV and V.)
25.       FONADE has three separate funds for its operations: the
Ordinary Fund (75% of previous lending); the Special Fund (25%); and
the Fund for Non-Reimbursable (Grant) Studies (less than 0.5%). The
terms of the Special Fund are somewhat softer than those of the Ordi-
nary Fund.. They are at present as follows:
Ordinary Fund Special Fund
Maximium amortization period                   7 years       10 years
4a.ximum grace period                          2 years       2 years
Interest rate p.a.                             10-15%        9-14%
Commitment fee on undisbursed balance          1-1/2%        1%
Interest rate p.a. on balance in default       24%           24%
Terms of individual loans are adapted to the specific conditions of the
studies and projects in question.  The interest rate policy will be mod-
ified as described in para. 3h.
26.      The Ordinary Fund is used for feasibility studies in all
sectors and has been financed by the loan proceeds of the two IDB loans,
Government allocations, and repayments and interests on loans made from
it.   The Special Fund is designed primarily for the promotion of
studies where agencies' financial resources are very limited and where
they require encouragement to undertake particular studies of high
national priority.   Resources for the Special Fund come mainly from
repayments on the USAID loan and from Government allocations.  Although
in the early years of FONADE the Special Fund was used extensively, in
the past two and a half years only 15% of FONADE's lending was through
this fund.   The Fund for Non-Reimbursable Studies is very small and is



-9-
used very sparingly for studies which car be financed only on a grant
basis.   The resources of this fund come exclusively from Government
contributions.
27.       By December 31, 1973, FONADE had approved 153 studies, whose
total cost will amount to about US$29 million equivalent.    About 30%
of total studies costs have been financed by the borrowers.    By mid-
1973 about 100 studies had been completed and 60 of these studies will
result in investments of about US$670 million equivalent in projects,
when they are completed.   Under the terms of the Bank loan, FONADE
would report on follow-up investments which result from its studies
28.       So far, FONADE has been financing studies in many sectors,
but has given particular emphasis to power, water, sewerage and roads.
Studies previously financed had led to Bank lending in water supply to
medium size cities. Studies currently underway cover several projects
for which the Government has approached the Bank for financing.    These
include a second water supply project, a highway improvement project,
an urban development study in Cartagena and a tourism facilities study
on the Atlantic Coast.
29.       FONADE finances only consultants' costs and does not cover
administrative costs of the borrowers.    It finances up to 80% of the
consultant's costs and in exceptional cases, when the study is of high
priority but the borrower has no possibility to raise funds in the
short run, up to 100%.   Loans can be made to both public and private
entities.   Most loans have gone to the public sector, since few private
enterprises have applied for FONADE financing.   However, FONADE has
provided lines of credit to development finance companies for lending
to loan applicants who require study funds.
FOIADE's Projected Operations
30.        During the past six years FONADE has approved an average of 25 loans
for preinvestment studies per year. Thirty-seven studies were approved in both
1972 and 1973.   FONADE has been increasing its capacity to screen,
analyze and process study proposals and to supervise their execution.
The average number of studies approved each year is expected to
increase tQ over 4Q within the next five years.   FONADE estimates
a lending program of about 110 studies during the period 1974-76.    In
October 1973, FONADE's list of proposed studies at various stages in
the screening process numbered 68,   These studies, together with new
proposals received and developed during the nexst three years, minus
those proposals which slip or are denied for various reasons, would
comprise the lending program during the time period.    Since FONAIE
both responds to requests for financing and promotes the undertaking



- 10 -
of studies by agencies in certain areas of particular interest, all of
the studies to which funds will be committed cannot be determined at
the present time. Annex VI indicates the areas of previous and future
FONADE loan activity.
31.       FONADE's operational program will be developed in accordance
with requests to it by Dorrowing agencies. FONIADE intends to consult
with the Bank periodically about its future program. A number of studies
which are expected to be financed by FONADE and are likely to lead to
projects requiring external financing by the Bank and other lenders have
been defined. Among them are:   (a) studies for the national rural develop-
ment program;  (b) studies for the development plans of metropolitan areas;
(c) special studies stemming from the UMDP financed and Bank executed
study of urban development in Bogota; (d) specific rural roads;
(e) detailed engineering studies for the paving program portion of the
Seventh Highway Project;  (f) preparation of forestry projects;  (g) the
Honda hydlroelectric project on the Magdalena river; (h) the hydroelectric
utilization of the rivers La Miel, Guarino, Manso and Moro;  (i) specific
urban water and sewerage systems; and (j) underground water studies, etc.
32.       In order to assure that Government Ministries and Agencies
benefit from preinvestment studies prepared earlier, and to avoid
duplication and overlap, FONADE has agreed to catalog such studies.
Data collected in the archive would be drawn upon by FONADE and other
public institutions undertaking studies.   Another method to avoid
duplication and to foster coordination in the field of preinvestment
studies will be the participation in FONADi3's review of applications
for subloans of representatives from Ministries concerned with the
particular area under consideration.
33.       The increase in FONADE's operations between 1972 and 1978
will be substantial, both because of the rising number of studies to
be financed and because of increasing cost per study. 1 Commitments
for new studies are estimated to grow from about Col$200 million in
1974 to about Col$350 million in 1977.   Assuming similar disbursement
patterns as in the past, these commitments, together with disbursements
from earlier commitments will result during 1974-1978 in disbursements
in the order of Col$l165 million, to which about Col$80 million in
administrative cost should be added.   These total financial re-
quirements could be met as follows: 2/
1/ The increase is due to inflation, inclusion of one very large
study (Second Phase of Bogota Urban Study), and to a decline
in the number of very small studies.
2/ All data in current pesos.    For detail see Annex IV.

Thus, although interest and other income of FONADE as well as loan
repayments would increase rapidly and government contribttions would
continue at about the same level as in the past, a financing gap of
Col$225 million would remain.   The proposed Bank loan of US$8.0
million would cover the additional financial requirements of Col$225
million (see Annex VI for exchange rates).   It would also include
technical assistance in an amount of $300,000.   This technical
assistance financing would allow FONADE to employ consultants when it
lacks sufficient experience to review terms of reference in partic-
ular areas to evaluate and supervise preinvestment studies when
proposed studies are especially complex.   It would also include
technical assistance to FONADE, to set up the catalog of preinvestment
studies mentioned in para. 32 above.
The Terms of the Proposed Loan
34.        The proposed loan would be made to the Government of Colombia,
repayable over 20 years, including five years of grace. The term is
justified on general external debt grounds, and by the length
of time it will take for the country to reap the benefits of the invest-
ments which will result from the studies undertaken. The proceeds of the
will be passed on by the Government to FONADE as a grant. Repay-
ments of and interest on subloans would accrue to FONADE's resources
and would be available for further lending operations. Ninety percent
of the proceeds of the loan would be used for lending operations from
the Ordinary Fund and 10% for operations from the Special Fund. On-lending
terms would be the same as described in para. 25 except for the interest
rates which would be a minimum of 15% for lending from the Ordinary Fund
and 10% from the Special Fund, thus conforming to FONADE's most recent
practice. These interest rates would apply to all of FONADE's lending
program.



-, 12 -
35.       Of the subloans financed under the Bank loan, FONADE would submit
half for prior Bank approval, including all loans above US$300,000.    This
would mean that about 20 of the estimated 40 subloans financed by the Bank
would receive prior review.    The Bank would in a first stage review the sub-
ject of the study, the terms of reference, the estimated cost of the study,
the short list of consultants and decide on approval after a second phase review
of study cost, selection of consultants, the contracts between FONADE and the
borrowers, and between the borrowers and consultants.    Progress and final
reports would also be reviewed by the Bank.   The subloans committed during
1974-76 will result in disbursements through 1978.
36.       The Bank loan will cover 50% of the total cost, or the foreign
exchange cost, whichever is higher, of each study to be financed under
the Bank loan, up to a total of US$7.7 million, with FONADE puttinig up
on the average 20% and the Sub-Borrower the remaining 30%. It will also
finance 70% of the cost of technical assistance to FONADE, up to a limit
of US$300,000 equivalent. To make it possible for FONADE to finance the
studies for the Seventh Highway Project and for a hydroelectric power
plant, the loan documents provide for retroactive financing, up to the
amount of US$350,000 from January 1, 1974.
37.       As stated in para. 22, the consultant firms performing the studies
will be selected by FONADE's borrowers on the basis of their qualifications.
Although foreign firms will have the opportunity to make their talents
and availability known to FONADE and its borrowers, most of the consultants
chosen by borrowers are likely to be Colombian because there are qualified
local firms in many fields. Foreign consultants will be involved in a
number of studies either individually, jointly with Colombian firms or
sub-contracted by such firms, in areas where the competence and experience
of local firms are limited,especially in newer fields such as urban studies.
However, it is not possible at this stage to estimate with any precision
the proportion of Bank loan disbursements which would be destined for
foreign exchange expenditures. FON-ADE's experience with the utilization
of IDB loans suggests that apnroximately 25% of the cost of its studies
was for foreign services. In the case of the Bank loan, this proportion
may be higher because of the expansion into unfamiliar areas.
PART IV:  LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
38.       The draft. Loan Agreement between the Republic of Colombia and
the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and FONADE as well
as the Report of the Committee provided for in Article !II, Section 4(iii),
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft Resolution approving
the proposed loan, are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
39.      'The draft Agreements contain provisions to reflect the various
arrangements described in Part III above and conform to the normal patterns
for loans for technical assistance projects.



- 13 _
40.       I amn satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V: RECOMMENDATION
41.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION!!
Summarized below is the current status oi ail loans signea but
not fully disbursed:
Ln No. 502     Irrigation (Atlantico I); US$9.0 million, June 1967.
Closing Date: Original - December 31, 1973; Current -
December 31, 1974.
As a consequence of various unforeseen problems, implementation
of the first phase of the project financed under Ln. No.502 has fallen two
and a half years behind schedule.   However, since the last supervision
mission, INCORA. has made arrangements to strengthen project manageaent and make
the supporting services more effective. Civil works are expected to be com-
plete by mid-1974 so that full irrigation becomes technically possible on about
3,750 ha in the second semester of 1974.
Ln No. 536     Water Supply (Bogota I); US$14.0 million, June 1968.
Closing Date: Original - June 30, 1973; Current -
June 30, 1974.
The major part of the First Bogota Project is in operation. Water
service in most areas which had poor service is rapidly improving.    Minor works
still remaining will be completed in the early part of 1974.    The Closing Date
has been postponed to permit completion of the project and payment to suppliers.
Ln No. 550     Highways V; US$17.2 million, July 1968.    Closing Date:
Original - June 30, 1973; Current - June 30, 1974.
There have been substantial cost overruns and delays in the civil
works financed under this loan.    The project is about 95% complete.
Ln No. 552     Education I; US$6.6 million, July 1968.   Closing Date:
December 31, 1973
The original loan amount was US$7.6 million, but US$1.0 million was
cancelled on September 10, 1973.   School construction is completed and all
furniture and equipment have been delivered to the schools.    Withdrawal
applications to cover the remaining expenditures to be financed under the
project will be accepted, if submitted prior to the end of April 1974.    All
ten schools included in the project have been in operation since January 1972.
Ln No. 575     Electric Power (Interconnection); US$18.0 million, December 1968.
Closing Date; December 31, 1974.
The original project is in satisfactory operation.    The Bank agreed
that an undisbursed balance could be used to finance a 230 kV transmission line,
Guatape-Barrancabermeja, which should be completed by late 1974.
Ln No. 624     Agricultural Credit II, US$17.0 million, June 1969.   Closing Date:
Original - December 31, 1973;  Current - December 31, 1974.
After disappointing performance in the first three years, changes in
project management and organization and an increase in technical personnel pro-
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the pro-
gress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems which are
being encountered1 and the action being taken to remedy them. They should be read
in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not purport to present
a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

vided the basis in February 1973 for the Bank's agreement to enlarge
the project area and include lending to small farmers under the project.
As a result, the project is now proceeding in a satisfactory manner.
Ln No. 625     Development Finance Companies III;  US$25.0 million, June
1969.   Closing Date - June 30, 1974.
The loan is fully committed to sub-projects.,
Ln No. 651     Livestock II; US$18.3 million, December 1969. Closing
Date - July 31, 1975.
After earlier difficulties, the project is now proceeding satis-
factorily, partly because of modifications agreed to between the Bank and
Caja in October 1972.   These included the appointment of a single Project
Director with overall responsibility for the project, extension of the
project area to the entire country, and the application of more flexitle
lending terms.   The number of loans approved in 1973 exceeded the level
achieved in 1972 by almost 80% and disbursements are expected to be completed
by the end of 1975.
hun No. 679    Education II; US$6.5 million, June 1970.  Closing Date:
Original - June 30, 1973; Current - June 30, 1974.
All nine schools have been in operation since January 1973 and con-
struction has been completed on seven.   All furniture and almost all equip-
ment have been contracted, and are now being delivered.
Ln No. 680     Highways VI, US$32.0 million, June 1970. Closing Date -
November 30, 1974.
The Paving Program, the largest element of the project, has been
seriously delayed and there have been substantial cost overruns.   It has
already been necessary to have approximately 270 km of the 1600 km Paving
Program rebid and further rebidding is likely on several sections.   Of the
other two components of the project, the Barranquilla Bridge has been virtu-
ally completed and work is progressing fairly well, although behind schedule,
on the El Pailon-Buenaventure road.
Ln No. 681     Chivor Hidroelectric Power; US$52.3 million, June 1970.
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
Progress of the main civil works contract is generally satisfactory
and bidding for the rest of the civil works is proceeding as planned. Higher
than expected prices for equipment due partly to currency revaluations together
with changes in the access road program has resulted in a substantial increase
of the total cost of the pro,ect.   An estimate as of June 1973 put the
increase at US$25.0 million but following more recent currency adjustments,
the increase would be somewhat less. The Bank reassessed the economic and



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 7
financial viability of the project in terms of the earlier estimate of
the cost overruns and found that Chivor I remains a better solution than
a thermal plant that would play an equivalent role within the system.
Ln No. 682     Cali Water Supply and Sewerage; US$18.5 million, June 1970.
Closing Date - June 30, 1974.
Notwithstanding the fact that the Project started far behind
schedule because of a change in the municipal government after the loan
was signed, noticeable efforts have since been made to speed up the pace and
EMCALI's performance continues to improve.   Construction is expected to be
completed by December 1975.
Ln No. 738     Palmira Water Supply and Sewerage; US$2.0 million, May 1971.
Closing Date - March 1, 1975.
Construction on this project was delayed at the outset because of
slow project design and administrative problems of the Borrower.   All the
equipment has been contracted and most of it has arrived or has been shipped.
Construction is expected to start shortly on the new water treatment plan
and on the treated water pipeline.   Recent tariff increases and other
corrective measures are improving the financial situation of the Borrower.
Ln No. 739     Land Settlement Caqueta I; US$8.1 million, may 1971.
Closing Date - April 30, 1975.
50% of appraisal objectives for the first half of the project period
have been achieved. Provision of credit to farmers is being accelerated as
administrative problems are resolved, but road construction has met with un-
expectedly difficult physical problems which will not be made good in the
time remaining.   Additionally, because of considerable price increases, the
loan, disbursed at the current rate, will finance only 70% of original project
objectives.   Despite these problems, the project is contributing signifi-
cantly to the successful colonization of the area.   A second phase project
is being appraised in January/February, 1974.
Ln No. 740     Telecommunications II; US$15.0 million, May 1971.
Closing Date - June 30, 1975.
Due to initial delays in the procurement of project equipment, a
slippage of about one year in the completion date of some works on the project
is ncw anticipated.
Ln No. 741     Water Supply (Bogota II); US$88.0 million, May 1971.
Closing Date - June 30, 1978.
The principal civil works component of this project, the Chingaza
tunnel construction is seriously behind schedule but the contractors have
taken additional measures to improve performance, the results of which will
be reviewed by the Bank in March 1974.   The Borrower's financial position has
weakened but a decision to increase tariffs and other measures promise to bring
about an improvement within the next few months.



ANNEX II

Ln No. 742     Development Finance Companies IV; US$40.0 million,
May 1971.   Closing Date - December 31, 1974.
This loan is fully committed.   Disbursements are ahead of
schedule.
Ln No. 842     Development Program and Expansion Project; US$60.0 million,
June 1972.   Closing Date - Lecember 31, 197h.
The second tranche (US$30.0 million) of this loan was cancelled
because coffee prices exceeded the upper limit setJ in the Loan Agreement
for release of the second tranche.   The US$20.0 million under the program
component of the first tranche of the Loan has been fully disbursed. Com-
mitments under its US$10.0 million export expansion project component are
progressing substantially on schedule.
Ln No. 849     Irrigation (Atlantico II), US$5.0 million, June 1972.
Closing Date - March 31, 1978.
Construction of .lrainage works has fallen considerably behind
schedule, but INCORA has taken appropriate steps to improve the contractor's
performance.   A revised plan for the implementation of the other project
components is in process of being finalized.    Although it is too early to
pass judgement on the progress in agricultural development in this area, the
envisaged land use pattern in the Stage II area will be less intensive than
originally assumed because of soil limitations.
Ln No. 860     Medium-size Cities Water Supply and Sewerage Project;
US$9.1 million, October 1972.   Closing Date - September 30,
1976.
The Borrower experienced difficulties in the initial phase of the
project owing mainly to the failure of water demand to increase as much as
had been expected.   Administrative and financial problems were also encoun-
terec.   The stationing of a Bank water supply specialist in Bogota has helped
solve these problems.   Construction of all subprojects is now proceeding.
Ln No. 874     Guatape II Hydroelectric Power Project; Us$56.o million,
January 1973    Closing Date - December 31, 1978.
Construction of the Project is slightly ahead of schedule. Constant
attention is being given to problems in connection with resettlement of villages
to be inundated, so as not to cause delays in the filling of the reservoir. The
Borrower's financial situat-ion has deteriorated but a tariff increase made in
August 1973 is helping to improve its finances.
Ln No. 903     Development Finance Companies V; US$60.0 million, May 1973.
Closing Date - June 30, 1977.
This loan was decLared effective on November 9, 1973.    About US$3.5
million have been committed since that date.

Ln No. 920     Education III; US$21.2 million, July 1973.
Closing Date - June 30, 1977,
This loan became effective on January 10, 1973.   Project imple-
mentation is already under way.
In No..926     Sixth Railway Project; US$25.0 million, August 1973.
Closing Date - June 30, 1976.
This loan became effective on December 6, 1973.   Tender documents
have been issued for rails as well as accessories and machinery for track
rehabilitation.

CASH FLOW FOR FONADE
Assumptions
1.   Government contributions will remain at about the same level for the
next four years.
2.   Inflationary cost increases for the studies will be about 15 percent
through 1975, and from then on about 10% per annum.
3.   The number of loans approved each year will increase from an average
of 30 in 1971/72 to about 40 in 1977.
4.   The studies will, on the average, with a lag of half a year after
approval, draw 40% of the disbursements in the first year, and 40%
and 20% in the second and third year respectively.
5.   The weighted average of the terms of the loans, will be two years grace
plus five years repaymernts.
6.   The interest rate will on the average be 15%, and has been calculated
on the outstanding loan amount at end of previous year.
7.   The proportion of reserves kept in bonds should be as high as possible,
to get the best interest.    Bonds yield 11%, deposits in Banco de la
Republica yield nothing.
8.   Loans covered by IDB will have to be disbursed by the end of 1974, to
meet the closing date.
9.   FONADE will need to keep a reserve equal to about three months dis-
bursements. In the past these reserves have been considerably larger.
By 1978 new financing will have to be secured.
10.   The exchange rates used to estimate the loan amount in U.S. dollars,
are based on a yearly increase of 7.8%. This is the actual increase
between September 30, 1972 and September 30, 1973.

11.    IThe sharp increase in estimated disbursements for 1974 is based on
three factors:
(a)  Commitments have increased sharply during 1972 and 1973.  (See
Annex VI, Table 2).
(b) Disbursements in 1973 are affected by the low amount of conmit-
ments made in 1971, while disbursements for 1974 will be
influenced mainly by commitments made during 1972-1974.
(c) Special attention is being given to meet the Closing Date for
disbursements under the IDB loan at the end of 1974.
