PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COLOMBIA - LOAN 971-CO
PREINVESTMENT STUDIES PROJECI
PREFACE
Loan 971-CO for the Preinvestment Studies Project, in the
amount of US$8 million, was signed in March 1974 and was fully dis-
bursed in December 1979 with a delay of 12 months. The main objectives
of the loan were to provide financing to public agencies and private
industry for project preparation through FONADE, and to strengthen
FONADE institutionally. During implementation, the project was
expanded and the Bank participated in the financing of more studies
than originally anticipated.
This Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the
Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office, based on the findings
of a mission mounted in December 1980. No comments were received from
the borrower.
The project has not been subjected to OED audit.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COLOMBIA - LOAN 971-CO
PREINVESTMENT STUDIES PROJECT
HIGHLIGHTS
Loan 97L-CO, in the amount of US$8.0 million, was
approved in March 1974 to help finance the preparation of project
pipeline through the Government preinvestment agency, FONADE,
including $300,000 for technical assistance to FONADE.
While during appraisal there was a feeling that the pro-
ceeds of the loan should be partially directed towards the non-
traditional sectors, in the end complete freedom of sectoral
allocation was aLlowed. Bank involvement followed very closely
the distribution of the borrower's operations as a whole, in
which the most significant change over the period was the
increase in the power sector and the decrease in transportation.
Unfortunately the organization of FONADE does not cover
follow up of studies, so the usefulness of these studies them-
selves cannot be gauged. However, most of the studies appeared
to be executed efficiently and to cover priority projects.
FONADE functioned satisfactorily as implementing agency,
but efforts during supervision to increase its impact through the
development of specific preinvestment expertise had only limited
success.
The Technical Assistance component to FONADE, covering
a study inventory, a consultants register, and specific study
evaluations were well executed, but there has been no follow up
by FONADE.
Aspects of this experience that may be of special interest
are:
- The need to pay attention to issues other than provis-
ion of finance in designing preinvestment operations
(paras. 4.1-3)
- The complexity of administrating this type of project
within the Bank (paras. 4.9-11).
- The potential impact of Preinvestment Funds (Annex III).



I. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Background
1.1       A sustained preinvestment studies effort designed to promote the
growth of Colombia's investment program was considered important for the
steady flow of well prepared projects susceptible to financing from the
Bank, Consultative Group members -and other sources. Bank financing
of such studies had been included in loans for specific projects and
had been aimed at preparing further projects in the same sector. This
system however lacked flexibility, as the project to be prepared had
to be identified at the same time as the project on which it was to be
"piggy-backed" was appraised, and had to be in the same sector.
1.2       The Government recognized this problem and in 1968 established
a Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo (FONADE) as an autonomous Government agency,
with the objective of providing finance for project preparation.
1.3       In that year, FONADE received a loan of $4.1 million    from the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and a further $6 million in 1971.
FONADE's organization includes a sub-director, a legal office, a loan
division, and a financial-administrative division. It operates in close
cooperation with the National Planning Directorate (NPD). The Chief of
NPD and some of its senior officials are members of FONADE's Board. Its
borrowers are Ministries, parastatal organizations, local government
authorities and private industry.
1.4       FONADE approves terms of reference for the studies, the selection
of consultants and the contracts between borrowers and consultants. It
supervises ongoing studies through reviewing intermediate and final consultants
reports, but leaves the bulk of detailed supervision to. the borrowers. Where
external lenders for projects are identified in advance, FONADE obtains
their participation in the studies at the outset or during the course of
the study.
1.5       FONADE has three separate funds for its operations:    the Ordinary
Fund; the Special Fund; and the Fund for Non-Reimbursable (Grant) Studies.
The Ordinary Fund is used for feasibility studies in all sectors. The
Special Fund is designed primarily for the promotion of studies where
agencies' financial resources are very limited and where they require
encouragement to unclertake particular studies of high national priority.
The Fund for Non-Reimbursable Studies is small and is used very sparingly
for studies which can be financed only on a grant basis.
1.6       FONADE finances only consultants' costs and does not cover
administrative cost; of the borrowers. It finances up to 80% of the
consultants' costs and in exceptional cases, when the study is of high
priority but the borrower has no possibility to raise funds in the short
run, up to 100%.



-2-
Preparation
1.7       In its economic mission in 1970 the Bank discussed the advantages
of centralizing the preinvestment process with the NPD, and the possibility
of the Bank's financing such studies was raised. The current portfolio
and future plans of FONADE were discussed, and comments were made on the
weakness of the program in agriculture, health, education and urban/regional
development.
1.8       Three years later, at the time of appraisal, IDB funds had
already been committed, but the weakness noted above remained. However,
with an ambitious program of expansion FONADE needed to find alternative
sources of finance, if possible without the restrictions attached to the
bilateral sources which it was also utilizing.
Appraisal
1.9       Preliminary discussions were held with FONADE in July 1973.   There
were five missions of identification and appraisal between July 2, 1973
and October 26, 1973. These missions, except for the first, were not
entirely devoted to the appraisal of the project, most of them being limited
to discussions with specific sectorial projects staff, in Colombia for
other reasons, regarding the proposed list of projects to be studied.
1.10      The main issues remained the balance of the program, whether
there should be mandatory proportionate sectorial assignments, whether
projects should be prepared for Bank finance only, and the reporting
requirements. In the end program control was left completely flexible, and
project selection independent of the Bank's willingness to finance
implementation.
1.11      Negotiations were held in December 1973 and the project was
approved on March 5, 1974.
Project Objectives
1.12      The objectives of the Loan were given in para. 18 of the President's
Report.  They were:
a)  to support FONADE's cash flow;
b)  to allow FONADE to benefit from Bank experience in project
preparation in general;
c)  to transfer Bank experience in the urban, agricultural and
social areas in particular; and
d)  to diversify FONADE's sources of foreign consultants (to escape
from tied aid).



- 3 -
1.13      It should be noted here that, while there is frequent mention
in internal Bank memoranda prior to ,he production of the President's
Report of the desirability of using the loan for institution building
as much as for specific project preparation, the areas of the corresponding
involvement were never defined, and there was no provision in the legal
documents on this matter.
II. PROJECT EXECUTION
Execution of Project
2.1       The first year disbursements were estimated during appraisal
at $1.1 m. In fact, the first disbursement request was not received
until two years after signature, in spite of the fact that several studies
were under way by that time. FONADE tended to use its own local funds
when available, and permission to disburse foreign exchange took a long
time to obtain. However, the disbursements reached a total of $1.32 m
within eight months thereafter.
2.2       Once disbursements were under way their rate exceeded that
forecast due partly to the fact that once sub-projects actually started
they departed very little from their individual schedules; partly to the
fact that in the last year, the Bank supported a larger number of projects
at a lower overall percentage, so that individual slippages where they
occurred, had a reduced effect.
2.3       Not only was the adherence to schedules of the sub-projects
good; the total difference between actual and estimated sub-project cost
over the whole project was only 22% in spite of an inflation rate which
averaged 25.5% p.a. Half of this increase occurred in the three electrical
interconnection sub-projects which accounted for 31% of the total costs.
The average rate for the rest was therefore 16%. Furthermore, most of
the differences arose either through extensions of the study areas or
through the reorganization of work resulting from the inability to use
foreign consultants (see 2.16 below). In most cases, the additional
costs were met by the sub-borrower.
2.4       Repayments from sub-borrowers were prompt, indicating that
financial assessment and guarantees required were adequate.
2.5       Only one project (Bogota Hospital - No. FO 188) did not
proceed beyond the study, the rest advancing to the next stage in the
project cycle. This does not necessarily mean construction however. Most
of the hydroelectric studies were undertaken to determine potential and
the Government is in the course of determining the order of construction.



- 4 -
2.6       The total value of constructionlimplementation of projects
studied is about $5,500 m. This is several times what would be
expected from $27 m. worth of studies. General Bank experience,
confirmed by consultants making the register of previous studies in
Colombia, would indicate that the studies would normally result in
projects valued at only about a fifth of that -around $1,000 m. The
difference however is due to the fact that many of the studies, especially
in the power sector, were only concerned with one aspect of the project
and were not complete in themselves. All were, however, considered
appropriate by the relevant sectoral division in the Bank.
2.7       The relationship for the non-power sector studies was nearer
the normal -$12 m in studies leading to $1,222 m of works (instead of
$500 m.). The difference here is partly due to the relatively low cost
of local consultants, partly to the degree of definition, partly to the
existence of earlier studies.
2.8       Two studies were included as a technical assistance component
-an evaluation of some earlier studies, and a general inventory of studies.
These were well executed and potentially useful. Their impact is discussed
below (3.7-3.10 and Appendix 2, Section 3).
Documentation
2.9       The Project Agreement required presentation to the Bank of the
following documentation for the approval of sub-loans:
i) a description of the sub-borrower;
ii) a description of the sub-project (including its cost);
iii) the terms and conditions of the sub-loan, including the
schedule of amortization for the sub-loan;
iv) full information on the consultants, including their terms
of reference (TOR) or other terms and conditions of their
employment; and
v) such other information as the Bank shall reasonably request.
2.10      The timing for the above was not specified.   All the documents were
thus often presented after the consultants' contract had been signed, so
that the Bank was faced with a "take it or leave it"' situation. However,
especially in the Power and Transport sectors, the Bank had had advance
indications from the sub-borrower, so that final approval, at least of the
rORs, was generally a formality.
2.11      The high proportion of local consultants made helpful Bank intervention
in the drawing of short lists unlikely. The Bank in some instances advised
FONADE to limit the number of consultants included in the lists, but such



- 5 -
advice was not followed. The final decision rested with the sub-borrower,
so that in the absence of a contractual provision in the Bank's Loan
Agreement, it was not enough to convince FONADE.
2.12      Final reports were only supplied on request.   There was no
regular reporting by FONADE on progress. Here again the deficiency was
to some extent remedied by the sectoral division/sub-borrower relationship.
2.13      Audit reports of FONADE as a whole were supplied regularly.
2.14      A full program of identified projects for possible future lending
was only provided twice. As a large number of these still remain unfunded,
they may still cover a significant proportion of future work. There is
however currently no annual updating of the schedule, hence no indication
of what has been dropped or what new projects are being considered.
Procurement
2.15      The Bank has only recently started to concern itself with actual
consultant selection procedures. Accordingly, reports on the evaluation
of proposals were not provided for in the agreement, nor were they requested.
2.16      There were cases (FO 169, 244, 245 in Appendix 2) where consultants
once selected -and contracted- had to be dismissed because the Government
taxation provisions for foreign consultants made it impossible for them to
continue.
Disbursements
2.17      Even though the foreign exchange requirements of the sub-projects
were more than covered by the Bank loan, payments in foreign currency were
subjected to the fuLl weight of control procedures. The need for Ministry
of Finance permission to incur obligations in foreign currency was a
frequently cited reason by FONADE for delays in signing contracts. This
nullifies one of the possible advantages of Bank finance.
Performance
2.18      There were no sub-borrower complaints or disputes under any of
the sub-loans. The Bank was, however, disappointed that much of the highway
design and engineering had to be redone.
Impact
2.19      One of the objectives of the loan was to change the sectoral
balance of studies. As can be seen from Appendix 1, Table 2 this was not
achieved. For example, agricultural studies accounted for 5.5% of the



total over the first five years of FONADE operations. They were forecast
to increase to 24.9% but in fact, in 1979, only amounted to 3.1% (the
proportion of the Bank Loan was 6.8%). The proportion allocated to Urban
and Regional Development in 1979 showed an improvement over the earlier
years (18.2% as against 15.4%) but was also far below the target of 44.8%,
while Bank participation in financing studies for the sector was minimal
(4.8%). The impediments to improved distribution are largely on the side
of the sub-borrowers and reflect weaknesses in one or more out of identification,
planning, finance and execution capabilities (see Appendix III, 3.2 et seq.).
2.20      Another objective was to make it easier to employ foreign consultants
where appropriate. This also was not achieved, foreign costs accounted for
only 12% of the total cost of sub-projects -as against 25% forecast in the
President's Report (para. 37).
2.21      The Bank loan conditions tended to favor employment of foreign
consultants, since 100% of foreign exchange costs and only 50% of local were
financed. However, partly as a result of higher cost and partly because of
a tax on foreign consultancy which made them even more expensive to use
(40% tax, requiring a 67% surcharge), only 41% of the loan was disbursed for
foreign costs.
2.22      The extra cost of foreign consultants should be a sufficient
disincentive where there is no techrical necess:ty to emplc
impossible to prove rigorously that the tax has adverse effects on project
design, but the size of the tax, and the necessity of using foreign consultants
all the same in several of the sub-projects does support the hypothesis that
foreign intervention is below the optimum level, both for project design and
for technology transfer.
2.23      The experience of implementing this project, and similar ones in
other countries, has identified wider possible areas of impact. These are
treated under "Institution Building" below.
III. BORROWER PERFORMANCE AND INSTITUTION BUILDING
Sub-borrower Relations
3.1       Relations with sub-borrowers were good.   FONADE acts only as a
lender and does not attempt to review the technical decisions of its clients
or follow-up on the implementation of the conclusions of the studies it
finances.
3.2       There was nothing in the project design to speed-up sub-loan
processing. This was a pity, as the lead time is still too long for
FONADE to replace UNDP and piggy backing as a convenient method of financing
project preparation on a routine basis. Improvements would also generally
help increase the impact of FONADE. However, there has been no shortage of
business and it will be difficult to encourage faster processing.



-7-
Promotion
3.3       On  of the reasons for the initial slowness of the disbursements
was the lack of requests for sub-loans, even though the requirement for
studies had been identified. Real progress has been made in the area of
promoting FONADE financing. This, however, is largely dependent on
individual management style, and the number of recent changes in senior
personnel makes it impossible to assess the present situation.
Accounting
3.4       The annual accounts are detailed and informative.   Recently however,
certain aspects of the format have changed, which makes progress difficult
to follow. The lack of a cash flow forecast reduces the visible commitment
of management to any specific policy, as well as the ability to recognize
success.
Institution Building - FONADE
3.5       While FONADE does the job assigned to it well, it is not using
its position as a base for expansion into other fields of work where its
accumulated experience would be beneficial (see Appendix III).
3.6       During supervision a number of suggestions were made to this end.
Subjects discussed included the formulation and critique of consultancy
laws and policy; the assessment of sub-borrowers' implementation capability
and the identification of areas for improvement; acceptance of responsibility
for archival and evaluation problems on a continual rather than one shot
basis in the preinvestment sector; the refinement of selection and
contracting procedures.
3.7       The only tangible improvements which have been made are in the
realm of Consultant registration, where computerized access to a list
including wider information than previously available has been provided.
There has however been no attempt to maintain the register of studies set
up under the loan, nor to use the information available from it as a guide
to establishing standards of success in the preinvestment field.
3.8       Similarly there has been no follow-up on the studies evaluation
exercise funded under the loan, nor are records kept of the state or
success of the implementation of study findings and recommendations.
3.9       Both the studies just mentioned -for the evaluation of studies
and for setting up a register of studies- were carried out satifactorily,
with interesting and useful results. Neither, however, have led to any
further action, either to maintain the register or to extend the evalua-
tion work. This also may be due to lack of continuity in management and
the matter was taken up during the final mission.



3.10      The demonstration effect of both studies could be important
beyond the currently weak impact on FONADE itself. Efforts at dissemination
to other Funds through the Centro de Informacion en Preinversion para
Latinoamerica y el Caribe (CIP),Qf which FQNADE is a leading meTRbep have
been and are still being made.
Institution Building - Sub-borrowers
3.11      With FONADE's responsibilities confined to financial management
and preinvestment procedures, the Loan gave no opportunities for assisting
in sub-borrower development in project identification, study supervision
or project implementation. As the final impact of the loan was mainly in
the traditional sectors, there was in fact little opportunity to affect
project execution in the weaker sectors. However, such development of the
sub-borrower is probably the key to changing the distribution of FONADE's
portfolio (see Appendix III, 3.3).
IV.  BANK PERFORMANCE
General
4.1       This was the first project of its kind in the Bank.   It became
increasingly clear during supervision that there were opportunities for
providing more in such operations than simply a line of credit. It also
became clear that the institution building aspects may delay initial
implementation and subsequent disbursement by encouraging projects in
the weaker sectors. Compromise is accordingly necessary to achieve
immediate impact in the creation of a useful pipeline of projects and long-
term impact to make the process self perpetuating.
4.2       Our own formulation of the possibilities occurred late in the
project, and was broached with diffidence because of the length of time
FONADE had been in the field. It is really with this evaluation exercise
that what had been formalized in later projects now comes to be formalized
here. A large number of issues, which were not part of project design,
but which were discussed with FONADE during supervision, are collected in
Appendix III.
4.3       It should be emphasized here that projects designed for technical
assistance have somewhat different logistics to normal Bank projects. In
the latter, the main expenditure of manpower is in identification and
design. In the former, it is in supervision, which ideally becomes a
partnership between Bank and borrower in the solution of institutional
problems and the exploitation of potential advantages.

Project Justification and Objectives
4.4       The project helped to establish FONADE as a key institution
in the preinvestment process. The growing appreciation of the potential
for FONADE, although partly dissipated in the organization itself because
of management changes, should hasten the achievement of some of the
stated objectives -better sectorial distribution, diversification of
sources of expertise; and of other goals- the speeding up of the selection
and contracting process, the wider dissemination of study results.
4.5       The size of the project was also sufficient to support the
cash flow requirements over the period. FONADE, however, has not yet
achieved financial independence, and is likely to require further
support for some time to come.   This is currently being supplied by the
IDB.
4.6       It is in Eact questionable to what extent financial independence
should be an objective. To achieve it, interest would have to cover both
inflation and administration costs even if FONADE had no loan capital to
service.  As all income consists of transfer payments the advantages of
"self sufficiency" are either independence or increased motivation for
efficiency. The former is illusory, because of FONADE's political
situation; the latter can be accomplished by efficiency targets. These how-
ever will require a lot more conscious management investigation into operations
until they can be established with any degree of realism (see Appendix
III, 4).
4.7       The Bank's favorable assessment of the administrative capacity
of FONADE was correct. The nature of the requirements of promotional
effort were not so well understood and were rectified more by personnel
changes than any effort on the part of the Bank. As a result, the initial
forecasts of disbursements were over-optimistic. Later improvements,
however, showed that they were realistic as far as demand was concerned.
Operations in 1979 were more than twice the total for the years 1968 to
1973 (Appendix I, table 2).
4.8       Bank supervision concentrated initially on sub-project
processing and disbursement. The only time charged to the project was
by the Project Officer.   Review of sub-projects and supervision of sub-
borrowers by other Bank staff was absorbed in project preparation and
sector work. The recorded supervision, therefore, shows only a total
of twelve supervision missions and thirty-nine man weeks. This,however,
was sufficient for the recognition and discussion of the various institutional
issues mentioned in this report.
4.9       Administration of the Loan involved consideration not only of
rather more than the 42 sub-projects against which disbursements were made
(some which were presented were later withdrawn) but also of the 139 contracts
into which they were broken down. The variable percentage of the Bank
contribution, depending on the relevant percentages of local and foreign



- 10 -
expenditure, imposed a considerable burden on Controllers. This can be
avoided in future by having one rate for all sub-projects, regardless
of currency.
4.10      Relations with FONADE were good.   Initially, Bank response to
requests for approval were said to be slow. Later these requests were
treated more as administrative than technical assistance requirements, with
faster action but less attempt to develop FONADE. This may have been
compensated by greater inputs at the sub-borrower level, although this is
not recorded.
4.11      This highlights the complexity of the internal administration
of this type of project, which has, however, now been solved by channelling
all correspondence with the borrower through the Project Officer with copies
to the relevant sectoral division; while correspondence with the sub-borrower
originates in the sectoral division and is copied to the Project Officer.
V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
5.1       The project was useful and, by contributing to cash requirements
during a period of rapid expansion, helped to establish FONADE as a central
point in project preparation. Of the four objectives mentioned in 1.12
above, the first, support of cash flow, was certainly achieved. The transfer
of Bank experience -in project preparation in general and in certain sectors
in particular- was only partially successful, due in part to staff changes
in FONADE. The last objective, diversification of sources of foreign
consultants, was not achieved at all.
5.2       This being the first project in the sector it is natural that
project design did not cover all the issues. While this report concentrates
on the project as conceived, Appendix III gives a general description of
issues and opportunities in the Preinvestment Sector. These have been
progressively addressed in subsequent projects.
5.3       From this the additional work which FONADE will need to do to
realize its full potential can be gauged. Encouragement and guidance is
being provided through the CIP. However, progress here is now dependent
purely on FONADE's acceptance of CIP and Bank's recommendations without
the additional incentive provided by Bank financing.
5.4       The main areas which could be addressed by FONADE, apart from
internal procedural improvements are:
1. Institutional assessment of non-traditional sub-borrowers,
with technical assistance where required (3.11);



- 11 -
2.  Monitoring report implementation, with early identification
of areas of difficulty and technical assistance where
required (3.11);
3. Monitoring of relationships between study forecasts and final
outcome, and use of the resultant material to improve study
design and supervision (3.8);
4. Improving access to foreign exchange when required (2e17);
5. Assessing the objectives of the relationship between foreign
and local consultants, and serving as a center for suggestions
for legislative reform (3.6); and
6. Further development of FONADE's promotional role to achieve
a better sectoral balance of projects (2.19).
5.5       In additicon FONADE could contribute to the development of local
consulting through identifying and monitoring institutional impediments
(e.g., slow payment, guarantee requirements, size of contracts).
5.6       Any future project should include a clearer definition of the
Bank's role in the s;upervision of the various stages of the preinvestment
process.

APPENDIX II
SUB-PROJECTS
1. Introduction
1l1l      The sub-project summaries which follow are based on replies to a Bank
questionnaire requesting the following information:
Borrower
Reference Number
Study Title
Type of Study
Original Cost Estimate
Final Cost
Consultants
Reasons for Cost Variations
Reasons for Time Variations
Construction Cost Estimate
Finance Source for Construction
Benefits of Study
Anticipated B/C Ratio of Project
Stage of Implementation
1.2       Unfortunately, there were no answers to the last question, and
information was, therefore, only evailable on those studies which led--or
are leading--to Bank projects. FONADE does no post-study monitoring,
which deprives the system of feedback on the effectiveness of the studies
and the efficiency of the sub-borrower.
1,3        Study cost figures are based on average current dollar conversions.
Implementation cost figures are estimates given in response to the question-
naire and may differ from study estimates.
1.4        The sub-projects are presented in chronological order.   The two
technical assistance studies, not included in Appendix I,are summarized at
the end.
2. Sub-Project Summaries
F0143     Paved Roads Rehabilitation - $830,000
Detailed design for the rehabilitation of 17 roads, undertaken
by seven firms of local consultants coordinated by one expatriate firm
which was also responsible for the economics. Led to a Bank project
(1471-CO), for partial implementation with an investment at appraisal of
$74.4m.
FO 166    Three Projects in Magdalena Cauca - $390,000
The three projects were feasibility studies for the realignment
of the Dique Canal, sedimentation control in the canal and river training
of the Magdalena at Barrancabermeja. The work was undertaken by three local
consultant firms, and the economics evaluation was done by the Ministry of
Public Works and Transport (MOPT), who calculated an ERR of 26%. The sub-
sequent project was financed by IDB.



- 15 -
FO 167    Magdalena Cauca I - $1.3m
An investigation into the agricultural potential of the Magdalena-
Cauca Valley at Nechi-San Jacinto. The economic rates of return were not
promising (about 9%), but the Government feels implementation,at least in
part, may be justified by social considerations. They hope to put up a
case to either the Bank or the IDB.
FO 169    Patia 236 Hydroelectric Study - $1.9m
Like all the hydroelectric studies in this project, this one con-
cerned itself with only a small part of the total feasibility--in this case,
geological optimization. The study was delayed because of problems with the
foreign consultants arising out of local laws. The consultant eventually had
to withdraw. The final cost was more than double the original budget,with
local firms getting 90% of the business, as opposed to the original plan of
50%.
FO 178    Three River Hydroelectric Study - $1.9m
The three rivers are La Miel, Guarino and Manso. Here again the
withdrawal of the foreign consultant led to a reallocation of work to the
local consultants (88% as opposed to an original 46%) with a price increase
of 36%.
FO 179    500 kv Interconnection - $1.6m
Final design and bid documents for a 500 kv interconnection. This
time the foreign consultants stayed on the job. The 13% price increase (6%
for foreign, 19% for local) was attributed to last minute changes in specif-
ication and tendering procedures. A B/C ratio of 2.8 was calculated.
FO 180    Rio Sinu Hydroelectric Study - $630,000
A partial feasibility study for the two Urra projects, the second
of which would involve redirecting the Verde River. The project was delayed
because of local political unrest. Even so, the final cost was only 3%
above the original estimate. At the same time, there was an increase in
local involvement from 45% to 62%. It is expected that the USSR will finance
the resultant project.
FO 188    Bogota Hospital - $290,000
Final designs for the Bogot'a "Santa Fe" Hospital, using six local
consultant firms and two local individuals.
FO 195    Cartagena Free Zone - $430,000
Final design and socio-economic studies for the Free Zone. The
study was extended so that the final cost was about 25% above the original
estimate. The project is being financed by Loan 1593-CO.



- 16 -
FO 196    Samper Cement - $91,000
Feasibility study for increasing the production of cement works.
The first part of the study identified an alternative solution to the
problems of expansion. This, in turn, required additional work (5% increase).
Unfortunately, there has been no evaluation of the benefits of the alter-
native over the original plan which could be set against the cost of the
study. Implementation is to be financed as to 38% local funds, 36% suppliers
credits and 26% international banks.
FO 201    Medellin Municipality - $30,000
Valuation survey to determine tax base for the finance of various
municipal requriements, and to serve as a basis for future urban development.
FO 202    Antiocuia Maps - $100,000
Aerial photography and mapping of 41 townships as a preliminary
aid to project identification.
FO 203    Four Roads, Phase III - $2.6m
Final engineering for four roads (out of an original set of ten),
undertaken by four local consultants. The design for one of these is being
revised by MOPT because the traffic expectations have declined (Tumaco
Refinery is not to be built). This one is to be financed by the IDB. Fi-
nance for the other three roads has not yet been identified, but one will
probably merely be restored through a special maintenance program. The re-
maining two each have an estimated cost of about $24m and show B/C ratios
of about 2 at 13%.
FO 204    Medellin Roads - $140,000
Final design studies for urban road improvements in Medellin.
Eight local firms were involved. Only 10% external finance (about $5m)
will be required for implementation.
FO 205    Cali Suburban Improvements - $110,000
A feasibility study for the provision of public services, ranging
from water supply to education, to the outlying suburbs. The study covered
upgrading to achieve present minimum standards. No benefit/cost calculations
are available.
FO 206    Cellulose Production - $28,000
Feasibility study for expanding production of the client,
"Procecolsa". The latter reduced the scope of the study to a very prelimi-
nary assessment.
FO 208    Roads in Valle de Cauca - $160,000
Although this was a prefeasibility study concerned with integration
of the sub-region in the Department, and with improving the linkage into
the national road network, preliminary B/C ratios were calculated for five



- 17 -
roads (1.9 to 3.2) and additional paving on three primary sections (1.8
to 2.9), at 12%. There is as yet no finance plan for this $232m project.
FO 212    Milk Commercialization - $45,000
Prefeasibility study to identify areas with potential for milk
production and processing, with some subsequent feasibility work, but not
to the point of C/B analysis.
FO 215    Guajira Thermal Electric - $1.4m
Part of the feasibility and final engineering of this thermal
electric plant, the first stage of which is now under construction.
FO 217    Bogota-Municipality - $40,000
A planning study to indicate investment and development priorities
in seven suburbs.
FO 218    San Juan Hydroelectric - $760,000
Additional studies on the technical feasibility of harnessing the
San Juan River. Undertaken by two foreign and one local firm, plus three
individual expatriate consultants. The price increased by about 50%
(mainly in the local firms) due to salary escalations and redefinition of
work.
FO 220    Rio Suarez Cane Sugar - $80,000
A feasibility study to identify the best alternative for unrefined
sugar production in an under-exploited area. Finance of the resultant
project is expected t;o come at least partly from private sources.
FO 225    Rio Naya - Geology and Forestry - $290,000
A prefeasibility resource study of Naya River Valley, covering
205,000 hectars.
FO 230    Cauca Valley and Region Reafforestation - $50,000
Feasibility for   regional reafforestation projects, studying
three alternatives, with implementation costs going up to $83.5m.   The best
requires an investment of some $75m over thirty years for an ERR of 16%.
The output is intended both for pulping and for sawmill.
F0235     Seventeen Feeder Roads - $180,000
Feasibility and final engineering for feeder roads in five depart-
ments. Seventeen local consultants were involved. Twelve of the roads
have been selected for construction, at a total estimated cost of $4m, of
which 64% will be provided locally and the remainder from three international
agencies, including the Bank (a component of Loan 1352-CO).
FO 240    Santander Industries - $150,000
Feasibility and final engineering covering a brick factory at
Bucaramanga, a hotel, public library, commercial center and urban development.



- 18 -
Five local consultants were involved. Implementation will be financed by
private sources with assistance from the relevant municipalities.
FO 242    Betania Power Study - $4.6m
The loan was applied to only a small part of this detailed
engineering study. Finance for implementation has not yet been identified.
There was a cost increase of 60% for this study, mainly in the local com-
ponent. Part of this was due to a higher than anticipated rate of inflation,
but there were also a number of late design changes which required consi-
derable additional work.
FO 243    Alto Sinu Agroindustry - $110,000
Feasibility study to identify areas for investment. Area under
study was increased by 96% and the cost by 55% while work was in progress.
While the study concluded that there was a potential for over $8m in invest-
ment, no rates of return were specified.
FO 244    Rio Guavio Hydroelectric - $1.7m
Additional feasibility studies (technical) for a 1,050 mw plant.
A reallocation of work, from foreign to local consultants, together with an
increase in subsoil investigations increased the cost of the study by 19%.
The plant has subsequently been appraised for a Bank loan.
FO 245    Caiiafisto Power Study - $2.3m
As above, for a 1,500 mw plant. In this case, however, the price
increase was 110%. Finance for the $783m plant (1979 prices) has not yet
been identified.
FO 268    Direct Reduction Plant - $260,000
Two sizes of plant for sponge iron were studied--220,000 and
330,000 tons per annum at $61m and $74m respectively. No B/C or financial
analysis was included. Supplementary studies for $750,000 are now contem-
plated. No finance source has yet been identified.
FO 270    Steel Plant Study - $275,000
Feasibility study for a steel plant to produce 400,000 tons of
sponge iron, 228,000 tons of steel sheet and between 170,000 and 354,000
tons of laminate per annum. The cost would be $217m (1978). No B/C or
financial analysis was undertaken. No finance source has yet been identified.
FE 031    Boyaca-Santander Water Supply - $200,000
Final engineering for some 35 water supply projects, including
four treatment plants. Twenty local consultants were engaged. The imple-
mentation will cost about $4.6m and will be financed partly by the IDB,
partly by the Bank.
FE 033    Municipal Water Supply - $270,000
Final engineering for water supply and disposal for nine munici-
palities or departments. Seven local consultants were involved. The



- 19 -
implementation is forecast to cost $11.6m. Finance is being sought from,
the IDB as well as the Bank.
FE 034    Real Minas Township - $170,000
Final engineering for a-self contained township, undertaken by
four local consultants. The implementation cost should be about $58m,
to be financed localLy. There was no B/C or financial analysis.
FE 038    Lake Tota Conservation - $200,000
Feasibility and design studies for the preservation of the
amenities of the area, including some reafforestation for erosion prevention,
some drainage and riuver training. Benefits should include trout farming
possibilities and tourism. There was no B/C or financial analysis. Im-
plementation cost is reckoned at $3m.
FE 039    National Health Evaluation Study - $1.3m
A study in social medicine aimed at identifying the areas and
nature of preventible disease as a means to project preparation in the
sector.
FE 040    Bucaramanga Development Plan - $400,000
Prefeasibility study to help formulate a development policy,
including zoning, standards for services and employment generation. The
study cost increased by nearly 80% as it was found necessary to study
additional items, reorganize available statistical information, and in-
crease the area undetr consideration.
FE 044    Pollution Control (Betania) - $280,000
Feasibilit:y study to indicate the improvements and forms of
treatment which wou].d be possible for the Betania and Mamoral Plants. It
also set the standards and methodology for control. The final cost was
in conformity with t:he consultants' proposals, which came out 20% below
the owners' forecast:.
3. Technical Assistance Studies
AT 001    Post Evaluation of Studies - $45,000
This was the first attempt at an "audit" report on studies. Its
usefulness was reduced by its length, so that a number of excellent points
will not have the impact they deserve. There is, in fact, no indication of
steps being taken to learn from this report, or to follow the Bank's reco-
mmendation to make an executive summary and to pass on the benefits to other
preinvestment funds.
AT 002    Inventory of Studies - $80,000
Consultants prepared an inventory of some 2,000 studies going back
to 1966 and covering both public and private sectors. The inventory broke
out eleven parameters, which could be used not only for physical location of
the work, but also as basis for control of sectorial distribution, implemen-
tation and the relation between study and construction costs. Unfortunately,
this has not been kept up-to-date.

THE PREINVESTMENT SECTOR
The Preinvestment Sector consists of the following activities:
1. The provision of finance for studies.
2. The optimization of those studies.
3. Ensuring a pipeline of appropriate projects.
4. Generation and provision of information.



- 21 -
1.        The Provision of Finance.
1.1       While this is the most obvious function of a Preinvestment Fund (PF),
it is not merely a matter of having available funds which are additional to the
current individual secto:cal budgets, although this itself is also important.
Vital also are speed, if not ease, of access to those funds, and certain priv-
ileges or exemptions from specific controls when such funds are used.
1.2       Speed of access is governed by the type of controls by which access
is governed. Good use of the funds mean that the implications of a positive
outcome of a study, for the internal national budget, for external finance and
balance ofpayments, and for sectorial balance in development, are all understood.
This means an easy relationship with the Ministry (or equivalent) of Planning,
the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank. A successful PF must be able to
provide such relationship in the first phase simply better than its clients can
achieve directly; ultimately improving it still further to the best possible
level.
1.3       From this follows that it should have preferred access to foreign
funds when these are required and as simple an assurance of repayment from its
clients as it is possible to conceive while maintaining the control that the
National Budget authority requires. Local circumstances will dictate in the
first instance whether a guarantee from the borrower is required, or whether
all operations carry an implicit or explicit guarantee from the Ministry of
Finance, for example. Where applicable, the foreign exchange risk should also
be covered by such guarantee.
2.        The Optimization of Studies.
2.1       This consists in quality control of Terms of Reference, correct
dimensioning of studies, selection of the most appropriate consultants,
negotiation of a suitable contract, ensuring the proper level of supervision.
Because a PF is engaged continuously in all these activities, it should achieve
a greater expertise in them than its individual clients, who may only be in-
volved in one or two studies a year. This expertise should be reflected not
only in improved quality but also in improved speed.
2.2       In the provision of Terms of Reference the questions requiring
attention are not only cLear format and completness, but the degree to which
methodology and inputs shall be specified, as opposed to merely outputs and
the format of those outputs.
2.3       The relationship and responsibilities of client (owner) and consultant
need clear expression. This is particularly the case where the client is pro-
viding counterpart staff, and where the study includes a training component.
Trade-offs between optimization of design, transfer of technology, training
(local consultants and/or client) and cost must be considered consciously and
an explicit policy formuLated in each case.
2.4       The question oE dimensioning is that of the budget.    The Terms of
Reference should be analyzed from the point of view of the inputs required to
satisfy the real needs of the client. This helps to control costs, and to help
in laying the basis for the choice between the various proposals which will be



- 22 -
made. It also helps relate available funds to the secondary objectives already
mentioned such as training.
2.5       Considerable experience is required for this, again more than the
individual client is likely to have in many sectors. Even in those where
client does have expertise the FP can help to make sure that it is consciously
and properly applied.
2.6   The ways in which studies can or should be split into phases should also
be considered, as well as the appropriateness of giving a whole parcel to one
firm or splitting it up amongst a number. This requires recognition of the
capabilities of the various consultants, from the points of view of absolute
scale (how much road or irrigation can one firm study in what time), interdis-
ciplinary requirements (can the same firm handle both the economics and the
engineering) and the overall interrelationship of the work (are individual
studies, or one study with sub-contracts more appropriate).
2.7       The selection of consultants requires expertise in the fields of
preselection, writing of requests for proposals, and evaluation of those
proposals.
2.8       In many cases, items of the above are covered by local laws.   There
is a continuous requirement for monitoring effects of such laws and their
appropriateness or necessity. The latter may well vary as between a PF and
clients operating on their own. A FP should moreover be able to make represen-
tations which will enable the legislative authority to make any changes which
experience may show to be necessary or desirable.
2.9       Specific problems to be addressed include whether prequalification
should be by advertisement or from a register; how to limit short lists and
criteria for inclusion thereon (e.g., geographical spread, regional coopera-
tion, new firms, previous local experience, how many local firms); how to
organize local/foreign cooperation; how to indicate the scale of work in the
invitation; methodology of proposal evaluation.
2.10      In addition, familiarity with the above tasks should enable progres-
sive reductions to be made in the time it takes from the production of agreed
terms of reference to the end of the selection procedure without any loss of
quality.
2.11      The negotiation of the contract requires an understanding of the
commercial issues beyond the cost of the individual components. Satisfactory
resolution of procedures for variation orders, of how and when payments are
made, of the requirements or not of insurance, penalties, guarantees and
property rights help achieve both economy and the smooth progress of work.
2.12      Supervision requires a level of involvement from the client which
ensures conformity with the terms of reference and timely achievement of the
objectives within the budget, but does not interfere with the professionalism
of the consultant. Judgment is necessary in many cases regarding the clients
ability to supervise and how to compensate for any deficiencies. For various
reasons, it is not a good solution for the PF to try to replace its client in
this activity, both because of the undesirable responsibility this places on



- 23 -
what is primarily a fincncial institution and because of the tendency this has
to promote internal techmical competition.
3.        Project Pipeline.
3.1       The critical areas here are the size of the pipeline and the sectoral/
geographical distribution of the identified and prepared projects. As far as
the size is concerned, this has to be related to the availability of capital for
overall investment, both for the country as a whole and by sector. The fiscal
implications of the work which is being done are important for project design
as well as selection, tc the extent that for instance cash or foreign exchange
generation may be a primary requirement, rather than say long term economic
benefits.
3.2       The distribution should reflect Government priorities rather than
current opportunities. This means first of all that the Government plan has
to be translated into specific projects, and secondly that the projects so
identified have to be brought to execution.
3.3       This may require both promotional effort and local institution
building. Many agencies outside the traditional heavy investment sectors find
difficulty in maintaining current operations. They can hardly service loans
for studies, let alone project execution, and their human resource situation
is as bad as the cash one.
3.4       The FP is only one amongst many Government agencies which can iden-
tify such weaknesses. It may however be the best one to do something about it.
In the first place, with sectoral targets set in conjunction with the Planning
Ministry (or equivalent) it has an obligation to report the reasons for short-
falls. At the same time it has an incentive to avoid their repetition.
3.5       Its work with such agencies should indicate the precise location of
the human resource gaps. Its experience in consultancy and recruitment should
enable it to make suggestions for filling them.
3.6       Its experience as a banker moreover, with the constant necessity of
judging the ability as well as the financial viability of borrowers, should
enable it to suggest org.nizational improvements which would convert a poor
client into a good one.
3.7       Its relationsh:Lp with the Ministries of Planning and of Finance
should furthermore give it the influence not only to have its suggestions con-
sidered but also adopted., To achieve this however a PF must pursue consciously
the identification and the solution of these types of problems. This requires
both a general awareness and possibly the employment of some experts in the
field of institution building.
3.8       In addition ad-hoc assistance in the form of short term experts
can be provided.
3.9       Recognized effectiveness in all the above can be a major incentive
to use of the PF by other agencies. However, this type of work can affect the
apparent viability of the PF itself as its salary bill increases without a
corresponding increase in turnover. It is therefore important to try to
separate the costs of lending from the costs of technical assistance to borrower.



- 24 -
4.1       Information.
The following items seem worth collecting for the reasons mentioned:
a) Names of consultants, by discipline, location, size and
experience; in order to facilitate the drawing of short
lists. Knowledge of and access to other lists should
complement this.
b) Names of previous studies, with relevant TORs and indication
of location; to prevent duplication of work. A good library
of summaries can help make useful information accessible
and save a great deal of time.
c)  Costs of consultancy; to help budget studies and to give
background information for negotiations.
d) Relationships between study costs and costs of works, by type
and sector; to help dimensioning and budgeting.
e) Relationships between cost (and other) forecasts in studies
and subsequent actual experience; to help improve study
design and the interpretation of recommendations.
f) FP efficiency criteria-processing costs per study, per $000
lent, relationship between processing costs and technical
assistance, time requirements from identification to loan;
to indicate areas of possible improvement, to coordinate
manpower planning with anticipated level of operations and
to form a basis for exchanging experience with other FPs.
4.2       In addition, the FP should try to generate information on the use-
fulness of the studies it finances. This should include an appreciation of
how much it is worth paying to insure top quality - what, on a case-by-case
basis, would be the implication for the client for lower grade, but perhaps
faster and less expensive work. This will contribute towards the resolution
of the controversies over whether to have studies at all, whether to use
outside consultants or owner's staff to carry them out, how to assess and
monitor cost effectiveness, and how the importance of the three items changes
by sector and by type of study.
4.3       It should also evaluate the usefulness of studies not only for
decision making by the owner but also for assisting in negotiations for
finance for the execution of the works and in speeding the execution itself.
