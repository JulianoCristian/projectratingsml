                                  Restructuring Paper


1.    The closing date for Vietnam, ICT Development project, Credit No. 4116-VN,
P079344 will be extended from June 30, 2011 until June 30, 2013.

2.      Implementation of the projects is considered to be moderately satisfactory overall.
The project team believes that the procurement and training plans are achievable within
the proposed extension time. The project is in full compliance with all covenants, and
disbursements are not suspended, and the project is up-to-date with audit reports. The
Project Development Objectives (PDOs) are still relevant and the proposed extension will
allow them to be met. Disbursements as of June 27, 2011 were approximately SDR 10.12
million or 17.7 percent of the total credit amount of SDR 57.03 million; with SDR 21.68
committed/contracted or about 40 percent of the total credit amount. No undisbursed
amount of funds is expected upon the new closing date of June 30, 2013, with the grace
period.

3.      The proposed extension for a two-year period beyond the closing date is
necessary to complete the implementation of recently, and to-be-signed contracts. Most
of these contracts will be completed one year beyond the current project closing date. A
small number of the remaining procurement packages will require about 20 months to
complete the procurement process, implement the delivery, install and use the equipment
and software. In order to garner an initial assessment of the results and impact and to
realize the benefits of the project, an extension of two years is recommended. The Bank
Task Team has reviewed the PIUs’ revised procurement and training plan to complete the
ongoing contracts and consider it achievable within the proposed extension time.

4.     This will be the first extension of the project. Based on already signed contracts
and the revised procurement plan, the proceeds of the Credit will be reallocated as shown
in Annex 1, including reallocation of proceeds originally in the “unallocated” category.
