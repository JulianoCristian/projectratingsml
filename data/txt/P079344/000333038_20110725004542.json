The closing date for the project will\n            be extended from June 30, 2011 until June 30, 2013. The\n            extension for a two-year period beyond the closing date is\n            necessary to complete the implementation of recently, and\n            to-be-signed contracts. Most of these contracts will be\n            completed one year beyond the current project closing date.\n            A small number of the remaining procurement packages will\n            require about 20 months to complete the procurement process,\n            implement the delivery, install and use the equipment and\n            software. In order to garner an initial assessment of the\n            results and impact and to realize the benefits of the\n            project, an extension of two years is recommended. The Bank\n            Task Team has reviewed the Project Implementation Units\n            (PIUs') revised procurement and training plan to\n            complete the ongoing contracts and consider it achievable\n            within the proposed extension time. This will be the first\n            extension of the project."}, "docdt": "2011-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
