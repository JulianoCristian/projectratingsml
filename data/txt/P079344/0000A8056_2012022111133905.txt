                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project's revised PDOs are to focus more narrowly on project activities funded by IDA, and are to assist the Borrower: (a) to support MIC#s institutional
                         development and technical and regulatory capacity for ICT sector oversight and to increase the efficiency and transparency of public service delivery in MIC, GSO,
                         MOFA, Hanoi and Danang; and (b) foster private sector development by increasing access to business-related government services and raising awareness and usage of
                         ICT in Hanoi and Danang.

                         Since the last ISR, the Bank management approved a two-year extension of the project, and new closing date was set as June 30, 2013. The Task Team Leader has changed, and
                         the first introduction mission with new TTL has taken place in October 2011. The mission team met counterparts (MIC, PMU, and PIUs), and discussed project progress and
                         measures to enhance quality of the project implementation and the Bank's support. The mission team visited Phuoc Tam ward in Danang City and witnessed the improvement in
                         governance and service delivery which was supported by the project (i.e., provision of equipment, software and training). The mission observed that the project continued to move
