                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project's revised PDOs are to focus more narrowly on project activities funded by IDA, and are to assist the Borrower: (a) to support MIC#s institutional
                         development and technical and regulatory capacity for ICT sector oversight and to increase the efficiency and transparency of public service delivery in MIC, GSO,
                         MOFA, Hanoi and Danang; and (b) foster private sector development by increasing access to business-related government services and raising awareness and usage of
                         ICT in Hanoi and Danang.
