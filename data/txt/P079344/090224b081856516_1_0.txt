                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project's revised PDOs are to focus more narrowly on project activities funded by IDA, and are to assist the Borrower: (a) to support MIC#s institutional
                         development and technical and regulatory capacity for ICT sector oversight and to increase the efficiency and transparency of public service delivery in MIC, GSO,
                         MOFA, Hanoi and Danang; and (b) foster private sector development by increasing access to business-related government services and raising awareness and usage of
                         ICT in Hanoi and Danang.

                         The Project Implementation Units have intensified efforts to accelerate the project implementation and achievement of PDOs, however, a number of large procurement packages
                         directly related to the achievement of the Project Development Objectives (PDOs) are still in early stage. According to this, the project may not fully achieve the Project Development
                         Objectives by the closing date (June 30, 2013).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         After the supervision mission in October, 2012. The following decisions were made.
                         - All procurement packages not signed by December 31, 2012 will be cancelled, and PIUs will be responsible from their budget funds for any expenditures not made by the project
                         closing date.
                         - Formal communication regarding the project closing will be initiated between the Bank and Government of Vietnam. (The letter from Country Director was issued on December 11,
                         2012).
                         - A second-order restructuring is planned for (i) Modification of the Results Indicators (a second-order restructuring, no change of PDOs) to more accurately measure the results
                         which contribute to the project development objectives and (ii) cancellation of the surplus of IDA funds due to the implementation of a number of packages from Government. The
                         process will be initiated once the World Bank received the formal request from State Bank of Vietnam (SBV).
