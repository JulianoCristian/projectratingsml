                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The following actions were taken after the super vision mission in early June 2013:
                         - The Bank received the formal request from State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) regarding the project restructuring.
                         - A second-order restructuring was approved by the RVP for (i)Extension of the project closing date for 6 months, (ii) Modification of the Results Indicators (a second-order
                         restructuring, no change of PDOs) to more accurately measure the results which contribute to the project development objectives and (iii) Partial cancellation of the IDA funs due to
                         the implementation by own funding.
