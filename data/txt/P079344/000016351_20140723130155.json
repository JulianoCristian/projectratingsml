the\n            Information and Communication Technology Development Project\n            for Vietnam was judged to be moderately unsatisfactory.  The\n            Bank and borrower performance were moderately\n            unsatisfactory. The risk to development outcome was\n            substantial. Significant changes included revised\n            components, restructuring and amendments. Several lessons\n            were learned. The complexity of project design needs to be\n            balanced carefully against the client's human resource\n            endowment and readiness to execute. Multi-unit institutional\n            arrangements, if unavoidable, demand that the Bank negotiate\n            mechanisms for joint management of essential functions and\n            structured opportunities for collaboration. The objective is\n            to avoid duplication of operational and administrative\n            efforts, inefficiencies, and other well-known\n            \"silo\" effects. Cancellation would have limited\n            the knowledge gained from implementing this important\n            project but restructuring and extending it in 2010 without\n            addressing design issues was an inefficient use of Bank\n            resources. Bank procurement requirements, processes and\n            documents are not optimal for the fast-evolving IT sector\n            and this needs review. Intervention of senior Bank\n            management with national authorities can galvanize project\n            performance in a failing situation. ICT projects need to\n            focus on both the supply and demand sides, the latter being\n            an important driver of longer-term sustainability.  The\n            rationale for including weighty private sector goals in a\n            foundational project focused on e-government should be\n            clearly defined.  ICT projects can materially impact the\n            behavior and performance of government, business and\n            citizens and require the same high standards of monitoring\n            and evaluation design and execution as projects in other\n            sectors. It is unrealistic to expect that the deeper impacts\n            of newly-constructed ICT systems can be measured by end-project."}, "docdt": "2014-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
