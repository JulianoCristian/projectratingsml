F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objectives of the proposed project (as stated in the PAD) were to: (a) accelerate the
use of ICT and support institutional development in order to increase the efficiency and
effectiveness of public administration, increase transparency and availability of
information, and improve public services delivery to stakeholders; and (b) to foster
private sector development in particular by facilitating the increased adoption of ICT by
SMEs.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
A Level One Board-approved Restructuring in 2010 revised the PDO (and Key
Performance Indicators) to focus more narrowly on project activities funded by IDA by
assisting the Borrower to: (a) support MIC's institutional development and technical and
regulatory capacity for ICT sector oversight and to increase the efficiency and
transparency of public service delivery in MIC, GSO, MOFA, Hanoi and Danang; and (b)
foster private sector development by increasing access to business-related government
services and raising awareness and usage of ICT in Hanoi and Danang. Further
adjustments to PDO and Intermediate Outcome indicators were made via a Restructuring
in June 2013, approved by the Regional Vice-President.

   For clarity and consistency with the ICR Guidelines Appendix B requirements, the
presentation below is organized as follows: (i) original, PAD-based indicators are listed
first in both sections (a) and (b) and are used to measure the initial phase of the Project;
(ii) the revised indicators resulting from the 2010 Level One Restructuring are then
shown in follow-on sections of (a) and (b) immediately under the PAD originals; (iii) the
June 2013 adjusted indicators and results are shown in the "Formally-revised Target
Values" column of these two post-Restructuring sections and are used to measure
achievement of PDO in the Project's second phase.

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.1.1 Country context and national commitment: Vietnam, like many developing countries,
recognizes the value and potential of information and communication technology (ICT) to
enhance competitiveness, facilitate economic diversification and increase productivity, and to
improve institutional capacity and efficiency especially in government. At the time of appraisal in
2005, the Government of Vietnam (GOV) had repeatedly identified ICT as a top priority, issued
high-level decisions and formulated strategies, master plans and decrees to that effect. These
included the National ICT Development Strategy 2006-2010, the e-Government Development
Master Plan to 2010, the State Administration Modernization and Computerization Program and
the Prime Minister’s Decision 169 on administrative simplification. The Ministry of Posts and
Telematics (MPT) was to lead implementation of the National ICT Strategy and E-Government
Master Plan under the guidance of a National Information Technology Steering Committee. Key
targets of the Master Plan included: extensive diffusion of ICT throughout the national economy
and society to increase ICT’s share of GDP; establishing a national information and
communications network; and, comprehensive ICT skills development.

1.1.2 Important efforts to upgrade ICT infrastructure flowed directly from this enabling
framework including: introducing information systems into selected government departments and
piloting online services; providing incentives to the ICT industry; and developing ICT skills and
improving awareness of ICT in government and to some extent, the private sector. Vietnamese
authorities expected that ICT development would be an instrument to facilitate service delivery
and a potential source of growth. References to ICT development featured prominently in GOV’s
Socio-economic Development Plan (2006-2010). Government had also committed under
international trade agreements (including the Vietnam/US bilateral trade agreement) to open the
telecommunications sector to outside investment and to increase competition. Substantial
progress had been already made in moving towards international norms and best practice.

1.1.3 Constraints and challenges: Government nevertheless faced tough constraints to e-
readiness at the time of project appraisal: the high cost of and uneven access to communications
infrastructure; a shortage of skilled human resources including in ICT-related disciplines; and
limited diffusion of ICT within government, the business sector and citizenry. Achieving the new
Master Plan’s targets was challenged further by the need to strengthen the management,
coordination, coherence and result-orientation of on-going programs. This included establishing
realistic indicators and benchmarks and developing successful demonstration models or
applications which could be scaled up over time.

1.1.4 Rationale for Bank involvement: GOV sought Bank support for ICT development for
the following reasons: (i) the Bank’s active, multi-country engagement in telecommunications
reform, e-government and ICT development throughout the developing world including East Asia
and the Pacific region, and comparative advantage in promoting best practice experiences in ICT
projects and policy formulation; (ii) established dialogue with GOV on telecommunications and
ICT policy issues and knowledge of main stakeholders; (iii) ability to coordinate development
partners working in ICT to prevent overlap and duplication; (iv) understanding of the ways ICT
could be integrated in other sectors, thus contributing more broadly to growth and poverty
reduction; and, (v) capacity to provide long-term, large-scale financing.




                                                1
1.1.5 Contribution to higher-level objectives: The Project supported two key pillars of the
Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) FY03-FY06: (i) high growth through transition to a
market economy, by developing policies for the ICT sector to generate employment, exports and
domestic economic efficiency in Vietnam, and through training to build a computer and internet-
literate small and medium enterprise (SME) sector more able to deliver growth and engage in
international trade and competition; and (ii) adoption of a modern public administration, legal
and governance system. Promoting efficiency and transparency of government operations via
portals, online applications for business and land registration, e-procurement, and data collection
and dissemination would improve government decision-making processes, reduce transaction
costs, improve quality and standardization of government documents and limit the scope for
corruption.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
1.2.1 The PDO as stated in the PAD and Development Credit Agreement sought: (i) to
accelerate the use of ICT and support institutional development in order to increase the efficiency
and effectiveness of public administration, increase transparency and availability of information,
and improve public services delivery to stakeholders; and (ii) to foster private sector development
in particular by facilitating the increased adoption of ICT by small and medium enterprises.

1.2.2       The table shows the alignment between the original PDO and Results Indicators:
    PDO                                        Project Outcome Indicators
    1. Accelerate the use of ICT and support   -Increase of 2% in share of ICT sector in GDP

                                               services (G2C and G2B)
    2. Foster private sector development in    -15% use ICT for business operations in 2010 and improve
    particular by facilitating the increased   productivity
    adoption of ICT by SMEs                    -Domestic IT service sector grows by an average 30% per year

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
1.3.1 A Board-approved Level One restructuring in January 2010 revised the PDO and
Outcome Indicators to focus more narrowly on project activities funded by IDA, assisting the
Recipient: (i) to support the MIC’s institutional development and technical and regulatory
capacity for ICT sector oversight and to increase efficiency and transparency of public service
delivery in MIC, GSO, MOFA, 1 Hanoi and Danang; and (ii) foster private sector development by
increasing access to business-related government services and raising awareness and usage of
ICT in Hanoi and Danang.

1.3.2 The table below shows alignment between the restructured PDO and Results Indicators as
at January 2010. A second (Level Two) Restructuring in June 2013 adjusted the Results
Framework including by adding two new Results Indicators. For convenience, these are shown in
the table below and discussed in Section 2.3 and Annex 2.

 increasing access to business-related           -More private firms in selected cities use ICT
 government services and raising awareness
 and usage of ICT in Hanoi and Danang.
**Also applicable to PDO #2

1.3.3 Rationale for changes: The partially adaptive, partially corrective Level One
restructuring was requested by the State Bank of Vietnam for the following reasons: 2
     • HCMC and Hanoi Subprojects had adequate funds from own sources to conduct activities
         similar to the Project. In the case of HCMC, the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) had
         tried hard to absorb the city’s US$3-4 m. budget allocation but could not use the
         additional IDA resources. HCMC Subproject disbursement was virtually zero.
     • Demand for IDA funds in GSO and Danang to finance their ICT development plans was
         increasing. Both PIUs were strong performers and reallocation of funds to their
         Subprojects was thought likely to ensure timely completion of project activities.
     • Implementation capacity was weak in the Hanoi and MIC PIUs (and PCU), hindering
         progress in the first half of the Project. See also Section 2.2.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries:
1.4.1 Project beneficiaries were not described explicitly in the PAD but by inference were:
government institutions at both the central and decentralized levels, and especially those directly
involved in project implementation; small and medium-sized business enterprises; and, the
general public/citizens through improved access to e-services. Project restructuring in 2010 did
not change the identity of expected beneficiaries but did expand the estimated numbers likely to
benefit from increased public access to e-services (see Section 2.2).

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
1.5.1 The Project comprised five Subprojects in three areas: (i) ICT leadership and
modernization of the MPT; (ii) modernization of the GSO; and, (iii) e-applications for the
municipalities of Hanoi, Danang, and Ho Chi Minh City. The five subprojects covered a total 14
“components” or sets of activities. See Annex 2.

Subproject 1: ICT Leadership and MPT (later MIC) Modernization (total estimated cost
US$21.7 m. of which IDA US$20.1 m., 93%) financed capacity-building for MPT for the
development, implementation and oversight of government’s ICT strategy and policies;
formulation of telecommunications and ICT policy; and, improving MPT’s operating efficiency
and effectiveness. The Subproject had six components/activity sets: (i) development of e-



2
   Bank management was ambivalent about pursuing a first order restructuring based on concerns about the time and
effort needed for its approval, especially in Vietnam, potentially adding to existing implementation delays.

                                                          3
government capability in MPT; (ii) informational interaction and transactional portal design and
activation; (iii) establishing a training program, and the design and implementation of curricula
for the Chief Information Officers (CIO); (iv) capacity-building for ICT policy and regulatory
development; (v) development of a legal, regulatory and institutional framework for IT and
telecommunications; and (vi) development of a national IT architecture and inter-operability
framework for e-government. See Annex 2.

Subproject 2: GSO Modernization (total estimated cost US$13.77 m of which IDA 100%)
supported implementation of the strategic plan for modernization and capacity-building of GSO.
The quality, transparency and timeliness of socio-economic and poverty data/information for
government agencies, research institutions and other data users were expected to improve,
modernizing the foundation for policy, planning and decision-making. Systems would be
upgraded and the timeliness, analytical quality and dissemination of data/statistical information
would improve. The Subproject had three components/activity sets: (i) ICT infrastructure and
process upgrade; (ii) data flow and enhanced statistical analysis through ICT; and (iii)
development/expansion of ICT human resources and awareness. See Annex 2.

Subprojects 3, 4 and 5: E-Government in Hanoi, Danang and Ho Chi Minh City (total
estimated cost for Hanoi US$31.3 m/IDA US$28.06 m (89.6%); for Danang US$17.33 m./IDA
US$16.42 m. (95%); and for Ho Chi Minh City US$10.61 m./IDA US$8.93 m. (84%)), sought to
improve the ICT environment in these cities by providing the foundation for deployment of e-
government in district offices and departments. E-government services, e-applications for
business, and ICT skills would improve government accountability, effectiveness, transparency,
public and business access to information, citizen and business interaction and public
administrative reform efforts. SME competitiveness was expected to improve with spillover
effects on trade opportunities, employment and income. The Subproject had six
components/activity sets: (i) development of ICT strategy, policies and architecture and upgrade
of ICT infrastructure, equipment and systems for these cities; (ii) assessment of business
processes and development and implementation of workflow solutions; (iii) development and
expansion of electronic gateways and city portals; (iv) implementation of e-applications in
selected public services, including geographic information systems; (v) support for the uptake of
ICT by SMEs through ICT transaction centers; and (vi) development of ICT human resources and
awareness-raising. See Annex 2.

Subproject 6: Project Coordination (total cost US$1.5 m. of which IDA 100%) financed a
Project Coordination Unit (PCU) within MPT (later MIC) - which was a separate unit from the
MIC PIU - for overall coordination of project monitoring and reporting, and knowledge-sharing
across subprojects. Implementation would be decentralized; each Subproject would have its own
PIU (in MIC’s case, as well as the PCU) and Special Account. See Annex 2.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1   The 2010 Restructuring revised several Subprojects/components (see Annex 2):
    •   Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC): Subproject was cancelled (see 1.3.3).
    •   MIC: Activities added: Test Center for IT product evaluation; consultancies to prepare
        plans for e-document interchange and integrated e-mail systems; and installation of an
        intelligent building system and integrated communications. The planned National
        Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) was removed (government-funded).
    •   MOFA under MIC: Data Center and establishment of online visa services added.



                                               4
     •    GSO: Planned Information Warehouse would add a data warehouse and information
          dissemination portal. New components added (US$6.7 m increase in credit amount by
          reallocation): equipment for data collection/processing for the 2009 Population Census;
          and, GIS application support mapping administration field database.
     •    Danang: Activities were expanded (US$10m increase in credit amount by reallocation):
          Data Center added to the Transaction Center, and Danang’s ICT infrastructure upgrade
          program expanded to include 30 departments, seven districts, and 56 communes and
          wards.
     •    Hanoi: IT infrastructure upgrade was removed, the number of e-services was reduced,
          and a Data Center was added.

1.7 Other significant changes
1.7.1 Restructuring and amendments to the DCA:
    • Level Two restructuring of June 29, 2011 approved by senior Bank management
       extended the closing date by two years to June 30, 2013.
    • Level Two restructuring of June 20, 2013, approved by Bank management on an
       exceptional basis (IP and DO ratings were then MU, and prior extensions totaled 24
       months), extended the closing date six months to December 31, 2013; adjusted the
       Results Framework (see Section 2.3); reallocated US$10.6 m. and cancelled US$10.3 m.
       of the IDA Credit (and US$4.6 m. of counterpart funds) representing large procurement
       packages either already financed by government with its own funds or unlikely to be
       completed by the closing date. The justification was to allow time to: (i) complete major
       contracts signed by December 31, 2012; (ii) stabilize and consolidate the ICT systems
       already established; and (iii) support critical turnkey packages signed before December
       31, 2012 to ensure that software applications and IT equipment functioned properly. 3
    • Development Credit Agreement (DCA) amended in 2008 to reflect an agreement during
       negotiations that IDA would finance the reasonable costs of incremental expenditures by
       the PCU in coordinating the project. 4 US$80,000 was allocated for this function.
    • DCA amended in February 2010 to substitute the Ministry of Information and
       Communication (MIC) as lead executing agency in place of the Ministry of Posts and
       Telematics (MPT), and Department of Information and Communication (DIC) for
       Department of Posts and Telematics (DPT).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 Preparation and background analysis: The PAD reflects a comprehensive effort to
design an ICT in the mainstream of best practice. External specialist sources including academic



3
     The rationale included: (i) experience with other ICT projects (difficult to launch and implement); (ii) Vietnam
country context (slow project implementation); (iii) importance of ICT to the country’s transparency agenda which the
Bank was fostering; (iv) progress on several complex ICT contracting processes and need for time to ensure that newly-
installed technologies worked; (v) country fiscal constraints, i.e., unfinished works were unlikely to be finished by the
client with own-funds; and (vi) emergence of important project results and impact. Critically, certain pending
procurement packages were linked directly to achievement of the PDO.

    The Bank Task Team believed that the O&M costs of the PIUs in Hanoi, Da Nang and Ho Chi Minh City, and at the
GSO, should be borne by counterparts to ensure ownership of project activities and the longer-term financial
sustainability of project activities. Incremental operating costs of the Project Coordination Unit however, were strictly
project-related, would not have been incurred absent the project, and would not continue beyond closing.

                                                           5
were consulted. The internal review process was thorough, and wide-ranging peer input was
sought. Concerns were expressed internally about the following: project scope and complexity;
institutional arrangements, especially the cost and efficiency of using five separate
implementation units; M&E and the quality and relevance of the Results Framework especially
impact indicators; overall coherence of the proposed intervention and linkage between the five
Sub-projects; inadequate connection between proposed sustainability factors and what was likely
to work; and, weakness in the underlying analytical justification for key activities including SME
involvement. Evidence suggests that while the project team understood these concerns, project
design responded only partially and the internal clearance process acquiesced.

2.1.2    Lessons: Global experience with ICT operations showed that the primary drivers of
success were strong country ownership and sustained commitment to implementation. Thus the
consistency of project design with government’s National ICT Strategy (2006-10) and other high-
level policy documents was equated with full ownership by government. Global lessons in
organization, leadership models, personnel and procedures in setting up telecommunications and
ICT regulatory bodies shaped design, while experiences balancing progressive change with
internal resistance and political issues were used to create a realistic roadmap for policy change.
For e-applications development, the Project heeded experiences in e-government projects in the
developed and developing world, and World Bank/other case studies. The value of picking high
payoff focus areas such as the e-registration of businesses and e-procurement was also studied
and incorporated (but the latter was later dropped). Lessons called for balancing supply-driven
features by demand promotion: ICT and e-government projects in many countries had been
unduly supply-driven. Project design featured awareness-building and skills development to
promote demand but in reality ICT infrastructure and e-services supply were the primary focus.

Assessment of project design:

2.1.3 The sheer complexity of project design, combined with its equally complex
implementation arrangements, is notable. Project activities were largely foundational, whereas
the original PDO and results indicators anticipated measurable outcomes more appropriate to a
second stage operation: qualitative, behavioral and cost benefits of established systems, strong
and measurable demand/usage, and with significant ICT capacity developed and consolidated
(see 1.2.2). These are impacts which even in advanced economies can take up to a decade to reap
measurable benefits. In practice, under the country conditions including a new client in a
challenging political economy and economic slowdown from 2010-2013, and regardless of
GOV’s strong commitment to an ICT-based economy, the complex foundation of infrastructure,
systems and services as well as M&E capacity, could not be established fast enough to achieve
and measure its development impact on the behavior of targeted beneficiaries by project end. The
learning curve was steep and the configuration of involved institutions unwieldy. The Project did
not get the opportunity to address second stage activities to enhance or measure, the impacts of
the infrastructure on behavior.

2.1.4 Several issues affected design. First, bidding documents should have been ready prior to
Board approval as part of the primary feasibility studies and would likely have led to better
disbursement flow in the initial years. In retrospect, it is also clear that of the 92 procurement
packages, some were not essential. Second, this type of project is not primarily about hardware
and software – which can readily be purchased off the shelf - but about the eco-system for the
human aspects. Project design lacked a substantial focus on the human behavioral change
element which proved critical to its progress and to what would be measurable by end-project.
Third, a higher portion of the project budget – perhaps as high as 30% - needed to be allocated to
change management/initiatives. This would include, as with the procurement packages, getting

                                                6
Enterprise Architecture (EA) itself or EA studies in place/done before Board approval, using
Project Preparation Facility (PPF) or Trust Funds to ensure that the foundational elements of the
Project could support subsequent procurement. Finally, the issue of ICT - and especially Internet -
penetration was not adequately addressed resulting in e-services not evolving readily into end-to-
end transactions. This project required something akin to a one-laptop-per-child approach or a
subsidized laptop purchase program to accelerate the impact on citizen uptake.

2.1.5 Implementation structure: At preparation, multiple Project Implementation Units (PIU)
were justified on the basis of project scope and the responsibilities of relevant government
agencies. The project used a decentralized approach; each Subproject had its own PIU,
procurement plan and Special (Designated) Account. The Bank’s conversation was quite different
with each unit. The PAD argued that similar arrangements had been adopted by other Bank
projects with multiple, decentralized subprojects or components. The real constraint was the
policy and legal framework for subprojects financed by GOV’s Official Development Assistance
(ODA) which does not permit joint PIUs across implementing/supervising agencies. 5 The PIUs
operated as parallel “silos”; there was no built-in mechanism for fostering inter-PIU collaboration
or synergy even though there were common components and similar objectives/outputs across
Subprojects. Further, the PIUs were not constituted at appraisal and only three of the five were
required to be up/running by effectiveness, which had implications for project ownership,
understanding and readiness to launch.

2.1.6 The Subprojects were overloaded, each with multiple components/activities (see Annex
2) and IDA allocations ranging from US$10.0 m. to US$28.0 m., equivalent in practice to five
separate projects. This was expected to implement smoothly in an untried, e-unready environment
with ICT human resource deficits and varying levels of commitment to (or understanding of) the
Project. As the Client was to bear the administrative costs, questions about duplication and
inefficiency may have been discounted; from a Bank supervision perspective, similar questions
were relevant. Selected cities covered the capital (to demonstrate e-government in the public and
private sector), a commercially-developed city (Ho Chi Minh City) and one in a less-developed
central region (Danang). The awareness that other donors were operating in the ICT “space” was
reflected in plans for collaborative events on ICT/e-government with all key development
partners in Vietnam. This was considered administratively manageable, would permit exchanges
of information and avoid donor duplication of effort. In practice, it worked well.

2.1.7 Acknowledging the lack of clarity in individual institutional responsibilities – strong
coordination being an essential feature of successful ICT operations – and complexity of the
institutional and legal framework, the Bank Team sought coordination by linking the Project to
the multi-agency National IT Steering Committee chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister, which
would review project performance at semi-annual meetings. A Project Working Committee of
PIU leadership was also to be established, meeting quarterly on project matters.




5
  Each supervising agency must be responsible for its own “project” and form its own PIU for management. Bank staff
in Vietnam has tried to rationalize this structure without success - it depends on the commitment of individual agencies.
A modified approach could have worked where for example, a joint procurement team might have provided unified
services for the three Subprojects based in Hanoi – MIC, GSO and Hanoi.


                                                           7
2.1.8    Participatory processes: The Bank project team worked with the involved public
agencies and met with associations representing the private sector and with private actors in the
ICT industry, incorporating their suggestions and priorities in project design. Private stakeholders
suggested and endorsed the emphasis on streamlining government processes burdening their
business operations. The PAD recommended that this dialogue – especially with SMEs - continue
during project implementation and it did, but intermittently and depending on location.

2.1.9 Risk assessment: The analysis of risk was satisfactory but incomplete. Mitigation
stressed training, awareness-raising and technical assistance. Risks also focused on concerns
about commitment to and sustainability of ICT policies and systems. Procurement risk was
correctly rated as High based on the readiness of bidding documents but the general lack of
procurement expertise/human resources was barely mentioned. This was a procurement-
dependent operation divided between five centers each with its own procurement plan and no
familiarity whatsoever with the Bank’s procurement framework. The most acute risk evident after
effectiveness was the limited capacity of implementing agencies (taking procurement processing
into account) and lack of skilled IT professionals, i.e., e-readiness, alluded to at appraisal in
general terms and rated Moderate. The 2010 Restructuring belatedly acknowledged human
resource deficits and e-readiness as “new risks” for which mitigation measures were already
activated, including more intensive/frequent Bank supervision. Risks associated with
SME/private sector uptake, citizen ICT demand/literacy and design complexity were not
mentioned.

2.1.10 Project financing: Financing arrangements were unusual. Six Special accounts were
opened for the PCU and five PIUs. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) proposed that MPT, GSO and
Danang receive their portion of the IDA Credit for their Subprojects as a grant. Hanoi and
HCMC – which MOF argued had sufficient internal revenues to handle repayment - would
receive their portions on a part-loan, part-grant basis. The two cities had requested that only
those portions of their respective subprojects with cost-recovery or revenue-generating potential
be financed through on-lending and the remainder through grants. The loan portion in each case
was to be via advances in VN Dong from the state budget on modified IDA terms and with MOF
bearing the foreign exchange risk, commitment and service charges.

2.2 Implementation

Principal factors affecting project implementation:

2.2.1 Complexity and readiness to implement: Implementation conditions/capacity on the
ground, especially for procurement and project/subproject management, was (except for GSO and
Danang in key aspects) exceptionally weak, hampered by: (i) lack of experience with Bank
projects/procedures and bureaucratic, multi-layered and cumbersome processing and approvals,
especially by the People’s Committees; (ii) inadequate approaches at the PIU level magnified by
their weak grasp of the Project’s opaque strategy and vision; and, (iii) in the first 2-3 years,
frequent organizational and staff changes disrupting continuity and capacity-building, along with
under-staffing, low salaries and difficulties in recruiting qualified/specialist personnel. By the
2009 Mid-term Review (MTR), the MIC and Hanoi PIUs still lacked essential qualified staff; (iv)
since the MPT/PMU’s operating costs were not covered by the DCA until 2010, the unit lacked
sufficient full-time staff to complete the Operational Manual or the website designed to aid inter-
PIU communication; (v) implementation of government’s ICT/e-Government Strategy and its
Administrative Reform Program was slow and poorly-coordinated, affecting the Project’s
operational and policy context. The Project was integrated in the National IT Steering Committee
early on but this mechanism for project orientation appears to have lost priority or involvement.

                                                 8
2.2.2 Procurement challenges: Procurement encountered specific constraints. First,
contracting of international procurement specialists took inordinate time, delaying for up to two
years in some cases the acquisition and installation of new infrastructure, systems and services
not previously known/utilized in Vietnam. Second, inexperienced PIUs with no prior relationship
to the Bank and negligible procurement capacity were required to execute 92 procurement
“packages”, many requiring International Competitive Bidding (ICB). The 2010 Restructuring
made marginal changes and dropped the HCMC Subproject, but essentially left this situation
intact. Third, as noted in the Danang and GSO completion reports, Bank procurement no
objections could be slow, and PIU procurement staff in general felt under-trained to use the
Bank’s new approach introduced in 2010 for technical specifications in IT bidding documents;
almost all bidding documents prepared required revision. Fourth, delays affected technology
packages where rapid innovation left some outdated even before their purchase was concluded
(see 2.2.3). Finally, GOV cost norms for specific packages could not compete with market
conditions, further delaying official approvals. Given the scope of these problems, the Bank
country management team authorized a senior procurement expert to provide hands-on advice to
PIUs, with positive results, and with further follow-up support, the PIUs slowly mastered
procurement processes. In general, PIUs with greater technical competence and strong,
collaborative relationships with their People’s Committees (Danang, GSO) devised better
technical solutions and more efficient procurement and contract implementation (see 2.4.2-2.4.3,
and Section 5). 6

2.2.3 Rapid technological change: Related to 2.2.2, rapid technological change and fast
evolving systems in the ICT marketplace from preparation through end-project affected progress
and had important collateral effects. The marked reduction in ICT product cycles and increasing
adoption of the enterprise architecture approach, broadband and Wide Area Networks (WAN),
combined with the PIUs’ limited technical competence and institutional capacity, had the
following effects: (i) Changing specifications delayed the development of detailed procurement
plans with key packages identified in 2008, but bidding documents not ready for up to 18 months;
(ii) PIU specialists needed time to update knowledge, digest consultants’ information and
translate it into reasonable technical requirements. Some procurement packages were already
superseded and could not be processed; (iii) Technical changes also prolonged the bid evaluation
process for up to a year. Meanwhile, contracted equipment became unavailable requiring contract
amendments and causing further delay.

2.2.4 Mid-term Review (MTR): The MTR was timely, well-staffed, accurately defined the
primary obstacles affecting project execution and prepared the strategy and content of a proposed
restructuring. Actions agreed as a result of MTR analysis included: (i) Level One restructuring
incorporating elements discussed with authorities; (ii) maintenance by the PIUs of the same
organizational structure and teams, backed by intensive training; (iii) closer involvement of and
speedier approval of procurement packages by PIU leaderships; and, (iv) project-financed
technical assistance to strengthen project management and supervise the execution of large
procurement packages. Of particular importance, participating agencies (MIC and GSO) and

  Well into project execution, when procurement issues had become chronic, the Bank team actively considered
consolidation of the procurement function across PIUs as well as moving a Bank procurement staff member to work
directly on the Client’s side on bidding and other documents. However, the associated difficulties were not easily
overcome and the plan was set aside. The ICR suggests based on discussion with the current Bank team, that various
solutions could have been devised to deal more decisively with this situation.


                                                        9
cities (Hanoi, Danang and HCMC - the latter dropping out after the Restructuring) were to
streamline internal procurement appraisal and approval processes with clearer assignment of
responsibility and accountability. Results of these decisions/efforts were inconclusive (see 2.2.5).

2.2.5 Restructuring 2010: The 2010 Level One Restructuring scaled the Project back while
adding new activities but did not change its fundamental design and approach, or substantively
address capacity constraints, perpetuating weak performance. The link between the revised PDO
and Results Framework remained unclear, the PIUs still shied away from monitoring and
measurement, and Bank supervision did not press the issue. Some activities were cancelled and
the HCMC Subproject was dropped. The environmental category and applicable Safeguards
policies remained as appraised. Expected benefits of this restructuring were increased numbers of
beneficiaries of ICT development overall and better public access to e-services, especially in
Danang to which an additional US$10.0 m. were reallocated consistent with its good performance.
GSO also received an additional US$7.0 m. to scale up its Subproject. The PMU and PIUs’
limited project implementation capacity remained a risk but participating agencies and cities were
to streamline internal procurement processes with clearer assignment of responsibility and
accountability. As noted, and with certain exceptions, this restructuring did not improve progress.

2.2.6 High-level joint project review: Consultations in January 2012 between Bank senior
management and the Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) galvanized progress in all PIUs
and were a decisive factor in ensuring completion of the Project. Notably, some 10 Bank-
supported projects in Vietnam were performing poorly at that time and were on the Bank’s watch
list; the ICT Development Project was not an outlier. Responding to the Bank’s insistence on
action, the DPM issued direct instructions to participating agencies to accelerate execution.
Intensified Bank supervision, including a technical procurement mission provided direct support
to critical procurement packages linked to achieving the PDO. Detailed action plans were
discussed and agreed with the PCU (MIC), PIUs, the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI),
the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) on procurement, financial
management, and results monitoring. Substantial progress resulted by January 2013 with most
outstanding procurement packages signed. Commitments increased to 85% of the total IDA credit.

2.2.7 Proactivity of Bank supervision: Changed Bank task management, combined with the
actions described above (2.2.6) reversed the project trajectory and built renewed trust. Further
restructuring in mid-2013 extended the closing date and adjusted the Results Framework for
clarity/relevance. The project disbursed rapidly in 2013 because a large number of contracts
initiated in 2012 were completed. The Bank Task Team provided intensive technical
implementation support with additional IT experts, helping to shorten the technical review of
bidding documents and bid evaluation reports to the Bank’s service standard of an average of two
weeks. M&E was prioritized: PIUs designated individuals responsible for specific segments of
the process and monthly updates on results were conducted via video-conferencing. The risk of
project cancellation, continuing relevance of the PDO, and importance of the Project to the
Bank/GOV relationship and dialogue, pressured the Bank and country counterparts to complete
outstanding procurement/training, and ensure that equipment/systems were operational by closing.
The Bank portfolio review made senior management in supervising agencies aware of pending
issues and take greater control of procurement. But above all, counterpart staff was able to
“master” the Bank’s ICT procurement guidelines especially the new regional guidance on the
shift from a specification-based to performance-based approach.

2.2.8 Project at Risk Status: The MTR downgraded the project ratings to MU and the Project
fell into problem status. Performance remained sluggish until 2012 but, consciously erring on the
conservative side given the Project’s generally troubled trajectory, the DO rating was maintained

                                                10
by the Bank team at MU through closing. The IP rating was upgraded to MS due to rapid and
conclusive progress on remaining procurement packages in 2013. See Annex 2 matrix of
procurement packages completed.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 Design: The PAD called for a Management Information System (MIS), complemented
by semi-annual progress reports and impact studies prepared by the PIUs and PCU. This was
consistent with the PAD’s assertion (Annex 1) that the challenge facing government was not only
how to achieve its ambitious targets but to strengthen the results-orientation of several ongoing
programs through the “establishment of realistic indicators and benchmarks for rigorous M&E”.
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) was to be the responsibility of individual PIUs at their
subproject level with the MIC PCU consolidating results sent by the PIUs, identifying lessons and
disseminating knowledge to stakeholders - including the Bank and government.

2.3.2 Evolution of the PDO and Results Framework: The ICR Data Sheet illustrates the
problematic Results Framework. The original PDO was broad, complex and in key aspects
unmeasurable within the life of the Project. The causal link between the Project Outcome
Indicators and PDO internal elements was unclear, and confused outputs with outcomes.
Presentation of the PDO was inconsistent within the PAD, including the Results Framework (RF)
and Arrangements for Results Monitoring (ARM), and between the PAD and Development
Credit Agreement (DCA), creating difficulties for the ICR. Overall design of the RF was
exceptionally weak, with excessive numbers of indicators (especially Intermediate Outcome and
the separate slate of outputs tied to the components – see Annex 2) and many were not SMART
(specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound). The ICR adheres to the initial, two-
part statement of PDO which also accords with the DCA and as shown earlier in Sections 1.2 and
1.3, aligns the results indicators accordingly.

2.3.3 The 2010 Level One Restructuring narrowed PDO scope to focus more tightly on IDA
activities and added several Core Indicators concerning processing time for public services and
user perceptions of e-services. Overall measurability improved to some extent, but the number of
indicators remained unusually large and their ability to capture the PDO was still problematic.
Retention of the private sector objectives was not matched by appropriate tools to deliver the
impacts sought. Revisions were overly-focused on input indicators measuring implementation
rather than results. No plans were made to conduct an impact evaluation or related study -
surprising given that M&E standards in the Bank were much higher by 2009 - virtually no
monitoring activity had yet occurred, and this was the logical opportunity to formalize M&E.

2.3.4 The Level Two restructuring in June 2013 further adjusted the RF, while leaving the
PDO intact. The new Project Task Team in 2012 mapped key project activities and procurement
packages against expected outcomes reflected in the internal elements of the PDO, and found that
large numbers of important activities directly affecting PDO achievement were still in the early
stages of procurement. The decision to further adjust the RF to adequately measure achievements
of the PDO improved measurability of indicators per se and linkage to the PDO, but the overall
number of indicators - including many with multiple internal targets - increased (see Data Sheet).

2.3.5 M&E Implementation: Overhaul of both the PDO and indicators in 2010 did not result
in a sharper focus on monitoring, and evaluation lacked priority. Continued poor definition/clarity




                                                11
of the RF, limited capacity and focus in the PIUs and continuing inability to see the Project in
integrated terms, plus the PCU’s general lack of leadership deterred data collection on project
results. The PIUs were monitoring progress on the procurement packages. 7 In a major push to
have the PIUs focus on PDO achievements, each assigned an M&E focal point for tracking
progress and key procurement packages were accelerated, but the overall quality of data reporting
was low and collected data was not used for planning or decision-making. Data collection and
organization improved in the final 18 months and evaluation/studies made headway, including: an
independent evaluation of the Danang Subproject (Leading Associates/KDI Asia, 2013) paving
the way for rigorous M&E of future, similar projects; a well-conducted survey contracted by MIC
PCU (An Vien Media, 2013) to gauge the effectiveness of the project communications campaign
(Annex 5); and, a Project Performance Assessment Report (KDiAsia), intended to provide MIC
with internal guidance for future operations. 8 MIC/PCU, Danang and GSO prepared Completion
Reports (executive summaries in Annex 7).

2.3.6 Utilization: The ICR acknowledges some internal Bank concerns that the adjustments to
the Results Framework in mid-2013 seemed too late to be used to measure end-project outcomes,
but opted to use that final version anyway, for the following reasons. First, initial analysis
prompting the decision to adjust the RF occurred in March 2012 with the expectation that
changes would be effected within a reasonable period. However, the multi-layered, multi-agency
sign-off process in GOV delayed final Bank approval until June 2013, six months before the
revised closing date and 15 months after the initial proposal to restructure. Second, adjustments
in 2013 were a serious effort to ensure that the indicators reflected actual project achievements.
Indicators were further refined and brought down to project level by specifying units of
measurement, linking targets to the institutions where results were expected to occur, eliminating
intermediate indicators considered irrelevant, and adding two new Results Indicators to more
accurately cover expected PDO outcomes. Such changes were also required by the cancellation of
some procurement packages and amendments in the project description. Third, the project archive
shows that senior Bank management tacitly assumed that the Level Two adjusted RF would be
the version used to measure achievement of the PDO. 9

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Safeguards: Due to its nature, the project was an environment Category C, and did not
trigger any safeguard policies. The category did not change with restructuring.

2.4.2 Procurement: Procurement execution involved “learning by doing”. Procurement risk
was rated High at appraisal because the PIUs had not yet been established nor their procurement


7
       Evidence suggests the PIUs – GSO and Danang excepted - always saw the Project as an aggregation of
procurement packages since their focus was almost wholly on getting those prepared, approved and executed. Most
PIUs lacked any concept of the “Theory of Change” although at end-project they were all able to narrow down the
Project’s key impact on behavior – the transition from manual to electronic administration and services provision.
8
    See: Impact Assessment Study of Computerized Services Delivery Projects from India and Chile, Bhatnagar,
Tominaga, Madon and Bhatia, World Bank Staff Working Paper, #42147 (November 2007).The study demonstrates
how to estimate direct and indirect benefits to clients with reasonable accuracy using a framework which includes
surveys of clients (citizen and business users) and other stakeholders. While the study shows the potential of ICT to
help reduce costs of accessing services, improve convenience and accountability and promote good governance, it also
advises looking beyond the “hype” of e-government and that the principles of good project design and management
remain important to results.
9
   Email from U. Zachau (EAPVP) to V. Kwakwa (EACVF) of January 11, 2013 refers to key remaining issues in
project implementation for the 6-month extension period including the need for “….modification of the indicators to
measure more accurately the results contributing to the achievement of the project development objectives….”.

                                                        12
staff identified. Many procurement packages, including specialized consultant services were
unique and challenging, the cycle of no objections and PIU approvals was inordinately protracted
in many cases, and some PIUs were reluctant to communicate their need for Bank guidance.
Difficulties arose - and persisted over time – in getting agencies’ clearance/approval of project
procurement documents due to their insistence on applying the National Procurement Law despite
provisions in the DCA - and in the National Procurement Law itself - giving precedence to Bank
Guidelines. As discussed, procurement performance was variable between PIUs and greatly
affected the Project’s ability to advance (Section 2.2). Most IT projects face similar procurement
challenges. The Bank may need to revise its procurement documents for IT projects, moving
beyond an input-focused approach to processes more appropriate to a fast-moving sector.

2.4.3 Within this context, the Bank procurement team (based in Hanoi) conducted regular
supervision, training, workshops and direct mentoring in procurement planning, cost estimation,
terms of reference, technical specifications, RFPs and bidding procedures. Procurement ratings
fluctuated between MS and MU over the project period. Complaints associated with procurement
packages in MIC and Danang in 2012 resulted in explicit warnings to all PIUs and additional
resources to focus attention on bidding processes and transparency. The MU ratings reflected
slow procurement progress and weak management, not malfeasance. The PCU/PIUs grasped the
importance of (and strove to develop) sound quality control of bidding/other processes and to
comply with Bank standards, slowly overcoming deficiencies with time and mastering processes.

2.4.4 Financial Management (FM) and audit: As with procurement, FM required intensive
attention/supervision. The FM performance rating fluctuated between MS and MU over the life of
the Credit and financial risk was rated mostly Substantial. The main reason was variable capacity
between PIUs/PCU. At appraisal and as with procurement, there was no institutional base or
identified staff for project FM, and no computerized system (MIS) in place to track project
transactions and conduct financial reporting. Institutional arrangements with multiple units and
Special Accounts affected FM efficiency. Internal controls, including contract management,
eligibility of expenditures, defined FM responsibilities, reporting structures and accounting
software – the latter experiencing serious problems of installation, activation, and systemic errors
depending on the PIU – were slow to improve. Capacity-building was recommended and training
provided. The rating fell to MU in 2012 due to a series of outstanding issues - ineligible
expenditures, delayed financial audits and weak contract management - but was restored to MS
by the final supervision due to all PIUs showing improved performance in specific aspects.

2.4.5 Audit: Eight audit reports were required and by ICR, seven were received with one
pending. Three audits were late and two had issues of accountability and internal controls.
Auditors’ opinions were qualified on occasion and audit quality was uneven. Delayed delivery of
the 2011 audit and protracted delay in reimbursing the Bank for some ineligible expenses implied
the possible suspension of disbursements under BP 10.02, but issues were resolved to the Bank’s
satisfaction by closing.

2.4.6 Project costs: Total project cost was US$77.08 m, 72.1% of the US$106.96 m.
estimated at appraisal. 10 Cancellation of IDA resources totaled US$13.52 m. over the project

   Total disbursement of US$74.12 m, cancellation of US$13.52 m and undisbursed balance of US$6.23 m, as shown in

period. The Recipient’s contribution was an estimated US$2.96 m, 22.36% of the appraisal
estimate. Costs per Subproject varied significantly from appraisal estimates (see Annex 1).
Combined supervision costs for FY12 and FY13 alone were US$384,000, well above regional
norms due to the marked intensification of Bank supervision in that period. Due to the tendency
for prices to fall, and increasing efficiency in procurement management over time, project costs
were reduced by a total US$15.4 m. over the course of the Project. More effective and cheaper
solutions became available such as the scanning facility in GSO and online visa application
system in MOFA. The Danang PIU Completion Report cites combined savings on several of its
packages exceeding US$6.0 million. 11 The PCU and all PIUs used savings to purchase additional
systems/equipment.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 The Bank and counterpart project teams mapped out a plan for the immediate post-
completion operation and maintenance of project infrastructure and systems and their medium-
term sustainability (see Section 4). As discussed (2.3), no formal O&M system was established
by the Project although GSO by the nature of its data and research functions is well-positioned
and motivated to maintain project achievements, as is Danang City which has become a national
e-services demonstrator.

2.5.2 An official delegation from Vietnam visited the Bank in December 2013 to present the
results of the ICT Development Project and to outline a new ICT operation which might include
scaling up the especially successful Danang experience nation-wide, further increasing the scope
and efficiency of the GSO, and in the case of Hanoi, replicating and increasing e-services across
different levels of government. Given the foundational nature of the Project, continued
development of IT professionals and adequate budgets are essential. Annex 5 summarizes
recommendations of the Danang study which point the way to post-completion operation and
expansion of this/similar projects. Regardless, the ICR suggests, based on reviewers’ comments,
that any new ICT intervention be results-based or a Development Policy Credit rather than an
Investment Lending (IL) operation. A programmatic approach for such projects, with a second
operation contingent upon performance under a first, may be advisable.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rated: Moderately Satisfactory
3.1.1 Relevance of PDO: Continuing relevance of the (restructured) PDO is rated
Satisfactory, capturing key development themes in the current Country Partnership Strategy
(Report #65200-VN of November 7, 2011) and GOV’s current development priorities. The CPS
identifies issues affecting the business environment: weak infrastructure, high costs of interacting
with government; and, lack of adequate information on policy, all of which resonate directly or
indirectly with the PDO to “foster private sector development by facilitating the increased
adoption of ICT”. The CPS recommends, inter alia, strengthening Vietnam’s technology and
innovation system, and supporting the country’s transition to a successful mid-income country by

                                                   14
promoting innovation-led and higher-value-added production and services. Strengthening
governance is an important cross-cutting theme and links directly to the PDO: “support MIC’s
institutional development and technical and regulatory capacity for ICT oversight and to increase
efficiency and transparency of public service delivery in MIC, GSO, MOFA, Hanoi and Danang”.

3.1.2 Relevance of design and implementation: The relevance of project design and
implementation showed significant shortcomings, and is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.
Prima facie, the technical design was acceptable and responded to defined needs, but the
Project’s ambitious vision for the project period was unreasonable on capacity and readiness
grounds. The risk assessment was incomplete, under-estimating human resource factors, and
overlooking issues such as the demand side, citizens’ IT literacy/uptake and the implications of
overall complexity. Mitigation measures were limited/inadequate. The relevance of PDO and
Results Framework design was especially weak; the former improved in 2010 but the latter not
until the final year. Implementation of M&E was unsatisfactory until the final stages. Few
specific activities were tailored to private sector needs or linked to the PDO’s private sector goals.
Most of the Sub-projects (components) were implementation inputs and outputs linked causally to
improved government services. While the private sector would, like regular citizens, be likely to
benefit from many of those services, the link to “private sector development” was not well-
justified or measurable. The institutional arrangements fostered inefficiency, duplication and
delay throughout the project cycle. They would today be subjected to tougher internal scrutiny
and demand joint institutional arrangements and shared functions. The PAD discussed the need to
sequence business process change and awareness-building ahead of equipment purchase and
application development but in practice, project implementation was supply-driven and the
human factor was under-emphasized. The demand side prominent in current Bank
policies/methodologies across sectors lacked priority.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
3.2.1 Revision of the PDO via a Level One Restructuring entails that the ICR conduct a split
assessment of outcome using the pre- and post-restructuring PDO and indicators, weighted based
on respective levels of disbursement in the two stages. The following presents project results
against the original PDO and indicators up to the date of Board approval of Level One changes
(January 29, 2010). Results based on the revised PDO and RF up to closing at end-December
2013 are shown separately using the indicators as restructured in June 2013.

Pre-restructuring period (from Effectiveness to January, 2010)

3.2.2 Profound delays in project execution and disbursement under the first stage of the project
resulted in few PDO-linked achievements in this period. To the extent that any measurement was
conducted, it was of basic progress in the contracting and completion of planned procurement
packages which for the PIUs – both at that time and virtually throughout – were synonymous with
the Project.

Original PDO Part A: Rated Unsatisfactory

3.2.3 The internal elements or themes of the original PDO Part A were four-fold: “to
accelerate the use of ICT and support institutional development; to increase the efficiency and
effectiveness of public administration; increase the transparency and availability of information;
and, improve public services delivery to stakeholders”. With two notable exceptions, there is
little to show through end-2009, evidence of the acute problems affecting implementation. All
four elements entailed a critical mass of investments and appropriate evaluation including user
surveys and case studies to measure behavior change through gains in “efficiency”, “effectiveness”

                                                 15
and “transparency”, including several at the level of national indices and probably unmeasurable
even under higher levels of achievement at the time.

3.2.4    The following situation prevailed at end-2009:
    •    MIC issued common technical standards for the Inter-operability Framework in 2008,
         and guidelines for the development of the E-Government Enterprise Architecture (EA) in
         2009. These were important milestones for Vietnam’s overall ICT development.
     •   Danang City put a city-level EA in place to guide its e-government development.
     •   GSO acquired and developed its Form Scanning system crucial for faster processing of
         the 2009 Population Census.
     •   Otherwise, negligible achievement was shown by most PIUs (except Danang and GSO)
         in acquiring the infrastructure, equipment, systems and services to move beyond the
         policy and standards stage.
     •   By end-2009 citizen usage remained incipient, as did the “increased transparency and
         availability of information and improved public services delivery to stakeholders”.

Original PDO Part B: Rated Unsatisfactory

“Foster private sector development in particular by facilitating the increased adoption of ICT by
small and medium enterprises (SME)”
3.2.5 There is in the pre-Restructuring period, some limited evidence of SME adoption of
project-financed ICT but no hard evidence that this “fostered private sector development”, a
complex linkage difficult to measure in the circumstances. The Bank MTR team reported that
SME-related activities had received modest attention in the period.

3.2.6    Addressing individual indicators:
    •    Anticipated growth of 30% per year in the domestic IT service sector as a result of the
         project fostering private sector development was unrealistic and lacked a baseline on
         which to assess incremental gains.
     •   Facilitation of “increased adoption of ICT” was limited to Danang having established its
         ICT Transaction Center (TC).
     •   15% of SMEs in Hanoi, Danang and HCMC were to be using ICT for business operations
         by 2010. The baseline is identical for all three cities and is assumed to be national, not
         city-specific: Danang, measured via canvassing of SME customers using the new TC,
         registered 18% usage for business purposes by early 2010, but attribution to the Project is
         unclear, i.e., whether the increase is based purely on impact of the TC on awareness.

Post-Restructuring period (February 2010 to end-December 2013):

3.2.7 Delays continued to plague the post-Restructuring period and for many of the same
reasons, but Danang City and GSO continued to lead the way and overall, progress picked up. By
closing, all procurement packages not cancelled were fully completed and operational. Evidence
is mostly output-based with one exception: Danang PIU financed a study which paves the way for
future M&E of ICT development projects and reports findings and lessons directly attributable to
the Danang Subproject.12 Some results are included below, with further details in Section 3.6 and
Annex 5.

Revised PDO Part A: Rated Moderately Satisfactory

“To support MIC’s institutional development and technical and regulatory capacity for ICT
sector oversight and to increase the efficiency and transparency of public sector service delivery
in MIC, GSO, MOFA, Hanoi and Danang”:

3.2.8 All PIUs established the foundation for improved e-government, formulating frameworks
and standards, upgrading key e-government infrastructure, and training human resources at
managerial/other levels, both at HQ and in decentralized government units. A fundamental
transition occurred from manual to computerized administration and services. Internal procedures
and public service systems were improved or developed using ICT and are fully operational
including portals and websites. These are likely to have improved the efficiency and transparency
of public services delivery, democratic access to information, and government accountability,
although the ICR cannot definitively prove this even from the Danang study. Danang and GSO
are good cases illustrating how an ICT project can support local e-government and a central
agency respectively, to become service- and citizen-oriented facilitators/providers. The following
assessment disaggregates the PDO by its main themes.

Theme 1: To support MIC’s institutional development and technical/regulatory capacity for ICT
sector oversight:
    • MIC’s institutional development was supported through the formulation and application
        of four standards: Enterprise Architecture, the Interoperability Standard, the e-
        Government Framework and Security Standard.
    • MIC’s regulatory capacity was improved through laws, decrees and circulars
        promulgated/approved: Postal and Radio Frequency Laws; the Information Security Law
        – of crucial importance in an expanding e-services environment - and MIC decrees
        supporting the application of IT and Information Security.
    • Technical capacity improved through numerous infrastructure upgrades: LAN networks
        in MIC headquarters and 12 DICs; smart building communications systems connecting
        MIC to regional offices in Danang and HCMC, MOFA and the Hanoi Telecom
        Authority; video-conferencing, IP phone and building security systems operational.
    • At the district level (DIC), upgrades included: PCs, laptops and printers, video-
        conferencing facilities, email and LAN/WAN integrated connectivity.
    • Training of 500 CIOs/IOs, 220 state-owned enterprises and 70 SMEs supported the
        operations and sustainability of these upgrades (policy formulation, capacity-building and
        implementation guidelines for IT and telecom sectors).

Theme 2: Increase the efficiency and transparency of public sector service delivery (MIC, GSO,
MOFA, Hanoi and Danang):
   • The primary change in behavior was the transition from manual to electronic/digital
      processing of governments’ key business processes and delivery of public services.
   • Reduced transaction times demonstrate efficiency gains: MIC’s Radio Spectrum
      processing time was halved from 20 to 10 days; registration for imported publications




                                               17
          from 30 days to 15; online visa application processing averaged 2.5 days; in Hanoi,
          average transaction time fell 50% for selected e-government services via the City Portal.
     •    GSO’s Population Census data collection/processing time was reduced by 42% with an
          estimated cost reduction of US$500,000 as a direct result of project-supported ICT
          upgrades; Forms Scanning infrastructure and other upgrades facilitating the 2011
          Agriculture and Rural Census reduced processing time by 50% (two years to one); and,
          data collection/processing for CPI surveys fell by one-third (15 to 10 days).
     •    Global experience validates the tendency for online services to promote transparency.
          The Project established, inter alia, online drivers’ licensing, business registration, water
          quality monitoring, construction permits and public transport management.
     •    Improved connectivity and information flow G2B, G2G and G2C, as well as local
          facilities such as transaction and data centers, information kiosks, online booths, e-
          Learning portals and public WiFi also likely promoted efficiency and transparency. 13

Revised PDO Part B: Rated Moderately Unsatisfactory

Foster private sector development by increasing access to business-related government services
and raising awareness and usage of ICT in Hanoi and Danang.
    • Interviews and anecdotal evidence suggest that the “viral” nature of ICT skills acquisition,
        the breadth of information now available to business and speed of access to it, and efforts
        by the Project to promote awareness, are positive signs for downstream gains in private
        sector development beyond the Project.
    • Substantial numbers of SMEs took ICT training courses, visited/utilized the new
        Transaction and Data Centers, and accessed online e-services, e-learning courses, portals,
        and SME-tailored training modules.
    • Localized surveys in Danang showed that 33% of SMEs were using ICT and 18% using
        it for business purposes. Caveats noted above (3.2.6) apply.
    • SME’s awareness of the availability of project-financed, business-appropriate e-services
        and how to use them had increased.
    • Several business-related e-services, e.g., online Business Registration and Licensing, and
        the Investment Project Management System were launched in Hanoi and Danang,
        markedly reducing transaction times compared to legacy, paper-based transactions.
    • However, despite these gains, there is no hard evidence that private sector development
        was fostered only that access, awareness and usage by SMEs had improved. This
        indicator was felt to require more formal evaluation to reveal specific evidence of
        “development” and that the behavior changes noted did not in themselves, equate to that
        development.

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1 Assessing the efficiency of the Project in a rigorous manner would require extensive data,
including detailed financial and operating information from government agencies as well as
surveys carried out among beneficiaries both before and after the interventions. Given that this
data was not available by project closing - and experience shows that a period of maturation is


13
     The Danang study (Leading Associates/KDiAsia, 2013) found that – at least at project closing - a majority of
potential and actual citizen e-service users interviewed expressed preference for a human face at the “counter” but this
is not interpreted as dissatisfaction with online services per se. E-services were still tending to be used for information-
seeking not end-to-end transactions. Many factors constrain demand including computer literacy and access to a
computer per se, which received insufficient attention from or acknowledgment by, the Project.

                                                            18
normally needed for ICT investments before such data is meaningful - certain assumptions can be
made about the efficiency of the project based on results as well as what is likely to happen based
on experiences in other countries. See Annex 3 including sources.

3.3.2 Project interventions affected efficiency for three groups: government, businesses and
citizens. For government, transitioning from manual to computerized processes results in lower
costs and shorter processing times. Project-financed training of government officials taught them
how to implement IT systems to achieve efficiency gains. Further, sensitizing high level officials
is likely to have reduced resistance to restructuring business processes. Project-fostered
coordination among government agencies will have reduced duplicate IT systems resulting in
improved efficiency.

3.3.3 GSO: Data collection and processing for the 2009 Census was reduced to 14 months
from 24 months (42% reduction) as a direct result of project ICT improvements. The estimated
cost savings were US$500,000 based on the 450 data entry staff used for the Census, assuming
they received the average monthly salary for government workers. Forms scanning hardware used
for the 2011 Agriculture and Rural Census generated a 50% improvement in overall processing
time, reduced from two years to one. Data collection and processing time for Consumer Price
Index surveys was reduced by one third from 15 to 10 days using newly-introduced IT processes.
The GSO subproject also reduced duplication by harmonizing and integrating databases within a
standard system architecture. The provision of additional/free statistics online would also have
improved decision-making by both government and the private sector.

3.3.4 Small and medium enterprises: Interventions aimed at Small and Medium Enterprises
(SMEs) included training and online services. These are likely to have positively impacted SMEs
in Vietnam. World Bank research suggests that online business registration systems (among the
applications developed by the Project) reduce complexity, time and costs leading to a rise in
business registrations and employment (as well as generating income for government). Similarly,
facilitating construction permits (another project application) through online applications saves
businesses time and money.

3.3.5 Danang City e-services: The delivery of online public services benefits citizens by
reducing the cost and time of travelling to and waiting at government offices. Examples cited in
Annex 3 include Sri Lanka and Europe. Similarly, 45% of respondents to the Danang survey
expected project-financed e-services to save time, 35% foresaw greater convenience and 23%
expected to save costs. The city-wide free Wi-Fi scheme in Danang saves citizens time and
money. Businesses also benefit: customers could find businesses easier using Internet-based
location services, and businesses could exploit social media/other applications to create
innovative relationships with customers. Estimating the cost savings to citizens from free Wi-Fi
means calculating the cost of Internet access payments no longer needed. Assuming the same
proportion of Internet users in Danang as the nationwide average and that one third would use the
free citywide Wi-Fi service, the aggregate consumer benefit is over US$350,000 per month.

3.3.6    Overall project implementation efficiency was also notable. For example, the total
estimated value of the Danang subproject at appraisal was US$27.3 million. After five years of
implementation, Danang PIU saved a total of US$6.1 million through competitive procurement
practices and good management, and acquired additional equipment with the savings. All other
PIUs also registered substantial savings although not on the same scale as Danang. Aggregate
cost savings were US$15.4 million. See also 2.4.6 above and footnote 10.



                                                19
3.3.7 Although detailed information necessary for carrying out a comprehensive efficiency
analysis is lacking, the anecdotal data suggests that project interventions are already having an
impact on reducing costs for government and saving time for SMEs and citizens. These benefits
can be expected to grow as e-services evolve in scope and functionality and more Vietnamese use
the Internet.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
3.4.1 Overall PDO rating: Consistent with the ICR Guidelines Appendix B, separate
outcome ratings for the original and restructured projects respectively were weighted in
proportion to the share of disbursements in the periods pre- and post-Restructuring.

 (e) Final Rating                             -                       -               Moderately Unsatisfactory

3.4.2 Overall project outcome rating: This rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory takes into
account the following:

     •   Relevance: Assessed against current Bank strategies, PDO relevance remains
         Satisfactory. However, the ICR asserts that a technically and operationally demanding
         project design was largely imposed on an inexperienced client. Capacity and readiness to
         implement were over-estimated at appraisal. Design and implementation relevance are
         therefore rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. Overall relevance is rated Moderately
         Satisfactory.
     •   Efficacy: Achievement under the original PDO is rated Unsatisfactory because with the
         exceptions noted, progress as measured by level of outputs (completed procurement
         packages) and disbursements was still negligible by end-2009 and thus most expected
         outcomes – changes in behavior – lacked the conditions for achievement. Most of the
         latter came well after the 2010 Restructuring and some of the most critical not until 2013.
         The post 2010 Restructuring phase is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory, reflecting a
         conservative approach which acknowledges the Project’s continued difficulties, last
         minute execution of key procurement packages and lack of time to conduct user surveys,
         although the vast majority of planned systems, equipment and training were implemented,
         with substantial cost savings, and with early/preliminary indications of reduced
         transaction costs and greater efficiency. However, looked at overall, and not just through
         the lense of the good performers (Danang and GSO), there is a significant risk given
         likely medium and longer-term challenges, that outcome may not be sustained (see
         Section 4).


14
      The ICR takes total IDA resources disbursed as at July 16, 2014 (US$74.07 m), and for the pre-Restructuring
period, total disbursements by January 28, 2010 (US$7.35 m) as a percentage of that total, with the balance attributed
to the second, post-Restructuring stage. This results in relative percentages of 10% and 90% respectively.

                                                         20
    •   Efficiency: Based on evidence of efficiency gains in time and cost already reported and
        likely impacts based on global experiences for public e-services, balanced by the
        acknowledgment that the project currently has limited hard evidence of citizen/SME
        gains, and the fact that the efficiency discussion is largely couched in terms of likelihoods,
        project efficiency is rated conservatively as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 The project had no overt poverty objectives, and did not address gender either in design
or during implementation perhaps due to a perception that they were not immediately relevant
goals for the type of project and its stage of development. Neither did the project have explicit
social objectives although it can be inferred that more efficient provision of government services
and the wide range of e-services already developed in the Project’s lifetime, have solid potential
for positive social impacts, e.g., water quality monitoring introduced in Danang; more rapid and
transparent business registration; e-learning portals and TV programs delivering courses to
enhance citizens’ skills; and, improved management of public transport. Potential social benefits
are likely from better planning and policy-making using GSO’s improved population/other data
and modernized systems/procedures.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.2 The project has already had significant impact on the administrative and operational
efficiency of the participating institutions, most notably (and measurably) the General Statistical
Office (GSO). Key government services are more accessible in less time to current and potential
users. Most key administrative and operational functions are now electronic/digital rather than
manual, representing the most profound of the behavioral changes prompted by the Project. Most
staff from the PIUs, now possessing specific skills developed over the course of the Project, have
already returned to their parent agencies. Danang representatives refer to their daily activities as
being more “citizen-centric” and that coordination and inter-connection among departments and
agencies is more streamlined and easier. The Project laid the foundation for changing the science
of service delivery and inclusive innovation with ICT. Other new innovation, public procurement
and education projects in the Vietnam portfolio will benefit from this achievement.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.3 Examples of unanticipated developments include: (i) substantial, unexpected aggregate
cost savings of US$15.4 m resulting from competitive and over time, more efficiently-managed
procurement; and (ii) collaboration with other donors conducting similar/related projects (as
envisaged in the PAD) went further than expected. For example, the close
consultation/coordination between GSO and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
within the design and implementation of package GSO 6.1(b) provided more efficient data entry
and processing technology for the 2009 National Population Census. UNFPA also helped design
GSO’s questionnaires appropriate for mechanized data entry and optical recognition, and trained
interviewers and enumerators.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
3.6.1 The Danang Subproject financed the project’s only major evaluation study, but the MIC
PCU also financed an important survey of citizens’ awareness of the ICT Project and their
opinions concerning the benefits of project-financed e-services. Relevant conclusions from

                                                 21
Danang are summarized below, with details on both reports in Annex 5. The Danang study used
the e-GAF (e-Government Assessment Framework) which looks at ICT Outcomes, Program
Management and Governance, using qualitative, interview-based information in this case from
642 citizens, 75 businesses and 38 public agencies, including transport, health, science and
technology, Peoples’ Committees and DICs. The findings of three other methodologies discussed
in the Danang study are summarized briefly in Annex 5 but their research ranged more widely
and only a small portion of results can be attributed directly to the Project. An important objective
of the Danang study was to illustrate methodologies available for future ICT M&E.

    •    Project-financed Danang ICT Transaction Center, Data Center, Public WiFi and
         Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) are providing good quality services to the public and
         government agencies.
    •    E-services being quite new, their current role is focused more on information than
         transactions. Citizens’ IT skills/access remain limited and information campaigns about
         e-service availability/usage were still ongoing at the time of this study.
    •    With more services migrating online and demand increasing, human resource capacity
         and budgets must also be scaled up with attention focused on managing information
         security and measuring ICT performance.
    •    Danang’s ICT strategy is based on consultative, inclusive processes involving
         stakeholders and awareness of ICT is high among senior city managers interviewed.
    •    Due to the Project, Danang City’s e-government was rated top of the Vietnam ICT Index
         for five years (2009-2013) and its ICT development is entering a maturing phase.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant

4.1      Final supervision missions and video-conferences associated with ICR preparation
obtained opinions from the PIUs and MIC/PCU on factors likely to foster the maintenance of
installed systems. In the country context, waning interest/investment in the ICT sector is not seen
as a risk either at the central or provincial levels, while recent legal directives, resolutions and
decisions underscore Vietnam’s commitment to ICT in industrialization, modernization and
institutional development. Nevertheless, significant risks include: technical, since the project
financed a large amount of innovative technology and systems; financial as indicated by the need
for adequate budget to fund operation, maintenance and replacement costs as well as human
resources development; and social, the latter equated with citizens’ IT literacy and building
sustained demand for the services and facilities implemented. The ICR believes it probable that
the achievements of strong performers like Danang and GSO will be sustained, but uncertainty is
associated with MIC and Hanoi, the assessed project benefits to date are couched in terms of
likelihoods based mostly on similar external experiences, and overall sustainability of the Project
must be questioned given that even its restructured stage is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory and
several large procurement packages were not completed until the final months. 15 Final
supervision missions, and video-conferences associated with ICR preparation discussed with the
PIUs and MIC/PCU the factors likely to ensure that project development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) would be maintained/realized.


15
    The project team opted for a conservative approach to rating the post-Restructuring phase, deciding on MU to
acknowledge its continuing difficult trajectory, last minute execution of key procurement packages and lack of time to
conduct user surveys, although the vast majority of planned systems, equipment and training were implemented and
operational, with substantial cost savings, and with early/preliminary indications of reduced transaction costs and
greater efficiency.

                                                         22
4.2     Technical: GSO intends to increase public access to its statistical databases, standardize
additional data sets and install them in its statistical hub for use across departments, open further
databases to public access, maximize the data mining capacity of new systems, and pilot
automatic on-demand report generation and provision. Hanoi and Danang have specific plans to
expand e-services availability while increasing ICT uptake/usage. In most cases where relevant,
suppliers delivered O&M training and both national and local authorities are well-informed on
the budget needed to maintain connectivity, especially for Internet. The issue of ICT security -
flagged in the Danang study - has lagged and needs attention, while rapid technological change,
obsolescence (including of the Enterprise Architecture) and development of a national ICT
innovation sector are issues of broad national interest and relevant to sustainability.

4.3       Financial and institutional: Project-financed infrastructure, e-services and public
facilities will remain operational. Adequate budget is available in most cases to maintain project-
financed equipment, infrastructure and e-services, except for MIC/PIU which is still negotiating
with related departments in MIC itself, MOFA and MPT for the budget needed for the rest of
2014. MIC’s task is more complex, covering the public sector, citizens and business. It has
requested budget for M&E of e-services at the provincial level. Most project-trained staff have
returned to their respective agencies with expected institutional benefits, and public e-facilities
are open for business and adequately-staffed. PIU teams are aware that extending e-government
facilities to other public services entails risks in terms of the availability of specialized/trained
human resources, adequate budgets and demand. GSO is recommending that the Statistical Law
be updated to create the mechanism for fee-based information services. Dissemination of project
results and lessons to stakeholders and promoting demand is an acknowledged priority.

4.4      Social: Recognizing that citizens’ ICT literacy is comparatively low, Danang launched
new Citizens Services Centers (one-stop facilities) to build familiarity with ICT, and provide
incentives such as inexpensive computers and laptops. 16 Danang also plans to roll out the public
services developed under several procurement packages, extend free WiFi services until 2016,
complete the migration of public applications to its Data Center and pilot common data-sharing.
Hanoi plans appropriate public information on e-services available via TV and radio, and seeks to
deepen the behavioral change in government’s interaction with citizens/business via the Hanoi
Portal, as well as inter-agency relationships. The rapidly-changing socio-economic environment
in Vietnam means that GSO will need faster and more accurate data on trends and thus strong
O&M of sophisticated systems is essential and well-understood.

5. Assessment of Bank and Recipient Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Unsatisfactory
5.1.1 Quality at entry was Unsatisfactory overall. Among positive attributes, the Project was
timely and responded to defined country needs, plans and policies. The Bank team sought to
ensure that design reflected best practice, global research findings and lessons. Evidence suggests
that the internal discussion/review of the proposed operation was candid and wide-ranging. The
basic technical approach was sound as the Project could not achieve its objectives without the
ICT infrastructure, systems and training financed. Even so, project complexity exceeded the


16
   GOV data shows that by end-2012, some 35% of the population was using internet (31.2 million people), 4.78
million were broadband subscribers, and 18.8% of households had computers.

                                                       23
country conditions/context and promised too much. The ICR suggests that the preparation team
should have contained more experienced ICT operational staff. The Results Framework lacked
coherence and was not understood by the clients, who lacked even basic readiness to implement.
The operation was immensely ambitious for a first-round ICT project and IDA funding exceeded
absorptive capacity. There was inadequate acknowledgment of known risks and calibration of the
project to existing human resource capacity, i.e., a schedule which took the learning curve into
account. Project scope was broad, especially private sector goals lacking a convincing rationale
for their inclusion in a publicly-led project. The institutional/implementation arrangements lacked
synergy and created operational difficulties and inefficiencies although it appears that the multi-
PIU approach had few alternatives under ODA rules. But this should have prompted
analysis/negotiation of mechanisms for cross-PIU collaboration.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.1.2 The Bank Team conducted 11 supervision missions over a seven year period (based on
Aide Memoires and ISRs), well under the Bank’s norm, with uneven spacing of missions (e.g.,
gaps exceeding 12 months from 2009 to 2012). While this does not take into account regular
Bank Procurement and FM supervision out of Hanoi, the impression is that at least until the final
two years, supervision from Bank headquarters was uneven. Management recommended
immediately post-effectiveness that the inexperienced PIUs receive intensive Bank supervision
but missions from headquarters did not increase even though broader forms of guidance were
needed, especially for the most recently-constituted PIUs. The MTR accurately diagnosed the
issues affecting progress but the continuing rigidity of project design – technical, operational and
institutional – and the Bank team’s inability to simplify the Results Framework, improve its
coherence and measurability, and focus on development impact, meant that the 2010
Restructuring – a direct outcome of the MTR - had only modest influence on the subsequent pace
and quality of implementation. The ICR notes that certain design elements planned at appraisal
disappeared early on from the project/supervision agenda: regular consultation with the private
sector/SMEs; introduction of demonstration models of e-government; focus on business process
change and mobilization of private investment in the ICT sector; and, establishing the planned IT
Innovation Fund.

5.1.3 Supervision intensity and quality improved in the final two years, as did the realism of
project ratings. The change in Bank task management turned the supervision focus onto
diagnosing the main constraints, assigning ICT procurement specialists to the PIUs, and building
awareness of development impact. This intensity was costly in terms of supervision budget, as
noted in 2.4.6. The ICR suggests that in challenging countries with complex operations, the
Country Management Unit (CMU) may need to provide a higher coefficient for supervision.
High-level Bank/GOV consultations in 2012 on the Bank’s Vietnam portfolio, and subsequent
ministerial directives to PIUs provided critical “weight” to the task team’s efforts which included
a second restructuring to inter alia, promote organized project measurement via further
adjustments to the Results Framework. 17 Completion of procurement packages linked directly to
the PDO became the top priority. Within this finalization scenario, formal impact evaluation had
insufficient time and unsuitable institutional conditions for initiation, although Danang and MIC
PCU did conduct studies.


17
    The 2013 adjustments were the result of an intensive, thoughtful process to link project indicators to the PDO and to
reflect what was happening on the ground. However, the excessive number of indicators was not addressed and internal
targets for each indicator were increased to ensure the capture of all achievements. See Data Sheet and Annex 2.

                                                          24
5.1.4 Fiduciary supervision was satisfactory overall and accompanied the general supervision
effort closely because Bank FM and Procurement specialists were located in Hanoi. Procurement
supervision was of outstanding quality in the final 18 months, complemented by ICT
Procurement Specialists from Bank Headquarters driving the completion of all planned packages.
Safeguards supervision was not relevant to this project.

5.1.5 The rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory for Bank supervision quality reflects the overall
performance since Effectiveness. The ICR acknowledges the strong- and ultimately successful -
effort by the Bank task team working with the PIUs to salvage this project in the final two years.
The high cost of supervision (Annex 4) in FY 12-13 testifies to this effort to complete all
procurement packages, ensure that installed equipment/systems were operational and oversee the
orderly completion of the Project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.1.6 This rating takes into account major weaknesses in the preparation phase affecting quality
at entry, the more mixed supervision performance which included well-diagnosed but in practical
terms, overly-conservative and unsuccessful efforts to generate progress. While sustained
improvement resulted from exceptional measures to salvage the Project in the final years of a
seven year operation, this is considered insufficient to raise the rating for overall Bank
performance into the Satisfactory range.

5.2 Recipient Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
5.2.1 Government of Vietnam: Government commitment to the Project was uneven over time
and its performance showed significant shortcomings. On the one hand, Government maintained
its policy stance on promoting ICT as an engine of modernization and socio-economic
development. However: Government dragged its feet in sending the Bank a request for the
essential second restructuring despite repeated reminders; its response to high level Bank
consultations regarding the Project - within the context of non-performing projects in the Vietnam
portfolio – was the result of the Bank’s insistence on action, not its own proactivity, although its
directives to participating agencies did have a positive impact on subsequent performance;
Government’s last minute request for further extension of the closing date was unjustified; its
overall coordination of project activities was deficient; and, implementation of its overall ICT/e-
Government Strategy and its Administrative Reform Program was slow with inadequate
coordination between the two and effects on the Project including staffing, salaries and skills
development. The e-readiness factor was acknowledged in the PAD but project design was not
modified, i.e., the Bank shares some responsibility.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.2.2 MIC (PCU and PIU): The Recipient was formally the State Bank of Vietnam with
responsibility for project coordination delegated initially to the Ministry of Posts and Telematics
(MPT), subsequently changed to the Ministry of Information and Communications (MIC). Pre-
MTR, MIC operated with three distinct project teams (PMU, PCU and PIU), a structure not
discussed in the PAD. These teams changed twice early on, affecting continuity and the Project’s

                                                25
institutional memory. Ownership of the Project was inconsistent over time. MIC lacked a clear
sense of purpose for its Subproject. The Procurement Plan changed repeatedly and new ideas
resulted in long and difficult consensus-building. The PCU staff, although large, was
inexperienced in project management, did not work proactively with its technical subgroups and
had difficulty functioning effectively as the coordinating unit for the entire Project. The technical
subcommittees were unable to develop strategic, implementable procurement plans for the
Ministry and consultancies were not effectively deployed. Some 18 international study toursMIC
delivered a Completion Report of reasonable quality, limited to its own and the PIU/MOFA
activities, not the consolidated version agreed before project closing. Competence, leadership,
mobilization and coordination issues to varying degrees persisted throughout.                  Rated:
Unsatisfactory.

5.2.3 Hanoi: Several key issues hindered progress in the first stage of the project, including
repeated turnover in team membership, lack of qualified staff for procurement, project
management and technical aspects, and ineffective use of consultancies. There were protracted
delays in mobilizing to effectively implement the Project. Territorial reorganization of the Hanoi
City Government further delayed decision-making and obscured project objectives. Approval
processes for procurement packages were long and lacked any sense of urgency. Obtaining
timely approvals within DIC and from the PPC was a major constraint. Expansion of Hanoi City
meant that the development level was uneven city-wide. The PIU sought to focus on rolling out
infrastructure services and capacity-building to bridge the digital divide and ensure readiness of
users before developing e-applications. Hanoi was the first PIU to complete finalization of
bidding documents under the Bank’s new bidding parameters after 2010 and it made reasonable
progress in the final years. Rated: Moderately Unsatisfactory. 18

5.2.4 GSO: This agency/PIU performed well, including in the difficult initial years of the
Project, with strong disbursement. Positive factors: (i) GSO’s relative autonomy and sense of a
shared mission among its 5,000-odd staff (including 64 provincial offices); (ii) direct reporting
and access to the Ministry of Planning and Investments; (iii) leadership and commitment of the
GSO Director General and management team, especially for using ICT for Change Management;
(iv) strength, diligence and technical qualifications of the GSO PIU, although in the final two
years the timeliness and quality of some bidding documents was inadequate; and, (v) ability to
leverage expertise of international consultants in procurement. GSO planned/executed a good
communications and outreach campaign to sensitize GSO staff and the public on the
modernization process. It increased the scope and sophistication of additional tools (from the
additional reallocation of US$6.2 m in 2010) for data capture/collection, storage, analysis and
dissemination. GSO positioned itself as a center of data intelligence and analysis to benefit
government, investors, international agencies and citizens, using new technologies for change
management, business process re-engineering, and transparent provision of information to
clients/stakeholders. It sought to acquire a state of the art statistical information system with
business intelligence tools to improve decision-making for policy-makers, investors and
development agencies. Rated: Highly Satisfactory




18
  The Hanoi PIU, in its comments on the Bank’s draft ICR, strongly disagreed with this rating stating that it felt its
performance had greatly improved after the Mid-term Review and merited a Satisfactory. The Bank does not agree
with this assessment and retained the rating of MU. See Section 7.


                                                         26
5.2.5 Danang City: The Danang PIU performed exceptionally well throughout and the city
became a national ICT leader, a remarkable achievement given its modest capacity when formally
assessed in 2004. As noted, demand for IDA funds steadily increased to meet the city’s ICT
development vision and plans. While disbursement was initially slow, the PIU rapidly laid the
foundation for accelerated execution of its Subproject: (i) conducting a city-wide review of
government processes; (ii) identifying specific services to be electronically streamlined; (iii)
developing a strategy and roadmap for e-government; (iv) effectively training Chief Information
Officers (CIOs); (v) making serious efforts to collaborate – especially on training – with other
PIUs; and (vi) conducting international study tours. Success resulted from the PIU’s strong,
committed leadership, management and technical skills, and clear procurement timetables. It was
able to work with specialist consultancies to design/execute sound plans, and had a good grasp of
the status and future of ICT infrastructure city-wide. The PIU had the full support of and good
relationships with the PPC Leadership (unlike other PIUs) whose high commitment to using ICT
for Change Management promoted faster and more efficient approval of procurement packages.
Its overall approach was practical, innovation-driven and stakeholder-aware. Danang recognized
the technical expertise and management capacity needed to apply the IT EA on a city-wide scale
and developed/extended e-government services well beyond what was anticipated at appraisal
through skillful use of available (and additional) funds. Rated: Highly Satisfactory.

5.2.6 HCMC: The HCMC Subproject was cancelled by the 2010 Restructuring. The PIU took
a mixed loan/grant arrangement but planned outputs (up to the MTR) were implemented with city
budget funds, not IDA. HCMC was relatively advanced in its ICT endowment at the time of the
2004 assessment but even so, e-services were receiving an average of only 6,000 requests per
month, modest for a city of 8 million. Despite Bank efforts, disbursements of IDA funds were
zero at the time of the MTR. The PIU had prepared no procurement or training plans and had no
staff assigned to procurement or FM. The main issues affecting HCMC were: (i) DICs’ limited
commitment – there was no meeting with the Bank team for two years; (ii) weak leadership of the
Subproject and inadequate supervision by the PPC and MIC; (iii) poor implementation capacity,
with frequent staff changes resulting in limited understanding of the Subproject approach and
Bank procurement and FM procedures; and, (iv) lack of responsiveness to repeated Bank requests
about the city’s plans to use IDA funds. The PIU was barely able to absorb its city budget and
had no chance of using its IDA allocation. Rated: Unsatisfactory

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.2.9 This rating takes into account the following: (i) Government’s sustained policy stance on
ICT-based modernization but moderate shortcomings in terms of the pace and depth of ICT-
related policy implementation relevant to the Project, combined with its uneven commitment and
responsiveness over time and weak project coordination; (ii) sustained, highly satisfactory
performance by GSO and Danang, balanced by uneven performance of Hanoi and unsatisfactory
performance of MIC and HCMC.

6. Lessons Learned

         The complexity of project design needs to be balanced carefully against the client’s
human resource endowment and readiness to execute. Scope, scale and scheduling are critical
considerations in an innovative, foundational project, especially when the client lacks experience
with the Bank. While many Bank projects entail “learning by doing”, capacity must be assessed
realistically, and minimum professional and administrative frameworks should be in place before


                                               27
effectiveness to launch activities and build momentum. Front-loading selected, strategic activities
into the pre-Board stage and focusing time and budget on human resource development are
essential. Practical examples include: having bidding documents ready prior to Board approval as
part of the primary feasibility studies to promote better disbursement flow in the initial years;
allocating a significant portion of the project budget to change management/initiatives; using
Project Preparation Facility (PPF) or Trust Funds to put Enterprise Architecture (EA) in place or
conduct EA studies before Board approval to ensure the foundation for subsequent procurement;
addressing the issue of ICT and especially Internet penetration to promote rapid evolution of e-
services into end-to-end transactions and accelerate citizen uptake; and, greater focus on the
human behavioral change element which can directly affect project progress and measurement.
         Multi-unit institutional arrangements, if unavoidable, demand that the Bank
negotiate mechanisms for joint management of essential functions and structured
opportunities for collaboration. The objective is to avoid duplication of operational and
administrative efforts, inefficiencies, and other well-known “silo” effects. Joint frameworks for
procurement, financial management and M&E could have simplified project execution and
promoted efficiency without sacrificing human capital formation. This could have been tried in
Hanoi where the MIC, GSO and Hanoi PIUs were based. Also, led by Danang and GSO, regular
exchanges of experiences and knowledge would have been valuable for Hanoi and MIC.
         Cancellation would have limited the knowledge gained from implementing this
important project but restructuring and extending it in 2010 without addressing design
issues was an inefficient use of Bank resources. The ICR concludes that the first restructuring
was too conservative and essentially preserved weak design features contributing to
implementation delays requiring further restructuring and entailing high supervision costs. The
Project needed overall simplification, re-negotiation of the institutional arrangements - at
minimum for FM and Procurement – and a marked focus on building leadership.
         Bank procurement requirements, processes and documents are not optimal for the
fast-evolving IT sector and this needs review. The Bank’s portfolio of investments in IT
systems and equipment tends to perform poorly, importantly due to procurement constraints. The
no-objection process can be slow, and Bank support to inexperienced counterpart teams
inconsistent. GSO and Danang PIUs reported delays from one to two years in some packages due
to the need for adjustments and re-submission to the Bank. Meanwhile, innovation caused
technical specifications to become outdated, contracting could not proceed and further bid
evaluations and no objections were required, compounding delay. The Bank needs to revise its
IT procurement documents and procedures which have repeatedly proven unsuitable/unwieldy for
Bank projects in the technologically fast-moving IT sector.
         Intervention of senior Bank management with national authorities can galvanize
project performance in a failing situation. If the Project team continues to see the operation as
worth completing but has been unable to promote progress, high level Bank intervention should
be considered. Timing is critical and it may need to occur as a standalone event. Also, the
renovation of Bank project task management, bringing in the seasoned ICT specialists essential
for projects of this kind and a tighter, more vigorous approach to supervision can effectively
salvage an operation, even one with chronic difficulties.
         ICT projects need to focus on both the supply and demand sides, the latter being an
important driver of longer-term sustainability. Plans to further expand online services require
attention to user uptake/adoption through repeated communications campaigns tailored to diverse
stakeholders and able to solicit feedback to improve e-services quality. The demand side is still
weak for many project-supported e-services even in Danang. Citizens prefer traditional “counter-
service” accounting for the modest usage of fully transactional online applications even at the end
of the Project. That said, many e-services were implemented only in the final year, and demand is
also dependent on computer ownership, access and literacy. Finally, the design of a City Portal


                                                28
needs to allow for year-round citizen feedback and engagement functions, with features
promoting the smooth transition from manual to digital/e-transactions.
         The rationale for including weighty private sector goals in a foundational project
focused on e-government should be clearly defined. Adequate tools should be provided and a
specific strategy devised to achieve and measure goals which include private sector development
and improved productivity. Having the public sector take the lead in fostering private sector
development through ICT usage was not matched by appropriate tools, limited in practice to
training and awareness-building.
         ICT projects can materially impact the behavior and performance of government,
business and citizens and require the same high standards of monitoring and evaluation
design and execution as projects in other sectors. Proven evaluation frameworks and
methodologies for ICT projects/programs are available. This project demonstrated the
implications of a weak M&E framework and inadequate focus on establishing an MIS and a time-
bound evaluation strategy and products. Bank-wide by late decade, the focus on M&E quality
was much stronger, yet as late as 2012 most PIUs lacked understanding of the PDO/indicators
and had not attempted their measurement. The ICR suggests inter alia, that the project team could
have obtained an independent, third party, objective review to help re-design the RF at the time of
the Level One Restructuring.
         That said, it is nevertheless unrealistic to expect that the deeper impacts of newly-
constructed ICT systems can be measured by end-project. For foundational projects of this
type, two indicators – essentially proxies for impact - should be of primary concern: number and
type of services online and, numbers of users or uptake of those services. Global experience
shows that a minimum of 3-5 years are needed to permit consolidation and second stage
developments before impacts such as transparency, user satisfaction, cost reduction and
productivity can be measured meaningfully.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Recipient/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

7.1     MIC PCU: In response to the Bank’s draft ICR, the MIC PCU sent a letter (see Annex
7) with brief comments, primarily requesting that the Bank reassess its rating for MIC
performance on the basis of two reports accompanying the letter (MIC PCU Completion Report
and a Project Performance Audit Report (KDiAsia, 2014), designed to provide internal guidance
to MIC). The project team reviewed both documents, finding that they accord with the ICR’s
representation of the Project’s achievements and experiences. However, the team’s assessment of
the overall performance of MIC PCU/PIU was sustained.

7.2      Hanoi PIU: The Hanoi PIU, in its comments on the Bank’s draft ICR, strongly disagreed
with the Bank’s performance rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory stating: “Hanoi agrees that
there was slow progress in the first stage of the Project. However, since the Mid-term Review in
2010, Hanoi has improved a lot and we cannot deny its achievements in project implementation.
Deeply understanding ourselves, Hanoi clearly knows what we can do and what we cannot do
within the framework of this Project. That’s why Hanoi decided to drop some packages and focus
on the most important and feasible ones. For the remaining packages, we always completed on
committed time and the outcomes of these packages are 100% achieved. So we would like to be
rated as Satisfactory." The ICR believes the rating of MU is correct.

Danang and Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC). Changes were made to some components by the 2010 Restructuring including canceling the
HCMC subproject altogether.

Subproject 1: ICT Leadership and MPT (MIC) Modernization

This subproject sought to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Posts and Telematics in development, implementation and
oversight of Government’s national ICT strategy and policies; strengthen its capacity to formulate telecommunications and ICT
policy; and, improve its operating efficiency and effectiveness. The ICT capability of other government ministries would also be
improved via the function of the CIO (Chief Information Officer). There were six components: Development of e-Government
capability in MPT; Creating an MPT Flagship Portal; Creating a center for training, improving and managing CIOs; Training in ICT
Policy and Regulation; IT and Telecommunications Regulation; and, IT Architecture and Interoperability Framework for e-
Government. The ICR notes that the original description of the components in the PAD, Annex 4 shows Subproject 1 with 6
components and 32 individual activities, many of which show no clear link as outputs supporting the Subproject-based Intermediate
Outcome Indicators in the Results Framework. This list was modified by the 2010 Restructuring and the gap with the also-revised RF
seems to have widened.

Subprojects 3, 4 and 5: E-Government and E-Development:

Subprojects for Hanoi, Danang and Ho Chi Minh City e-Government had similar objectives and components, supporting activities to enhance the
ICT environment in these cities, and providing the basic foundation for deployment of e-Government in their district offices and departments.
They were expected to facilitate the development of various types of e-government services, e-applications for business, and development of ICT
skills. These were expected to have a positive impact on government accountability, effectiveness, transparency, access to information by citizens
and the business community, citizen and business interactions, and public administration reform efforts. The competitiveness of SMEs was
expected to improve, with positive spillover effects on their trade opportunities. Despite broad similarities, individual subproject design reflected
the different status of ICT development in each city and their particular application needs. Outputs were as follows:

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The following analyzes the impact of the World Bank Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) Project in Vietnam. It looks at (1) efficiency gains of specific interventions as
well as (2) overall project efficiency. This includes the Danang subproject and General Statistics
Office (GSO) subprojects. In many instances the precise impact is difficult if not impossible to
measure due to a lack of baseline data and detailed financial and operating information. Instead,
the analysis reports what can be reasonably assumed based on documented experiences elsewhere.
Efficiency gains of specific interventions
Project interventions have impacts on three groups: government, businesses and citizens. For
government, efficiencies from ICT include higher output with lower expenses due to cost savings
including reduction in duplication and service delivery times. Citizens and businesses achieve
greater efficiency through time and cost savings when accessing government information and
services. There are also benefits that are difficult to measure including the contribution of online
public services to the quality of life of businesses and citizens; improved business and citizen
decision making due to the availability of easier to access information; and linkages between
government and private sector to create new business opportunities (e.g., open data).

Danang Subproject:
The Danang Subproject had impacts on government, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and
citizens.

Government
According to the Vietnam project teams, interventions impacted the government positively due to
the transition from manual to computerized methods:

    •   The competence of city officials grew to a higher level due to knowledge and skills they
        received through intensive IT training. This opened the way for solid and sustainable
        development of the city in the coming years.
    •   A citizen-centric government has been established where interactions between
        individuals, businesses and government departments will become more streamlined and
        easier.
    •   Coordination and interconnection among departments and agencies in delivery of public
        services improved.

The transition from manual to computerized processes results in lower costs and shorter
processing times. Measuring this requires an assessment of the amount of time spent and costs
carrying out processes before and after the intervention. In the absence of such information, some
inferences can be made:

    •   Government ICT competency was increased through training programs leading to
        understanding of how to implement IT systems with consequent efficiency gains. Further
        awareness of IT benefits is likely to reduce resistance to restructuring business processes.
    •   Interactions between government, businesses and citizens became more streamlined
        resulting in quicker processing times.


                                                63
       •    Coordination among different public agencies resulted in a reduction of duplication
            leading to greater efficiency and cost savings. For example multiple databases maintained
            by different city departments were streamlined with common codes and system
            architecture, reducing duplication and simplifying maintenance.
       •    It is also noteworthy that Danang has ranked in the top position of the Vietnam ICT Index
            for five straight years (2009-2013) a period that coincides with the ICT Development
            Project. Note that prior to the intervention a stakeholder consultation in 2004 rated the
            city’s status of ICT development as limited/very limited. 23

SMEs
Several interventions impacted SMEs including:

       •    Application systems were built to meet SME requirements including the “Business
            Registration System", "Investment Project Management System", "Fishing Boat
            Management System", and "Construction Permit Management System";
       •    Significant information was provided for SME business activities via the Contact Center
            (76% public services related to SMEs);
       •    400 courses in ICT are available in e-Learning Portal;
       •    75 software developers from SMEs have gone through Software Engineering training
            courses;
       •    50 IT experts from the private sector joined the training course about the Danang e-
            Government Platform.
There is evidence that these types of interventions are likely to have positively impacted SMEs in
Vietnam. For example, World Bank research suggests that development of online business
registration systems that reduce complexity, time and costs lead to a rise in business registrations
and employment as well as generating income for the government. 24 Similarly, facilitating
construction permits through online applications saves businesses time and money. 25

The contact centers would facilitate business activities by providing a medium for enterprises to
easily contact government agencies about matters such as policy, operating hours, general
information or to voice a concern. This reduces costs for both the government and business.

The training interventions will likely have increased the ability of SMEs to use relevant e-
government services as well as incorporate ICTs in their businesses raising productivity.

Citizens
A number of interventions were aimed at citizens:

     •   Over 315 public services delivered via the Danang Portal for citizens;
     •   Basic IT training courses (68 sessions) delivered on television;
     •   400 courses in ICT are available on the e-Learning Portal;
     •   1,125 citizens received IT training via the Danang Training and Applied Research
         Center; and,
     •   Danang Public Wi-Fi with 329 Access Points provides Wi-Fi coverage over the city
         center including all main city routes, beaches, offices of departments and agencies,
         communes and wards and public areas to serve citizens and tourists.

The delivery of online public services benefits citizens by reducing the cost and time of
travelling to and waiting at, government offices. Sri Lanka showed significant savings in time
from implementing online citizen services: the period to issue birth, marriage and death
certificates dropped from hours to just a few minutes.26 A survey of European citizens found that
80% replied that online public services saved them time, 76% appreciated the flexibility of
conducting government processes anytime and from home and 62% replied they saved money. 27
Similarly a survey carried out for Danang found that 45% of respondents expected the project’s e-
services to save time, 35% stated it would be more convenient, and 23% expected to save costs. 28
Assuming that the Internet penetration rate is the same in Danang as the nationwide average, then
around a third of citizens could take advantage of the online public services implemented through
the project.

Availability of different ICT training options via television, online portal and physical classes
promotes digital literacy of citizens, providing flexibility in how they can access learning
opportunities. This will enable them to more successfully use e-government as well as other
online services and applications.

City-wide Wi-Fi availability saves citizens the time of having to find a physical location when
they need use the Internet. Since the intervention was free, it also saves citizens money. Note that
there are also benefits to government in terms of making online public services more accessible
and allowing government employees to access the Internet when outside the office. Businesses
also benefit; for example customers could find businesses easier using location services over the
Internet and business could exploit social media and other applications to create innovative
relationships with customers. 29

   According to one source, other impacts of the free city Wi-Fi include "...better IT infrastructure; boost
trade promotion, lure more investment, advertise tourism images and raise cultural and educational

                                                    65
Estimated costs savings to citizens: An estimate of the cost savings to citizens from free Wi-Fi
can be made by calculating the cost of Internet access for which they no longer have to pay. This
makes the following assumptions:

       •   The proportion of Internet users in Danang is the same as that across the country (36% in
           2012). 30 This results in an estimate of around 345,700 Internet users in Danang. 31
       •   It assumes that one third of such Internet users would use the free citywide Wi-Fi
           service. 32
       •   The cost of a mobile data package is VND 70,000 33 (US$3.36 34) per month.

Based on these assumptions the savings to citizens would be US$383,409 a month (114,081 users
X US$3.36 (cost of Internet access per month)).

The projects also supported quality of life interventions for citizens such as e-service for Water
Quality Monitoring (financed for Danang) and improved bus/transport services (GIS
equipped/Danang).

GSO Subproject:
For the GSO subproject, the following efficiency gains were observed:

          Data collection and processing for the 2009 Census was reduced to 14 months from 24
           months (42% reduction) as a result of project-supported ICT improvements. The
           calculated cost savings is US$500,000 based on the 450 data entry staff used for the 2009
           Population Census 35 and assuming they receive the average monthly income for




standards for the city." See: “Da Nang Provides Free Wi-Fi Coverage.” 2012. VietNamNet, May 11.

         months as compared to 14 months is US$500,276.
        Forms scanning hardware used for the 2011 Agriculture and Rural Census generated a
         50% improvement in overall processing time with time reduced from 2 years to 1.
        The time for data collection and processing for Consumer Price Index (CPI) surveys was
         reduced by one third from 15 to 10 days following the introduction of new IT processes.

In addition, the GSO subproject reduced duplication significantly by harmonizing and integrating
databases into a standard system architecture. The provision of additional free statistics online
would also have improved decision making by both the government and the private sector. 37
Overall project efficiency
Several factors contributed to overall project implementation efficiency for Danang and the GSO.
Two key factors were: (i) the skills of the PIU; and (ii) competitive bidding. The Danang PIU
project manager had significant expertise in both technology and project management. Further he
had good relations with local leaders at all levels. This helped speed up the local authority’s
approval for all submissions. Similarly, there was good coordination between the GSO PIU and
technical and business staff, enhancing work flows and reducing implementation time.

The competitive bidding process for all Danang packages resulted in significant cost savings. The
original overall budget of the Danang Subproject was US$ 17,310,000. In 2010 when the project
was restructured, additional funding of US$10,000,000 was allocated due to successful
implementation. This brought the total value of Danang Subproject to US$27,310,000. Following
5 years of implementation, Danang PIU has saved a total of US$6,146,000 through competitive
procurement practices. This allowed the PIU to acquire additional equipment with the savings.
Though not as large as Danang, the other PIUs also achieved cost savings on procurement
packages. In aggregate, project savings totaled over US$15.0 million and most of this is likely to
have been used for other equipment, systems etc.

Conclusions
Although detailed information necessary for carrying out a comprehensive efficiency analysis is
lacking, the anecdotal data suggests that the project interventions are already having an impact on
reducing costs for government and saving time for SMEs and citizens. These benefits can be
expected to grow as the e-services evolve in scope and functionality and more Vietnamese use the
Internet.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

5.1     The following summarizes the results of a major study and an important assessment. The
Project financed a study in 2013 under procurement contract DNG14 entitled: “Assessing the
Status of Danang e-Government Implementation”, conducted by consultants Leading Associates
and KDi Asia. It is important to note that the study does not focus exclusively on the ICT
Development Project but it does refer to specific results from the Project where relevant. The
study is important for providing a roadmap of how evaluation of ICT projects in Vietnam might
be conducted from here on, establishes a form of baseline for doing that, and emphasizes building
strong M&E of ICT programs. Its findings – specifically those pertaining directly to the Bank-
supported project - are summarized below along with important lessons for such projects. The
second report/assessment is entitled “Report on Performance Assessment of Communications
Campaign for Vietnam ICT Development Project” conducted by An Vien Telecommunications
and Communications Company in December, 2013 under contract to the MIC PCU.

Danang Study:

5.2     Methodology: The study proposes and itself uses, the e-Government Assessment
Framework (eGAF), which provides a comprehensive review of e-government from three
important domains: ICT Outcomes which assesses user satisfaction, service quality, information
quality and systems quality; ICT Program Management assesses quantitative data from diverse
sources for six dimensions: projects, applications, infrastructure, security and architecture,
regulations and human resources; and ICT Governance which looks at five dimensions via
questionnaires and an interview-sourced capability maturity assessment in each selected public
agency. Conducted under the DNG 14 procurement package, Leading Associates/KDi Asia
interviewed 75 SMEs, 642 citizens and 38 public sector departments and agencies - the latter
including health, transport and science and technology agencies - and Peoples’ Committees. A
summary of the survey framework is attached but does not contain the citizen or business
questionnaires (requested from firm but not provided).

Results of e-GAF:

ICT Outcomes Assessment: This domain used qualitative, survey/questionnaire-sourced data
from citizens, businesses and public agencies:

     •   E-Government in Danang City has brought the city to the top position of the Vietnam ICT
         Index for five years continuously (2009-2013).
     •   This occurred within the life of the ICT Development Project and in a city where a
         stakeholder consultation in 2004 rated the city’s status of ICT development as limited/very
         limited under major themes. 38
     •   E-Government in Danang City has entered a maturing phase of its development;


38
   Ratings for Danang were as follows in 2004: (i) business process changes, ICT as a strategic tool: Very Limited; (ii)
true integration, data sharing, workflow, functional applications: Limited; (iii) training of officials: some progress but
low awareness and competence still a key constraint; (iv) connectivity, LANs: more required particularly at district and
ward level; (v) WAN: some, but less than other cities; and (vi) basic computerization: medium progress but more
needed, particularly districts and wards.


                                                           70
   •    The Danang ICT Transaction Center operates six days/week from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm for
        general enquiries about public services.
   •    The Danang Data Center, Public Wi-Fi and Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) are
        providing good quality infrastructure to the public and to government agencies.
   •    At the time of the study, online services in Danang were tending to play a greater role in
        providing information to the public on public service procedures than as a new method for
        online transactions between Government and the public.
   •    This is explained by the still-limited ICT skills and competence of citizens and the fact
        that in a small city like Danang, people can still transact face-to-face with agency
        representatives, whose services are generally well-rated.
   •    Citizens also believe that personal transactions foster accountability and transparency, and
        enable them to participate in government policy-making.
   •    While most citizens are satisfied with public services of Danang City, the level of
        satisfaction for online services is expected to further increase once end-to-end services –
        still in the pipeline at the time of the study - are introduced.
   •    The study recommends that the City pay attention to the digital society and knowledge
        economy aspects of ICT and e-Governance development, supporting people’s skills
        development and access to computers/literacy.

ICT Program Management: This domain used quantitative data from diverse sources which
with the exception of Security and Architecture, were collected from existing reports and indices
(Danang ICT Steering Committee – on which the project was represented - annual ICT Current
Status Report; agencies’ project planning and implementation documents; and Vietnam’s annual
ICT Index):

    •    Successful implementation of all planned procurement packages establishing key systems
         and deploying a comprehensive ICT infrastructure, financed by the World Bank ICT
         Development Project, demonstrated Danang’s commitment to strong ICT management.
    •    Greater emphasis is needed on ICT Information Security practices.
    •    ICT Regulations were established and will need more frequent review and updating to
         reflect changing needs.
    •    An important issue is that the current human resource endowment cannot meet further
         ICT development/expansion needs without adequate staff and budget.
    •    With more services migrating online and demand increasing, capacity and resources must
         also scale up. ICT needs and organizational framework, as well as resources must be
         mandated to meet sector growth.

ICT Governance Assessment: This domain used questionnaires and interview-sources
capability maturity assessment in each selected public agency:

    •    Danang’s e-Government objectives are clear as enunciated in several forms such as the e-
         City Program which describes the modernization of the city through technology and ICT.
    •    The city’s ICT strategy is based on consultative, inclusive processes involving
         stakeholders and awareness of ICT is quite high among senior city managers.
    •    Policy instruments still do not define how ICT Governance is to be measured and the
         performance indicators for measuring progress.
    •    Danang’s Enterprise Architecture (EA) was formulated in 2009 under the ICT
         Development Project and attention is now needed to its updating.



                                                71
   •   Implementation of the Korean e-Government Standard Framework (eGovFrame)
       represents only the application architecture subset of the full EA scope and the EA should
       fully-incorporate this Framework.
   •   Evidence suggests there is no Risk Management Framework and Monitoring and that this
       will need attention.
   •   More resources are needed for managing information security oversight.
   •   There is not yet a framework for systematic monitoring, evaluation and assessment of
       performance of ICT processes. While some monitoring was in place at end-project, there
       were no specific performance parameters for assessing the outcomes of e-Government
       and evaluating the effectiveness of ICT governance.
   •   When the study was conducted, management of ICT projects was centralized in the PIU
       and DIC accounting for less awareness among other agencies not typically accountable
       for managing the ICT Development Project.
   •   The acquisition and deployment of ICT services under the ICT Development Project have
       been properly established but there is need for structured, better-defined and activated
       processes for managing change and releasing new e-services.
   •   More structured frameworks would improve the planning for and execution of initiatives
       to deliver the required level of service.
   •   Identification and monitoring of performance standards for quality of ICT service
       management and governance are currently centralized, and awareness of performance
       metrics and targets for existing online services is still developing.

Other Project-related results, events and trends reported by the study:

ICT Development Project-financed procurement “packages” have had positive impacts:

   •   Capacity of the ICT workforce was improved via the development of a Master Plan for
       ICT Human Resource Development (DNG9).
   •   New, end-to-end online services based on the e-Government Standard Framework
       (Korea) were introduced in 2013 (DNG 6-7 and DNG13).
   •   Danang City in late 2013 officially opened the Danang ICT Infrastructure System which
       includes Project-supported components: Danang Metropolitan Area Network (MAN);
       Public Wi-fi, ICT Training, the Applied Research Center and other related components.
   •   The City has won several international awards from organizations such as FutureGov, the
       2013 eAsia Award of AFACT, and Smarter Cities Challenges for successfully adopting
       ICT for citizens and to serve business organizations, as a direct outcome of the Project.
   •   Specific examples show that the cost of public administration was decreased through the
       effective application of ICT systems.

ICT Infrastructure Development Results:

   •   ICT infrastructure was modernized, becoming an important contact point for the national
       backbone network covering the city with networks based on international standards,
       providing good quality, diverse services.
   •   Danang MAN was re-constructed, connecting all government agencies, departments,
       districts and branches (enterprises, schools, hospitals) to support daily operations.
   •   100% of local government agencies are now connected to LAN and high speed Internet
       (ADSL)
   •   100% of staffs and employees working for all branches, departments and people’s
       committees of districts now have computers.

                                              72
   •   Fiber optic network system (Metronet) with 100Mb capacity is connected to 72
       government agencies.
   •   The Danang Data Center, ICT Transaction Center, ICT Infrastructure Development
       Center, Public Wi-Fi network and ICT Training Center are established and operational.

Human resources development:

   •   The Human Resource endowment in Danang has improved: the ICT Development
       Project’s main contribution has been through the development of an ICT Human
       Resource Development Master Plan (package DNG 9) backed by training;
   •   Training courses resulting from this plan included: CIO training for 27 city and
       department leaders; 18 training courses in e-Government and ICT governance skills for
       government managers and staff; technical training courses for diverse ICT stakeholders;
       study tours to developed countries to acquire understanding of best practices for e-
       Government development.
   •   Such training has improved the quality of the ICT workforce but is hampered by ICT
       human resources and civil service regulations.

ICT application development results:

   •   The study asserts that the Project’s installation of One-stop Shop software in 56
       communes in 2010 improved the effectiveness of government management. Managers
       can monitor and control administrative processes and all citizens can access the site for
       information.
   •   Almost all departments and agencies have a website/portal accessible by users at all times.
   •   Some 315 online e-services deployed to date were directly attributable to the ICT
       Development Project: Driving Licenses Management; Land Use Rights Management;
       Business Registration Management; e-Procurement; Building License Management;
       Geographical Information System (GIS) and others were being finalized under
       procurement packages DNG6-7 and DNG 13 at time of study completion.
   •   These services are based on e-GovFrame, a Korean open-source e-Government
       application framework.

Impact of the ICT Development Project in socio-economic development:

   •   Strong e-governance foundation for Danang.
   •   Positive impact on the operational capacity of the City.
   •   Improved productivity, quality and efficiency of key public services for people and
       business as well as public authorities from municipal to commune level.
   •   Significant progress towards establishing a “professional, responsible, active and
       effective administration for the people”.
   •   Authorities have significantly reduced the cost of public administration through the
       effective application of ICT systems and improved the operating efficiency of the
       administration while broadening people’s participation, improved the productivity and
       effectiveness of city government agencies in managing and serving people, increased the
       transparency of government activities and reduced bureaucracy.
   •   Equality of access to information through new channels of communication (email, text
       messages, phone calls/other) has improved, especially information about administrative
       procedures for people and business and service responsiveness has improved.


                                              73
Other methodologies applied by the study:

The e-GAF analysis is supplemented/complemented by three other methodologies seeking to
correlate and measure Danang’s achievements in e-Government. The results have been used very
selectively, i.e. only where the Project is specifically-mentioned to avoid attribution errors.

Public Administration Performance Index (PAPI): This is a policy monitoring instrument
providing objective, bottom-up, evidence-based measures of citizen’s experiences and direct
interactions in regard to standards of provincial level governance, public administration and
public services performance. Since 2010, PAPI has surveyed 32,500 citizens in 63 provinces, of
which 13,747 in 2012.

   •   Achievements of Danang related to the PAPI Index show close correlation to recent e-
       Government initiatives such as development of e-District and e-Ward systems, and fully-
       implemented One Stop Shop system (OSS) and Inter-Agencies One Stop Shop (IAOSS)
       systems.
   •   The Danang ICT Transaction Center (including a call center), in operation since 2012,
       has helped make public service procedures clearer to citizens and businesses.
   •   New online public services platform developed under packages DNG 6-7 and DNG 13
       are expected to continue supporting Danang’s high rating in the PAPI Index.

Provincial Competitiveness Index (PCI): This instrument assesses the ease of doing business,
economic governance, and administrative reform efforts by local governments of Vietnamese
provinces and cities to promote private sector development and only includes data supplied by
private, domestic operations. The 2012 report surveyed the perceptions of 8,053 domestic firms.
The PCI comprises nine sub-indices reflecting economic governance areas affecting private
sector development. No specific attribution to the Project is intended but it is reasonable to
assume that the Project made a contribution.

   •   Danang improved its rating from 2011 to 2012 in: informal charges; developed and high-
       quality business support services; reduced time requirements for bureaucratic procedures
       and inspections.
   •   These three components are described as having a very close relationship with the
       development of e-Government services in Danang City.

Public Administration Reform Index (PARI): Looking at three reform indices: Index of
Central Authorities; Index of Department Authority; and Index of District Authority and cross-
referencing them to the initial e-GAF assessment, the study concludes that:

   •   Danang’s e-Government initiatives and the Danang ICT Development Project in
       particular have had many positive impacts on the city’s socio-economic development;
   •   Comparing the e-GAF assessment on customer satisfaction with online public services
       and the PAR Index on public services, Danang citizens still prefer counter to online
       services (explained by the ICR as also stemming from citizens’ lack of access to
       computers, and to still-modest IT literacy).
   •   This explains the still modest utilization of fully-transactional online applications which
       in turn explains the so far modest overall impact of the e-Government program on other
       indices.
   •   From 2014 onward, operation of the new ICT infrastructure financed by the ICT
       Development Project may represent a significant challenge to Danang and therefore a

                                              74
       “proactive ICT governance framework should be established and information security
       provisions should be improved”.
   •   Importantly, to improve e-services usage rates, Danang needs a proper communications
       plan to promote ICT usage by stakeholders and to solicit their feedback to improve the
       quality of online services;

Study recommendations:

The study makes an extensive series of recommendations for future ICT development and
programs, summarized below:

ICT Monitoring and Evaluation:

   •   Adopt the eGAF framework for monitoring and evaluating e-Government and ICT
       Development ensuring consistency/linkages to the City’s socio-economic goals.
   •   Appoint a single unit accountable for coordinating and implementing assessment
       exercises.
   •   Conduct the ICT Outcomes assessment to focus on satisfaction levels of citizens and
       businesses, twice yearly or on a continuous basis through online “pop-ups”.
   •   Conduct the ICT program Management assessment by aggregating quantitative data on
       readiness from existing secondary data sources/indices, annually, supplemented by
       internal reports on adoption and implementation status of projects, ICT applications and
       infrastructure.
   •   Conduct the ICT Governance assessment every two years using trained assessors in
       consultation with responsible agency personnel and provide an objective evaluation of
       the capability maturity of ICT management in selected public agencies.

ICT Regulatory and Policy Management:

   •   Establish a central ICT Governance entity responsible for long-term strategy which aligns
       ICT strategy and includes business sector; integration of city-wide technology initiatives
       and compliance with ICT policies and standards; and compliance management with ICT
       Regulations and standards.
   •   Establish a Risk Management Framework including assessment and awareness-building,
       update risk registers, monitor risk mitigation initiatives, and establish risk responsibility.
   •   Minimize overlap, redundancy and cost in ICT-related operations, ensure that proposed
       new systems are appropriate and a sound business investment, and improve
       organizational maturity and capacity in effective management of IT with clear and
       measurable success criteria.
   •   Develop minimum standards for project management and oversight, define project
       management performance standards and methodologies, develop systems testing
       methodologies and promote effective portfolio management with a central pool of
       resources.

ICT Architecture Management:

   •   Complement Danang City’s Enterprise Architecture defined in 2009 with detailed
       guidelines and Reference Architecture Models to reflect 2013 ICT infrastructure, e.g.,
       incorporate Korean eGovFrame into Danang’s reference model and rationalize same


                                                75
        within the EA’s Application Architecture. The Danang EA needs updating/revision and
        participation of stakeholders in this process is encouraged.
   •    Develop a multi-year ICT Strategic Master Plan to ensure public agencies are on the
        same page and moving in same direction and update annually.
   •    Develop a communications platform to disseminate information to the public and private
        sectors on ICT programs and initiatives.

ICT Resource Management:

    •   Establish a clear top-down framework for managing ICT services and their governance.
    •   Danang City to establish an industry standard framework for service management with
        clearly-defined functions, roles, goals and expectations, based on the UK Government’s
        IT Service Management (ITSM) framework, and mapped to achieve specific objectives
        of the ICT Master Plan.
    •   Establish a formal process to capture new e-service requests or changing operational
        requirements, i.e., a centralized User Representative function to interact with and
        interpret user needs.
    •   With limited budgets and human resources, Danang City’s ICT agencies need to
        consolidate roles cleanly dividing areas requiring specific knowledge domains or
        authority related to a business process from generic/user/customer facing ICT processes
        and consolidating the latter into a singly/centralized ICT Service Unit with a Chief
        Information Officer.
    •   Establish a single point of contact – an ICT organization - to manage a structured
        incident response process that is transparent and measurable and provides feedback
        and/or resolution of issues. This entity must understand the e-services and processes it
        supports and keep citizens informed of revisions to e-services to prevent
        pushback/aversion to using the particular service. This entity must maintain transparent
        and objective communication with all stakeholders through official channels/forums.

ICT Security Management:

    •   Establish an effective information security unit in Danang City with authority to manage
        all security processes across Danang’s e-services.
    •   Formally define information security roles and functions, and monitor the
        implementation of security controls selected to mitigate specific risks.
    •   Enforce security policies and standards through regular compliance reviews and audits,
        providing feedback to senior officials with validated risk profiles.


B. Assessment of Communications Campaign for the Vietnam ICT Development Project

Field interviews were conducted in December 2013 via phone interviews with samples of 300
persons per province (Hanoi and Danang), male and female in the age range 24-45.

Results:
   • 65% of respondents in Danang read e-news daily vs. 35% in Hanoi
   • Respondents had mostly learned about the Project via the TV campaign or Internet (27%
       and 25% respectively)
   • About 36% of respondents were aware of and recalled the Project’s communication
       themes, a result indicating need for improving campaign methodology

                                              76
   •   41.7% of respondents were aware of the construction of e-government for Danang and
       Hanoi
   •   35.3% were aware of motor vehicle registration and drivers’ licensing e-services
   •   28.3% knew about online licenses
   •   21.3% knew that the Project was implemented by MIC and the World Bank
   •   In terms of GSO modernization and electronic visa applications/processing, 12% of
       respondents were aware.
   •   Benefits of the Project were seen overwhelmingly as “keeping pace with world trends“
   •   “Convenience” was rated higher in Hanoi (53%) than Danang (35%). Danang is a small
       regional city and citizens still preferred personal, face to face transactions (as noted in the
       Danang Study).
   •   Relative values by type of benefit were as follows:

 Type of Benefit/Project Services               Danang                 Hanoi
 Time savings                                45%                 48%
 Convenience                                 35%                 53%
 Transparency                                57%                 27%
 Cost savings                                23%                 40%
 Simpler procedures                          46%                 15%
 Keep up with trends                         46%                 15%
 Better than old way                         22%                 40%

   •   The assessment concludes that the Communications Campaign has improved the
       awareness level of project content.

   •   36% knew about and remembered the communication topic
   •   About 10 million people are estimated to have seen/learned about the Project via TV,
       followed by Internet and Press.
More time is needed to assess the effectiveness of the new e-services.

Executive Summary

Overview of Vietnam ICT Development Project

The Government of Vietnam (GOV) recognizes the potential of Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) in its various applications to enhance competitiveness, facilitate economic
diversification and increase productivity, as well as to improve the efficiency and capability of
institutions, particularly in government. GOV has undertaken several initiatives to upgrade
information and communications infrastructure. These include: introducing information systems
into selected government departments and piloting online services; providing incentives to the
ICT industry; developing ICT skills and enhancing awareness of ICT, in government and to some
extent in the private sector.

In 2005, the World Bank approved the project (Vietnam ICT Development Project financed by
IDA Credit No 4416) for assisting Vietnam to accelerate utilization of ICTs to foster economic
development, modernize public administration and improve delivery of public services to citizens
and businesses. Through a combination of business process improvements and deployment of
technology, the project will support a substantially enhanced government online presence and
content at the national and municipal level, through interactive and dynamic portals at the MIC,
and the People’s Committees of Hanoi, Danang and Ho Chi Minh City. MIC, and the above-
mentioned municipal administrations would roll out e-government services to businesses in areas
such as e-procurement and business/land registration. The project commenced in September 2006
and planned to complete by 30 Jun 2011, but due to slow implementation, the project was
extended to 31 December 2013.
Critical Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

Positive Conditions:
(1) PMU was received the closely directs and supports from the Leaders of the Ministry of
      Information and Communication, specially is Deputy Minister –Dr. Nguyen Minh Hong
      who directly in charge of the MIC subproject in particular and overall VN-ICT
      Development Project in general.
(2) The staffs involved in the MIC subproject (of PMU, stakeholders) are qualified,
      professional qualifications and enthusiasm in the work.
(3) Good Project management consultant firm (MPT2) has helped to promote the progress of
      projects
(4) Close cooperation between Stakeholders (12 DICs, MOFA and other MIC agencies) during
      project implementation to ensure sustainable of the project results.



                                               79
(5)   Besides that, during project implementation, MIC subproject always gets absolutely strong
      supports from WB. The WB task team has conducted the evaluation for every 6 months
      and provided the PMU-MIC the valuable recommendations to support us to solve the
      difficulty in procurement and financial management.

Negative Conditions
(1)   Changing of procurement guideline and personnel from WB: In 2010, there was a change
      in development of IT procurement guideline together with changing of personnel in WB
      task team leader. Therefore, most of bidding documents had to re-submit, and some
      bidding documents took more than 2 years to get the NOL from WB, for example: MIC1.2,
      MIC1.3, MOFA1, MOFA2 (see table 3 below)
(2)   WB’s Comments to the IT technical documents too slow and lack of consistency in the
      approval of the Bank for the bidding documents (BD).
(3)   Changing of director of subproject in PMU-MIC: 02 times: 2008 and 2009.
(4)   Lack of project management experience in PMU-MIC because most of the PMU staffs
      were first involved in the ODA project implementation.
(5)   Issue with anonymous complaints: The handling of anonymous complaints was different
      between Vietnam and the World Bank which also caused delays in the process of
      implementing the packages.

Achievement of PDO:

Stage 1: before 2010 the achievement against the original PAD-based PDO and data/results
against the original Key Performance Indicators. Event that, MIC subproject has had successfully
issued the e-Government Inter-operability standard which help to standardize all IT technical
standard within project and overall IT investment within government agencies.
Low achievement of PDO of the subproject cause by following reasons:
       (1) All PIUs are new to WB IT project which having different procurement process;
       (2) MIC subproject has been restructuring to combine PCU and PIU into single
           organization PMU which to manage entire project activities. From the
           implementation view, MIC subproject has established 3 technical implementation
           working group who responsible for 3 components by 2008.


Stage 2: After project restructuring the achievements against the post-Restructuring #1 PDO
At the end of stage 2, most of PDO and related KPI have been archived as follows:
    - Unified IP communication system has been setup at MIC head quarter which to allow
        smoother communication within MIC. In additional 12 DIC provinces also equipped with
        new hardware infrastructure including Data center and video conferencing system.
    - MIC also support MOFA to implement MOFA data center and online visa system. By the
        end of 2013, online visa system is operating and new data center was utilized to
        consolidate existing applications of MOFA to help better IT governance within MOFA.




                                               80
   -   The training and capacity building activities of MIC subproject has helped to improve the
       capability of MIC policy makers and also improve the IT governance capability of
       business sector via training to state-own enterprise and SMEs
   -   With the support from project, several legal and policy documents have been approved
       including Radio Frequency Law, Postal Law, National Information Security master plan
       and various IT application decrees
   -   The National PKI infrastructure also improve via implementing new root CA system
       which help to ensure higher securer transaction on electronic environment in Vietnam


Reasons for success:
   -   MIC subproject was meet with demand of improving infrastructure from MIC and DIC
   -   MOFA component was exactly met the requirement from the operation of MOFA


Impacts on Intended Beneficiaries (if any):

   -   Project is helped MIC to improve the legal environment by supporting MIC to draft and
       approve several legal and policy documents. Those policy documents will contributing
       the improve IT application and overall ICT development in Vietnam in the future
   -   The project is helped to create a comprehensive IT infrastructure at MIC and also DIC
       which provide a new communication way between central and provincial government
   -   Online services, especially online VISA system helped to create better environment to the
       citizen and business in Vietnam

Other unintended Outcomes and Impacts:

   -   The project is help to improve the image of Vietnam to the international as as providing a
       faster and easier method to getting entry visa to Vietnam. It will contribute to promote the
       trade and tourism in Vietnam.

Risk to the Project’s Development Outcomes

With result and outcomes of MIC subproject, we identified following risks may effect to the
sustainable of the project as follows.




                                               81
  No.    Critical Risks                Mitigating Activities
 1       Sustainability for new • MIC should prepare the operation cost and maintenance budget to
         system                   ensure smoothly operation of newly implemented system
                                • Provide proper training to technical staff to improve the IT system
                                  operation and management capability.
                                • Maintain a proper IT system operation policy to increase the
                                  availability of the system




     2   Handling over of new • MIC leaders and relevant stake holders should cooperate closer in
         system to the system   post implementation period to ensure the system will be transfer
         operator from PMU      smoothly




     3   Lack of IT        system • Provide frequent training course on the technology which using by
         management           and   new system
         operation                • Continuously train the IT staffs of MIC to equip them with update
                                    technical standard




     4   Resolve the cancellation • MIC should plan to mobilize the government budget to resolve the
         activities                 cancellation packages of project such as MIC2.1, MIC3.1 to setup a
                                    new data center to host the e-services and application




Assessment of Bank and Client Performance

1. Project Preparation Period

Project preparation at MIC has been very well implemented, but after effectiveness of project, the
project plan of MIC has been changed dramatically which created very big challenges for PMU to
implement and manage entire project implementation.




                                               82
Changes in project organization structure by 2008, 2009 and 2010 also effected to the project
progress at MIC.


2. Project Implementation Period

   -   Procurement procedure of WB has been change in the midway of project implementation
       cause lots of challenging to PMU as the procurement and technical staffs had to learn to
       familiar with the new process and guideline
   -   Very complex project organization in MIC subproject with unclear responsibility and
       accountability required lots of coordination activities from PMU during the project
       implementation.
   -   Limited technical capability of PMU and technical working group to create various IT
       solutions for longer procurement cycle; some complex packages took 3 years to
       complete.
   -   Even the WB team is very supportive to the project, but by the end of project, the
       technical advisors from WB were changed frequently and the technical advisors are less
       local environment understanding, therefor it created delays in approval of bidding
       documents.

Lessons Learned

  1. IT application project which usually will bring the impact to many different stake-holders
     and required lots of changes in the operational mind set from the stake holders. Therefore,
     to ensure the successful of project implementation, a detail and effective project
     communication and change management plan should be design and implemented
     throughout the project implementation. This communication and change management
     activities will help to reduce the resistant from the stake holders and mobilize them to
     participate more actively to the project.

  2. To ensure greater integration of packages, ICT strategy planning should be conducted
     properly to identify future projects justified through strong business case. ICT as a strategic
     investments need to be closely aligned to the needs of the organisation’s development and
     the government’s vision for the service delivery of the future. The result and outcome
     indicators are an essential part of this planning outputs and they must originate from the
     formulated business strategies of the organization

  3. IT application and e-service development package usually will take very long time to
     complete compare to hardware infrastructure packages. Therefor in eGovernment or IT
     application project, the project owner should consider to plan the application and e-service
     development package in better alignment maner with purchasing and implementing
     hardware infrastructure package which to ensure the application and e-services can be
     operate properly prior to the project closure.




                                                83
  4. The introduction of e-services and ICT applications requires a different mind-set in modern
     organizations i.e. a service management and service delivery improvement outlook. ICT is
     an integral part of government business operations and can have great socio-economic
     impact on the service delivery to the citizen and businesses. Making ICT a priority to
     support and improve services need to be on the mind of all senior government officials.
     ICT today is positioned to drive improvements and innovations to meet the demands of the
     constituents

  5. The PMU staffs should equipped with proper project management and risk management
     prior to the project implementation. Besides that, PMU staffs also should understand the
     stake holder analysis and business requirement analysis in order to manage and monitor the
     project and vendors properly.

  6. The impact and outcomes of IT project especially for e-service development project only
     able to assess properly after live operation of the system for at least 1 to 2 years. Therefor
     at this moment, its very hard to find the tangible outcomes or impact of this project at this
     moment.

B. GSO: Executive Summary of Completion Report

Overview of Vietnam ICT Development Project

The Government of Vietnam (GOV) recognizes the potential of Information and
Communication Technology (ICT) in its various applications to enhance competitiveness,
facilitate economic diversification and increase productivity, as well as to improve the
efficiency and capability of institutions, particularly in government. GOV has
undertaken several initiatives to upgrade information and communications infrastructure.
These include: introducing information systems into selected government departments
and piloting online services; providing incentives to the ICT industry; developing ICT
skills and enhancing awareness of ICT, in government and to some extent in the private
sector.

In 2005, the World Bank approved the project (Vietnam ICT Development Project
financed by IDA Credit No 4416) for assisting Vietnam to accelerate utilization of ICTs
to foster economic development, modernize public administration and improve delivery
of public services to citizens and businesses. Through a combination of business process
improvements and deployment of technology, the project will support a substantially
enhanced government online presence and content at the national and municipal level,
through interactive and dynamic portals at the MIC, and the People’s Committees of
Hanoi, Danang and Ho Chi Minh City. MIC, and the above-mentioned municipal
administrations would roll out e-government services to businesses in areas such as e-
procurement and business/land registration. The project commenced in September 2006
and planned to complete by 30 Jun 2011, but due to slow implementation, the project was
extended to 31 December 2013.



                                               84
Coherence of the Subprojects

The VNICTDP aimed to promote ICT development in Vietnam at both the national level (MIC
and GSO subprojects) and the municipality level (e-Government subprojects) by illustrating:
   a. Leadership/systemic effects through: (a) development of ICT policies; (b) development
      of a common national ICT architecture and interoperability framework; (c) providing
      improved information/data for timely policy and decision making (GSO); (d) fostering
      human capacity building at the CIO level.
   b. Demonstration effects through: (a) effective changes in business processes; (b)
      scalability and sustainability of the subprojects; (c) pilot e-applications at the city level;
      and (d) establishment of a budget to support innovative initiatives in selected ICT areas to
      involve other stakeholders who are not included in the proposed project. The selection of
      the cities intended to cover the capital city (where e-government can be best
      demonstrated), a commercially-developed city (Ho Chi Minh City) and a city in a less-
      developed central region (Danang).
Major factors affecting/influencing project implementation
   1. Strategic top down project planning with mini GSO IT Master Plan at the beginning
      of the Project using a business driven approach helped GSO to minimize the impact
      of project changes throughout the Subproject.
   2. Commitment of the leader and support from business department during project
      implementation. Many different types of beneficiaries involved make the Project
      become more complex and uncontrollable.
   3. Government cost norms of Vietnam have a very negative impact on the procurement
      process as it is very hard for PIU to convince the management agencies for approval
      of cost estimate for specific packages.
   4. The rapid changes of technology and solutions during the procurement process
      which was often too long (at least one or two years) led to changes required during
      the project implementation.
   5. Changing of procurement processes by the World Bank and inconsistency of IT
      procurement support from WB cost the GSO Subproject almost 2 years delay from
      2009 – 2011.

Lessons learned
1. Good project planning from the beginning will minimize effects of changes to and
risks of the Project during implementation. This shows clearly in the GSO Subproject
which had only very minor changes in project scope and objectives. In order to achieve
this, at the beginning of Project, GSO PIU cooperated with the procurement consultant to
plan the Project to ensure close alignment between packages in the Procurement Plan and
to ensure that all project activities contributed to at least one specific Project
Development Objective.
2. Project must be designed on a business driven basis. All GSO Subproject
activities/components have been designed to meet a specific business requirement.

                                               85
3. Have clear plan to manage all stakeholders related to the Project, and ensure that all
stakeholder are well informed about the project progress and benefits they will get as well
as challenges they will face from the Project.
5. Buying the solution rather than buying equipment. It will minimize the integration
issue between different packages.
6. Enterprise architecture is a powerful tool for entire project governance. Since GSO
completed GSO6.1a to develop GSO EA, other related IT investment in GSO became
clearer and easier to align the investment to GSO development goals. But it was a pity
that the delay in selecting GSO6.1a consultant then GSO EA did not adequately support the GSO
Subproject.
7. Need a stronger project monitoring and evaluation process, as lots of package implementation
has been delayed.
8. GSO leader must be aware to prepare in advance the necessary resource and operational policy
for new IT systems which were procured by the Project to maximize the benefits from these new
IT systems.


C. Danang City: Executive Summary of Completion Report
Project Objectives

The Subproject was designed to enhance the ICT environment in Danang; provide the basic
foundation for e-government deployment in the city’s district offices and departments; develop
various types of e-government services; promote e-applications for business and develop ICR HR
resources.

Key Design Features

The Subproject consists of four key components which include: (1) Assessment, Strategy,
Roadmap, IT Architecture and Standards; (2) Local e-Government Enablement; (3) E-
Application, E-Commerce, and (4) ICT HR Development and Awareness-Building.

The above four key components (except for e-Commerce) were successfully completed and put in
operation in late 2013. Details are as follows:

 Component                Output
 Assessment Strategy,     Danang Enterprise Architecture has been developed as a foundation
 Roadmap, IT              for implementing e-Government for Danang City
 Architecture and
 Standards
 Local e-Government       An ICT Infrastructure which includes Danang MAN, Public Wifi,
 Enablement               Data Center, Contact Center etc, has been set up and successfully put
                          into operation in late 2013 to facilitate the delivery of public services
                          to citizens. It consists of more than 300 public services posted on the
                          Danang City Portal to deliver to citizens
 E-Application, E-        315 public services have been developed and provided to citizens and
 Commerce                 businesses via Danang Portal.
                          E-Commerce was removed since it is part of the national system and

                                              86
                            financed accordingly.
 ICT HR Development         An ICT Human Resource Master Plan for up to 2020 was developed
 and Awareness-             and issued in 2010. Based on this Master Plan, over 100 leaders
 Building                   joined study tours to countries with advanced e=Government models
                            such as Singapore; Malaysia; Taiwan, China; England; Australia; and
                            Korea. 2,000 officials and 150 IT experts from SMEs went through
                            intensive IT training.

Major Factors Affecting/influencing project implementation:

1.       The commitment of the city leaders, the determination, responsibility and dedication of
all members of Danang PIU, the valuable support of the Danang DIC, the effort and
responsibility of all the contractors; the timely instruction and assistance of the World Bank’s task
team members as well as the cooperation of all the beneficiaries are key to the success of the
Subproject.
2.       Many different types of beneficiaries involved make the project more complex and
uncontrollable.
3.       Various areas of expertise within IT projects make them difficult to implement since we
cannot mobilize enough good experts within the limited budget of the Project.
4.       Cost estimates for packages based on Vietnam ICT Norm is rather low and less attractive
to qualified bidders.
5.       Integration of all the investment systems to ensure their synchronization in operation is
extremely difficult for any IT project.
6.       The procurement process is often too long (one to two years) given rapid changes in
technology and solutions. This leads to delay in contract implementation since several
components originally stated in the bidding documents must be adjusted and re-submitted to the
Bank and Local Authority for approval.

Lessons Learned:

Due to the complexity and particularity of IT projects, the Danang Subproject has gone though
many difficulties, obstacles, as well as opportunities. Below are some of the key lessons to be
drawn from the success of the Danang Subproject.
1.       A project can achieve success at the end only if the project manager, beyond professional
know-how and technological competence, is not motivated by self-interest but by the interests of
the peoples’ success. He must be powerful enough to wield his influence and persuasion upon
local leaders of different levels to gain approval for the project as well as to facilitate project
implementation.
2.        The close cooperation between Danang PIU and all their beneficiaries during project
implementation.
3. Transparency, competition and fairness during the process of selecting contractors must be
strictly-applied to all packages. This will help award contracts to the winning bidder with real
competence.
4. The beneficiaries must be informed of the components which will benefit them and get them
involved in the Project from the first steps of the procurement process.
5. New technologies and new solutions must be applied to the Project, taking into account the
key factors such as budget, operational costs and systems integration.
