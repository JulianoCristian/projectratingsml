                         The Project's revised PDOs are to focus more narrowly on project activities funded by IDA, and are to assist the Borrower: (a) to support MIC#s institutional
                         development and technical and regulatory capacity for ICT sector oversight and to increase the efficiency and transparency of public service delivery in MIC, GSO,
                         MOFA, Hanoi and Danang; and (b) foster private sector development by increasing access to business-related government services and raising awareness and usage of
                         ICT in Hanoi and Danang.

                         The full team supervision mission was held March 5-18, 2012. The task team conducted an intensive review of progress by each Project Implementation Unit (PIU) and component
                         on: (i) procurement packages, (ii) disbursements to date and projections, (iii) achievements and results to date, and (iv) potential revision of results framework (targets and
                         measurements) toward the project closing. Due to the slow implementation and project maturity, the project had been restructured twice, and extended once in the past. The current
                         project closing date is June 30, 2013 which will not be extended any further. The mission set two key dates (April 30 and August 31, 2012) for the project to report the cancellation for

                         the packages which cannot complete by the project closing date.

                         Bank supervision has been extremely intensive over the period April 1 – June 30, and will continue to be in FY13. In FY12 the CMU and sector unit provided additional budget for the
                         supervision to speed up and improve the quality of implementation.

                         For the first cut-off date (April 30, 2012), the client only recommended the cancellation of one package (HAN 8), due to the fact that the Hanoi PIU found other funding sources. The
                         PIUs have expressed confidence that they will complete all packages by the project closing date, and the Bank team has communicated in AM and ML to the counterparts that they
                         will have to provide their own funding for any contracts that still have payments outstanding beyond the project closing date.

                         Additionally, the team conducted a technical mission in June 2012 with the primary purpose to provide in-depth technical support to the critical procurement packages. The technical
                         mission reviewed all critical packages and identified revised contract signing dates for most packages. The mission recognized the extraordinary high intensity and effort from the
                         clients in this regard.

                         Since the mission in March, the Task Team and all PIUs have been fully committed to speed up the implementation. The Task Team recognizes the substantial progress in
                         processing the critical procurement packages. However, given the current low disbursement rate and issues that need to addressed with procurement, financial management, and
                         M&E capacity, the l ratings for progress toward development objectives and overall implementation will be kept as MU until actual improvements are observed over the next few
                         months.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Slow implementation has been the key challenge for this project. Given the 11 months remaining until the project closing date (June 30, 2013), the Task Team and each PIU agreed
                         upon the action plans to sustain the momentum, and the two cut-off dates (April 30, and August 31, 2012) for the cancellation of remaining packages which cannot be completed by
                         the project closing. PIUs are fully committed to speed up the implementation, and the Task Team has been providing close supervision. In order to improve the quality of the project
                         ratings (from MU to MS), the Task Team will focus on the following areas: disbursement, procurement, financial management, and results monitoring (M&E).
