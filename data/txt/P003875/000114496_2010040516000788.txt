     The objectives of the Project  are to expand PLN's generating
capacity  in  Java:  to  promote  the  economic  use  of  coal for
electricity generation  and  develop  an  efficient  domestic coal
industry;  to  develop   PLN's   institutional  capacity;  and  to
strengthen the Borrower's  environmental  monitoring capability as
well  as  its  ability  to  formulate  and  enforce  environmental
standards in the energy sector.
     The Project consists of the  following parts, subject to such
modifications thereof as the Borrower  and the Bank may agree upon
from time to time to achieve such objectives:

infrastructure to accommodate an  ultimate plant capacity of 4,000
MW.
Part B:
     Construction of  a  500  kV  double-circuit transmission line
between Paiton and Krian with associated substations, and a 150 kV
transmission  line   between   Probolinggo-Paiton-Situbondo,  with
associated substations.
Part C:
1.   Provision  of   technical   assistance   to   strengthen  the
Borrower's capabilities  to  develop  environmental management and
control plans  for  the  energy  sector,  including formulation of
environmental regulations  and  quality  standards; development of
standard  methodologies  for   controlling  various  environmental
impacts;   development   of    environmental   monitoring   plans;
strengthening enforcement procedures and training.
