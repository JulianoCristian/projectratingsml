Some lessons\n            learned included: International Competitive Bidding (ICB) is\n            the best means to ensure low prices. Contract costs awarded\n            through ICB have been lower than their estimated costs,\n            while costs of contracts awarded through direct negotiations\n            under Co-financing have been significantly higher than their\n            estimated costs. The practice of conducting long and\n            protracted negotiations with the winning bidder to drive\n            down quoted prices, or increase the local content, may\n            appear to be an accomplishment in the short-term. However,\n            it may not be in the best interests of PLN (Engineering\n            Services Center) as the contractor could run short of\n            resources to sustain its operations and deliver in\n            accordance with the agreed schedule, as is clearly borne out\n            by the experience gained on this project. Bank policy\n            dialogue should be linked to individual projects. In this\n            case, while the Bank raised the problem of excess capacity\n            as early as 1994, a stronger case could have been made if\n            the implication of this excess capacity for Bank financed\n            plants such as Paiton had been highlighted at an earlier stage."}, "docdt": "1996-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
