Paiton Thermal Power Project for\n            Indonesia supports the major elements of the\n            Government's energy policy of promoting the use of\n            nontradeable surplus coal as an economic option for the\n            generation of electricity and expanding the State\n            Electricity Corporation's (PLN) generating capacity in\n            Java to meet part of the expected growth in demand for\n            electric power. The project includes: (i) the construction\n            of the Paiton power plant comprising two coal fired\n            generating units of 400 MW each and other support elements\n            necessary to complete the installation, together with an\n            infrastructure to accommodate future units for an ultimate\n            plant capacity of 4,000 MW; (ii) construction of a 500 kV\n            double circuit transmission line between Paiton and Krian\n            and associated substations; (iii) a 150 kV transmission line\n            between Probolinggo, Paiton and Situbondo, with associated\n            substations; and (iv) technical assistance to strengthen the\n            capability of the Ministry of Mines and Energy to formulate\n            and enforce environmental standards in the energy sector,\n            and to train PLN's engineering and design staff."}, "docdt": "1989-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
