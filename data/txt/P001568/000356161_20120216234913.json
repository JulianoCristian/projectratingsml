outcome\n            was substantial; Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory and borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: community\n            participation as the foundation for identifying appropriate\n            community-based nutrition activities and mobilizing the\n            community's willingness to contribute to the\n            implementation of the agreed on nutrition activities. A\n            multi-faceted and flexible approach was critical in order\n            respond to the communities' diverse needs and readiness\n            to take appropriate action. Significant investment must be\n            made in training community nutrition workers, social\n            workers, school teachers and health staff. Distance and\n            inaccessibility to certain sites proved to be important\n            limiting factors without obvious solutions. The impact\n            analysis showed that results were more pronounced in more\n            accessible communities, with better infrastructure, and more\n            literate mothers."}, "docdt": "2012-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
