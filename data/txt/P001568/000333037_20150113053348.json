A community-based response, supported by the World\n            Bank, has brought action on several fronts, ranging from\n            nutritional supplements to grants for school water tanks. In\n            almost four years, SEECALINE a community nutrition program\n            in Madagascar has treated 1.2 million students, preschoolers\n            and non-enrolled school-aged children for intestinal\n            parasites. The program has provided iron supplements to\n            800,000 students, funded 71 micro-projects, and trained\n            20,000 teachers. The program continues to tackle iodine\n            deficiency - another prevalent, but easily remedied problem\n            which causes mental retardation and poor growth in all\n            children, and can cause younger children to become deaf.\n            Iodine deficiency affects all children's capacity to learn.<BR>"}, "docdt": "2002-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
