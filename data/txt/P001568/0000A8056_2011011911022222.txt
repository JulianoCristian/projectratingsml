                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The key development objective of the project is to improve the nutritional status of children under three, primary school children and pregnant and lactating
                         women in the project target areas. It also aims to ensure long-term sustainability of nutrition outcomes by improving the quality and quantity of food intake by
                         children at home.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?
