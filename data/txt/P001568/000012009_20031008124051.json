As a result of these crises - emergency\n            situation due to the 2000 cyclone, and political turbulence\n            in 2002 - the project objective became at risk because of\n            two factors. First, a set-back in the earlier achievements\n            because of a worsening of the causes of malnutrition in the\n            project areas. Second, geographic areas that before the\n            crises were not among the targeted project areas because the\n            malnutrition rates were lower than national average - the\n            cut-off for the interventions - now became target areas. The\n            Government requested the project to assist in the response\n            to the crises, with an expansion of its activities to the\n            previously not targeted areas, as well as an intensification\n            of the project interventions, and acceleration of activities\n            in the already target zones. This report proposes a\n            supplemental credit to Madagascar to cover the additional\n            costs that were incurred to address the emergency\n            situations. A serious deterioration resulted from these\n            crises, which led to an increase of the risk of malnutrition\n            in the cyclone areas, and in the cities during the political\n            crisis. The supplemental credit meets the requirement for\n            supplemental credit because of cost overrun due to\n            exceptional circumstances beyond the borrower's\n            control, and because it is currently not possible to reduce\n            the scope of the project, being the credit mostly disbursed,\n            and the remaining funds fully committed. The existing credit\n            is being implemented in compliance with all covenants."}, "docdt": "2003-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
