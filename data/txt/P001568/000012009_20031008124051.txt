               INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
         PROPOSEDSUPPLEMENTAL CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF
                                   MADAGASCARFOR
               THE SECOND COMMUNITY NUTRITION PROJECT


1.       The following report proposes a supplemental credit to the Republic o f
Madagascar for SDR 7.3 million (US$10 million) to cover the additional costs that
were incurred to address the emergency situations that arose from the cyclones that
struck Madagascar in 2000 and the political turbulence in 2002.                The proposed
supplemental credit would be on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years and
commitment fee o f 0.5%. The credit would provide supplemental financing for the
Second Community NutritionProject (Cr. No. 3060-MAG).

2.       A serious deterioration resulted from these crises which led to an increase of
the risk o f malnutrition inthe areas where the cyclones struck and in the cities during
the political crisis. Food crops were destroyed, food prices increased, and access to
food diminished. The availability o f potable water was seriously constrained and the
sanitary situation deteriorated leading to an increase ininfectious disease, while access
to health care was compromised. Reduced food availability and infectious disease are
the direct causes o f acute malnutrition. Repeated episodes of acute malnutrition,
especially inyoung children, lead to chronic malnutrition.

3.       The development objective of the Second Community Nutrition project is to
reduce chronic malnutrition among children under three and to improve the nutritional
status o f school-aged children, pregnant and lactating women. As a result of the crises,
the achievement o f the development objective became at risk because of two factors.
First, a set-back in the earlier achievements because o f a worsening o f the causes o f
malnutrition inthe project areas. Second, geographic areas that before the crises were
not among the target areas of the project because the malnutrition rates were lower
than national average - the cut-off for the interventions-, now became target areas.
The Government of Madagascar requested the project to assist in the response to the
crises with an expansion of its activities to the previously not targeted areas as well as
an intensification o f the project interventions and acceleration of activities in the
already target zones.

4.       As a result, the project increased its geographic scope and added the rural areas
o f an additional 16 districts to its already targeted 52 districts after the cyclones and the
urban areas or the capital cities o f the six provinces as target areas after the political
crisis. Inorder to achieve its development objective and the targets, the project requires
additional financing for the costs incurred to address the emergency situations as
describedabove.

Background

5.      Countw context. After having been one o f the most rapidly growing African
economies in recent years, Madagascar plunged into deep political crisis at the
beginningof 2002. The crisis ended 6 months later, but social and economic impact i s
extremely pronounced, with poverty levels rising to where they were a decade ago. The
new Government presented a recovery program to the donor community in July 2002
and IDA supported this through a US$50 million emergency credit and a substantial
portfolio restructuring. After emerging from this deep political and economic crisis the
new Government i s embarking on an ambitious reform program, as described in the
new CAS that is currently under preparation.

6.      Sectoral backmound. Malnutrition was already a serious development problem
inMadagascar before the crises. Almost 50 percent of children under five years of age
were chronically malnourished or stunted. Analysis of malnutrition data among the
different income groups confirms that malnutrition i s largely a poor peoples problem.
Poverty, as well as lack of knowledge, poor feeding, health and caring practices,
inadequate food production and consumption, are the main determinants o f chronic
malnutrition. Recurrent infectious diseases, especially diarrhea, measles, malaria, and
helminth infections cause bouts o f acute malnutrition and contribute to chronic growth
retardation. Malnutrition prevalence trends in Madagascar are decreasing, but very
slowly. It i s likely that after the crises, gains achieved have been lost, due to the
deterioration in the causes o f malnutrition as explained above. Continued and more
intensive efforts are needed to achieve the project development objective, which
contributes to the achievement o f the Millennium Development Goal for nutrition -
halving underweight by 2015. The Government o f Madagascar (GOM) implements
Community Nutrition programs with the assistance from the World Bank and other
donors in order to reduce malnutritionrates and prevent growth faltering among young
children.At present, a highlevel intersectoralcommittee is inthe process of developing
a new Nutrition Policy for Madagascar as well as an update o f the National Plan o f
Action for Nutrition.

7.      Social Deterioration. In2000, Madagascar was struck by three cyclones, Eline,
Gloria and Hudah, inquick succession over a three monthperiodbetween February and
April. More than 1 million people were directly affected, resulting in over 200 people
dead and almost 300,000 people in need of emergency aid assistance. More than 80
percent of the poor in Madagascar live in rural areas and rely largely on subsistence
agriculture and already had limited access to food reserves. The cyclone damage
severely impacted the population's food security, health and sanitary conditions, all
determinants o f acute malnutrition leading to chronic malnutrition. There was
substantial damage to food crops and food reserves were damaged and/or insufficient.
Rice stocks, the main staple food for the Malagasy, were flooded and rotten. In 2001,
the Southern part o f the country suffered severe droughts that led to further
deterioration o f the food situation in that region. In 2002, the political turbulence after
the December 2001 election resulted in the worsening o f already precarious conditions,
especially inthe urbanareas.

8.     Impact on malnutrition: Food insecurity is one o f the main determinants of
malnutrition. The cyclone damage and droughts in the Southem part o f the country

worsened the food security situation in terms of availability, due to lost crops. Local
authorities estimated that 95% o f the paddy rice, the main food crop o f Malagasy
people, all o f the vegetable crops and 75% o f the manioc crops were destroyed or
severely damaged in the affected areas. The political crises resulted in increased food
prices, worsening the food security situation interms o f accessibility, which affected in
particular the poor in the urban areas. As a result the risk of malnutrition, especially
among those most vulnerable, young children, pregnant and lactating women, increased
inthe affectedareas.

9.      Government and Bank responses. The govemment requested that the existing
Project be used to quickly prevent the situation from worsening. About one third o f the
affected areas were already targeted by the existing project. In these the preventive
interventions were intensified with messages about coping with shocks and food
insecurity risks. In addition, there was geographic expansion to cover a larger number
of beneficiaries and to add the affected areas that were not previously covered by the
project. The main objective o f the intensification and expansion was to prevent
worsening malnutrition rates that would jeopardize the development objective o f the
project.

10.     During the political crisis, emergency safety plans were put in place, using
projects with demonstrated capacity to quickly act. An Interim-CAS (October 2002)
assisted the Government to mitigate the impact o f the crisis on the poor by restructuring
the existing portfolio and provided new lending in the form o f an emergency credit.
This Project was one o f the projects used for the emergency response. The project
increased its geographic scope and added the rural areas of an additional 16 districts to
its already targeted 52 districts after the cyclones and the urban areas or the capital
cities o f the six provinces as target areas after the political crisis. An additional 550
nutrition sites were added to the existing program, with about 100,000 children under
three for monthly growth monitoring and promotion, after the cyclone's devastating
impact. During the political crises, the urban areas o f all six provinces were added to
the program target areas. A total o f 104 urban nutrition centers were established,
representing about 50,000 children under three.

11.     New CAS. The new CAS will be presented to the Board in October/November
2003. The focus o f the new CAS i s to support the Government not only inrecovering
the ground lost duringthe political crisis but also help inachieving broad-based growth
rates well above those experienced before the crisis. The CAS foresees a new Nutrition
operation inFY05. This will be either under the PRSCI or as a self standing operation.

ExistingProject

12.     The Second Community Nutrition Project was approved on April 21, 1998 and
became effective on November 2, 1998. The total project cost i s US$42 million o f
which US$ 27.6 equivalent i s providedby IDA, US$ 11.6 million i s co-financed by the
World FoodProgram and the Government and beneficiaries contribute US$ 2.7 million.
The development objective of the project i s to improve the nutritional status o f children
under the age of three, pregnant and lactating women and school - aged children.
Specific indicators include the reduction of current underweight rates by 25%, thus
contributing to the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) nutrition goal to halve

underweight prevalence by 2015. The project also aims to ensure long-term
sustainability o f nutrition outcomes by improving the quality and quantity o f food
intake by children at home. Progress to achieving these objectives was measured at
mid-term review and will be measured again at project completion through
anthropometrics and dietary surveys and through data accruedbythe project.

13.     Implementation experience The growth monitoring and promotion (GMP)
program currently reaches about 1million children under the age o f three and 700,000
pregnant and lactating women every month. The child's growth i s monitored, progress
explained to the caretaker and action taken on the basis o f the progress or lack thereof
with specific counseling. Inthe case o f growth faltering, children receive supplementary

including to over 2 million school - aged children under the school nutrition program.
feeding. Micronutrients and deworming are systematically provided to all beneficiaries,

The Mid-Term review, which took place in September 2001, rated the project, and all
its components, satisfactory. Impact studies undertaken for the Mid-Term review show
positive impact, inparticular inthose areas where the program i s implemented for more
than two years.

Rationale for Supplemental Credit

14.     The proposed supplemental credit meets the requirement o f OP 13.20 on
Supplemental Financing as follows:

(a)     Cost overrun due to exceptional circumstances beyond borrower's control.
The supplemental credit would finance the cost overruns that were incurred as a result
o f the exceptional circumstances that occurred beyond the Borrowers' control during
the implementation of the Project. There are no changes in project design, the
community nutrition and school nutrition components, as well as the intersectoral
activities and monitoring and evaluation would continue with the same development
objective and use of the same implementation manual. The beneficiaries remain the
same. The project increased its geographic scope and intensified its interventions that
fall within the objective o f the project which are to improve the nutritional status o f
children under three, primary school children, and pregnant and lactating women, and
ensure long-term sustainability o f nutrition outcomes by improving the quality and
quantity o f food intake by children at home; and, in so doing, improve quality o f life
and productivity, decrease child morbidity and mortality rates, and support primary
education.

(b)     The existing credit i s being implemented in compliance with all covenants.
The overall project performance has been satisfactory duringimplementation, including
during the crisis. Project and financial management, compliance with agreed
procurement schedules, and compliance with safeguards policies have been satisfactory
throughout implementation. Monitoring and evaluation has been rated highly
satisfactory inrecent project status reports.

(c)     I t is not possible to reduce the scope of the project at this point. The credit i s
90 percent disbursed and the remaining funds are fully committed. A reduction in scope
would jeopardize the achievement o f the development objectives of the Project. A new
project i s being prepared but will not be ready for Board presentation until FY05 and


                                            6

preparation cannot be accelerated since it i s likely that nutrition will be included under
the PRSCIthat i s scheduled for Boardpresentation inFY05.

(d)     The Government of Madagascar sought other means of financing but was
unsuccessful.

(e)     The time available it too short to process a further free standing Bank
loan.Ifno supplemental financing is providedto the GOMto continue the project, the
current achievements will be severely compromised. About 1 million children are
monitored on a monthly basis and their care takers counseled on proper growth in
order to prevent malnutrition, which negatively impacts human development and
economic growth in the long run. The project would risk loosing an important group
of beneficiaries, which will then reduce the possibility o f achieving the development
goal, reducing malnutrition by 25% by the end o f the project. The DO may already be
compromised as a result o f the crises themselves.

(0      The GOM is committed to continue the reduction of malnutrition and
make progress towards the achievement of the nutritiongoal of the Millennium
Development Goals. Reducing malnutrition is among the priority actions in the
PRSC and the new CAS. The GOM has demonstrated its commitment in public
speeches, timely counterpart funding and efforts made - albeit without success - to
finance the gap induced by the extra costs. The GOM also has given nutrition high
level attention by placing the executing agency directly under the Prime Ministry and
not under a line-ministrywhere it i s likely to be less visible. Discussions about placing
it firmly on the government's organizational chart are ongoing and a working group is
updating the National Nutrition Policy and Plan o f Action in order to determine the
needs for intensified efforts to achieve the MDGs. The future nutrition operation i s
part o f these intensified efforts. The GOM also shows commitment by allocating
finances to the project. It allocated 10 percent o f its 2001 HIPC funds to the project
and it proposed to finance U S $ lmillion o f the required US$ 11 million additional
project costs.

(g)     Not only the government i s committed to improving nutrition in Madagascar,
NGOs and civil society have long been involved in the project implementation. The
first project included geographic areas that were no longer part o f the second project,
but there is evidence the interventions are continued by the communities and NGOs
themselves. Since nutrition i s a multisectoral theme, the education, health and
agriculture sectors are involved in policy making and nutrition interventions are
deliverednot only at the community level by the project itself, but also through health
centers and schools.

Implementationof Proposed Supplemental Credit

15.     Project costs: Total additional financing needs are estimated at US$ 11million.
The project incurred US$4.5 millioninadditional costs with respect to the cyclone and
drought afflicted areas in FYOO/Ol. Of these, US$ 3.8 million i s investment, training,
and the recurrent costs o f the 550 new nutrition centers. US$ 0.5 million was used to
finance institutional strengthening and about two hundred thousand ($200,000) to
rehabilitate existing (damaged) nutrition centers. The extra costs are cumulative

reaching US$ 11 million by the end o f the project. The estimated costs to maintain the
activities inthe areas that were added inresponse to the crises are US$4 million. Since
it is the Government's objective to scale up to national level of nutrition interventions
in the next operation, it would not have been advisable to start interventions and
implement for a short duration. Instead the project management decided to continue.
Nutrition i s a development problem than cannot be solved in two years. It needs long-
term investment to make sustainable impact. IDA supplemental financing i s requested
for an amount o f SDR 7.3 million (US$ 10 million equivalent). The Government o f
Madagascar and beneficiaries will contribute US$1million.

16.     Implementing arrangements: The executing unit o f the Second Community
Nutrition Project, SEECALINE, has demonstrated capacity to intervene effectively at
the community level and to undertake large scale operations. The first Community
Nutrition project established over 500 nutrition centers in two provinces over a four
year period; the second project has established 3600 nutrition centers over the last four
years. Each center covers between 200 and 500 children and women. Regional offices
have been established in all six regions. The supplemental credit will continue to be
implemented through contracting o f NGOs under the same arrangements as the current
project.

17.     As part of the request for a supplemental credit, a concomitant extension of the
closing date from January 31, 2004 to October 31, 2004 i s proposed. Without such an
extension the project would not be able to finalize the planned activities. Accordingly,
the legal documentation for the supplemental financing, the Agreement Amending the
Development Credit Agreement would reflect the new closing date.

18.     Accounting financial reporting and auditing arrangements: The financial
transactions pertaining to the Supplemental Credit will be recorded and monitored by
the PIU Seecaline which has considerable experience and a good track record in
managing Bank funds. The PIU has established an acceptable accounting system that
has worked efficiently during project implementation and which will continue for the
Supplemental Credit. Appropriate accounting staff i s in place for maintaining proper
records and accounts, and producing on a timely basis all financial reports required for
managing and monitoringproject activities. The format and frequency o f reporting will
be maintained as defined inthe project implementation manuals. Independent auditors
acceptable to IDA would audit the use o f all funds available under the Supplemental
Credit, reflected in project financial statements. The Bank may accept a single audit
opinion on the annual financial statements instead o f requiring separate audit opinions
on Special Account and statement o f expenditures as their associated transactions and
balances are reflected in the project financial statements. Audit reports would be
submitted to IDA no later than six months after termination o f the project. The
Implementation Completion Report will be prepared within six months after Credit
closing.

19.     Environmental and Social Aspects:       There i s no change in environmental
aspects and as stated in the project appraisal report o f the original project, there could
likely be a positive impact on the environment since it would contribute to improved
hygiene and sanitation in schools and at home. In addition, the small grant fund




                                            S

component under the original project has financed small activities including cleaningup
o f the market place. The environmental classification category remains C.

20.     Sustainability Through its community-based interventions, the project (i)
empowers communities to deal with malnutrition; (ii)      promotes positive changes in
caring practices related to the preparation o f food, hygiene, and feeding at the
household level, especially for children, pregnant and lactating women; (iii)  promotes
an intersectoral approach to combat malnutrition through village communities, schools
and health centers; and (iv) relies on local NGOs to organize communities and assist
them inimplementingcommunity nutrition interventions, thus creating local capacity to
further develop these interventions. Special emphasis was given on early warning and
preventative measuresintraining modules following the cyclone and drought periods.

21.     Risks: The original project rated institutional capacity at high risk. This
however has been mitigated by substantial training and through learning by doing o f
the local NGOs. Another threat to the project could be the limited food availability in
the affected areas, which in turn is mitigated by the on-going emergency WFP
operation to distribute food to prevent the development of widespread famine and
furtherdeterioration ofthe nutritional status ofhouseholds mostaffected.

22.     Effectiveness conditions and agreements: Except for submission o f a
