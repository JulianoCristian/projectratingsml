An estimated 2,850 small farmers would\n            receive medium- and long-term credit in Phase II, and the\n            additional economic and social infrastructure would benefit\n            a large proportion of the overall population of the region,\n            which has grown to 12,000 families."}, "docdt": "1975-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
