The principal objectives of the loan were\n            to: (a) assist local government units (LGUs) in Metro Manila\n            and the surrounding provinces to provide basic\n            infrastructure, services, and facilities, especially to the\n            lower income communities; (b) improve the LGUs'\n            investment planning, financing, and implementation\n            capabilities; and (c) expand the coverage of the Municipal\n            Development Fund (MDF) to include all LGUs in the\n            Philippines. Bank's performance was satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (i) Demand driven\n            \"bottom-up\" project structure; (ii) ownership and\n            commitment by LGUs and national support mechanisms; (iii)\n            size and complexity of capital investments and matching LGU\n            capacities; (iv) need for appropriate strategic planning and\n            network analysis; (v) need for incentive scheme for\n            non-revenue generating \"public goods\" type\n            infrastructure provision; and (vi) need for comprehensive\n            revenue enhancement and mobilization for LGUs."}, "docdt": "1997-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
