Executive Summary 
Background of the Project 
Consistent with Government strategy of developing the sanitation and drainage components of 
urban infrastructure in Vietnam in the period 2001 to 2010, Quang Ninh province is included in 
a
three cities programme in World Bank funded sanitation project. The other two cities are 
Danang and Haiphong. 
The first project formulation and feasibility study was done in 1995. Feasibility study for Phase 
I
was completed in 1998 followed by detailed design and bid documentation. The tendered 
rates for the construction packages were lower than anticipated. In late 2002 the Ha Long City 
and Cam Pha Sanitation Project Management Unit (PMU) requested the World Bank approval 
to utilize unused funds for a second phase of improvement works. The funds would be used to 
expand on drainage, sanitation and wastewater treatment in accordance with the concept laid 
out in the Phase I feasibility study, as approved by the Government of Vietnam.   
The feasibility study for the Phase II works was approved by the Quang Ninh People’s 
Committee on 22 April 2003, which included the location of the wastewater treatment plant at 
Deo Sen, Ha Khanh Ward, Hon Gai (see Annex 8). 
Draft Environmental Impact Assessment for Additional Works was prepared during the 
detailed design phase of the Ha Long City and Cam Pha Town Drainage & Sanitation Project – 
Phase II in July – August 2004. The EIA report has been updated based on the comments in 
December 2004.  
Scope and Objectives of the Phase II 
The investment aim, as defined in the Decision from the Peoples Committee of Quang Ninh 
Province dated 22 April 2003 is to continuously invest in the drainage and wastewater systems, 
and solid waste management, to protect the environment from flooding and to improve the 
drainage and sanitation system.     
More specifically, using funds remaining from the first phase, the objectives of the project are 
to:   
-
Mitigate flood and inundation of areas of Ha Long City and Cam Pha Town not covered 
under the Phase I works. 
-
Provide significant reduction in pollution of the ocean waters of Hon Gai by intercepting 
and treating wastewater carried in the storm water drains in the central area of the city.  
-
Further reduce the pollution of the Bai Chay coastline emanating from wastewater 
carried in storm water drains by increasing the length of interceptor sewers installed in 
Phase I.  
Water Quality and Pollution Loads 
According to the State Environmental Quality Report of Quang Ninh Province (2003) the 
coastal sea water quality of Ha Long City and Cam Pha Town is directly influenced by 
domestic wastewater, port services and sea reclamations. However, the parameters like DO, 
BOD, turbidity, coliform, oil and grease, heavy metals, total nitrogen and total phosphorous 
meet the requirement limits of the standard TCVN 5943:1995. The water quality in Ha Long 
Bay area is rather clean, clear and unpolluted. The water quality around floating fish farming 
area is suitable for aquaculture.  
The results according to the water quality model calculated in 1998 show that the dilution 
capacity of Ha Long Bay is very good. It can be estimated that dilution capacity with the 
proposed load is in Cua Luc Bay 8,570:1 and in Ha Long Bay 900,000:1. This is expected 
Page  7
Ha Long City & Cam Pha Town Drainage & Sanitation Project 
–
Phase II 
Environmental Impact Assessment

Black & Veatch International
because of its connection with the Gulf of Tonkin. On the other hand, the dilution capacity of 
Cua Luc estuary (Bai Chay bay, Hon Gai Bay) is limited and is related in a large measure to the 
area of the estuary. If the bay is reduced, as seem to be happen, in size by reclamation, the 
dilution capacity will also be reduced, but is still very good compared to the discharged effluent 
volume. 
Alternatives of the Project 
The Phase II is the extension and finalisation of the ongoing Ha Long City and Cam Pha Town 
Drainage and Sanitation Project Phase I and it is necessary to fulfil the scope of the project, 
which was proposed in the Phase I feasibility study in 1998. Without the Phase II there would 
be no wastewater collection and treatment in Hon Gai and intended improvements of living and 
hygienic conditions would not be reached. Without the project improvement of drainage system 
would not be completed in the extension to be agreed and flooding problems would be solved 
only partly and in Bai Chay, Hon Gai and Cam Pha.      
The most important criteria in determining the best wastewater treatment plant site was agreed 
to be the number of houses requiring resettlement. This in turn necessitated the determination 
of the likely buffer zone around the site perimeter, based on Government regulations. The most 
appropriate standard is TCVN 7222:2002, and this dictates a 300m buffer zone in the case of 
open sludge treatment and a 210m buffer zone (a 30% reduction) in the case of closed sludge 
treatment. It also allows for a further 30% reduction (to 147m) in the event tree landscaping is 
provided around the WWTP site perimeter. The local authorities have approved the location of 
wastewater treatment plant  in Bai Muoi in Hon Gai.  
SBR (Seqvencing Bacth Reactor) has been selected for the wastewater treatment process and 
the process has been designed to meet the Vietnamese standards TCVN 6987:2001 and TCVN 
7222:2002. The removal efficiency of BOD, suspended solids, total nitrogen and total 
phosphorous would be 70 
–
90
%. The quality of the effluent after treatment is calculated to be 
as follows:  BOD 20 – 30 mg/l, SS 30 mg/l, total N 5 mg/l, total P 2 mg/l.  Effluent from the 
wastewater treatment plant will be discharged to the nearby large drainage channel, which 
discharges to the sea through the new coastal urban development area. Due to the self-
purification mechanism starting in discharge channel and continuing in the sea, the pollutants 
are easily diluted and decomposed, which further mitigates the impacts on water quality in Cua 
Luc Bay and Ha Long Bay.  
Environmental Impacts 
General
The main impacts in the proposed project area will mainly affect the human and aquatic 
environment, in lesser amount the atmospheric and terrestrial environment. The atmospheric 
and terrestrial impacts are mainly temporary during construction and rehabilitation and 
therefore of short duration. Possible negative impacts on air quality from operation of 
wastewater treatment plant can be minimised through mitigation measures. The overall impacts 
of the project are positive and are very important step in improving sanitation situation in Ha 
Long City and Cam Pha Town.  
The improvement of urban sanitation, which is currently badly hampered by frequent flooding, 
towards a clean and healthy environment for the population of Ha Long City and Cam Pha 
Town as well as the numerous domestic and international tourist visiting the area is essential. 
The overall impact of the on going project and the proposed additional works is positive and it 
is an important step in improvement of sanitation in Ha Long City and Cam Pha Town. The 
Phase II Project includes additional works to the first sanitation project aiming at the 
rehabilitation and improvement of the existing sewerage and drainage system of the city.

Improvement of the wastewater collection and treatment in Hon Gai and prevention of flooding 
in low-lying areas in Hon Gai and Cam Pha will improve considerably the living and 
environmental conditions in the project area. However, untreated wastewater will partly still 
flow in the open channels, which cross the residential areas. The negative impacts of untreated 
wastewater are mainly concentrated in the city area. The discharge of untreated wastewater to 
the sea will continue the contamination of the sea water. However, the concentrations of 
contaminants will be diluted by the large amount of seawater. 
The water use will increase in the city (new water connections, more household facilities, 
conversion from bucket latrines to flush toilets, etc.), which will increase wastewater amounts. 
This shall be taken into account in the designs and in dimensioning the improvements in flood 
prevention. The installation and regular desludging of septic tanks connected to sewers will 
improve the wastewater quality. 
On any of the proposed construction sites there are no cultural properties, historical places or 
buildings or other structures, which should be protected.  
All the excavated material is normal soil and there is no need for treatment of this material. 
Wastewater Treatment Plant in Hon Gai
The wastewater treatment plant will be constructed in Bai Muoi on the vicinity of Deo Sen 
landfill, Deo Sen cemetary and mining quarry, where the original landscape has been already 
changed. On the proposed construction site there are fish ponds which need dewatering and 
land reclamation before construction. Separate socio-economic and detailed measurement 
survey will be done for the preparation of Resettlement Action Plan. 
During the dewatering and filling there will be noise from pumps, and an increase in channel 
water turbidity due to pumping, this can be minimised with avoiding mixing of sediment and 
using stabilisation pond. The pond can be dewatered through existing channel to Cua Luc 
Estuary on the other side of the road.  
During the construction of the wastewater treatment plant the traffic will increase due to the 
transportation of excavated material and construction equipment and materials. The excavated 
material is normal soil and there is no need for treatment. Working should be avoided during 
night from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. The maximum permitted noise level in public and residential areas 
is given in Vietnamese standard TCVN 5949:1998.  
Construction of some structures might need piling, which will temporarily cause an increase of 
noise in the vicinity of the construction sites. 
Sewerage and Drainage System
Sewers will be constructed in street areas and there is no need for site-clearance and 
resettlement. However, some temporary disturbance might be caused to businesses along the 
streets during the excavation of sewer trenches. Pumping stations are constructed next to the 
streets and in some places some site clearance might be needed, if there is not enough vacant 
land available.  
Most of the rehabilitation of channels will occur on the ends of channels, but some parts of the 
channels or whole channels are located along narrow alleys where it is difficult to use any 
machines, and only manual methods can be used. Some channels or part of channels to be 
rehabilitated are located under houses or other structures, and this will cause some difficulties 
both for rehabilitation and for people living next to the channels. Site clearance might be 
needed in some areas. A detailed survey will be done for the Resettlement Action Plan. 
There will be temporary nuisance to traffic and traffic congestion is possible due to the 
construction. On highway 18 and Hau Can Road in Bai Chay there might be some disturbance 
Page  9

–
Phase II 
Environmental Impact Assessment

Black & Veatch International
for tourist transportation. The traffic will increase due to the transportation of equipment, pipes 
and excavated material. Dust and noise will increase temporarily in the vicinity of construction 
sites. Open trenches might be dangerous if not marked and identified carefully.  
Impacts during Operation
The capacity of the wastewater treatment plant in Hon Gai is 7,000 m
3
/d and the capacity can 
be increased later to 14,000 m
3
/d. The wastewater treatment plant is necessary first step to treat 
the wastewaters in the densely populated Hon Gai area. 
In general the positive impact of the wastewater treatment is the decrease of pollution load to 
the environment and especially to the sea. Wastewater treatment plant will guarantee from its 
part that the pollution load to the sea will not at least increase due to the possible increased 
wastewater quantity. Wastewater treatment will have positive impact on the hygienic situation, 
decrease the risk of water related diseases, and thus improve the living conditions of the people. 
The decreased pollution load to the sea will improve the living conditions for aquatic life and 
therefore improve the fishing catches.   
Nowadays both rainwater and wastewater is discharged into the combined system. Sections of 
the channels have collapsed and are blocked by solid waste and O&M is neglected, all of which 
decreases the flow. After the rehabilitation the flow will increase and there will be no stagnant 
water.  
Wastewater flow in open channels will decrease when wastewater is collected through the new 
interceptor sewer pipes to be constructed in Hon Gai. This will also decrease the discharge of 
untreated wastewater to the sea.  In the dry season all wastewater will be treated at the 
wastewater treatment plant. The foul odour in the vicinity of channels will decrease and the risk 
of water related health problems will also decrease due to the improved sanitation situation.   
Breakdowns in wastewater pumping might cause serious environmental risks if there are no 
spare pumps, electricity supply or enough capacity in the system. 
Mitigation Measures 
Environmental matters shall be integrated in all the design work and planning of the project. 
The designing shall be done by minimising the adverse impacts on environment using as much 
as possible existing facilities and selecting the location of new facilities in areas where the 
disturbance to environment, people and existing structures is the smallest. Where possible 
existing rights-of-way should be used rather than create new ones. 
Location of the wastewater treatment plant has been selected in co-operation with the local 
authorities paying attention to the approved master plan and the present and future land use. 
Densely populated areas have been avoided to minimise the resettlement. On the proposed 
construction site there are no cultural properties, historical places or buildings or other 
structures, which should be protected. Buffer zones should be designed around the wastewater 
treatment plant according to the standards TCVN 7222:2002. 
Very special attention has to be paid to the strengthening of the management system and long-
term O&M training since in practice these will be the weak points, and might put the whole 
system at risk if not arranged carefully. SBR (Sequencing batch reactor) as the treatment 
method needs trained staff to operate. If the given and agreed O&M guidelines are neglected 
the wastewater treatment plant can cause big environmental problems when all wastewater is 
discharged from one outlet instead of several and the local impact might be significant. 
Handling of sludge has to be done according to the given guidelines. If gravity thickened 
sludge will be transported to final treatment to Deo Sen septage treatment facility the 
transportation has to be done in closed tankers and only to the agreed treatment facility.

Spillages have to be avoided during loading, transportation and unloading of sludge. Special 
attention has to be paid to occupational health and to training of workers to avoid direct contact 
with wastewater and sludge. Protective clothing including overalls, gloves and wellingtons has 
to be provided to workers. 
In the operation and maintenance of drainage and sewerage system has to be considered regular 
inspection of the condition of sewerage and drainage system. Solid waste disposal into drains, 
sewers, channels and sea has to be prevented to keep the drains and sewers open. Illegal 
housing in the channel embankments has to be prevented. In all operation and maintenance 
operational and safety standards have to be followed.

Vietnam: Three Cities Sanitation Project 
–
Quang Ninh Sub-Project (Phase I Project) takes 
wastewater samples twice per year from sewers No. 13 and 21 in Bay Chay, from sewer No. 11 
in Hon Gai and sewer No.5 in Cam Pha. The parameters to be analysed are BOD
5
,
total 
suspended solids and coliform bacteria.    
From Bai Muoi wastewater treatment plant in Hon Gai would be analysed the process and 
effluent quality at the discharging point to the open channel discharging to the sea. Due to the 
several other pollution sources to the channel and especially to the sea it is not possible to 
separate the impact of effluent from the impact of other load sources, therefore no analysing 
point from Cua Luc Bay, which is recipient water body, is proposed. Wastewater treatment 
process will be analysed daily and effluent samples will be taken four times per year.

In Bai Chay there is no need to have additional sampling points because there are already now 
two sampling points for Phase I in the project area. In Cam Pha one sampling point would be 
added to Km 8 Stream and one sampling point to Eastern of Mechanical Enterprise Stream. 
Samples will be taken twice per year after the construction.   
Monitoring of the flooding areas is proposed to be done in the same way than in Phase I. In 
Phase is proposed to have the following flooding monitoring areas in Hon Gai:  Cau 2 Channel 
(Cao Xanh ward), Dong Thanh Channel (Cao Thang ward), Ha Lam Channel (Ha Lam ward) 
and Technical Construction College (Hong Hai ward); and in Cam Pha: Cam Thach market 
(Cam Thach ward, Western of Mechanical Enterprise (Cam Phu ward), Bridge No. 6 (Cam Phu 
ward), Thanh Nien Mining Enterprise (Cam Phu ward) and Quang Hanh area.  
All reporting of Phase II will be done in the same way than in Phase I including semi-annual 
Report to WB, monitoring of implementation of mitigation measures done by the Contractors 
and all other relevant reports already in use. 
Institutional Development
Organisation responsible for Ha Long and Cam Pha Sanitation and Drainage Project is Ha 
Long URENCO on the behalf of Ha Long URENCO and Cam Pha URENCO according to the 
decision of QNPPC 300/QD-UB 3.2.1999. Ha Long URENCO and Cam Pha URENCO as the 
statutory providers of the sector services in Ha Long and Cam Pha will be implementing 
agencies of the Project, advised and supervised by Quang Ninh Province Peo
ple’s Committee 
(QNPPC) and municipal People’s Committees. For practical day-to-day work of this Project 
URENCOs have set up a Project Management Unit (PMU). 
PMU, Ha Long URENCO and Cam Pha URENCO shall pay attention to protection of 
environment and implement EMP during construction. PMU shall observe and follow 
resettlement rules and pay resettlement compensations on the behalf of the companies. 
Technical assistance will be used to improve management systems. 
Public Involvement and Consultation
The World Bank’s Operational Policy (OP 4.01) on Environmental Impact Assessment requires 
that affected groups and local NGOs to be informed and consulted as a part of the EIA 
preparation during at least two stages of the EIA-process: shortly after the EA category has 
been assigned and after the draft EIA-report has been prepared. Proper consultation is a 
requirement for EIA category A projects. Participation should be enabled during project 
preparation under certain conditions and is generally recommended as part of implementation. 
Projects that require involuntary resettlement (OP 4.30), consultation on social issues should be 
included.  
The Vietnamese version of the executive summary of draft EIA report was disclosed in all 
phuongs including to the project from August 2004. At the same time the full text of the draft 
EIA report was available at PMU office and informed to the project affected households. The 
final EA documents will be disclosed in InfoShop and VDIC at the World Bank office in 
Hanoi.

The first public consultation meeting was arranged already on 24 April 1998 in Ha Khanh ward 
People’s Committee. However, the wastewater treatment plant for Hon Gai was not 
implemented during the Phase I of the project.  
The second public consultation meeting for wastewater treatment plant was organised on 3 
August 2004 and there were representatives from Ha Khanh, Hong Gai and Bach Dang wards 
from where the wastewater is collected and where the wastewater treatment plant will be 
located. There were totally eight participants. In the meeting the participants agreed the 
location of the wastewater treatment plant, but wanted to have proper mitigation measures to 
prevent the negative impacts caused by the wastewater treatment plant, e.g. buffer zone around 
the site. Resettlement and site clearance issues were also discussed.   
The public consultation for sewerage and drainage component in Bai Chay and Hon Gai was 
organised on 30 November 2004 and there were representatives from Hong Hai, Cao Thang, 
Tran Hung Dao, Yet Kieu and Bai Chay wards. There were totally nine participants. In the 
meeting the participants supported the sewerage and drainage construction because it will 
decrease the flooding problems and improve environmental condition. The participants noticed 
that impacts during construction are obvious and requested that construction regulations and 
mitigation measures should be strictly followed. The representatives of the wards fully agreed 
to support and co-operate with PMU in the implementation of the project. 
 
The public consultation for drainage component in Cam Pha was organised on 1 December 
2004 and there were representatives from Cam Thinh, Cam Phu, Cam Son, Cam Thach and 
Quang Hanh wards. There were totally ten participants. In the meeting the participants made 
practical proposals for the design how to improve the streams in their wards. The participants 
fully supported the project because it will reduce the flooding problems in the area. The 
participants also proposed to speed up the construction. In addition during the RAP 
consultation meeting arranged on 3 December 2004 have been informed and discussed the 
environmental issues with the project affected people. There were 23 severely project affected 
people and representatives of the communes. The PAPs wanted that the appropriate boundaries 
of the buffer zone around the wastewater treatment plant should be identified to minimise the 
possible adverse impacts  
For environmental education and hygiene awareness it is recommended in the Phase II to 
continue the group training method, which results are already noticed to be good and effective. 
Women’s Unions would be the correct facilitators, because they have already experience from 
the Phase I to run the training on group level. Actually Women’s Unions have already made 
proposal to continue the training. Community participation and environmental training of Phase 
I
already covers the central areas of the project area and therefore it is recommended to have 
environmental awareness campaign in those areas which have not got any training until now.

introduction and project description 
-
Background of the Project 
Consistent with Government strategy of developing the sanitation and drainage components of 
urban infrastructure in Vietnam in the period 2001 to 2010, Quang Ninh province is included in a 
three cities programme in World Bank funded sanitation project. The other two cities are Danang 
and Haiphong. 
The first project formulation and feasibility study was done in 1995. Feasibility study for Phase I 
was completed in 1998 followed by detailed design and bid documentation. The tendered rates 
for the construction packages were lower than anticipated. In late 2002 the Ha Long City and 
Cam Pha Sanitation Project Management Unit (PMU) requested the World Bank approval to 
utilize unused funds for a second phase of improvement works. The funds would be used to 
expand on drainage, sanitation and wastewater treatment in accordance with the concept laid out 
in the Phase I feasibility study, as approved by the Government of Vietnam.

Environmental Impact Assessment of Halong City Water Supply and Sanitation 
Project  
The 1998 published EIA-study was divided into two separate reports: Volume IIIA 
–
EIA for 
Proposed Landfill Sites and Volume IIIB – EIA for Proposed Drainage and Sewerage System. 
Separate Environmental Management Reports have been prepared for Proposed Landfill Sites 
(IIIC) and Proposed Drainage and Sewerage System (IIID). A common Environmental 
Assessment Summary (IIIE) has also been prepared.   
The EIA Study for Proposed Drainage and Sewerage System was based on: 
-
collection of background data in situ in Vietnam and updating data from previous EIAs in 
Vietnam; 
-
review documents and project overview; 
-
review of the documents of other environmental studies in Halong Bay area, e.g. Ha Long 
Bay Environmental Pollution Study and The Study on Environmental Management for Ha 
Long Bay; 
-
site visits and preliminary assessment of wastewater treatment plant sites at Bai Chay (7 
sites), Hon Gai (14 sites) and Cam Pha (6 sites); 
-
biological-ecological and socio-economic surveys in Bai Chay (Cai Dam and Vuon Dao) 
and Hon Gai (Cua Luc shoreline in Yet Kieu) which were included in the earlier report (A 
Biological Study for the EIAs for three Landfills and three Wastewater Treatment Plant 
Sites in Halong City, Socio-economic Survey Data, and Summary of Results of Household 
Surveys in areas surrounding the proposed Yet Kieu – Bai Chay- Hung Thang wastewater 
treatment plant sites); 
-
site visits to the proposed areas in Bai Chay, Hon Gai and Cam Pha; 
-
Feasibility study and EIA of the recently constructed municipal wastewater treatment 
plant in Bai Chay  
-
Public hearings in Bai Chay, Hon Gai and Cam Pha, 
-

The following steps were taken in producing this environmental assessment report: 
-
analyse and specify environmental effects on the physical, biological and human 
environment caused by the location, rehabilitation, construction and operation of drainage 
channels, sewers and wastewater treatment plans in Bai Chay, Hon Gai and Cam Pha;

Public consultation with parties potentially affected by the project has been an integral part of the 
environmental assessment methodology. It has provided baseline information; has assisted in the 
identification of issues requiring resolution; and has established a mechanism for constructive 
exchange of information between the proponent and local residents. The consultation process 
followed in this environmental assessment; the results obtained to date; and future plans for this 
ongoing program.

Background, Objectives, Location and Scope of the Work of Additional Work in 
Hon Gai, Bai Chay and Cam Pha 
The investment aim, as defined in the Decision from the Peoples Committee of Quang Ninh 
Province dated 22 April 2003 is to continuously invest in the drainage and wastewater systems, 
and solid waste management, to protect the environment from flooding and to improve the 
drainage and sanitation system.     
More specifically, using funds remaining from the first phase, the objectives of the project are to:   
-
Mitigate flood and inundation of areas of Ha Long City and Cam Pha Town not covered 
under the Phase I works. 
-
Provide significant reduction in pollution of the ocean waters of Hon Gai by intercepting 
and treating wastewater carried in the storm water drains in the central area of the city.  
-
Further reduce the pollution of the Bai Chay coastline emanating from wastewater carried 
in storm water drains by increasing the length of interceptor sewers installed in Phase I.  
The following table gives the scope of works. Locations of the project area and works are 
presented in Drawings 1 to 12.

environmental policies and legislation 
Environmental Management 
The National Asse
mbly approved the government’s proposal to create the Ministry for Natural 
Resources and Environment (MONRE) by decision 02/2002/QH11 on August 5, 2002. Decree 
No 86/2002/ND-CP on November 5, 2002 provides in general functions, tasks, powers and 
organisation structure of the ministry and ministerial agencies. Decree No 91/2002/ND-CP on 
the functions, tasks, powers and organisational structure of the Ministry of Natural Resources 
and Environment was promulgated on November 11, 2002. The new ministry will co-operate 
with the General Department of Land Administration, the General Hydro-Meteorology 
Department and environmental offices that now operate under the Ministry of Science and 
Technology.  
MONRE is the government body to exercise the state function of management over the land, 
water resources, minerals, environment, meteorology, hydrogeography, measuring and mapping 
in the national scope; exercise the governance over the public services and represent the owner 
of state capital in enterprises using state budgets relating to natural resources of land, water, 
minerals, environment, meteorology, hydro-geography, measuring and mapping in accordance 
with the legislation.  
Concerning the environment the tasks and powers are as follows: 
-
Direct and supervise the implementation of the regulations and measures for the 
protection of the environment, the programs and projects on the prevention of combat and 
overcoming the degradation and pollution, environmental break-down as assigned by the 
government  
-
Uniformly manage the national environmental monitoring system; summarise and process 
data from environmental monitoring and regularly assess the environment; forecast the 
environmental changes 
-
Appraise the environmental impact assessment reports of the projects and business and 
production units; regulate environmental standards and uniformly manage the licensing, 
restoring the environmental standards satisfied certificates according to the regulations of 
the laws; 
-
Mobilise the donor resources, receive the investment capital from the State to support 
programmes, projects, activities and tasks to protect the environment and manage the 
utilization of Vietnam Environmental Protection Fund. 
On the provincial level DONRE is the legal body with responsibility for environmental 
regulation. DONRE has the overall responsibility that the Vietnamese environmental regulations 
are followed during the construction. DONRE carries out environmental monitoring as follows: 
-
Inspect execution of regulations, norms of the prevention and overcoming of 
environmental degradation caused by the pollution and environmental problems during the 
project implementation 
-
Co-operate with the PMU to inspect execution of relevant environmental law, regulations 
and standards to be followed 
-
Determine and report all environmental pollution and problems, which occur in project 
area and submit the inspection report to the People’s Committee for consideration and 
decision    
On the project level PMU has the main responsibility for the implementation and monitoring of 
the EMP and will ensure that the necessary sampling, analysing and reporting is carried out. 
Page  19
Ha Long City & Cam Pha Town Drainage & Sanitation Project

Black & Veatch International
PMU follows that the contractors will follow and implement the mitigation measures and 
monitoring mentioned in EMP. PMU will submit all monitoring reports to DONRE. 
Environmental Law, Decree and Standards 
In Vietnam, the basic national environmental policy is based on the Law on Organisation of the 
Government (September 30, 1992), the Law on Environmental Protection (December 27, 1993) 
and the Decree No. 175-CP (October 18, 1994). 
According to the Decree 91/2002/ND-CP under MONRE has been established among many 
other departments Environmental Impact Assessment and Appraisal department. The EIA can, 
however, be appraised by the local DONRE based on their knowledge of local conditions and 
further be delivered to PC for approval, if delegated so by MONRE.  There are no specific 
stipulations in the law and decree concerning the approval of EMP. 
MOSTE has published in 1995, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002 Vietnamese Environmental 
Standards, and standardisation work is in progress. From now on MONRE will continue the 
standardisation work. In such cases, where the applicable Vietnamese standard is inadequate, not 
regulated or applicable, project agencies must obtain MONRE’s approval for the use of 
equivalent standards of the countries that have provided the technology and equipment to 
Vietnam, or apply equivalent standard from a third country.  
The most relevant environmental related laws, standards and regulations are listed as follows:

World Bank Guidelines 
The environmental impact assessment study for the sanitation project was designed to evaluate 
its status with respect to all applicable World Bank environmental and social policies and 
guidelines. 
During the EA process for this project, a review of World Bank environmental and social 
policies was carried out with respect to their relevance to this project. The policies directly 
relevant to this project are Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), Cultural Property (OP 4.11) 
and Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.30). The specific World Bank guidelines that were 
identified as being applicable to this project are Environmental Assessment Sourcebook, Volume 
I
and II (1991) and Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook 1997. 
For all Category A projects proposed for IBRD or IDA financing, during the EA process, the 
borrower consults project-affected groups and local nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) 
about the project’s environmental aspects and takes their vies into account. For Category A 
projects, the borrower consults these groups at least twice: shortly after environmental screening 
and before the terms of reference for the EA is finalised; and once the draft EA report is 
prepared.  
For meaningful consultations between the borrower and project-affected groups and local NGOs 
on all Category A projects for IBRD or IDA financing, the borrower provides relevant material 
in a timely manner prior to consultation and in a form and language that are understandable and 
accessible to the groups being consulted. 
For a Category A project, the borrower provides for the initial consultation a summary of the 
proposed project’s objectives, description, and potential impacts; for consultation after the draft 
EA report is prepared, the borrower provides a summary of the EA’s conclusions. In addition, 
for a Category A project, the borrower makes draft EA report available at a public place 
accessible to project-affected groups and local NGOs. 
Once the borrower officially transmits the Category A EA Report to the Bank, the Bank 
distributes the summary (in English) to the executive directors (EDs) and makes the report 
available through its InfoShop. If the borrower objects to the Bank’s releasing an EA report 
through its InfoShop, Bank staff (a) do not continue processing an IDA project or (b) for IBRD 
project, submit the issue of further processing to the EDs.

BACKGROUND 
-
Environmental Setting 
The environmentally sensitive subjects in the project area are: coal mining activities in Cam Pha, 
sewerage and drainage discharge in Ha Long Bay, shipping, and raw water sources. 
The coal mining activities in Cam Pha have a significant environmental impact on the 
environment. The open-pit mining produces coal dust and tailings. These are generally tipped 
over the mountain escarpment facing the township. There is no buffer zone between the mining 
site and the township and the rainwater carries coal dust down towards the township. The coal 
dust settles all over and blocks the drains and channels.  Coal dust and coal particles contaminate 
the shoreline, offshore waters and bottom sediments thus damaging shoreline terrestrial and 
aquatic habitats, particularly the coral reefs. Large quantities of sulphur dioxide are released into 
the air and water bodies causing acidification. Coal mining causes also deforestation and land 
destruction, thus increasing erosion, surface runoff and lowering of groundwater levels. The 
large barren areas that are left without any landscaping after mining activities destroy the area’s 
natural scenic beauty.  Coal dust and inadequate mine safety increases health hazards. 
The provincial administration is conscious of the negative environmental impact of the coal 
industry and its conflict with the tourist development. Processing and shipment of coal has been 
moved from Han Gai to Cam Pha, and the harbour presently used for coal shipment has been 
changed to cater for passenger ships. It has been decided to encourage only underground mining 
in the Hon Gai area in order to minimise the dust problems.  
Discharge of untreated wastewater and solid waste into the channels, natural streams and the sea 
causes deterioration of the bay water quality and affects fishing and tourism activities. 
Deterioration of bay water quality is a health risk both for bathers and seafood consumers. 
Sea traffic and harbour activities increase the risk of pollution. At present there is no bilge water 
collection system, and in spite of existing regulations all vessels throw garbage and bilge water 
into the sea causing serious pollution. As a result the harbour areas are very dirty and there is 
often a visible oil film in the water. 
There are several rivers both large and small discharging into Cua Luc estuary and Ha Long bay 
bringing large amounts of suspended solids from upstream areas. Non-point source pollution 
provides a large contribution to the overall pollution load in this area.

Previous and Ongoing Sanitation Projects and Studies 
Halong Water Supply and Sanitation Project is part of the World Bank financed water supply 
and sanitation project in Vietnam which covers the three cities of Hanoi, Haiphong and Danang 
and, in Quang Ninh province, Ha Long City and Cam Pha town. The Danish International 
Development Agency (DANIDA) provided a bilateral grant for project preparation for the 
Quang Ninh component including in the first phase pre-feasibility studies to define a priority 
investment project to upgrade the water supply, drainage and sanitation services.  
The objectives of the Phase I of the project, which cover Ha Long City (Bai Chay and Hon Gai) 
and Cam Pha were to: 
-
improve environmental conditions in the urban areas 
-
help preserve the unique natural environment of Ha Long Bay that has ben designated a 
World Heritage site by UNESCO 
-
encourage economic growth

Ha Long City Master Plan 
Land Use 
According to the new Ha Long City Master Plan 2020 development target for Ha Long City is to 
develop infrastructure and other facilities and reserve land for construction to ensure the 
development of ecotourism. Target of the spatial development is to develop at the same time 
industrial areas, buffer zones, and residential and tourism areas focusing on two basic structural 
systems in the area namely sea and mountains.  
Urban spatial development orientation of Ha Long City according to approved master plan to 
2020 can be summarized as below: 
1.  The former centre (Eastern Hon Gai): Provincial centre for administration and public 
services like post office, hospital, stadium etc. 
2.  The Southern and Western-Northern sea encroachment areas: Area for comprehensive 
development and close structural management of infrastructure system. The sea 
encroachment of urban zones in the Western-Northern direction of Cua Luc estuary need 
to be limited in order to protect mangrove forests and tidal expanses to avoid effect to 
natural environment, minimize impacts on river currents flowing to the estuary and avoid 
changing the narrow passage of Cai Lan port. 
3.  Bai Chay area: The highest priority is development of tourism and tourism services 
4.  The North of Western Hon Gai: Modern industrial zones and ports and therefore this area 
needs close management of development plans and environment protection. 
5.  Expanded urban areas: Reserve for residential areas near centre  
6.  Natural reserves, national forests and cultural and historical sites: Development belongs to 
Ordinance of Vestige and Landscape Protection as well as Ordinance and International 
Convention of Heritage Protection 
7.  Development reservation area: Areas on the hills and mountains, which can used for 
construction, the reasonable sea encroachment areas and some satellite urban areas in 
order to meet the requirements in the situation of high growth of population. 
8.  Central public areas: Areas for services, tourism, industry and urban residence  
9.  Satellite urban areas: Preparation for three new urban areas: An ecotourism urban area at 
Hoanh Bo with capacity of 50,000 habitants and two urban areas at Bieu Nghi and Hoang 
Tan. These areas have business centres, tourism services, sport parks, mangrove forest 
reservations etc. There is also reservation to construct an international airport.   
 
10. Peripheral buffer zones: Zones surrounding city including forests, limestone mountains, 
hills and coastal mangrove forests. These ecosystems surrounding the city and need to be 
protected.

There should be appropriate plan on locations for cinder and soil discharge to prevent 
impact on residential areas. It is necessary to plant trees on buffer zones to prevent dust 
spreading. 
-
To protect Dien Vong water treatment plant it is necessary to survey sedimentation of the 
reservoir and study solutions to improve quality of water in the Dien Vong River. It is 
important to have vegetated buffer zone especially around Dien Vong and Cao Van 
reservoirs.  
-
Treatment of water from coal mine areas: pH level of leachate is 2.5-6 and it is necessary 
to add lime into water. High level of ammoniac is proposed to be treated by lime and 
aeration. 
-
Trees and grass should be planted in new cinder and soil disposal sites to prevent dust and 
erosion. Tree plantation is needed to create buffer zone for protection of residential areas.  
-
Dust from road is prevented by tarmac the roads and increasing road watering. If sea 
water is used for this purpose, dust volume will be less than 5-7 times in comparison with 
using surface water. Watering with 1.8l/m
2
seawater once a day will keep dust level on the 
permitted limitation.

Location 
Quang Ninh province is located about 160 km North-East from Hanoi in the Northern Mountain 
Region of Vietnam. It is bordering China in the North, Haiphong City and Hai Duong province 
in the South-East, and Bac Giang and Lang Son provinces in the West. Quang Ninh has 14 
administrative units including Ha Long city, 3 towns and 10 districts with total area of 5,900 
km
2
.
Ha Long City is political, economic and cultural center of the province, and it is also attractive 
resort with Ha Long Bay, which is UNESCO’s World Natural Heritage area. Ha Long City has 
two main parts; Bai Chay and Hon Gai, which are separated by the Cua Luc strait. Bai Chay is 
the tourism centre and Hon Gai is commercial and industrial centre of the city. Cam Pha is an 
industrial town located 30 km far from Ha Long city to the Northeast. In Cam Pha the main 
industrial activities are coal mining and mechanical factories.

Topography and Soil Conditions 
The Ha Long Bay area is characterised by steep hills of weathered limestone running from East 
to West and ranging from 100 to 300 meters high. The lowlands between the steep hills and the 
bay consist of alluvial and marine sediments, with an average height of 4 to 5 meters. 
All coal mining activity is in the Lower and Middle Triassic stratigraphic areas. North of these 
regions are the Ordovician layers, where there is no coal mining. 
Rates of erosion are associated with climate, particularly the amount and intensity of rainfall, and 
can be modified by vegetative cover. Deforestation, mining activities, increased intensive 
agriculture and other human activities such as housing on the hill slopes increase erosion in the 
Ha Long City and Cam Pha areas. 
-
Flora and Fauna 
General  
In Quang Ninh Province there have been originally more than 35,000 ha of mangrove. Causes 
for the deterioration include permanent dumping of coal waste, conversion to coastal agriculture, 
fuel wood exploitation, land conversion to freshwater agriculture, alteration of tidal and salinity 
regimes caused by dike construction and extensive land reclamation. 
The original forest area in Quang Ninh Province was about 507,000 ha in 1943, but only 208,000 
remained in 1985, and the forested area is certainly much less today.

aquatic habitats: 
-
Natural forests developed in the limestone mountains for example: Bai Tho, Giap khau, 
Ha Tu mountains

-
Secondary forests or savannas developed on the "soil" mountains or hills for example Bai 
Chay, Ghenh Tau Mountains. Secondary forests compose of plant species 
Pinnus spp, 
Eucaliptusspp, and Acacia spp 
-
Sea shorelines are composed of different sub- ecosystems and sand beaches, mudflat 
beaches, mangrove forests and brackish lagoons and lakes 
-
Cua Luc estuary 
The aquatic Ha Long bay has a total surface area of 1,566 km
2
with 1969 small isles. Of these 
788 isles with a surface area of 434 km
2
are protected by UNESCO as apart of World Natural 
Heritage.  
Vulnerable Ecosystems in Ha Long Bay 
Tropical rain forests developed on limestone mountains and Ha Long bay islets
 have been 
degraded by human activities. There are some hundreds of Phanerogame plants, which have 
developed in these mountains. There are 19 mammals in the forests and hundred of bird species. 
Mangrove forests of the coastal zones
 of Ha Long city can be divided into three types of 
coastal geomorphology: shoreline of Hon Gai, shoreline of Bai Chay; and mudflat beaches of 
Cua Luc. The mangrove forest in the shoreline of Hon Gai coast have not been developed very 
well, because there are very few rivers and little alluvium deposits. The mangrove forests form 
only narrow bands near the seashore. The mangrove forests in the shore line of Bai Chay and in 
the Cua Luc areas are better developed than in Hon Gai, particularly in the mudflat beaches in 
the Cai Dam area. In Ha Long Bay area there are mangroves growing along the coastline and in 
the bay. The larger mangrove areas are protected, but most of the mangrove forests have been 
cut down due to land reclamation. There are 34 species of mangroves found in the whole of 
northern Viet Nam. Cua Luc has rather less with 13 species of mangroves, of which 6 species 
distribute broadly over the entire saline swamps, and 4 of these have high density and large 
qualities. 
Coral reefs in Ha Long Bay
:
There are 117 species belonging to the 40 genera and 12 families 
of hard corals (
Scleractinian
). Living corals cover about 15% of the near shore area and up to 
50% of the offshore areas. The Corals occur normally in a depth of 0 to 7 m, the most of them 
live in a water depth of 2m to 4m. According to the survey done by Hai Phong Institute of 
Oceanology (HIO) for the Ha Long Bay Environmental Pollution Study there are no hard corals 
near to the mainland due to the muddy bottom and high turbidity. The distribution of number of 
taxon and species of living coral are found with increased distance from seashore towards the 
outer sea direction. The amount of living coral varies from 15-55% with most of the reefs being 
categorised as poor quality, and only the reefs at Dau Be and Hang Trai being in the good 
category. No excellent reefs were found in the region. Species, which can tolerate turbidity of 
sea water, were the most common. The biggest threats to coral reefs besides the turbidity are 
fishing with dynamite and collection for souvenir business. 
Threats to Ha Long Wetlands 
Wetland and marine coastal ecosystems have been rapidly degraded particularly near Ha Long 
city and Cam Pha Town. It has been estimated that over 60% of the mangrove systems have been 
destroyed. The biggest threats are: land reclamation, population pressure and industrial 
development; concession to agriculture; discharge of highly contaminated coal mine drainage; 
and decreased freshwater discharge. Wetland use and management strategies and action plans are 
proposed in Ha Long Bay Pollution Study.

Sea and River Conditions 
ƒ
Tide Regime 
The Ha Long Bay area is influenced by a diurnal tide. Average tidal amplitude is 2-3.8 m in 
height, with maximum amplitude of 4.70 m. The tides are the strongest in December-January and 
June-July. They are the weakest in March-April and August-September. During strong tides the 
average tidal height is 2.8 - 3.6 m. The weak tides are only 0.2 to 0.5 m in height. Velocity of the 
tidal currents is in the range 0.2-0.5 m/s.  Bac Bo gulf tide regime has impact on the see water 
level. The following information is based on data from national gauging station:

Sea Water Quality  
According to the State Environmental Quality Report of Quang Ninh Province (2003) the coastal 
sea water quality of Ha Long City and Cam Pha Town is directly influenced by domestic 
wastewater, port services and sea reclamations. However, the parameters like DO, BOD, 
turbidity, coliform, oil and grease, heavy metals, total nitrogen and total phosphorous meet the 
requirement limits of the standard TCVN 5943:1995. In general the values of DO were from 4.3 
to 6.8 mg/l, BOD from 1.3 to 12 mg/l, TSS from 0.7 - 63 mg/l. The detailed information from 
some of the sampling points is presented in Annex 1. The water quality in Ha Long Bay area is 
rather clean, clear and unpolluted. The water quality around floating fish farming area is suitable 
for aquaculture. Oil and grease concentration at Cai Lan port was about 1.86 times higher than 
that in the TCVN 5943:1995. The number of coliform bacteria at Ha Long boat station was about 
4.1 times higher than that in the TCVN 5943:1995 because of the operation of fish port.

The Halong City area has several rivers flowing into the Cua Luc estuary, the most significant of 
these being Troi, Mau, Vuoai and Dien Vong Rivers. Dien Vong River is the source for the 
domestic and industrial water supply for Hon Gai, Ha Tu, Cam Pha, Coc 6 and Cua Ong. The 
waters of Troi River are utilised mainly for domestic and industrial use but also for agricultural 
use in Dong Dang, Bai Chay and Gieng Day.  There are a number of minor surface water 
resources in Bai Chay and Hon Gai including many small ponds and lakes and numerous small 
streams with small catchment areas. None of these are of any interest for public water supply due 
to the small and unreliable flows. Many of these ponds and rivers are polluted by the coal mining 
and other human activities.  
Based on The study on Environmental Management for Ha Long Bay (carried out by JICA, 
1999) as well as the environmental monitoring results of Quang Ninh DONRE from July 2002 to 
February 2003, the river quality in the project areas is still unpolluted. The DO values are about 
6
mg/l to 7 mg/l, BOD values are about 6 mg/l to 12 mg/l. The Total SS values are about 18 mg/l 
to 120 mg/l in the dry season and about 500 mg/l to 1,000 mg/l in the rainy season because of the 
high slope of rivers. The concentrations of other parameters like heavy metals, total nitrogen and 
total phosphorous are rather low.

Pollution Loads and Dilution Capacity according to Water Quality Models 
Impacts of the discharge of effluent from the wastewater treatment plants the according to the 
water quality model calculated in 1998 are presented in Annex 2. The results show that the 
dilution capacity of Ha Long Bay is very good. It can be estimated that dilution capacity with the 
proposed load is in Cua Luc Bay 8,570:1 and in Ha Long Bay 900,000:1. This is expected 
because of its connection with the Gulf of Tonkin. On the other hand, the dilution capacity of 
Cua Luc estuary (Bai Chay bay, Hon Gai Bay) is limited and is related in a large measure to the 
area of the estuary. If the bay is reduced, as seem to be happen, in size by reclamation, the

dilution capacity will also be reduced, but is still very good compared to the discharged effluent 
volume.

Tourism 
Quang Ninh province has special tourism resources with attractive resorts and especially Ha 
Long Bay which has been recognized as the World Natural Heritage area by UNESCO. In the 
province there are also hundreds of historical places and buildings. There are a lot of 
opportunities to discover the sea, land and islands. 
The tourism turnover in the year 2003 was 879 billion VND and 2,590,064 tourists visited the 
area. The number of tourists increased 10.2% from the year 2002. The number of foreign tourists 
was 1,107,813 which increased 21.8% in comparison with the year 2002. 
There were 51,462 people working in trade, tourism, hotel and restaurant in the province in the 
year 2003, of which in Ha Long City there were 21,217 workers (41.2% of total labour of the 
province) and in Cam Pha Town 6,717 workers (13.0% of total labours of province). 
drainage and sanitation status 
-
Drainage Areas and Capability of Drainage and Sewerage System in Hon Gai, Bai 
Chay and Cam Pha 
Ha Long URENCO and Cam Pha URENCO are responsible for operation and maintenance of 
drainage system in Ha Long City and Cam Pha Town. The drainage system is about 50 years old 
and suffering from poor maintenance, including significant blockage due to the solid waste, 
sewage and coal fines from the nearby coal mines. Many parts are broken or plated and have not 
been prepared. 
In general in the project area the channels are short and discharge directly to the sea. The 
channels are usually not lined except in the town centres. The channels are frequently partially 
blocked by household garbage. The number of drainage is limited and they concentrate on 
centres and along coastline areas, and therefore there is no drainage system in valleys or 
residential areas far from the centres.  
In recent years the high degree of urbanisation has changed the characteristics of the surface and 
reduced the penetration capacity of storm water into the ground, thus increasing the water 
volume to be discharged through drainage system and the existing drainage system is becoming 
even more overloaded.  
The sewerage system is combined. Wastewater from household kitchens, baths and sinks are 
typically disposed directly to the drainage channels. However, in the new development areas 
Page  33
Ha Long City & Cam Pha Town Drainage & Sanitation Project 
–
Phase II 
Environmental Impact Assessment 
20
 
Black & Veatch International
these grey waters are discharged to the septic tanks. Many areas have not been connected to the 
drainage system and wastewater will soak to the ground or is discharged to the ponds and 
reservoirs. 
Industrial wastewater is usually discharged untreated directly to the sea through private drainage 
channels although the national legislation requires on-site treatment. Some factories have built 
own wastewater treatment plants, however, the number of treatment plants is small and 
efficiency low. 
In Vuon Dao in Bai Chay there is a small 2,500 m
3
/d wastewater treatment plant, in which part 
of the wastewater from tourist area is treated.  
The wastewater treatment plant including to the Phase I of the Project is under construction in 
Cai Dam area in Bai Chay.    
-
Flooding  
Flooding is still common in some areas in Ha Long and Cam Pha, but the situation will improve 
after finalisation of Ha Long City and Cam Pha Town Sanitation and Drainage Project. The main 
causes for flooding are insufficient channel capacity combined with channel blockages caused by 
uncontrolled dumping of solid waste and especially in Cam Pha coal mining waste. Some 
construction activities have also blocked channels recently.  
In Bai Chay there are no significant flooding problems in inhabited areas, except when the 
channels are blocked by solid waste and soil deposits from the hillsides. The coastline is 
relatively narrow with a high mountainous hinterland, hence storm water is transported to the 
bay via the existing drainage and natural channels. During high intensity rainfall, the storm water 
flows over the roads near the Halong Hotel where drainage is either insufficient or blocked. 
In the populated areas of Hon Gai there is regular flooding especially in the market area during 
heavy rainfall. The flooding is due mainly to blocked drainage channels. The most disruptive 
flooding occurs on the Road 18 along the Southern coastline at the Kenh Niem area near the 
Water Supply Company office.  This area is not fully channelled. The Ministry of Transportation 
and Communication operates and maintains the drainage channels but not on a regular basis. The 
main reason for the flooding is inadequate design of the drainage channels combined with the 
blockage of the channels and lack of access for the rainwater to reach the channels. During high 
tide the seawater flows to the channels and when the tide coincides with heavy rain there is not 
enough slope to drain the area. 
The present Yiet Kieu Lake was earlier a bay but construction of a causeway has cut the access 
to the sea. A tidal gate has been installed to the causeway and this appears to keep out the tide 
from the low-lying area, but during rains there are regularly floods. For the time being through 
this area is discharged a large amount of sewage. The main sewage flow is separated from the 
central ponds, which are used for aquaculture, but during and after heavy rains the whole area is 
flooding causing extremely unhygienic conditions. 
The Hon Gai town centre is a low lying flat area, which is drained through four main channels 
towards the harbour. During heavy rains certain areas are subject to flooding, particularly the Ha 
Long market area beside Le Thanh Tong Road. Because the channels are used also for sewage 
this causes serious health risk.   
In the whole project area the most serious flooding occurs in Cam Pha especially during high 
tide. The main drainage channels are encroached upon by unplanned house and infrastructure 
construction. The channels are at least partially blocked and do not have enough capacity to 
transport all storm water. To the East of Cam Pha at Can Thinh, Cam Phu and Cam Son the 
situation is worsened due to the tailings from the mining activities in the hills behind the town.   
Page  34

Phase I has partly solved the flooding problems and rehabilitation of drains in Phase II in the rest 
serious flooding area will still improve the situation.   
-
Wastewater Quality in Hon Gai, Bai Chay and Cam Pha 
In the construction stage of the Phase I the PMU has been cooperating with Preventive Health 
Centre of Quang Ninh Province to monitor the wastewater quality of four sewers flowing to the 
sea (sewers No. 13 and 21 in Bai Chay, sewer No. 11 in Hon Gai and sewer No. 5 in Cam Pha). 
Samples have been taken twice per year during high tide. The monitoring results indicate that the 
pollutant concentrations do not vary systematically; however, it seems that the concentrations are 
higher in dry season in December than during in the beginning of rainy season in June. Results 
of the project performance indicators are presented in Annex 3.  
The sewers are combined sewers and water is collected from many different sources. Therefore 
new domestic wastewater standard TCVN 6772:2000 cannot be used because that standard 
classifies very detailed the effluent according to the size of the hotel, restaurant and other 
commercial enterprise. The limits of TCVN 6772:2000 can be used only for the assessment of 
wastewater pollution of each separate enterprise. Standards TCVN 6986:2001 and 6987:2001 
can be used to assess point-source industrial effluent discharge when the effluent flow is known. 
Standard TCVN 7222:2002 is meant for effluent after wastewater treatment plant. None of these 
new standards is applicable for the assessment of this kind of combined untreated wastewater 
and therefore limits of standard TCVN 5945:1995 Class B (water used for swimming) Industrial 
wastewater 
–
Discharge standards are still used as reference.  
In Hon Gai BOD values in wastewater varied a lot, some results being well under the limit of 
standard TCVN 5945:1995 (class B) and some results many times over the limit. Total 
suspended solids were usually higher than the limit. The biggest problem is coliform bacteria, 
which very high numbers indicate strong and direct wastewater pollution.

1.6 times higher 
than the limit of standard TCVN 5945:1995 (class B). Total suspended solids were only in 2003 
higher than the limit. There is also in Cam Pha strong and direct wastewater pollution because 
the numbers of coliform bacteria were very high.

Without the Project Situation 
The Phase II is the extension and finalisation of the ongoing Ha Long City and Cam Pha Town 
Drainage and Sanitation Project Phase I and it is necessary to fulfil the scope of the project, 
which was proposed in the Phase I feasibility study in 1998. Without the Phase II there would be 
no wastewater collection and treatment in Hon Gai and intended improvements of living and 
hygienic conditions would not be reached. Without the project improvement of drainage system 
would not be completed in the extension to be agreed and flooding problems would be solved 
only partly and in Bai Chay, Hon Gai and Cam Pha.      
-
Selection of the Location of Wastewater Treatment Plant in Hon Gai 
During the preparation of Phase I EIA for proposed Drainage and Sewerage System (1998) 
totally 14 locations for wastewater treatment plant were reviewed.  
During Phase II site location PA 2A was chosen from three options at a meeting convened at Ha 
Long City PC on 10
th
 April 2003. This site is on the edge of the hill of Deo Sen cemetery, it 
being chosen principally because the projected number of houses (30) requiring relocation was 
smaller than for the other two site options considered.  
In mid-April 2004 open coal mining quarrying was noted by the Consultant to be encroaching on 
the south-western side of the designated WWTP site. This was brought to the attention of the 
PMU who immediately arranged for the mining company to cease excavating in the direction of 
the WWTP site. The PMU also arranged a site meeting with the mining company (29
th
 April 
2004) at which they were requested to demarcate their official mining area.  
The PMU then instructed the Consultant to propose two new alternative sites. The first 
(Alternative A presented in Drawing 7) was similar in orientation to the existing, only located 
about 100m further in a north-easterly direction along the base of Deo Sen hill; the second 
(Alternative B) was the same site orientated through 90 degrees.

The most important criteria in determining the best site was agreed to be the number of houses 
requiring resettlement. This in turn necessitated the determination of the likely buffer zone 
around the site perimeter, based on Government regulations. The most appropriate standard is 
TCVN 7222:2002, and this dictates a 300m buffer zone in the case of open sludge treatment and 
a
210m buffer zone (a 30% reduction) in the case of closed sludge treatment. It also allows for a 
further 30% reduction (to 147m) in the event tree landscaping is provided around the WWTP site 
perimeter.  
From recently acquired land use plans it was determined that for Alternative A the respective 
number of PAF’s for the closed sludge option with no tree landscaping would be about 105, 
whilst for Alternative B the corresponding PAF numbers would be about 125. The final number 
of houses to be resettled will be given in RAP.  The reason for the greater number of PAF’s than 
that determined in 2003 is that earlier evaluations did not take account of the buffer zone. When 
taking account of seasonal wind directions it was found that fewer extra PAF’s could be 
expected under Alternative A than under Alternative B. The reason for this was the greater wind 
protection offered to Alternative A from the Deo Sen hill.  
Accordingly, it was recommended to PMU that the Alternative A site be recommended for 
adoption to Ha Long PC. This duly transpired in early June 2004.  
The original overall site dimensions have been retained being 200 m by 353 m, equating to some 
7
ha of land. The design presented is estimated to cover an area of less than 3 ha, covering 
preliminary treatment, sequencing batch reactors, gravity thickeners and maturation ponds. A 
doubling of capacity to 14,000m
3
/day in the future is therefore viable.  
On the proposed wastewater treatment plant construction site there are no cultural properties, 
historical places or buildings or other structures, which should be protected.

Wastewater Flow and Load Projections of Phase II 
For the needs of wastewater treatment plant design of Phase II have been done wastewater flow 
and load projections. Table 6.1 summarises the flow and BOD load projections made in the 
Kampsax 1998 Phase I Report and the VIWASE 2003 Phase II Report. The third column gives 
proposed figures, based on adjusted population figures and BVI’s experience in Asia.  A mass 
balance diagram based on the proposed flows and loads given in Table 6.1 is presented in Annex 
4

In the Final Inception Report it is proposed to design the treatment facility to meet a range of 
flows and loads.  Due regard will be given to the cost and operational implications of such 
flexibility. The 2003 report design parameters have been adopted, but the impact of higher or 
lower loads on the design considered.  This range has been defined as: 
-
Upper end: assumes no effective pre-treatment in septic tanks 
-
Lower end: assumes greater infiltration than predicted by past reports, reflecting 
experience elsewhere in the Asia region. 
This is illustrated in Table 6.2
 
below. Note that the pollutant concentrations given in milligrams 
per litre relate to dry weather flow conditions.

The estimated input BOD load at the WWTP is 1,377 kg/d and input suspended solids load is 
984 kg/day. With an effluent standard of 30 mg/l for both BOD and SS, maximum theoretical 
pollution loads at 7,133 m
3
/day will be 213 kg/d both BOD and SS. This means a 84 % removal 
for BOD and a 78 % removal for SS. In practice, however, the removal efficiencies will be much 
higher. This is because the determining criteria for maturation pond sizing is faecal coliform 
level 3,000 MPN/100 ml being specified as a maximum in the effluent. The resulting large ponds 
size is such as to virtually guarantee a minimum 90 % BOD reduction though the works, i.e. a 
BOD of 20 mg/l. 
Nitrogen and phosphorous removal has been designed for an anoxic zone to provide 
denitrification to get the total N level down to 10 mg/l or less, as stipulated in the effluent 
standards below.  
ƒ
Effluent Discharge Standards 
In discussion with PMU it has been agreed to combine the TCVN 7222:2002 and TCVN 
6987:2001 standards to produce an appropriate list of design parameters for Hon Gai WWTP. 
TCVN 6987:2001 is Industrial Wastewater Quality Standard for Discharging into Coastal Water 
Body used for Sport and Recreation and TCVN 7222:2002 General Environmental Requirements 
for Central Domestic (Municipal) Wastewater Treatment Plants. This standard defines certain 
relevant parameters (but not all of them, for example coliform levels are not stipulated) and has 
not as yet been developed to allow application with varying receiving waters. It copes with this 
by quoting a range of permissible standards for five of the seven parameters listed.  The standard 
also attempts to be flexible by allowing the application of industrial effluent standards - such as 
TCVN 6987:2001.

The criteria laid down by PMU was that no standard must be less stringent than the equivalent 
TCVN 7222:2002 standard. Examples are suspended solids (SS) and COD, where TCVN 
6987:2001 quotes, respectively, a less stringent standard and none at all.  PMU have been 
advised that the COD value of 50mg/l to be applied is low and that a figure in excess of 100mg/l 
would be more appropriate. The 50mg/l limit should, however, be achievable for weak 
wastewaters with no industrial component.   
The implication of the low nitrogen and phosphorous values is that denitrification must be 
included in the design. The preferred method is the inclusion of an anoxic zone in the SBR tank 
(thus making the tank larger) rather than the alternative of lime addition.  
ƒ
Choice of Treatment Technology 
Much has been done previously by other in evaluating the most appropriate treatment 
technology.  In practice, for the specific circumstances of the project, there is no one option that 
precludes all others and that a number of technologies could be used successfully. 
Factors for process selection typically cover: type of waste, including industrial component; land 
area available at appropriate site, and relative investment and operating costs. However, it is 
important that all viable options must: meet be capable of meeting the required effluent 
discharge consent; be sustainable based on adequate available local resources including funding 
and revenue; provide for future changes in flows and loads and provide sufficient operational 
flexibility, and not utilise new untested or novel technologies be harnessed, presenting 
unacceptable risk to the municipality. 
It is envisaged that to meet the discharge standards, the treatment works must comprise: 
preliminary treatment (gross solids, screenings and grit removal); biological treatment; 
disinfection and effluent polishing, and biological sludge treatment and secure disposal. An 
evaluation of the latter three components is presented in the Final Inception Report. Table 6.4 
summarises the comparative analysis of treatment technology options.

Biological Treatment 
 
Viable options previously considered included the following biological treatment systems: 
lagoon systems; oxidation ditches, and sequencing batch reactor (SBR) activated sludge. Other 
options, such as chemically-enhanced settlement, may not be considered viable on the basis of 
inability to provide ammonia-nitrogen removal and a heavy dependence on expensive chemicals.  
The Phase 1 Bai Chay wastewater system is in the process of implementing SBR technology.  
This configuration was chosen on the basis of: system robustness and flexibility; low land 
requirement; simple construction; high treatment efficiency: reduced odours, and facility for 
removal of treated sludge.  
There are several benefits to adopting the same approach as Bai Chay, they are: flexibility to 
discharge limit upgrading (e.g. to include enhanced nutrient removal); common operating and 
maintenance scheduling; common staff training and development, and maintenance and spares 
economies through common ordering and preventative maintenance programmes.  
In the case of Hon Gai, land availability is not such a problem and all listed viable technologies 
could be accommodated. Nevertheless, pond systems may require further land for future 
expansion of capacity.  
Comparative to conventional activated sludge or oxidation ditch plant, SBR systems have: lower 
structural and equipment costs; lower operation and maintenance costs, and greater flexibility in 
managing weaker wastewater loads. Nevertheless, operator knowledge is a critical factor in their 
performance and this may be an area of concern.  
Whilst the 2003 Phase II FS outlines SBR design without accounting for nitrification capacity, 
the overall impact on the adequacy of the allocated land is expected to be negligible, given the 
intensive nature of this technology configuration. 
SBR is recommend is recommended to be selected for the wastewater treatment method. Other 
options, such as chemically-enhanced settlement, may not be considered viable on the basis of 
inability to provide ammonia-nitrogen removal and a heavy dependence on expensive chemicals. 
The Phase 1 Bai Chay wastewater system is in the process of implementing SBR technology and 
for the further operation and maintenance practices it would be good that the two wastewater 
treatment plant operated by Ha Long URENCO would have the same treatment technology.   
In environmental point of view SBR gives some advantages i.e. the flexibility and ability to treat 
low concentration wastewater and it is not so sensitive to shock loads, which are common to the 
combined sewer network and high rainfall.   
Disinfection and Effluent Polishing 
Given the sensitivity of the receiving water, with respect to nearby bathing and tourist amenities, 
it is recommended that some form of tertiary treatment is provided in addition to nitrification. 
Tertiary treatment facilitates opportunities for higher levels of disinfection, fine particulate

material, phosphorus removal, and denitrification (reduction of nitrate-nitrogen to gaseous 
nitrogen). Of these, disinfection is an essential requirement. Table 6.5 summarises the 
advantages and disadvantages of a number of technologies against each of these determinands.

From Table 6.5 it can be concluded that: sand filtration and reed beds should be rejected since 
they do not form secure disinfection. Chlorinated disinfection presents a negative environmental 
impact with the risk of organo-chlorine formation. Ultra-violet disinfection is not generally 
effective on virus-bearing particulates, such as with the likes of cryptosporidium and it is also an 
expensive option. Subject to land availability, multiple shallow maturation ponds provide a 
combination of secure simple to operate disinfection along with a range of other effluent 
polishing benefits. 
Biological Sludge Treatment and Secure Disposal 
Sludge treatment options include: 
-
Gravity thickening - digestion - dewatering 
-
Gravity thickening - lime/alum conditioning - dewatering 
-
Gravity thickening - open drying beds  
-
Gravity thickening - tankering to a landfill site 
Gravity thickened sludge could be transported  to the Deo Sen Landfill to the new Deo Sen 
sludge treatment facility which is located very close to the Hon Gai WWTP site (less than 1km) 
and is designed to provide drying bed treatment to 56m
3
/day of septage on a year round basis.  
Because it must function through the wet season the real dry-weather design capacity is 
112m
3
/day.  The provision of canopies over all or part of the drying beds (as has been done at 
Bai Chay WWTP) would increase capacity by 100%. It is estimated that thickened sludge 
production at the Hon Gai WWTP when operating at full Stage I capacity (7,000m
3
/day) will be 
in the order of 18m
3
/day. Hence it can be judged that there is more than sufficient design 
capacity to handle WWTP sludges, as well as normal septage loads.  
The predicted slow sludge build-up at the Hon Gai WWTP means that any mechanical 
dewatering facility installed is likely to be under-used for some time. It is therefore sensible to 
start operations by providing tankers to transport thickened sludge to the Deo Sen landfill. One 
tanker (9 m
3
capacity) will easily suffice initially. Later, as sludge volumes build up at the 
WWTP, possibly even after the later extension of the works to accept flows in excess of 7,000 
m
3
/day, serious consideration can be given to installing a sludge plate type facility.

Selection of the Alternatives of Sewerage and Drainage Improvements in Hon Gai, 
Bai Chay and Cam Pha 
In Phase II will be implemented the rest of the sewerage and drainage works which were agreed 
in Phase I, but could not implemented for different reason e.g. due the construction of new Hau 
Can road in Bai Chay tourist area. 
In hydraulic design of sewers has been used Manning’s Formula, which is accepted 
internationally for design of open channels, and used also in Vietnam for pipe design. Manning’s 
Formula applied in sewer design gives comparable results and its use is therefore recommended 
here. 
Although it is standard Vietnamese practice to use a minimum size of 300mm sewer in roads, the 
adoption of a minimum size of 200mm is normal international practice. A smaller pipe is less 
expensive and will give higher sewage velocities. However, the 300mm diameter pipe is less 
likely to block, which is the concern of the Vietnamese authorities. This size will therefore be 
adopted in the design. Pipe gradients should be such as to give a minimum daily peak flow 
velocity of 0.75m/s.  
In the design of storm water drainage systems the internationally used Rational Method is 
proposed by the Phase II FS. This is in accordance with standard Vietnamese practice. The 
formula is quoted as Q = CqF (L/s), whereas it is usually expressed as Q = CiA, where C is a 
coefficient, I is rainfall intensity and A area of sub-catchment in hectares. However, the end 
result is the same. The Mannings formula is proposed for the hydraulic design of drainage 
channels.

General Impacts on Socio-Economy 
All kind of construction works as well as activities related to these, will lead to certain cause 
(activity) and impacts on the environment. In this EIA-study will be analysed and specified both 
the negative and positive environmental impacts on the physical, biological and human 
environment caused by the construction of wastewater treatment plant in Hon Gai and 
rehabilitation and construction of sewerage and drainage system in Hon Gai, Bai Chay and Cam 
Pha.  
The environmental impact assessment adopts a concise format, where the linkages between 
environmental issues (or potential impacts), management measures (or mitigation), net effects 
(or residual impacts) and management information (or monitoring) are made explicitly. A 
comprehensive summary of these factors and their linkages is presented as tables in Annex 5. 
These tables provide the basis to develop and implement a detailed Environmental Management 
Plan (EMP) dealing with all phases of the project. 
The main impacts in the proposed project area will mainly affect the human and aquatic 
environment, in lesser amount the atmospheric and terrestrial environment. The atmospheric and 
terrestrial impacts are mainly temporary during construction and rehabilitation and therefore of 
short duration. Possible negative impacts on air quality from operation of wastewater treatment 
plant can be minimised through mitigation measures. The overall impacts of the project are 
positive and are very important step in improving sanitation situation in Ha Long City and Cam 
Pha Town.  
The improvement of urban sanitation, which is currently badly hampered by frequent flooding, 
towards a clean and healthy environment for the population of Ha Long City and Cam Pha Town 
as well as the numerous domestic and international tourist visiting the area is essential. The 
Page  42

overall impact of the on going project and the proposed additional works is positive and it is an 
important step in improvement of sanitation in Ha Long City and Cam Pha Town. The Phase II 
Project includes additional works to the first sanitation project aiming at the rehabilitation and 
improvement of the existing sewerage and drainage system of the city. 
Improvement of the wastewater collection and treatment in Hon Gai and prevention of flooding 
in low-lying areas in Hon Gai and Cam Pha will improve considerably the living and 
environmental conditions in the project area. However, untreated wastewater will partly still 
flow in the open channels, which cross the residential areas. The negative impacts of untreated 
wastewater are mainly concentrated in the city area. The discharge of untreated wastewater to the 
sea will continue the contamination of the sea water. However, the concentrations of 
contaminants will be diluted by the large amount of seawater. 
The water use will increase in the city (new water connections, more household facilities, 
conversion from bucket latrines to flush toilets, etc.), which will increase wastewater amounts. 
This shall be taken into account in the designs and in dimensioning the improvements in flood 
prevention. The installation and regular desludging of septic tanks connected to sewers will 
improve the wastewater quality. 
On any of the proposed construction sites there are no cultural properties, historical places or 
buildings or other structures, which should be protected.  
The cause and effect relationship of different activities are discussed below in detail according to 
the project components.  
-
Impacts during Design and Construction 
ƒ
Impacts of Wastewater Treatment Plant in Hon Gai 
The wastewater treatment plant will be constructed in Bai Muoi on the vicinity of Deo Sen 
landfill, Deo Sen cemetary and mining quarry, where the original landscape has been already 
changed. On the proposed construction site there are fish ponds which need dewatering and land 
reclamation before construction. Separate socio-economic and detailed measurement survey will 
be done for the preparation of Resettlement Action Plan. 
During the dewatering and filling there will be noise from pumps, and an increase in channel 
water turbidity due to pumping, this can be minimised with avoiding mixing of sediment and 
using stabilisation pond. The pond can be dewatered through existing channel to Cua Luc 
Estuary on the other side of the road.  
During the construction of the wastewater treatment plant the traffic will increase due to the 
transportation of excavated material and construction equipment and materials. The excavated 
material is normal soil and there is no need for treatment. Working should be avoided during 
night from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. The maximum permitted noise level in public and residential areas 
is given in Vietnamese standard TCVN 5949:1998.  
Construction of some structures might need piling, which will temporarily cause an increase of 
noise in the vicinity of the construction sites. 
ƒ
Impacts of Combined Sewers, Interceptor Sewers and Wastewater Pumping 
Stations in Hon Gai, Bai Chay and Cam Pha 
Sewers will be constructed in street areas and there is no need for site-clearance and 
resettlement. However, some temporary disturbance might be caused to businesses along the 
streets during the excavation of sewer trenches.

Pumping stations are constructed next to the streets and in some places some site clearance might 
be needed, if there is not enough vacant land available.  
There will be temporary nuisance to traffic and traffic congestion is possible due to the 
construction. On highway 18 and Hau Can Road in Bai Chay there might be some disturbance 
for tourist transportation. 
The traffic will increase due to the transportation of equipment, pipes and excavated material. 
Dust and noise will increase temporarily in the vicinity of construction sites. Open trenches 
might be dangerous if not marked and identified carefully.  
The excavated material is normal soil and there is no need for treatment of this material. 
ƒ
Impacts on Rehabilitation of Canals and Drains in Hon Gai, Bai Chay and 
Cam Pha and Tidal Gates in Hon Gai 
Traffic will increase due to the transportation of equipment and excavated material. There might 
be temporary traffic congestion during the works.  
Most of the rehabilitation will occur on the ends of channels, but some parts of the channels or 
whole channels are located along narrow alleys where it is difficult to use any machines, and 
only manual methods can be used. Some channels or part of channels to be rehabilitated are 
located under houses or other structures, and this will cause some difficulties both for 
rehabilitation and for people living next to the channels. Site clearance might be needed in some 
areas. A detailed survey will be done for the Resettlement Action Plan. 
Noise will increase temporarily in the vicinity of the channels to be rehabilitated. Working 
should be avoided from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. The maximum permitted noise level is given in 
Vietnamese standard TCVN 5949:1998. During the removal of sludge, which includes a lot of 
solid waste, there might be an increase in foul odours. 
Some of the channels are located in the tourist area in Bai Chay, and rehabilitation work might 
cause the some disturbance to tourists, therefore it is recommended to do the rehabilitation and 
construction work outside the tourist season. However, from the technical point of view 
construction work should be done mainly during the dry season when the amount of storm water 
and surface runoff is the smallest in the channels.  
Rehabilitation and construction of tidal gates have long-term positive impacts by increasing the 
possibility to control the flooding. There is no need of resettlement to rehabilitate and construct 
tidal gates.   
The material to be removed from channels to be rehabilitated in Hon Gai is mostly solid waste, 
which has to be transported to the landfills. In Cam Pha coal waste causes a special problem for 
the drains. The preliminary rough estimation of the total volume of sludge and excavated earth is 
about 10,700 m3, of which about 6,300 m
3
should be transported to the landfill and about 4,400 
m
3
could be used for backfilling (Table 1.2). This material should be transported to a landfill or 
other designated area agreed with the URENCO and the Constructor. If the dredged material is 
mostly coal waste it can be used as cover material.  
The excavated material is normal soil and there is no need for treatment of this excavated 
material.

Impacts during Operation 
ƒ
Wastewater Treatment Plant 
The capacity of the wastewater treatment plant in Hon Gai is about 7,000 m
3
/d and the capacity 
can be increased later to 14,000 m
3
/d. However, due to the limited sewer network in the 
beginning the actual capacity would be much lower. About the half of the population in Hon Gai 
will include to the area of wastewater treatment and the wastewater from the rest of the area is 
still discharged untreated to the sea through drains and channels. The wastewater treatment plant 
is necessary first step to treat the wastewaters in the densely populated Hon Gai area. 
In general the positive impact of the wastewater treatment is the decrease of pollution load to the 
environment and especially to the sea. Wastewater treatment plant will guarantee from its part 
that the pollution load to the sea will not at least increase due to the possible increased 
wastewater quantity.  
Wastewater treatment will have positive impact on the hygienic situation, decrease the risk of 
water related diseases, and thus improve the living conditions of the people. The decreased 
pollution load to the sea will improve the living conditions for aquatic life and therefore improve 
the fishing catches.   
The following calculations are based on the latest pollution loads used in the wastewater 
treatment plant design. The treated wastewater will be discharged into Cua Luc Bay (named also 
Bai Chay Bay or Hon Gai Bay). The concentrations of some typical pollutants according to the 
Table 6.3 Effluent Discharge for use in the Design of Hon Gai WWTP used for calculations are 
as follows: BOD 30 mg/l; TSS 30 mg/l and coliform bacteria 3,000 MPN/100ml. For calculation 
the dilution capacity of Ha Long Bay area were used four different treated wastewater flows 
namely 3,000 m
3
/day; 5,000 m
3
/day; 7,000 m
3
/day and 14,000 m
3
/day. In the beginning of the 
use of the wastewater treatment plant the wastewater flow is most probably under the nominal 
capacity of 7,000 m
3
/day.

Based on JICA study (1999), the volume of water of Cua Luc Bay and Ha Long Bay is estimated 
to be about 60 x 10
6
m
3
and 6,300 x 10
6
m
3
,
respectively. Due to the tide regime water is 
currently changing between Cua Luc Bay and Ha Long Bay. This mechanism makes the dilution 
and self-purification processes happen even quicker. It can be estimated that dilution capacity 
with the proposed load is in Cua Luc Bay 8,570:1 and in Ha Long Bay 900,000:1. 
SBR (Seqvencing Bacth Reactor) has been selected for the wastewater treatment process and the 
process has been designed to meet the Vietnamese standards TCVN 6987:2001 and TCVN 
7222:2002. The preliminary estimated loads and effluent quality using wastewater flow 7,113 
m
3
/d are presented in the table below. The input design loads are presented in Table 6.2. Effluent 
from the wastewater treatment plant will be discharged to the nearby large drainage channel, 
which discharges to the sea through the new coastal urban development area. Due to the self-
purification mechanism starting in discharge channel and continuing in the sea, the pollutants are 
easily diluted and decomposed, which further mitigates the impacts on water quality in Cua Luc 
Bay and Ha Long Bay.

The effectiveness and quality of the operation and maintenance of the wastewater treatment plant 
is the critical point. During the operation there might be odour problems, if the operation and 
maintenance is not done in the proper way and mitigation measures are neglected.  
Amount of thickened sludge will be 18 m
3
/day with the 7,000 m
3
/day treatment capacity and this 
amount could be easily transported to the existing Deo Sen landfill septage treatment facility also 
managed by Ha Long URENCO. In Deo Sen there is enough capacity to treat this amount of 
sludge. 
ƒ
Sewerage System 
Wastewater flow in open channels will decrease when wastewater is collected through the new 
interceptor sewer pipes to be constructed in Hon Gai. This will also decrease the discharge of 
untreated wastewater to the sea.  In the dry season all wastewater will be treated at the 
wastewater treatment plant. The foul odour in the vicinity of channels will decrease and the risk 
of water related health problems will also decrease due to the improved sanitation situation.   
Breakdowns in wastewater pumping might cause serious environmental risks if there are no 
spare pumps, electricity supply or enough capacity in the system. 
ƒ
Drainage System 
Nowadays both rainwater and wastewater is discharged into the combined system. Sections of 
the channels have collapsed and are blocked by solid waste and O&M is neglected, all of which 
decreases the flow. After the rehabilitation the flow will increase and there will be no stagnant 
water.  
In Bai Chay there are several outlets along the beach area, which pose a health and aesthetic 
problem. These outlets will be connected to sewer system, and dry season wastewater will be 
collected and treated. This will protect the most sensitive areas from further pollution. 
In Hon Gai the general environmental situation especially in the central market area is quite bad 
due to the inadequate solid waste management, the neglected O&M of the present drainage 
channel system and from the impacts of the coal stores. In some cases houses are constructed 
almost on the top of the channels causing some of the channels to collapse.  
Stinking drainage channels full of solid waste cause a serious health and aesthetic problem. 
Rehabilitation of drainage channels will improve the living quality and health situation, but at the 
same time there should be an improvement in the solid waste management. Very strong public 
awareness campaigns to give people information about the importance of their own contribution 
to the quality of the environment and the connection between good sanitary practices and health 
will be required. A strong O&M component has to be related to the rehabilitation of the drainage 
channels, otherwise the positive impacts will be short lasting.

mitigations measures 
-
General 
The main mitigative measures are summarised below according to measures during the design, 
rehabilitation and operation phases. The mitigative measures, which are outlined in this EIA, will 
be further developed in a separate Bidding Document Volume 5 Environmental Management 
Plan (EMP) of each contract. 
A
project’s EMP consists of mitigation, monitoring, and institutional measures to be taken 
during implementation and operation to eliminate adverse environmental and social impacts, 
offset them or reduce them to acceptable levels.  The plan also includes the actions needed to 
implement these measures. 
The EMP provides details on proposed work programme and schedules. The EMP helps to ensure 
that the proposed environmental actions are in phase with the design and construction work. After 
discussing and agreeing with the project design engineers, the recommendations will be translated 
into a simple, practical and action oriented EMP.  
The EMP identifies feasible and cost-effective measures that may reduce potentially significant 
adverse environmental impact to acceptable levels. The EMP also includes monitoring and 
reporting procedures to ensure early detection of necessary mitigation measures and the progress 
of these.  
The EMP estimates any potential environmental impact of the above-mentioned measures. 
Moreover, the EMP provides linkage with any other mitigation plans required for the project 
(e.g. involuntary resettlement). The EMP covers also the Occupational Health and Safety issues.  
Costs for all environmentally related mitigation have been developed and included in the EMP 
report. Moreover, the plan also includes compensatory measures if the proposed mitigative 
measures are not feasible or cost-effective.  
The EMP addresses institutional issues. The main focus is on how to strengthen URENCOs so 
that it not only can run the system in an environmentally sound manner, but also helps in 
building up community awareness and participation.  
For the mitigation, monitoring and capacity development the EMP provides an implementation 
schedule for the measures and the capital and recurrent cost estimates and sources of funds for 
implementing the EMP.  
Mitigation Measures during Detailed Design 
Generic Design Instructions 
Environmental matters shall be integrated in all the design work and planning of the project. The 
designing shall be done by minimising the adverse impacts on environment using as much as 
possible existing facilities and selecting the location of new facilities in areas where the 
disturbance to environment, people and existing structures is the smallest. Where possible 
existing rights-of-way should be used rather than create new ones. 
According to the Vietnamese Construction Regulation Standard Article 3.3 Protection of Natural 
Resources and Environment construction projects should: 
-
Not cause adverse effect to environment, and technical regulations on scenery and 
environment protection should be observed 
Page  48
Ha Long City & Cam Pha Town Drainage & Sanitation Project 
–
Phase II 
Environmental Impact Assessment 
35
 
Black & Veatch International
-
Protect the natural preservation areas, and historical, cultural and architectural places 
-
Extracting natural resource must ensure the rationality and cause no obstacle to the next 
exploitation 
-
Respect traditional customs, practices, religions of people living in and around the 
construction area.  
In Construction Regulation Standard there are instructions especially for master plan including 
general instructions for designing sewerage and drainage system. Urban drainage system should 
be assured: 
-
To discharge all types of urban waste water  
-
To have suitable solution for treating wastewater so that the urban area is not flooded, and 
environment and water sources are not polluted 
In Standard Branch Sewerage and Drainage System and Works, Standard Designs there are more 
detailed design instructions. However, also international design standards shall be applied and 
used in design work. 
Wastewater Treatment Plant Design Instructions 
Location of the wastewater treatment plant has been selected in co-operation with the local 
authorities paying attention to the approved master plan and the present and future land use. 
Densely populated areas have been avoided to minimise the resettlement. On the proposed 
construction site there are no cultural properties, historical places or buildings or other structures, 
which should be protected. 
Buffer zones should be designed around the wastewater treatment plant according to the 
standards TCVN 7222:2002. A 147m. wide tree-lined buffer zone is proposed in order to 
minimize resettlement and compensation costs. This meets the requirements of TCVN 
7222:2002 since the works will have closed sludge treatment.  
Until now there is very limited experience about designing and operation and maintenance of a 
similar wastewater treatment facility. Therefore the wastewater treatment method has to be 
technically easy to manage and complicated equipment should be avoided.  
Drainage and Sewerage System Design Instructions 
To prevent the possibility of contamination water supply system a special attention shall be paid 
to the crossing of water pipes and collectors and other sewers. It is not allowed to install water 
pipes going through the sewer manholes or box culverts. If possible the sewers should be 
designed in the lower level than water pipelines.    
Discharging points of the collectors shall be selected so that the dilution will be maximised. The 
discharging points shall have adequate distance from the tidal gates. However, the impact of 
busy boat traffic shall be considered, too.  
Mitigation Measures during Construction Works 
8.3 
Mitigation Measures during Construction Work 
All work included in the project has to be implemented following the appropriate standards, 
specifications and any restrictions on working methods given in the contract document. These 
conditions imposed on the contractor will include the environmental mitigation measures 
proposed in the EIA and EMP. Compliance will be monitored and supervised during 
construction by an international consultant. These measures will comprise a general framework 
Page  49

Black & Veatch International
of environmental constraints and also specific measures dependent on the particular conditions at 
each work location. 
The following table covers the main impacts and the general framework of environmental 
constraints proposed during the construction phase. 
 
Table 8.1 General Environmental Constraints during Construction

be  given to the ward representatives who will inform the residents. Loudspeakers could be 
used during the construction work to give the latest information in concerning areas.  
Most of these environmental impacts will apply to construction in all of the 22 urban locations 
for drainage improvements through new channels and the rehabilitation of streams. However, the 
degree of impact at each location will depend mainly on the extent to which residents are 
affected since they are most sensitive to impacts of noise, dust, accesses and construction 
methods. The general environmental constraints have therefore been used to formulate specific 
mitigation measures applicable to the two separate cases of residential and non- residential areas. 
 
The allocation of drainage work sites into residential (R) and non-residential (NR) conditions is 
indicated in the table below. The residential case will apply also to sewerage work locations 
which are mainly in streets and in view of the public sensitivity to the wastewater treatment plant 
we recommend that it should apply to this siten also.

-
The PMU shall announce the construction works and all arrangements in the method 
statement which are relevant to the public during construction work. The information shall 
be conveyed to the public by newspapers, TV and radio. Locally the announcement should 
be  given to the ward representatives who will inform the residents. Loudspeakers could be 
used during the construction work to give the latest information in concerning areas.  
Mitigation Measures during Operation and Maintenance 
ƒ
Wastewater Treatment Plant 
Very special attention has to be paid to the strengthening of the management system and long-
term O&M training since in practice these will be the weak points, and might put the whole 
system at risk if not arranged carefully. SBR (Sequencing batch reactor) as the treatment method 
needs trained staff to operate. If the given and agreed O&M guidelines are neglected the 
wastewater treatment plant can cause big environmental problems when all wastewater is 
discharged from one outlet instead of several and the local impact might be significant. 
Handling of sludge has to be done according to the given guidelines. If gravity thickened sludge 
will be transported to final treatment to Deo Sen septage treatment facility the transportation has 
to be done in closed tankers and only to the agreed treatment facility. Spillages have to be 
avoided during loading, transportation and unloading of sludge.  
Special attention has to be paid to occupational health and to training of workers to avoid direct 
contact with wastewater and sludge. Protective clothing including overalls, gloves and 
wellingtons has to be provided to workers. 
To mitigate the impacts of the wastewater treatment plant to the neighbouring area, mainly 
odour, there will be a 147 meter wide buffer zone with trees surrounding the wastewater 
treatment plant. 
According to the detailed land use plan (scale 1:1000) of the 112 ha urban area named Bai Muoi 
–
Cao Thang – Ha Long proposed by Quang Ninh Department of Construction and approved by 
Chairman of Ha Long City People Committee dated 28/07/2004 and by Chairman of Quang 
Ninh Province People Committee dated 12/10/2004, there is area about 17.4 ha for the 
wastewater treatment plant and the buffer zone, and some other activities belonging to this urban 
area project. To minimise the impacts of wastewater treatment plant on the urban area project, it 
is advised to have a co-operation between the Ha Long City & Cam Pha Town Drainage & 
Sanitation Project – Phase II and Bai Muoi – Cao Thang – Ha Long Urban Area Project for 
proper adjusting the land use plan. 
ƒ
Drainage and Sewerage System 
In the operation and maintenance of drainage and sewerage system has to be considered regular 
inspection of the condition of sewerage and drainage system. Solid waste disposal into drains, 
Page  54

sewers, channels and sea has to be prevented to keep the drains and sewers open. Illegal housing 
in the channel embankments has to be prevented.  
In all operation and maintenance operational and safety standards have to be followed. 
Regular monitoring of wastewater and sea water quality at discharging points has to be standard 
operating practices of URENCO and DONRE.

environmental monitoring and reporting 
Generic Environmental Monitoring during Construction and Operation 
Generic
Environmental monitoring will be done during construction in three levels; namely as 
monitoring of development of project performance indicators done by PMU; monitoring of 
implementation of mitigation measures done by the Contractor; and overall regulatory 
monitoring of the environmental issues done by DONRE. 
Project Performance Indicators
PMU is in charge of monitoring of the Project Performance Indicators. The PMU will prepare to 
the WB semi-annual report, which includes among other things reporting of the progress of the 
project also environmental project performance indicators, which are the same than in the 
Vietnam: Three Cities Sanitation Project 
–
Quang Ninh Sub-Project (Phase I Project). Project 
performance indicators are as follows: 
-
Water quality and flooding 
-
Health data 
-
Solid waste collected  
-
Tourist visits and revenues 
-
Household sanitation improvements 
Monitoring of Implementation of Mitigation Measures
Monitoring duties of the Contractor are specified in the Contract Documents and are related to 
the impacts during construction. 
Monitoring during the construction shall concentrate on safety aspects. Special attention shall be 
paid to the protection of construction sites, excavations and cleaning of the streets.  
The Contractor prepares monthly reports, which PMU compiles to quarterly reports to the WB. 
The Contractor monitors the implementation of the main mitigation measures listed below i.e. 
the quantity of dredged and transported material, number of loads, type of transportation, 
measures to keep streets clean, fencing etc. 
The quarterly reports include the following: 
-
List of priority identified in last quarterly monitoring report 
-
List of progress, which the Contractor has made to solve the problems 
-
List of issues, which have not been adequately resolved and give recommendations how to 
solve the problems and explain force majeure 
All reporting of Phase II will be done through Semi-Annual Progress Report to WB, monitoring 
of implementation of mitigation measures done by the Contractors and all other relevant type of 
reports already in use in Phase I.

Overall Regulatory Monitoring
During the operation Ha Long URENCO and Cam Pha URENCO, to whom the facilities will be 
handed over, will continue related water quality monitoring reporting to the WB. Copies of 
monitoring reports will be sent to DONRE, which performs the state environment management.  
The monitoring for the sanitation project is mainly based on the environmental standards of 
Vietnam (1995, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002). There are no specific standards for the 
contamination of soil, except the limits for maximum concentration of pesticides and fertilisers. 
Water analyses should be carried out in experienced and authorised laboratories. 
-
Present Water Quality and Wastewater Quality Monitoring 
DONRE carries out overall environmental water quality monitoring in Quang Ninh province and 
especially in the Ha Long Bay sea area (Annex 1). Vietnam: Three Cities Sanitation Project 
–
Quang Ninh Sub-Project (Phase I Project) takes wastewater samples twice per year from sewers 
No. 13 and 21 in Bay Chay, from sewer No. 11 in Hon Gai and sewer No.5 in Cam Pha. The 
parameters to be analysed are BOD
5
,
total suspended solids and coliform bacteria (Annex 3).    
-
Water and Effluent Quality Monitoring of Phase II 
From Bai Muoi wastewater treatment plant in Hon Gai would be analysed the process and 
effluent quality at the discharging point to the open channel discharging to the sea. Due to the 
several other pollution sources to the channel and especially to the sea it is not possible to 
separate the impact of effluent from the impact of other load sources, therefore no analysing 
point from Cua Luc Bay, which is recipient water body, is proposed. Wastewater treatment 
process will be analysed daily and effluent samples will be taken four times per year.

In Bai Chay there is no need to have additional sampling points because there are already now 
two sampling points for Phase I in the project area. 
In Cam Pha one sampling point would be added to Km 8 Stream and one sampling point to 
Eastern of Mechanical Enterprise Stream. Samples will be taken twice per year after the 
construction.

Overall Environmental Management 
Organisation responsible for Ha Long and Cam Pha Sanitation and Drainage Project is Ha Long 
URENCO on the behalf of Ha Long URENCO and Cam Pha URENCO according to the 
decision of QNPPC 300/QD-UB 3.2.1999. Ha Long URENCO and Cam Pha URENCO as the 
statutory providers of the sector services in Ha Long and Cam Pha will be implementing 
agencies of the Project, advised and supervised by Quang Ninh Province Peo
ple’s Committee 
Page  58

Black & Veatch International
(QNPPC) and municipal People’s Committees. For practical day-to-day work of this Project 
URENCOs have set up a Project Management Unit (PMU). 
Based on the Decision Ha Long URENCO will act as the Employer, on whose behalf PMU will 
monitor and control the contractor and suppliers and efficiency and adequacy of the work of the 
Engineer. 
PMU, Ha Long URENCO and Cam Pha URENCO shall pay attention to protection of 
environment and implement EMP during construction. PMU shall observe and follow 
resettlement rules and pay resettlement compensations on the behalf of the companies. Technical 
assistance will be used to improve management systems. 
Figure 10.1 Environmental Implementation Organisation 
 
In order to ensure compliance with national policies, strategies and regulations Ministry of 
Planning and Department (MPI), Ministry of Construction (MOC) and Ministry of Natural 
Resources and Environment (MONRE) are expected to participate in controlling the project 
implementation by sending their representatives for periodic evaluation missions. 
The local Department of Natural Resources and Environment (DONRE) is responsible for 
setting technical standards, for promotion of new environmentally sound production technologies 
and for monitoring of compliance with environmental regulations. DONRE monitors the quality 
of water in rivers and sea. 
Several city organisations e.g. City Planning Committee, Investment and Development 
Department, Construction Service, Transportation and Public Works Service, Electrical Service, 
Department of Science, Technology and Environment, Land Management Service and Water 
Supply Company have a critical role as issuers of various permits needed for the execution 
works. The post office, railway and the Army will issue the permits related to their utilities and 
participate in the field supervision of the works. PMU shall keep close relations with these 
organisations in order to avoid any delays in receiving appropriate permits.

Street excavation, dust, noise cuts in services etc. will cause nuisance to the population. PMU 
shall be responsible for ensuring that the contractors follow exactly the environmental mitigation 
measures specified in the Environmental Management Plan and in the bidding documents for 
minimising nuisances to public. PMU shall also take care of adequate public information 
concerning the project objectives and progress of the works. 
PMU and URENCOs should work closely with phuong authorities to promote community 
participation in the planning, management and operation of investments. The population shall be 
educated to understand the problems of sanitation and their role in overcoming the problems like 
regular de-sludging of septic tanks, regular cleaning and maintenance of the network, proper in-
house plumping and connection to the sewer system, and conservation of assets like manhole 
covers and lane paving. 
Into PMU has nominated one person in charge of public relations and one person in charge of 
environmental monitoring.    
-
Training 
In the Phase I there has been a very strong institutional strengthening component including 
comprehensive training programme for PMU and URENCOs. Therefore there is no need for 
environmental or other basic training in Phase II.   
During the Phase II a special attention should be paid to the training of the Bai Muoi wastewater 
treatment plant staff, to guarantee the continuous and smooth operation of the wastewater 
treatment plant. Experience from the Phase I training should be collected and if possible, the 
training of the O&M staff of Phase II wastewater treatment  plant should be organised in the 
same way than in Phase I. During the training period the similar wastewater treatment plant 
should be already in operation in Bay Chay and on-the-job training could be given there.  
The training of the Employer's staff of the facilities to be installed shall be performed by the 
Contractor during the erection, commissioning and testing of the facilities. The operation and 
maintenance (O&M) staff of the Employer shall be trained during the construction. The 
theoretical instruction in the facilities and the component operation and maintenance activities 
shall be provided by a professional trainer employed by the Contractor. 
Public awareness campaigns are discussed in Chapter 13. 
cost estimates of environmental management 
Most of the costs for mitigative measures created by environmental demands are already 
included in the investment costs of the proposed project, or they should be part of normal 
operation and maintenance procedures. The biggest separate mitigation cost is buffer zone 
around the wastewater treatment plant in Hon Gai.  
The total annual cost of Phase II environmental monitoring is 20 million VND. In the future in 
the operation and maintenance budgets of URENCOs there should be annual reservation for the 
whole environmental monitoring of both Phase I and Phase II.

public involvements and consultation 
-
General 
The World Bank’s Operational Policy (OP 4.01) on Environmental Impact Assessment requires 
that affected groups and local NGOs to be informed and consulted as a part of the EIA 
preparation during at least two stages of the EIA-process: shortly after the EA category has been 
assigned and after the draft EIA-report has been prepared. Proper consultation is a requirement 
for EIA category A projects. Participation should be enabled during project preparation under 
certain conditions and is generally recommended as part of implementation. Projects that require 
involuntary resettlement (OP 4.30), consultation on social issues should be included.  
Key principles 
The overall goals of the public consultation and disclosure are to inform all stakeholders 
(interested and project affected parties) about the important aspects of the proposed project and 
solicit their comments, ideas and concerns. Further objectives include: 
-
Commence consultations at the earliest stages of the project, in order to establish an open 
and participatory process 
-
Take care that groups being consulted are representative including representatives of 
women and youth associations, ethnic and religious minorities 
-
Enhance previously acquired knowledge of stakeholder concerns 
-
Employ culturally and socially appropriate consultation methods and provide all written 
materials and reports and orally in Vietnamese  
-
Utilise several different, complementary methods of receiving public input such as 
individual and public meetings, opinion surveys and document review 
-
Document the comments of the stakeholders 
-
Communicate information received from the stakeholders to the technical/design team 
members, and ensure that legitimate concerns are addressed appropriately 
-
File the EIA document in the communities affected by the project for public review and 
comments 
-
Continue to consult the public prior to, and during the construction, operation and 
maintenance phases of project development 
Disclosure 
The World Bank, like other donors, lenders and governments around the world, have recognised 
that many planned interventions in the past have led to undesirable impacts, often exacerbating 
economic inequalities and socio-political injustices. As such, these agencies have developed 
guidelines to ensure that meaningful consultation occurs, whereby relevant information is 
provided to the stakeholders and their inputs are encouraged. The World Bank’s guideline 
entitled Policy on Disclosure of Information
 
requires both public consultation and public 
disclosure by the project sponsors in the preparation of an environmental assessment. 
The Vietnamese version of the executive summary of draft EIA report was disclosed in all 
phuongs including to the project from August 2004. At the same time the full text of the draft 
EIA report was available at PMU office and informed to the project affected households. The 
final Vietnamese EIA report will be available at PMU office and the Vietnamese summary will 
be delivered to the ward office and put to the note board. The final EA documents will be 
disclosed in InfoShop and VDIC at the World Bank office in Hanoi.

Public Consultation Meetings 
WWTP 
The first public consultation meeting was arranged already on 
24 April 1998
 in Ha Khanh ward 
People’s Committee. However, the wastewater treatment plant for Hon Gai was not implemented 
during the Phase I of the project.  
The second public consultation meeting for the wastewater treatment plant was organised on 
3
August 2004
 and there were representatives from Ha Khanh, Hong Gai and Bach Dang wards 
from where the wastewater is collected and where the wastewater treatment plant will be located. 
There were totally eight participants. At the meeting the participants agreed the location of the 
wastewater treatment plant, but wanted to have proper mitigation measures to prevent the 
negative impacts caused by the wastewater treatment plant, e.g. buffer zone around the site. 
Resettlement and site clearance issues were also discussed.   
In addition, during the RAP public consultation meeting of 
3
December 2004, 
environmental 
issues were raised with the project affected people. There were 23 severely project affected 
people in attendance, plus representatives of the communes. The PAPs requested that appropriate 
boundaries of the buffer zone be set by the authorities around the wastewater treatment plant to 
minimise  possible adverse impacts.   
 
The minutes of these last two public consultation meetings, with lists of main participants, are 
included together in Annex 6.  
 
Sewerage and Drainage  
 
The public consultation for sewerage and drainage component in Bai Chay and Hon Gai was 
organised on 
30 November 2004
 and there were representatives from Hong Hai, Cao Thang, 
Tran Hung Dao, Yet Kieu and Bai Chay wards. There were totally nine participants. 
 
At the meeting the participants supported the sewerage and drainage construction because it will 
decrease the flooding problems and improve environmental condition. The participants noticed 
that impacts during construction are obvious and requested that construction regulations and 
mitigation measures should be strictly followed. The representatives of the wards fully agreed to 
support and co-operate with the PMU in the implementation of the project. 
 
The public consultation for drainage component in Cam Pha was organised on 
1
December 2004
 
and there were representatives from Cam Thinh, Cam Phu, Cam Son, Cam Thach and Quang 
Hanh wards. There were totally ten participants. 
 
At the meeting the participants made practical proposals for the design how to improve the 
streams in their wards. The participants fully supported the project because it will reduce the 
flooding problems in the area. The participants also proposed to speed up the construction.  
 
The minutes of these two public consultation meetings on the drainage and sewerage 
components, with lists of main participants, are presented in Annex 6.

Consultation with PAP’s 
Pr
oject Affected People (PAP’s) by the wastewater treatment plant were present at the pbulic 
consultation meeting of 3 December 2004. The minutes of the meeting in Annex 6 indicate that 
their main concerns were about odour and the need to provide an adequate buffer zone around

the treatment area. The design of the works layout therefore includes the mitigation measure of a 
147m wide tree-lined buffer zone in accordance with Vietnam standard TCVN 7222:2002. 
Unforetunately, the public consultation meetings for sewerage and drainage in 
November/December 2004 were attended only by local representatives and not by any PAP’s. 
Consultation with PAP’s was therefore carried out by distribution of a briefing note to all PAP’s 
by ward chairmen in February 2005. The briefing note was prepared by BVI and described both 
environmental impacts and the mitigation measures proposed. The note was issued in 11 wards 
in order to give PAP’s the opportunity to express their views. Issue was confirmed by letters 
from the ward chairmen to the PMU. Copies of the briefing note, lists of PAP’s and letters from 
the ward chairmen are included in Annex 6. 
Briefing notes were issued to 400 project affected households (PAH’s) as follows:

No concerns were expressed by any of the PAP’s in response this consultation by 30 April 2005 
when this report was finalised. This was confirmed by a letter from the PMU dated 6 May 2005 
which is included in Annex 6. The mitigation measures for sewerage and drainage works 
proposed by the briefing note and included in the EIA and EMP were therefore assumed to be 
adequate.

environmental education and public hygiene awareness 
programme 
In the Phase I the community participation activities have been concentrating on septic tank and 
other revolving fund related issues. According to the province level and town level decision 
community participation boards have been established. It is proposed to make evaluation of these 
community activities using participatory methodology where communities, local authorities and 
other stakeholders should participate to analyse the results and achievements. The finding of the 
evaluation should be used as background information to plan the detailed environmental 
awareness programme for communities. 
In the Phase I Ha Long City Women’s Union and Cam Pha Women’s Union organised 
environmental training and awareness campaigns in 11 phuongs in Ha Long City and 8 phuongs 
in Cam Pha to train the people to stop throwing the solid waste to drains and sewers and keep the 
streets and residential areas clean. To the awareness campaign included training of the trainers 
and meetings on the group level, which was found to be the most effective way. A brochure was 
prepared (Annex 7) and it has been delivered to 47,000 households in 16 phuongs in Ha Long 
City and 35,000 households in 11 phuongs in Cam Pha Town. There are enough brochures left 
also for the training of the groups in remaining phuongs.  
In the Phase II it is recommended to continue this group training method, which results are 
already noticed to be good and effective. Women’s Unions would be the correct facilitators, 
because they have already experience from the Phase I to run the training on group level. 
Actually Women’s Unions have already made proposal to continue the training. Community 
participation and environmental training of Phase I already covers the central areas of the project 
area and therefore it is recommended to have environmental awareness campaign in those areas 
which have not got any training until now. 
In Ha Long City the proposed phuongs are: Ha Lam, Gieng Day, Ha Trung, Ha Tu and Ha 
Phong including to the revolving fund, but not received environmental training until now, and 
Hung Thang, Tuan Chau, Dai Yen and Viet Hung not including to the revolving fund. 
In Cam Pha town the proposed phuongs are: Cam Thinh, Cam Son and Cam Phu including to the 
revolving fund, not received environmental training until now, and Cua Ong, Mong Duong, Cam 
Hai, Cong Hoa and Duong Huy not including to the revolving fund.  
The training would include two days training for the trainers, quarter leaders and representatives 
of WU in phuongs, and after that these trainers organise training of each group separately to have 
sustainable solutions and people would have good opportunities to discuss and solve the 
environmental problems of their own living area.

EIA for Proposed Drainage and Sewerage System  
December 1998 Revised 
 
Impacts According to Water Quality Model 
The impacts of the proposed wastewater treatment plants have been calculated by using the 
Water Quality Model in the Ha Long Bay Environmental Pollution Study (February 1998). In 
the final report the scenario was made for year the 2000 with and without wastewater 
treatment.  
In that study the dilution capacity of Ha Long Bay is determined by its ability to disperse 
pollutants. The mechanism for dispersing pollutants consists of dilution and flushing, which is 
provided largely by the tidal water movement. The river runoff entering Cua Luc estuary 
(Hong Gai Bay) also contributes to the dilution capacity of the bay, but its contribution is 
small in relation to the tidal exchange with Ha Long Bay. Dilution capacity is defined by 
pollutant concentrations below the Vietnam national water quality standards or other 
appropriate standard.  
The dilution capacity depends on: 
-
The type of pollutant; 
-
The location in the study area (Ha Long Bay and Cua Luc estuary); 
-
The level of treatment applied to the pollutant; 
-
The methods of disposal whether close to shore or through a marine outfall. 
The primary pollutants considered here are: 
1.  BOD, biochemical oxygen demand, which affects the dissolved oxygen (DO) content in 
the receiving water. DO is mainly related to marine ecosystem health and to the ability of the 
receiving water to oxidise other contaminants e.g. ammonium nitrogen; 
2.  Coliform bacteria, which is an indicator  of safe water conditions for public health, both 
for recreation and edible shellfish; 
3.  TSS, total suspended solids, derived from land-based contaminant discharges, with storm 
water runoff being the main source near the urban areas. The impacts from suspended solids 
are related particularly to the coral reefs and aesthetics as reflected in water clarity. The latter 
is related mainly to tourist activities and the perception of polluted water from low visibility. 
Dilution capacity has been investigated for BOD/DO, TSS and coliform bacteria using the 
C2DTD model and the pollution loads with five scenarios. The statistical summaries for the 
2000 scenario were viewed using the Seainfo software.  
The original five sites for presentation of the scenarios were as follows:  
-
Hon Gai, central market area, South shore of Hon Gai 
-
Hon Gai east, eastern South shore of Hon Gai, one of the options for a long-
term WWTP;  
-
the narrowest point in Cua Luc strait at the entrance to Cua Luc estuary, close 
to the originally proposed WWTP site (January 1998);  
-
the central Bai Chay coast immediately offshore of the central tourist hotel 
and swimming district (where the new package plant will discharge effluent);  
Page  76

Black & Veatch International 
-
Cai Lan, the future site for major port facilities, located inside Hon Gai Bay, 
can be used as a reference for the proposed WWTP sites for both Bai Chay and Hon Gai.   
According to the Final Report of the Ha Long Bay Environmental Pollution Study the key 
findings from the scenario results are: 
-
DO level is generally not a problem, and BOD is well assimilated now.  
-
Coliform bacteria is a potential problem now and in the future. The benefits from the 
proposed treatment options are large and treatment appears effective in reducing coliform 
levels in the receiving waters near shore. The benefit is significant for Bai Chay in both the 
short-term and long-term options. 
-
TSS from upland runoff dominates conditions in Cua Luc, but may not be the main 
source of low transparency in Halong Bay.

Several conclusions have been reached based on the model outputs and the scenario 
simulations: 
-
The water quality model is an effective tool to relate land-based sources of pollutant loads 
to receiving water quality conditions. The hydrodynamic model is accurate, and the software 
system has proved to be easy to use. 
-
The model provides a good understanding of the dilution and flushing processes. 
-
The results show that the dilution capacity of Ha Long Bay is large, which is expected 
because of its connection with the Gulf of Tonkin. On the other hand, the dilution capacity of 
Cua Luc estuary (Hong Gai Bay) is limited and is related in a large measure to the area of the 
estuary. If the bay is reduced in size by reclamation, the dilution capacity will be also reduced. 
-
Pollutant concentrations are the highest close to shore, and decrease rapidly out from the 
shore. Concentrations are reduced to below background in Ha Long Bay. Generally pollution 
impacts are confined to within 1-2 km of the shore, and problem areas tend to be localised 
around discharge points. For this reason, pollution loads can be reduced through treatment and 
will result in improved water quality in the bay.

2.  Cai Lan new port nearby Ship Building Enterprise; 
3.  North Sato island nearby Deo Sen cemetery; 
4.  1 km far from Hon Gai Km 5 sea shore. 
Pollution loads were calculated for dry season, and winter 1997 was used as baseline scenario. 
The model was to be run for BOD/DO and coliform bacteria.  The results were inconclusive 
and the printed input data appeared not to reflect the scenario requested.   The impact of other 
load sources was so large that the impact of the proposed wastewater treatment plants did not 
show in the results though in the previous presentation in Ha Long Bay Environmental 
Pollution Study the impact was clear. 
Comparing the baseline condition in 1997 with the 2008 scenario it can be noticed that the 
number of bacteria in the shoreline will decrease. However, the number of bacteria is still 
over the limit of 1000 MPN/100 ml according to the Vietnamese standard (TCVN 5943-1995) 
for acceptable levels of pollutants in coastal waters for bathing and recreation areas.  
It can be estimated that if the collection and treatment of wastewater is done in the proper way 
there will be an improvement in the aquatic environmental quality. According to the pollution 
load model based on the WHO Rapid Methodology the impacts of treated effluent are minor.

Setting Sub-catchments 
The catchment of the bays was divided into 14 sub-catchments for estimation of pollution 
loads, except for Cat Ba island and other islands. The sub-catchments having main rivers (No. 
1, 4 to 6, and 14) located in the northern part of the catchment from the east to the west. The 
others (No. 2, 3, 8 to 13) are located in along the coast line of the bays, these gradient varies 
from 12 to 20 %. 
The land use pattern of each sub-catchment was analyzed by satellite image analysis. The 
amount of freshwater flowing into the bays from each sub-catchment was estimated based on 
the hydrological data and analyzed land use pattern. The estimated total freshwater inflow is 
about 980 million m3/year, 82 % of which is discharged from the main rivers (Mip, Troi, 
Man, Dien Vong, Mong rivers). 
-
Specific and Non-specific Pollution Sources 
Database  
An inventory of pollution sources was taken to develop a database. The various data 
especially on the land-based specific pollution sources in the study area were collected by 
conducting questionnaire survey by the JICA study team in 1998. The established database 
was provided to DOSTE by the JICA study team. It is recommended that database should be 
updated in appropriate timing to provide users latest data and information, to accumulate data, 
and to analyze time series changes of data. Pollution source inventory data should be updated 
as soon as possible when new factory or any change of existing factory concerned as a 
pollution source is registered of informed. 
Pollution Sources   
For pollution load estimation, specific pollution sources in the study area are largely classified 
into three groups, namely, domestic wastewater including tourism, industrial wastewater 
including coal mining activities, and livestock wastewater based on the types and/or activities. 
While normally non-specific pollution sources are classified into two groups, land runoff and 
precipitation. Land runoff in the study area consists of pollution loads from forest, agricultural 
area, bare areas including denuded area by coal mining and urban areas. 
 
-
Runoff Pollution Load to the Bays 
The pollution loads flowing into the bays are calculated based on the generated pollution 
loads and runoff ratios. Domestic and livestock pollution loads are estimated by each 
population and pollution load units. Pollution loads from industries are estimated by volume 
of wastewater data obtained by the questionnaire survey for inventory and the Field Survey, 
and a typical water quality of each type of factory in Vietnam and Japan. 
Runoff ratio depends on land use, type of pollution sources, distance between location of 
sources and the bays, and intensity of rainfall. In order to obtain the runoff ratios in the rivers, 
Page  79

Black & Veatch International 
calibration is to be considered between water quality taken by the Field Survey and estimated 
runoff pollution loads. The pollution loads generated in the sub-catchments locating along the 
coastline, flow into the bays directly or via streams with relatively high runoff ratio. 
A
runoff pollution load is estimated by means of parameters such as runoff ratio and pollution 
load units which are set based on the result of the Field Survey. The pollution loads of BOD, 
COD, SS, T-N and T-P flowing into the bays are estimated as shown below.

mass balance of pollutants in the bays 
Material circulation and balance in the bays should be taken into consideration for the 
analysis of organic pollution mechanism in the bays. For the analysis of mass balance of 
pollutants in the bays, four representative calculation areas were set, namely, Bai Chay bay, 
Bai Chay and Hong Gai, Cam Pha and Cua Ong, and Ha Long bay and Bi Tu Long bay. The 
box mixing method was used for calculation. This method is that once pollution loads poured 
in each area, the water and pollutants are mixed one tidal period (assumed 24 hours), and 
pollutants are conveyed to the outsides with same water volume as inflow. In order to 
simplify the calculation, exchange of water between outside of each area was not considered. 
BOD was used as an indicator of pollutants. 
Primary production, decomposition, settlement, and elution are key components for 
clarification of organic pollution mechanism in the bays. These parameters are used to carry 
out the material balance calculation as well as to establish water quality simulation model in 
the bays. In order to obtain the values of these pollution mechanism parameters of the bays, 
the JICA study team implemented tests 
in situ
 and laboratory.  
The results of calculation for the present condition (1996) are shown below. Standing stock in 
the table means BOD left in each line. The results of this mass balance analysis indicate that 
the organic pollutant represented by BOD is mainly brought by the primary production.

water pollution mechanism of the bays 
-
General Conditions of Water Quality in the Study Area 
The results of the Field Survey indicate that the bays’ water, on the whole, had mesotrophic or 
slightly eutrophic conditions and little deterioration. However, the water and sediment quality 
inshore along Ha Long city and Cam Pha – Cua Ong areas was comparatively influenced by 
land-based effluent discharges. It is obvious that run-off pollution loads from the catchment 
were limited to the inshore areas, mainly close to untreated effluent discharge points. The 
only pollution variable that appears to influence offshore areas was oil, due to the presence of 
shipping activities throughout the bays. 
SS and iron (Fe) were only problematic variables in some rivers. The rivers experience high 
SS loads of more than 1,000 mg/l, which is likely a result of erosion from past and present 
denuded areas by urbanization, coal mining, and agricultural activities. The relatively higher 
Fe levels, for example more than 20 mg/l, in some tributaries are likely caused by mine waste 
in concert with low pH of 2 – 4. 
The concentrations of heavy metals in water and sediment of the bays were lower than the 
coastal water quality standards in Vietnam or international standards. The almost uniform 
distribution of zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) concentrations throughout the bay sediment 
suggests that their concentrations are considered to be natural. 
-
Water Quality Distribution in the Bays 
Rainy Season 
As observed in the Field survey in July 1998, land-based fresh water together with pollutants 
is stagnated inshore from the Cua Luc strait to Ha Long bay. Besides, the water in the bays is 
stratified wedge-wise by land-based fresh water and is intruded offshore water which shows 
relatively higher values of COD, SS, and nutrients than those in the center of the Ha Long 
bay. 
Observed water quality distribution in the rainy season is consistent with this water mass 
structure. Namely, relatively higher values of pollutants are observed inshore and offshore 
(COD: 8 – 11 mg/l), while lower values in the center of Ha Long bay (COD: 5 -6 mg/l). Some 
parameters such as SS are the highest (about 7 mg/l, except for the areas influenced by stirred 
up bottom sediment) at the front of the salt wedge, so called null point, where run-off 
pollutants tend to be settled. 
Dry Season 
Observed water quality distribution in the dry season was a little different from that in the 
rainy season. Salinity in the dry season was higher than in the rainy season due to the little 
precipitation. Stratified water in the rainy season disappears in the dry season, so that offshore 
water intruded into the inner part of bays. Accordingly, little differences of the water quality 
such as transparency were observed throughout the bays in the dry season. 
-
Water Quality in the Rainy and Dry Seasons 
The observed bays’ water quality parameters of BOD, COD, and SS were around twice as 
high in the rainy season than the dry season. One possibility is that land based pollution loads 
into the bays in the rainy season are higher than in the dry season. This is mainly due to a high 
percentage of the pollutants washed out to the bays by the higher rainfall. 
Page  81
Ha Long City & Cam Pha Town Drainage & Sanitation Project 
–
Phase II 
Environmental Impact Assessment - Annexes 
Black & Veatch International 
Another possibility is an effect of primary production. Chlorofyll-a values are around twice as 
high in the rainy season than in the dry season. This means that photosynthetic rate, namely 
generated organic matters by a primary production, in the rainy season is higher than in the 
dry season. This relatively active primary production in the rainy season is caused by the 
higher land based nutrients washed out by the precipitation, light intensity, and water 
temperature compared with the dry season. 
simulation model development 
-
Structure of the Model 
The objective of developing a numerical simulation model is to estimate changes in key water 
quality parameters for the different environmental scenarios derived from the socio-economic 
frame. The model was first developed for the current conditions based on the data obtained by 
the Field Survey and the existing data for its validation. The model simulated three processes: 
hydrodynamics, diffusion, and nutrient cycling in the study area. 
The hydrodynamic model was run to provide hydrodynamic conditions to be used in the water 
quality modelling. The period of the run was chosen to correspond to the Field Survey period. 
Four major tidal constituents were used as tidal forces rather than the single dominating 
constituent because of the large range of the amplitudes for tidal current velocities depending 
on the time. 
Pollutant variables of the different model were SS, and it was simply treated as a single 
variable. The diffusion model was run based on the results of the hydrodynamic model. The 
nutrient cycling model was also run based on the results of the hydrodynamic model. 
Pollutant variables addressed by the model were COD, inorganic nitrogen (I-N), organic 
nitrogen (O-N), inorganic phosphorus (I-P), organic phosphorus (O-P), and DO. 
-
Validation of the Simulation Model 
To validate results of the models, the simulated results were compared to the measured data 
obtained by the Field Survey. 
The tidal current ellipses extracted from the simulated results were compared to the measured 
data for the validation of the tidal components of the simulated currents. The simulated results 
rather met with the measured data. The averaged velocities of the simulated results were also 
compared to the averaged velocities of the measured data. The simulated results roughly met 
with the data. 
The simulated results of the diffusion model and the nutrient cycling model were compared to 
the measured data. The Field Survey data of SS, COD, T-N, and T-P decreased from the load 
points to offshore and then increased toward the south and southeast. The simulated results 
showed such trend. 
On these grounds, it is concluded that the development numerical simulation model can be 
used for the projection of future water quality in the bays.

Purpose 
The purpose of the meeting was two fold: (i) to brief the PAH’s on the proposed works and to 
explain the environmental and resettlement impacts to the local community; and (ii) to discuss 
and record the views of the affected community to enable suitable mitigation measures to be 
introduced during the design and construction phases.       
 
Presentations  
Mr. Son, Chairman of Ha Khanh WPC, introduced the participants of the meeting. 
 
Mr. Pha explained the background of the project on resettlement and environmental issues. He 
explained current Quang Ninh Province policy on resettlement and compensation, referring to 
current experience on Phase I. This was followed by reference to environmental issues and 
likely mitigation measures, again with reference to measures adopted for the current Phase I 
project works.

Mr. Kien started by describing the technical aspects of the planned wastewater treatment 
plant: process design, the number and type of treatment units to be constructed on the site. He 
then went on to talk about environmental aspects, explaining how a buffer zone around the 
site had been established in full conformance with Vietnamese regulations, quoting TCVN 
7222:2002, the relevant standard for domestic waste treatment. Mr Kien explained that the 
buffer zone had been minimized by providing off-site sludge treatment and incorporating 
trees as screening around the perimeter of the treatment plant site.  
 
Mrs Lan then explained her role as specialist for consultant BVI producing a Resettlement 
Action Plan (RAP), as required by Quang Ninh Province and the funding agency, the World 
Bank. There would be houses to be resettled resulting from both the 7 ha treatment plant site 
itself, and the effect of the buffer zone required by Vietnamese regulations. Her aim was 
firstly to explain the rights of the project affected peoples (PAP’s) with regard to current 
government regulations on resettlement, particularly the compensation aspect and likely 
resettlement site. She then wanted to hear the view of the affected peoples: their questions; 
their priorities; their needs; their concerns; and any suggestions they may have on minimizing 
negative impacts. These views would be incorporated into her Resettlement Action Plan.      
General Discussion 
Despite the resettlement and environmental impacts described to them, nearly all the PAP’s 
present (22 out of 23), expressed their general support for the project and respected the Quang 
Ninh Province selection of Ha Khanh as the site for the WWTP. Subject to satisfactory 
clarification of queries raised on environmental and resettlement issues (see below) the 
affected residents of Ha Khanh agreed to comply with resettlement orders. 
 
Mr. Pham Huy Viem, Head of Hamlet 2 made some general comments which are shown on 
the attached annex. 
 
Environmental Issues 
 
Having been informed of the environmental impacts and mitigation action plans for WWTP 
construction and operation, the PAP’s main concern was that the buffer zone boundary be 
carefully determined by those concerned – Quang Ninh Province officials and their 
consultants. What they wanted avoided is a situation that has arisen in connection with the 
Deo Sen landfill site and Deo Sen cemetery, where [reportedly] inappropriate buffer zones 
have resulted in environmental nuisance to local residents not relocated under the respective 
resettlement schemes.  
 
In view of these previous problems, the PAP’s present at the meeting implored the Quang 
Ninh PMU and their consultants to do their utmost to minimise the negative environmental 
impacts of this new initiative.   
 
Resettlement Issues 
 
The PAP’s asked for full clarification on the compensation and resettlement policy to be 
adopted. They wanted to know what compensation they will get and where they were likely to 
be resettled, and when. Mr Pha answered that the proposed resettlement site was Cao Xanh. 
He then went on to enlarge upon earlier discussion by detailing for the PAP’s the current 
policy on resettlement of Quang Ninh Province, enlarging on the standard procedures for 
public information and consultation and on compensation.

The PAP’s asked to be allowed to make their own decisions on resettlement options, with 
adequate time. For the consultant Ms Lan advised that the consultation process would be 
continued throughout the RAPs implementation. The residents were assured that inventory 
data collected now from each PAH for the purpose of establishing losses will be updated as 
necessary during the implementation stage. 
 
The PAP’s concurred that the affected residents fall into two categories. In the first category 
of those more willing to be resettled are those who are poorer or those who are currently being 
impacted by the Deo Sen landfill and cemetery interventions (mainly people of Hamlet’s 2 
&3).  In the second category of those less willing to be resettled are the wealthier residents 
who possess land.   
 
Of large concern to the PAP’s is the loss of agricultural land that will arise. Because land use 
provides an important source of income for many PAPs, unemployment will result. In answer 
to this cocern Ms Lan described the rehabilitation assistance policy of the project. 
 
Conclusions 
Mr. Son Chairman of the WPC, summarized the meeting’s result by confirming overall 
community support for the project. He asked the affected people to maintain their life styles 
as they currently are until the RAP has been formally approved by the World Bank and the 
required land acquisitions have been made. Finally, the Chairman requested that the PMU 
ensure that the transition period be made as short as possible to minimize any negative 
environmental and resettlement impacts on the local ward people.  
 
The minutes are accepted and signed by all parties.  
 
The meeting finished at 4.30 PM on the same day.

ANNEX TO PUBLIC CONSULTATION MEETING OF 3

 DECEMBER 2004 
 
Comments of Hamlet 2 Representative 
–
Mr Pham Huy Viem 
 
1.  Every project has a goal of serving people. Nevertheless, because the proposed 
WWTP site on this project is to be adjacent to a resident area, I consider it potentially 
unfeasible. I suggest that the WWTP site be moved to the area of the old Thanh Cong 
Coal Mine in Group 17, Area II. 
 
2.  I think the the Government should produce an action plan of resettlement for the local 
residents. The residents should be informed in advance prior to project start of the 
location(s) they will be resettled (km from present site).  
 
3.  I want to know to what extent the odour from the treatment plant will affect local 
residents [outside the buffer zone] in the hot season. 
 
4.  Most of the local residents earn their living in various ways like fishery, vegetable 
growing and farming in general. After their land is acquired, I want to know how these 
people will make a living and who will be responsible. I need a specific answer.  
 
5. 
Finally, I would like to know if this project has been approved by the People’s Council 
of all three levels.
