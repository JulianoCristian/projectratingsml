F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
(a) sustained improvements to public health, and (b) incr eased economic development,
by reducing the incidence of flooding; upgrading the urban environment; and developing
more efficient and financially sustainable sanitation and drainage companies (SDCOs) in
Danang, Haiphong and Quang Ninh Province (Halong City and Cam Pha).

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
No revisions to the PDO were made.

Comments        These diseases have been on the decline since 2002. More sanitary environment
(incl. %        created by project interventions played a role. The extent of this role cannot be
achievement) determined precisely because many external factors influenced the outcome.

Indicator 2 :   Increase in the number of tourist nights and annual income arising from tourism
                in Danang, Halong and Haiphong (visitors/VND billion).

Comments        Increased by 69% in DN and 113% in Halong and by 100% in HP. Revenue
(incl. %        increased by similar margins. The cleaner environment certainly made the
achievement)    project cities more attractive for tourists but many external factors impacted
                tourism trends.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1       Context at Appraisal

1.1.1     Country Background: Vietnam's urban population increased rapidly during the 1990s.
The Doi Moi (renovation) program of 1987 sparked a decade of growth and the ensuing rapid
urbanization caused pressure on inadequate sanitation, drainage, sewerage and water supply
services. Environmentally sensitive areas were threatened by industrialization and urbanization.
At the time of appraisal, these pressures were expected to increase as Vietnam's percentage of
urban residents, representing about 20% of the population, was still lower than developing
nations' standards. This reflected earlier government policies that had favored rural areas and led
to low urban growth rates from 1975 until the beginning of Doi Moi. The prospect of continued
rapid urbanization called for higher investment in water supply and sanitation. Private sector
participation in infrastructure was low and urban managerial capacity needed strengthening in
order for urban infrastructure provision to become more efficient.

1.1.2     Government Strategy: The Government's sanitation sector strategy was developed with
assistance from UNDP/World Bank in 1990 and the updated with support from the Finnish
Government in 1995/96. The strategy diagnosed under-investment in sanitation works, low
coverage and lack of wastewater treatment facilities, as well as excessive subsidies of sanitation
recurrent costs and an ineffective administrative structure. In response the sector strategy sought
to: (i) rehabilitate existing networks and facilities; (ii) develop policies and institutions to promote
a more market oriented system; (iii) develop, through public education, a better awareness of the
importance of more effective sanitation services; and (iv) gradually phase out subsides and
replace them with user charges. The strategy included measures to decentralize septage and solid
waste collection to the local level, commercialize public utilities and encourage greater cost
recovery by the Urban Environmental Companies (URENCOS) and Sewerage and Drainage
Companies (SADCOs).

1.1.3     Rational for Bank Involvement: The project supported the World Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS: 2001-2006) to raise productivity through urban infrastructure by
making the project cities more competitive, improving their "livability" and enhancing their
"bankability."2 It also supported the reform of state owned enterprises by requiring the agencies
responsible for sanitation and drainage to recover a greater proportion of their costs and to
increase private sector participation. The project supported the Government's sectoral policies of
decentralization, increased private sector participation, and movement towards commercialization
of the SADCOs and URENCOs by introducing user charges and strengthened management. The
project was the first Bank financed sanitation project in Vietnam and one of the earliest projects
to invest in the urban sector, and to be implemented at the sub-national level. It was also one of
the first projects to comprehensively address environmental sanitation issues for urban cities and
introduce commercial practices in the urban sanitation companies.




2In Vietnam water supply is a provincial government responsibility. Each province has a public sector sewage and
drainage company. In Danang and Quang Ninh they are known as URENCOs. In Haiphong the service provider is
known as SADCO. Haiphong and Danang are cities with provincial status. Quang Ninh is a province in which the
project supported the two main cities: Halong and Cam Pha. Haiphong, Danang and Quang Ninh are referred to
collectively as "the cities" throughout the ICR.

1.2      Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The project development objectives were: (a) sustained improvements to public health; and (b)
increased economic development, by reducing the incidence of flooding; upgrading the urban
environment; and developing more efficient and financially sustainable sanitation and drainage
companies (SADCOs) in Danang, Haiphong, and Quang Ninh Province (Halong City and Cam
Pha).


1.2.1 The approved indicators for measuring the PDO were:-
          Reduction in the incidence of water related and vector borne diseases ­ annual cases
             treated and deaths from diarrhea, dysentery, cholera, typhoid, and malaria in phuongs
             (wards) covered by the project; and
          Increase in the number of tourist nights and annual income from tourism in Quang
             Ninh (Halong City) and Danang

1.2.2    Outcome indicators measured solid waste management, flooding duration, loans lent for
sanitation improvement, cost recovery of sanitation companies, the impact of sewerage on water
quality, and private sector participation in the sanitation companies. (see Section F, Result
Framework Analysis, for details.)

1.3       Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
The Project Development Objective w as not changed. However, the task tea m realized that the
number of residents benefitting from project interventions was a key measure of project impact.
Therefore, data on beneficiaries w as added as one of the ke y "im plicit" i ndicators used to
evaluate project progress.

1.4       Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1    The project helped generate public benefits to the cities' economies and private benefits
to individual households in some specific areas. The public benefits included reduction in the
incidence of waterborne diseases and increased production due to reduced flooding and the
avoidance of flood damage. Reduced flood damage to roads and other infrastructure services has
resulted in lower economic opportunity costs, maintenance and rehabilitation costs. The improved
city environments and reduced pollution has also benefited the important tourist industry in
Quang Ninh (Halong City) and Danang. Sanitation improvements are more likely to be
sustainable because the URENCO/SADCOs capacity to operate and maintain the facilities has
been improved.

1.4.2    The project enabled 1.7 million people in Danang, Haiphong, and Quang Ninh to benefit
from reliable drainage, sewage treatment, solid waste management and on-plot sanitation. At
appraisal, the number of beneficiaries was estimated at 1.3 million and the substantial increase in
number of residents who actually benefited from the project is largely a result of the expansion of
the project to additional areas, using savings achieved in the first round of contracting. Because
sanitation improvements were implemented on a city-wide scale, most project components did
not target specific socio-economic groups. However, the revolving fund and community
mobilization programs focused on lower income households who lacked adequate sanitation
facilities.

1.5     Original Components ($ 119.53mn approved/ $ 119.17 mn actual)
The project had five components with similar subprojects in Danang City, Haiphong City and
Quang Ninh Province (Halong City and Cam Pha Town) as follows:-

Component 1: Drainage ($44.31 mn/$58.32 mn)
In areas where regular flooding occurred, existing drains were rehabilitated and new drains were
constructed.

Component 2 Sewerage and Sewage Treatment ($32.56 mn/$27.96 mn)
The component improved the urban environment and reduced pollution by intercepting and
treating sewage flows.

Component 3: Solid Waste Management ($23.06 mn/$8.01 mn) (Danang and Quang Ninh)
The project improved the collection and safe final disposal of solid waste through investment in
trucks, other equipment, environmental service centers and sanitary landfills. In Haiphong solid
waste was improved through assistance from the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation.
The funds for this component were less than at appraisal due to lower than expected bid prices
and the decision to pay for large works in Quang Ninh from the DANIDA trust fund.

Component 4: Institutional Development and Construction Management ($16.6 mn/$21.77 mn)
This component improved the management and efficiency of the SDCOs and URENCOs.
Technical assistance and training helped the cities establish technically and financially viable
service companies. The project also provided technical assistance to the cities for construction
management. FINNIDA, DANIDA and AUSAID provided assistance to Haiphong, Quang Ninh
and Danang respectively.

Component 5: Revolving Funds for Household Sanitation Facilities ($3 mn/$3.10 mn)
Revolving funds in each city assisted low income households to construct or improve septic tanks,
basic toilet hardware, and sewerage connections. The component was planned and implemented
in a participatory manner and included a sanitation and environmental education campaign to
inform the community of the linkages between health, environmental conditions, and sanitation.
Eligible households received loans of up to VND 2,000,000 (USD150) to fund sanitation
improvement. The revolving funds are still in operation under Government management.


1.6      Revised Components
There were no revisions of any project components, except for the scaling up of the civil works as
explained in Section 1.7 below.

1.7     Other Significant Changes

1.7.1   DCA Amendment: The DCA was amended in February 2006 to use savings of
USD$27.4 million which had accrued due to cost savings from competitive bidding and the
appreciation of the SDR. The savings were used to expand the scale of the investments in a
second phase of the project (considered as Phase II in participating cities). The largest additional
works included: i) in Quang Ninh: expanded drains in Halong City, Cam Pha Town and
construction of Ha Khanh new wastewater treatment plant in Hon Gai area, a densely populated
administrative area of Ha Long City; ii) in Danang: more drainage and interceptor sewers; and iii)
in Haiphong: construction/ rehabilitation of Phuong Luu Lake (22ha), Cat Bi Lake (3ha), more
drainage and interceptor sewers. The cancelation of a part of the savings was done at the request
of the Borrower.

1.7.2   Nine (9) Years Implementation: The DCA was amended twice to extend the closing
dates. The original closing date was June 30, 2005 and the first extension of two years (until June
30, 2007) was granted to allow for the completion of additional works funded by the Credit
savings in all 3 cities. The second extension of one year (until June 30, 2008) was approved only
for Quang Ninh Sub-project so that the construction of Ha Khanh new WWTP could be
completed and operated. This plant is very important in improving environmental protection for
the World Heritage Halong Bay.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1   Soundness of background analysis: The background analysis adequately addressed the
conditions in Vietnam at the time of appraisal and incorporated lessons learned from relevant
Vietnam projects. The rationale for the Bank's intervention was based on projected growth in
urban areas, and increasing pressure on urban environmental infrastructure. This analysis was
sound and project interventions to improve the urban environment have proved timely and
relevant. Decisions to adopt a relatively straightforward project design, choose project cities
experienced with implementing World Bank projects and carefully select the type of bidding
documents showed a prudent attention to lessons learned from previous Bank projects. The
financial analysis correctly demonstrated the need for tariffs to increase in order to cover O&M
costs.

2.1.2   Adequacy of project design: The design of the project was inadequate in terms of
specifying PDOs and the PDO indicators. The direct impact of the project on the increase in
tourism and reduction in the incidence of water-born disease was difficult to measure and they
were impacted by circumstances outside of the control of the project. Improvements in these
indicators cannot be solely attributed to project interventions. The intermediate outcome
indicators which quantified solid waste removal, flooding reduction, funds lent for household
sanitation, cost recovery, water pollution and private sector participation, were appropriate and
adequately captured the improvements in the urban environment that were the focus of the project
as well as aspects of the project (such as cost recovery) that were less successful. Had the task
team included more expertise in M&E, the team would like have chosen a lower level of
development indicators. For example, development indicators focused on the number of
households benefitting from the different components of the project would have both
demonstrated the project's effectiveness and been relatively simple to monitor. In addition, a
simpler indicator structure would have enabled the PMUs to focus more attention on the quality

                                                   4

of the data. This design flaw is partially due to less Bank focus on M&E at the time of appraisal.
The TT did consider amending the DCA at the mid-term review to rectify this flaw, but
concluded that scarce supervision resources were better spent on more urgent operational matters.

2.1.3    The project design adequately incorporated lessons learned from other Vietnam projects.
First, the project design was kept simple to avoid overwhelming a relatively new borrower. The
five components of the project covered the basic set of core urban services and were implemented
in a coordinated and integrated manner. Second, the project was confined to cities which had
been beneficiaries of the World Bank water supply project in an attempt to capitalize on the
experience of the implementing agencies and deepen the environmental management capacity of
these cities. Third, the project acknowledged the need for appropriate bidding documents and
adopted small separate goods and works contracts with which the implementing agencies were
familiar. This approach led to improvements in the procurement process, although issues did arise
because of differences between the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) and
government's standard contracts. Fourth, the move to decentralize approvals to the lowest level
was consistent with Vietnam policy direction. Decentralization has been a slow process and the
government approval procedures continued to be a challenge under the project, although the
situation improved during the later years of the project. Despite the difficulties encountered, a
different approach would have run counter to Government policy and would have caused greater
problems.

2.1.4    Adequacy of government's commitment: The Government demonstrated a strong
commitment to the project through the timely provision of counterpart funds, the establishment of
capable PMUs and willingness to issue legislation to move towards cost recovery. At the local
and community level, public participation was a key feature of the project design process. The
Women's Union's role in managing the revolving fund component, and the participatory manner
in which that component was designed and implemented, are particularly good example of
clients' commitment to the project

2.1.5 Assessment of Risks: Risks relating to cost recovery and procurement were adequately
identified during preparation and specific measures were taken to mitigate them. The most
substantial risks identified relate to achieving adequate cost recovery. The main risk was the local
government's failure to implement agreed tariff increases in a timely manner. Consumers'
possible refusal to pay for services was an associated risk. The risks were mitigated by relating
charges to affordability, phasing in increases in tariffs over time, and raising community
awareness about the benefits of improved sanitation. A second major risk was the possibility that
procurement process, with its complicated approval procedures, could delay project
implementation. To mitigate this risk, the project adopted a number of methods including smaller
simpler contracts, raising the problem of delays in annual portfolio performance discussions,
supervising procurement more intensely in the earlier stages of the project, and organizing
procurement workshops.

Overall, quality at entry is rated as "moderately satisfactory".


2.2 Implementation

2.2.1    The project design and institutional structure were important factors leading to
satisfactory outcomes. The chosen components covered the core urban services and to generate
positive impact on the urban environment. The PMUs had adequate administrative, financial and
technical capacity and additional staff was recruited as needed. Project physical targets were
mostly met or exceeded, the quality of construction was good and the project benefitted 400,000
                                                   5

more households than anticipated at appraisal. All project cities gained experience in
implementing Bank financed projects. Government counterpart funds were provided in a timely
manner. At the mid-term review, the Bank team demonstrated responsiveness toward the
borrower's priorities and was proactive in addressing problems. Unused funds from the first
round of bidding were reallocated to a Phase II project.

2.2.2    Difficulties in implementation and the long implementation period were due to delays
from the Phase 2 Project, challenges of decentralization, commercialization and rapid
urbanization. The large scale of the works constructed under Phase 2 required a new round of
planning, design and construction. The delay was compounded by high inflation in Quang Ninh
in late 2007 and 2008. Delays created by protracted approval procedures are common in
infrastructure investment in Vietnam. Decentralization to provincial level was not always
accompanied by the necessary approval authority which further delayed approving project
designs, processing contracts and making payments to contractors. Rapid urban growth led to
changing conditions in the project cities and design changes became unavoidable. All major
design changes required new government approval and some of the changes required new site
acquisition, always a lengthy process. Despite these challenges it is notable that in the later stages
of the project the time required for bid processing was significantly reduced. Another
implementation difficulty was the continuing inability of the URENCOs to recover costs for
wastewater and solid waste collection. The task team addressed the problem at the midterm
review by requesting the PPCs to increase charges to the levels agreed at project negotiations.
However, tariffs were not increased sufficiently due to the legal framework governing the project
cities. The uneven performance of some civil works contractors caused delays. In some cases
contractors had difficulty understanding the Bank requirements for environmental safeguards, and
proper practices for managing a construction site. In other cases, State Owned Enterprise
contractors had difficulty mobilizing sufficient resources. Finally, insufficient household
connections to sewers have hampered the overall efficiency of the sewage systems.

Overall Implementation is rated "satisfactory."

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1    M&E Design: The design of the M&E system and PDO indicators (decrease in
communicable disease and increase in tourism) were set at too high a level and subject to
influence by factors external to the project. Collection of data for these indicators also relied on
outside agencies which further complicated the problem. The intermediate outcome indicators
reflected output from each of the project components and were a reasonable choice. A review of
the indicators by a regional operations team around 2006 concluded that the project would be
better served by replacing the PDOs with indicators that reflected the number of beneficiaries of
the various interventions. The task team considered officially amending the PDOs but concluded
that, given the short time remaining in the project, resources would be better spent addressing
other operational issues. Instead, the task team collected data on beneficiaries and reported them
in the ISRs. The M&E design could also have been improved by assigning target values for all
indicators.

2.3.2     M&E Implementation: The PMUs were responsible for monitoring the key
performance indicators and data related to each of the intermediate PDO indicators were collected
from a variety of sources. Some data collection activities were carried out on a contract basis by
provincial government and local departments. Data were recorded in PMU's centralized database
and original data were kept in the Environmental Monitoring System EMS archive. In general,
the PMU's effort to collect data for the EMS was well done. However for some indicators, data
was not collected regularly. The EMS collected data on the following aspects:-
                                                  6

      Water and sediment quality monitoring
      Flooding data including rainfall, level of floodwater, water level in lakes and channels
         and tide information
      Groundwater level monitoring
      Health indicators
      Solid waste and septic tank collection and disposal
      Household sanitation improvements as described in Revolving Fund.

2.3.3    M&E Utilization: The aspects of the M&E system that were most useful to project
management were the outcome indicators. These indicators provided a thorough overview of
project progress in each component and data on cost recovery and private sector participation
focused TT attention on these issues. Similarly, data collected on the number of beneficiaries
provided a useful gauge of project coverage. Comprehensive environmental data were collected
regularly but no improvement in environmental indicators was expected until the project
interventions were nearly complete, so this was not a focus until the final years of the project.
The least successful aspect of the monitoring system were the key performance indicators, the
high level nature of the KPIs and the difficulty linking KPIs to project outcomes caused the task
team and PMUs to focus less attention on these indicators.

      Box 1. Typical example of monitoring of water quality

   Water quality Sampling in Quang Ninh

   During the project implementation, water sampling for quality analysis at various points have been
   taken. Analysis focused on BOD5, SS and colifoms. Water quality in 4 sampling points was permanently
   reported at interval of every 6 months. The sampling points were increased when Bai Chay WWTP and
   leachate treatment plants at landfills were in operation. Flooding indicators have also been supervised.

   Water Quality Results

   During earlier phases of study and construction, wastewater samples were taken from 4 points of
   discharge in Halong and Cam Pha. Water quality results were recorded and saved in the PMU's office
   for proper follow-up actions. PMU also reported necessary data to WB and relevant authorities.
   Water quality at sampling points in the project area was poor, largely caused by wastewater. Water
   quality in Cam Pha improved with BOD5 ranged from 11mg/l to 80mg/l; SS ranged from 23 ­ 184 mg/l.
   In Hon Gai BOD5 was from 16 ­ 92mg/l and SS was from 32- 250mg/l during the time of supervision
   period. Water quality in Bai Chay has been much improved since the wastewater collection and WWTP
   were in operation.
   After WWTP in Bai Chay, three sludge treatment plants at three landfills Ha Khau, Deo Sen and
   Quang Hanh were in operation, water sampling was continued. Wastewater Analysis Reports for each
   plant were prepared by the Institute of Marine Environment and Resources in 2006. It showed good
   treatment efficiency with a significant reduction of pollution parameters compared to earlier "before
   project" interventions.

The rating of M&E is "moderately unsatisfactory"


2.4      Compliance

2.4.1    Financial Management: Financial management (FM) aspects were generally in compliance
with Bank procedures. Some problems were encountered due to the limited FM capacity of the
URENCOs/SADCO, when the companies were in a transition period, from state-owned to autonomous
public service companies. Some audit reports were submitted late because of delays in selecting audit
firms. In the early stages of the Project, the PMUs and URENCOs/ SADCO had limited technical
capacity to follow up and rectify problems and weaknesses raised by the auditors but there was progress

                                                      7

during the latter years of implementation. Late submission of audited financial statements in Haiphong
was a breach of financial covenants of the project financing agreement, which required the audit
financial statements and audit reports to be submitted within six (6) months of the financial year end.

2.4.2   Environmental Safeguards: During the preparation phase of the project Environmental Impact
Assessments (EIA) and Environmental Management Plans (EMP) were prepared as the framework for
safeguarding the environment from the impacts of project construction. The outline and content of the
EMS was given in Contract Bidding Documents and covered cleaning and inspection of sewers,
construction and operation of engineered landfills, rehabilitation and construction of lakes and channels,
sewers and interceptors, and construction of workshops and new combined sewers. The focus of the
EMS was to minimize dust, odor, litter, noise and traffic emissions, ensure appropriate safe working
conditions; select transport routes to minimize/avoid public nuisance; provide proper equipment to
transport and treat sludge to avoid accidental spills and odor nuisances; avoid working during the night;
for landfill operations, avoid the bottom of landfill be constructed with an impervious liner, etc.
Observed results were recorded in PMU's data bases and original data was kept in the PMUs EMS
archive.

2.4.3   The construction management consultants reported on environmental compliance as required
by the EMP, and PMUs took appropriate actions. Site inspections revealed adequate compliance with
environmental requirements and that works carried out were generally implemented following the
Conditions of Contract which required appropriate environmental mitigation measures. From time to
time, review missions noted and requested that safety measures for workers needed to be better
enforced by contractors.

2.4.4   Social Safeguards: Project preparation included the planning for resettlement of affected
people, for which resettlement action plans (RAP) were prepared. Compensation rates applied for land
and structure acquisition were sometimes lower than market prices and not always agreed by Project
Affected Households (PAH) who were reluctant to accept the compensation offered. As with most
projects in Vietnam land allocation procedures for resettlement took a long time which delayed site
clearance. With long delay between compensation amounts being agreed and actual site clearance being
necessary and compensation being paid, rates agreed were soon outstripped by rapid increases in land
prices in the cities, an issue common to many projects in Vietnam. However, despite the difficulties
with compensation and resettlement plot provision, there was overall compliance with the Resettlement
Policy Frameworks (RPFs)/RAPs by the PMUs. Table 2.1 illustrates the numbers of affected
households in all three cities. The actual numbers of PAH exceeded planned figures. Reasons for this
included: some underestimation of original planned figures and the delays that occurred in project
implementation which led to some newcomers on sites which were not always adequately controlled.

2.4.5   Procurement: In keeping with the lessons learned in an earlier World Bank-funded
operation in the sector, where all elements of infrastructure were bundled into one contract per
city, multiple contracts per city were used to construct civil works and procure vehicles and
equipment. There was no recorded evidence of collusion among bidders or other forms of
malfeasance in the procurement process. However, Governments' own protracted procurement
processing had a substantial impact on progress, particularly during Phase 1 of the project. In
Phase 2, procurement activities went more smoothly based on the experience gained in Phase 1.
                                                  8

Procurement delays are a common and systemic issue in Vietnam for two main reasons:
decentralized responsibility for implementation, without parallel decentralization of the related
approval authority; and differences in the procurement procedures of Government and the Bank.
Each step of the procurement process, starting with design reviews, had to undergo multiple,
often duplicative reviews within the central and local Government before being eventually
submitted to the central authorities for final approval.

2.5       Post-completion Operation/Next Phase:
The following activities will be undertaken post-completion:-
      Plans to increase the number of household connections between septic tanks and tertiary
          sewer mains through an Output Based Aid3 approach are being put in place in Danang.
          Continued effort for tariffs increasing by URENCOs to cover O&M and depreciation.
          Awarding of service contracts to the private sector for expanded solid waste collection
          and disposal and septic tank emptying.
          Explore additional ways in which the PS might participate, e.g., vehicle and equipment
          service, billing and collection, electromechanical operations and maintenance.
          URENCOs to continue implementing the environmental monitoring plan; and
          Necessary budget be allocated to continue staff training.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1       Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The project objectives remain highly relevant today. Improving the urban environment is still a
central focus of the Government's strategy, and the pressures on the urban environment that
created the original demand for the project have only increased. The project design has also
retained its relevance as its core components cover basic urban services and are directly targeted
at improving the urban environment. Implementation arrangements are still relevant as they
reflected the Government's strategy of decentralization which is still a priority.

3.2       Achievement of Project Development Objectives
All PDOs have been satisfactorily achieved4.

3.2.1     The objective of sustained improvements to public health in the project area was
achieved. However, as discussed in sections 2.1.2, this PDO was subject to external factors and
the positive results measured by the project in the reduction of water-related and vector borne
disease cannot be directly attributed to the project. Nevertheless, this objective can be evaluated
in relation to the implicit objectives recognized by the task team as well as the outcome indicators.
Section 1.3 discussed the project's use of an implicit indicator ­ the number of urban residents
benefiting from the project. The number of beneficiaries is significantly greater than predicated at
appraisal and these beneficiaries enjoy improved sanitation, reduced flooding, and a generally
cleaner urban environment and they face a reduced risk of disease. The decline in the prevalence
of water-related and vector borne diseases shown in the surveys is likely due to the indirect
impact of the investments on the lives of project beneficiaries.


3OBA is an approach to providing financial support to a service provider or consumer which is disbursed after an
"output" has been delivered, as opposed to payment upfront, as with conventional aid.

4 There is a discrepancy between the PDO rating of "MS" in the ISR (#18 archived on December 22, 2007 before the
Credit closing on June 30, 2008) and the PDO rating of "S" in this ICR. ISR was again updated (#20) on April 24,
2009 after more data on project results became available. The final ISR upgraded the PDO to "S" which is again
reflected in this ICR.

                                                          9

3.2.2    The objective of increased economic development, by reducing the incidence of flooding;
upgrading the urban environment; and developing more efficient and financially sustainable
sanitation and drainage companies was also achieved. Increased economic development was
measured through tourism statistics and the number of tourist nights and the amount of tourist
revenue both increased significantly. While these observations cannot be tied directly to the
project, it is likely that improved urban environments have had an indirect impact on tourism.

3.2.3    Intermediate outcome indicators provide additional evidence that the project objectives
were satisfactorily achieved. In those areas where drains were constructed, flooding has shown a
marked decline. Quang Ninh has measured the improvement in flood control and shown
significant improvements in 10 locations prone to flooding; Danang showed similar
improvements in 5 locations measured by the project. Haiphong recorded a decline in the
flooding area, depth and time at all at all sites most prone to serious flooding.

3.2.4    Upgrading the urban environment was achieved through the investments in solid waste
management, sanitation loans and sewerage and sewage treatment. Solid waste collection and
disposal targets were exceeded in all project cities due to improved equipment, improved
management of the URENCOs and greater awareness on the part of residents about the health
benefits of a clean environment. Virtually all solid waste is removed from the cities within 24
hours. Solid waste and septic tank sludge are safely disposed to engineered landfill sites with
appropriate treatment facilities. The sanitation component, consisting of revolving funds for new
or improved on-site septic tanks and toilets facilities, exceeded loan targets and disbursed ahead
of schedule in 2005 and was the subject of a very positive external evaluation. It promoted equity,
by targeting low income households and is considered highly financially sustainable due to the
revolving fund mechanism and the high repayment rates. Most households borrowed for
construction or upgrading of septic tanks while the loans for house connections to sewers were
less popular than anticipated due to slow completion of sewers.

3.2.5    The urban environment was also improved through investments in wastewater collection
and treatment. Investments in Danang and Quang Ninh (Halong and Cam Pha) have resulted in
improved water quality to target levels and the three project cities are the only ones in Vietnam to
have functional comprehensive wastewater collection and treatment systems. Measurements
taken at Quang Ninh's tidal gates showed a reduction in BOD from 80 mg/l to 8 mg/l in 2003.
Visual inspection of the beach areas during the first trial runs of the wastewater systems showed
impressive results and the swimming areas were no longer affected by discharged wastewater.
More house connections need to be made to the sewage collection system to improve the
efficiency of the overall system.

3.2.6    The project succeeded in developing more efficient and financially sustainable sanitation
and drainage companies. The project's institutional development sub-components have enabled
the URENCOs to become stronger and more sustainable institutions. Through the project, the
concepts of cost recovery and user pay have been introduced to the Vietnam sanitation sector for
the first time and legislation was enacted to further the goals of cost recovery ­ this was a major
innovation and significant policy advance. URENCOs have improved their management skills
and expertise in solid waste management, and have begun to operate more in the manner of a
private sector company. Prior to the project, the URENCOs were primarily administrative
entities with no commercial focus. With the support of the project, URENCOs have developed
comprehensive business plans, and restructured the service delivery framework so that major
public services, such as street and beach cleaning, are provided under a structured service
agreement. Nevertheless, financial targets have not been achieved as tariff rates have not been
raised sufficiently to cover the increased costs of operating new facilities. The Government is
committed to providing sufficient O&M funds to cover these costs. In Haiphong, waste water

                                                  10

fees have been introduced to the consumer through water bills since 2000. The waste water fee of
15% of drinking water tariff has been applied since July 2006 and covers nearly 70% of O&M
costs for the Haiphong SADCOs.

3.2.7   The project's attempts to introduce private sector participation into this sector for the first
time in Vietnam have shown mixed results. In Danang the level of investment in new solid waste
management equipment and the resulting improved service by URENCO made it difficult for the
private sector to compete. Quang Ninh did contract out 100% of solid waste management. The
contracting out of septic tank emptying was very successful in Danang with a 100% participation
rate by licensed private operators. PSP in Haiphong was very low because the city policies did
not encourage private sector participation and the Haiphong SADCO has sufficient manpower
and specialized equipment to manage the tasks.

3.3     Efficiency

3.3.1   The final ERR calculated for the project was slightly higher than the rate calculated at
appraisal. The original calculation of the cost and benefits as contained in the PAD assumed that
the project would cause a reduction in the incidence of water-related and vector borne diseases by
an average of 15 percent, an increase in tourist nights by six percent, and increase revenue from
tourism by eight percent. The indicators used to quantify these assumptions were meant to be
proxies for the two PDOs: improved public health and economic development. The revised
calculations made similar assumption, albeit with more conservative figures of benefits achieved.
In addition the recalculation assumed increased benefits of 10% accruing to the additional
households which were included in the project once savings of $27 million were redeployed. The
results are displayed in Table 3.2 below. The ICR estimated NPVs and ERRs are slightly higher
than the PAD figures in all project cities and for the project as a whole. The notable increase in
investment and O&M costs was sufficiently compensated by the increase in benefits, mainly by
the extension of coverage.

3.3.2   Cost recovery: The rate of cost recovery for sanitation services in all three cities was
much lower than the mandated targets. The main reason for poor cost recovery results is the
absence of the necessary increase in the tariffs as required under the agreed schedule. There were
efforts by the URENCOs in all three cities to raise the fees. When approvals were given, the
tariff was sometimes already out of date. For example, it was planned in Danang to raise the fee
for waste water to 25% of water bills starting from 2001. In reality, the fee was only raised to
                                                  11

10% of the water bill, and then increased to a maximum of 13% in 2008. While this is an issue
endemic to urban projects in Vietnam, it does not augur well for the financial sustainability of the
URENCOs over the long term.

Note: Cost Recovery for Quang Ninh was calculated based on PMU reports. For Danang and
Haiphong, they were derived from auditing reports of the sanitation companies. Audit report for
Haiphong in 2007 has not yet been completed at the time of ICR preparation.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
The project rating of "satisfactory" reflects the success of the physical implementation of the
works, and the increase in the number of beneficiaries of the project over the appraisal estimate.
The physical works were implemented within the agreed budget, despite delays. Measurable
changes in all five components of the project represent clear improvements in living conditions in
the project areas for 1.7 million people. The rating also reflects the improvement of the
institutional framework, as the utility companies have made some progress towards financial and
technical sustainability. Despite difficulties in this area, the effort to introduce change was ground
breaking and the project has helped move forward public sector reform in the sanitation sector.

3.5      Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

3.5.1 Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The project had a positive impact on low income families in the project areas and actively
supported the role of women. Project improvements to the urban environment benefited all the
populations in the project areas, but low income households tend to suffer the most from poor
sanitation and so the impact on this part of the population is pronounced. The revolving fund
facility targeted lower income families and enabled poor households to improve their quality of
life. However, the poorest households were not eligible for the sanitation loans as they have
access to other government funds for this purpose. The project placed importance on the role of
women in project management. The revolving funds component was managed by the Women's
Union and women also played a major role in the information education campaign directed at
improving health and sanitation knowledge. The project emphasized opportunities for female
staff in technical, managerial and operational roles in the PMUs and the sanitation companies.

3.5.2 Institutional Change/Strengthening.
The project had a positive impact on institutional change. The Vietnamese government is
devolving responsibility and accountability from the central government to the provinces and
cities. For this process to be successful, provincial and local institutions face a steep learning
curve and must quickly build up institutional capacity. To this end, the project was able to support
the strengthening of the URENCOs with a comprehensive program to produce accounting
systems, O&M manual, a regulatory framework for PSP, environmental monitoring and HR
training.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome:
Rating: "moderate"

There are three risks to sustainability. The first is low cost recovery through user charges by
SADCO/URENCO for provision of sanitation services: Cost recovery was difficult to achieve
under the project and the most recent data shows all three cities did not meet targets agreed at
negotiations. Unless the utility companies are able to increase tariffs to cover operations and
maintenance and depreciation of moveable assets, local government resources will be needed to
cover costs. The Government is committed to provide adequate O&M budget until this issue can
be resolved with necessary amounts allocated in each city. As per Table 3.3 these are equivalent
with 58% in Quang Ninh, 50% in Haiphong and 48% in Danang respectively. A second risk is the
lack of effective institutional arrangements to support decentralization and the financial autonomy
of the utilities. The Government has taken steps to clarify the institutional arrangements for the
provision of urban services by independent service providers. The shifting of the responsibility
for sewage collection and wastewater treatment away from URENCOs to separate entities,
leaving the latter to deal with solid waste collection and disposal, has clarified the roles of local
bodies. Finally, the household connections to the networks need to be increased. The project
design assumed financing for connections to sewers would be provided through counterpart funds
and also that the households closed to sewers would finance the connection of their on-site septic
tanks to the tertiary sewage mains in their neighborhoods. However delays in sewage construction
meant that many households did not borrow for connections and some counterpart fund shortfalls
also impacted construction. There are plans for the sewage connections to be financed through
output based aid or though local budget.


5. Assessment of World Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1      World Bank Performance

5.1.1    World Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
The Bank's performance is rated "moderately satisfactory". The project was designed
appropriately for the conditions at the time and incorporated lessons learned from the previous
operation in the water sector. However, the PDO was not properly designed and reflects lack of
sufficient attention to designing practical M&E systems. The project design attempted to simplify
procurement procedures, however the complications from the decentralization process were not
anticipated.

5.1.2    Quality of Supervision: The project supervision team, including representatives of the
bilateral agencies (Netherlands, Finland, Denmark, UK) , carried out implementation support
missions twice a year, reviewing project progress, disbursement and procurement schedules and
environmental, social, financial and other related issues. The project benefited from a high level
of continuity within the IDA team and co-financiers throughout preparation and supervision. The
fact that all team members were based in Vietnam meant that it was possible to carry out
supervision continuously, on an "as needed" basis rather than intermittently. The task team
consistently raised areas of concern, such as cost recovery and procurement delays. Supervision
of M&E could have been stronger. World Bank performance is rated as "satisfactory".

5.1.3     Justification of Rating for Overall World Bank Performance
The Task Team focused much of its attention on the implementation of the civil works, ensuring
that systems were properly installed and the environmental safeguards and resettlement of PAH
                                                   13

were properly carried out. This attention no doubt contributed to the generally satisfactory
delivery of the engineering output. The Team's oversight and participation in the strengthening of
the URENCOs was critical and contributed to the improved managerial and technical capacity of
the entities. Despite the short comings referred to in (b) above, on balance the Task Teams
performance was rated as "satisfactory".

5.2 Borrower Performance

5.2.1    Preparation: The borrower's preparation of the project is rated "satisfactory". The
project was based on an appropriate and effective strategy. MPI was mobilized significant
bilateral support from Australia, Finland and Denmark to support the PMUs in project preparation.
By the time the project was presented to the Board detailed designs had been completed for 80%
of the project.

5.2.2    Implementation: The Government's implementation performance is rated
"satisfactory". The Government provided good support in many areas including the provision of
counterpart funds. However, in the first stage of the project the Government was not able to
adequately respond to Bank concern about procurement. Long procurement delays were the result
of procurement procedures which required multiple, often redundant, reviews of designs and
contract awards at local and central levels, and on occasion, by the Prime Minister's Office. The
performance of the implementing agencies is rated "satisfactory". After the separation of the
PMUs from their respective Danang and Quang Ninh URENCOs the role of the URENCOs
became less pronounced as their functions were limited to solid waste management and septic
tank emptying, PMUs remained proactive using consultant inputs effectively. There was a low
turnover amongst the implementing agency staff.

5.2.3    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance: The performance of the
borrower is rated "satisfactory". The performance of the Government was good with respect to
meeting its commitment for providing counterpart funds. However approval procedures remained
a major bottleneck to progress, hence the rating of unsatisfactory. Danang and Haiphong
performance was stronger and the project progressed more rapidly. Implementing agencies
generally performed well, despite constraints imposed by local regulations and competing
systems of procurement and environmental rules. In Quang Ninh, the project experienced greater
delays due to poor capacity of the contractor and delays in site clearance and performance was
only moderately satisfactory. On balance, the overall rating is "satisfactory".


6. Lessons Learned
   i. Definition of PDOs: Care should be taken to ensure that PDOs are appropriate and
       practical, measurable and attributable to the project.

  ii. Cost recovery: The project successfully introduced the concept of user pay in the sector.
       However, cost recovery targets proved to be too ambitious and did not adequately account
       for the slow pace of change in the legal framework and the risk of economic crisis slowing
       plans to raise fees.
 iii. House connections to sewer mains: Slow uptake of house connections by households in
       the project areas has reduced the efficacy of the sewerage system installed under the
       project. Future project should consider working with the Government to include house
       connections as part of the civil works.


                                                 14

 iv. Streamlined approval mechanisms: Future projects working at a sub-national level need
      to address the issue of protracted delays in the approval of contracts, compensation and site
      clearances. Strong commitment by local government is critical.
  v. Ensure some design capacity in construction management teams: The frequent need
      for design changes in the field on account of unforeseen circumstances in the works
      requires some capacity in the CM teams to propose design changes without the need to
      resort to engineering consultants.
 vi. Ensure the capacity of supervision consultants, of the contractors: These firms need to
      have not only technical expertise/financial ability but also contractual management/project
      management capacity. Adequate resources need to be mobilized for achieving satisfactory
      performance.
vii. Capacity building of sanitation and drainage companies: The valuable lessons on
      building the capability and services of sanitation and drainage companies need to be
      captured in a systematic manner to guide future projects.

Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

(including assumptions in the analysis)

The project delivered the planned work at costs lower than estimated in PAD. Significant savings
(amounting $27.2 million) were used to fund additional works in all three cities/province. In
general all components have been completed with works and goods contracts satisfactorily
delivered

The economic and financial analysis at completion of the project relied on the same methodology
as at appraisal.

    Note: Cost Recovery for Quang Ninh was calculated based on PMU reports. For Danang and
    Haiphong, they were derived from auditing reports of the Sanitation Companies. Audit report for
    Haiphong in 2007 has not yet been completed at the time of ICR preparation.

The rate of cost recovery of all three cities was much lower than the revised target. Danang
recorded the highest cost recovery, but the revenue was only just above one half of the cost for
operation and maintenance.

The main reason for not achieving cost recovery targets were that the fees for services could not
be raised according to the agreed schedule. There were efforts of authorities in all three cities to
raise the fees. However, this proved to be a very difficult task to fulfill. For example, it was
planned in Danang to raise the fee for waste water to 25% of water bills starting from 2001. In
reality, the fee could only be raised to 10% of the water bill, and then increased to a maximum of
13% in 2008.

Another cause of low cost recovery was the rapid increase of costs for operation and maintenance.
Major components of operating expenses witnessed considerable increases during the project life.
Wages were revised several times. For example, a 30% increase in all workers salaries from Jan 1,
2003 significantly increased costs. Electricity costs increased significantly. A recent decision of
the Government to raise the electricity fees by nearly 9% will have a significant impact on cost
recovery of the operations. In addition, high rates of inflation caused by the surge in commodity
prices in recent years also contributed significantly to the rising of cost of operation.

An example of large difference between cost estimate and actual cost can be seen with solid
waste collection in Halong and Cam Pha. Only a few year after the appraisal, the actual cost for
solid waste collection in Halong was 50% higher than the projected cost for 2003; and in 2004,
the actual cost for solid waste collection in both Cam Pha and Halong was more than twice as
much as the projected cost.
                                                  20

Despite the low cost recovery, a significant achievement of the project was the implementation of
service contracting in Quang Ninh and Danang. The PCs of Danang, Halong and Cam Pha have
all entered into such contracts and have found that it has improved the accountability of their
utility companies. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that people have been highly satisfied with
improved quality of services of the utility companies after the move the service contracting.

Economic Analysis
The main economic benefits resulted from the implementation of the project are (a) reduced flood
damage; (b) increased tourism; (c) improved public health; and (d) avoided sanitation costs.
There are two major factors that could have significantly positive and negative impacts on the
estimation of the economic benefits of the project. On the positive side, the use of savings for
extended sanitation work in three cities resulted in significant increased coverage of drainage
which in turn led to higher economic benefits as flooding was considerably reduced and more
people benefitted from improved water sanitation.
On the other hand, benefits related to tourism are quite sensitive to unforeseen events such as the
occurrence of natural disaster and severe epidemic or economic turbulence. , Vietnam's tourism
has been negatively affected by all these factors. Danang and Quang Ninh were severely affected
by both Avian Flu and the strong tropical storms in 2005-06, and actual revenues from tourism
even decreased over the period 2003-05. Since benefits from tourism accounted for the largest
share of the total benefits, notable declines in the growth of number of visitors over the last few
years would no doubt have negative impact on the overall benefits and economic returns.
Note: economic benefits related to improved public health and increased economic development,
the two PDOs, require major assumptions about the extent to which the project is supposed to
produce the expected outcomes in a reduced level of communicable diseases and an increase in
tourism. The assumptions required are subjective to the extent they rely on very little data.
The ICR analysis relied mostly on the same assumptions as that of PAD. Some of these were
modified slightly, to reflect better the trend in the last few years, and also the change of the scope
of work due to extension. In addition, the timeframe for the ICR analysis started from 2001, the
year actual investment took place, instead of 1999 as in PAD analysis. Some changes in the
calculations reflected the change in population of the project cities.
A summary of the PAD and ICR costs and benefits are shown in the table below. Significant
higher values of NPV for investment resulted from two factors: (i) change in the pattern of
investment with much heavier outlay in the first two years as compared with the plan; and (ii)
depreciation of VND vis-a-vis USD. If the depreciation were to be taken into consideration, the
increase became rather insignificant.
The ICR estimated NPVs and ERRs are slightly higher than the PAD figures in all project cities
and for the project as a whole. The notable increase in investment and O&M costs was
sufficiently compensated by the increase in benefits, mainly by the extension of coverage and by
the rapid increase in the number of visitors and revenues from tourism.
It should be noted that the adopted ICR assumptions about tourism-related benefits attributed to
the project implementation were even less generous than that of PAD. The increase in tourism
benefits resulted solely from the much faster rate of growth of both visitors and revenues in the
period of project implementation. For example, the projected number of visitors in Quang Ninh
for 2007 was less than one seventh of the actual figure. It was also the main reason behind the
large gains in both NPV and ERR for Quang Ninh.

Annex 7: Summary of Borrower's PCRs and/or Comments on Draft ICR

All participating cities submitted their PCR (See Annex 9). Based on the information/comments
provided, the TTL and the ICR Authors (Mr. Richard Beardmore and Ms. Julia Li) prepared
several draft ICRs. The revised draft Version 4.0 was circulated to Borrower and other partners
for comments. Below are the list and content of comments received so far:-

Comments from the Ministry of Planning & Investment (Email dated 13 May, 2009)
Firstly I would like to congratulate WB and three cities for successful completion of the Three
Cities Sanitation Project. I would like to give some comments as follows:-
     In general the project has met the set target. This is the first sanitation project which
         dealing with a comprehensive issues, including sewers and sewage treatment system.
     The project also changed the management style of the Sewerage and Drainage Company
         in Hai Phong or urban environment companies in other cities. In which, these companies
         have moving from mostly financed by the local government budget to sustained by
         themself through the principle of cost recovering mechanism. This mechanism is also
         now start to be applied to other cities in the countries and is a method that should be
         followed.
     The implementation of the project showing a strong commitment from both provincial
         authorities and the WB, the effective coordination between the WB and Vietnam
         authorities through the scheduled meeting to review the progress of the project.
     Decentralization in this project has shown it strength.

Nevertheless, the project has also faced some difficulties in implementation that we should take
note for other similar projects in the future:-
     The bidding problems: Some contractors are not good and not implement as they
         committed (the contractor in Quang Ninh,...) which make the project delayed.
     The selection of contractor should be made more carefully and sometime the contractors
         who have the best score are not the best one.
     Site clearance: Even with the high commitment from local authorities, as other project in
         Vietnam, site clearance remains a difficult issue to tackle. Due to the different b/w WB
         and Vietnam procedure, for the future project, the DCA should mention more detailed
         and clearer the resettlement framework to help the implementation agencies to be easier
         to follow.

Thanks and best regards,

        Ref. Quang Ninh Sub-project: PMU's comments to the draft ICR

Dear Mr. Hung,

Thank you for your email of 24.04.2009 and the attached draft Implementation Completion
Report, we would like to have some comments to this as follows:

In general, we agree with the outline and contents of the draft ICR. We however propose some
amendments for number of parts in the ICR:-
    1. In Item 1.7.2 (page 10), in paragraph: "Additional works included expended drains in
        Ha Long City, and construction of a new WWTP in Cam Pha......". Please amend as
        "Additional works included expended drains in Ha Long City and Cam Pha Town, and
        construction of a new WWTP in Hon Gai concentratively populated and administrative
        area of Ha Long City".
    2. In the Item 5.2.3 (page 23), in paragraph remarking Quang Ninh project: " ..In Quang
        Ninh, the project experienced greater delays in procurement and site clearance....".
        In the fact that, the delays was not caused by the procurement, we therefore propose to
        recorrect as "....In Quang Ninh, the project experienced greater delays due to poor
        capacity provided by the Contractor and site clearance....".
    3. In the Part A- Outcome: Regarding the second dash of the second sub-item (b) ( page 39),
        we propose to re-state as follows: A plan of increase of wastewater charge according to
        freshwater bill was drawn out in the FS Document for Loan Agreement with the Bank.
        People's Committee of Quang Ninh Province had issued Decisions regarding increase of
        wastewater charge for 5 times, from the flat fee of VND 200 per m3 to 10÷15%
        surcharge on water supply".
    4. In the Item regarding Completion of the Civil Works Contracts (page 40), at paragraph:
        At the time of completing this draft report no further actions had been taken.", we
        propose to rewrite as follows: " After consideration solutions, Quang Ninh Provincial
        People's Committee as well as PMU had conducted stronger actions, namely
                                                 28

         broadcasting the poor capacity provided by the contractor on National Television,
         issuance of request letter to Ministry of Construction ( Construction Company is directly
         under MOC) for assistance. After that move, the Contractor had mobilized more
         execution units which resulted in successfully completion of Bai Chay WWTP and it is
         handed over to the Employer for operation in the end of May 2007"

If there are any unclear points regarding our comments, please do not hesitate to contact us.

By the way, please be informed that Ha Khanh WWTP is reaching the end of commissioning
period. The recent tested samples are shown that treated wastewater meets Vietnamese Standard.
It is expected to be handed over to the Employer on May 25th, 2009.
Thank you for your assistance.
Yours truly,
Phan Cam Pha
Director of PMU

Re: Three Cities Sanitation Project
Mr. Le Duy Hung, Task Team Leader
World Bank, Hanoi, Vietnam

Re: Your letter 29 April 2009

We have a pleasure to congratulate World Bank and all parties involved to successfully
implementing the demanding Three Cities Sanitation Project in Vietnam. According to the
Completion Report the relevancy of the project has been high and the implementation most
satisfactory.

The draft of the Implementing and Completion Report for the Three Cities Sanitation Project is
very informative and makes interesting comparisons between three case cities of Hai Phong,
Danang and Quang Ninh. Finland has been involved with Hai Phong City and from our
experience we can agree that the conclusions of the Report are correct. We are also pleased to
observe that the quality of supervision has been rated good. That has been the major Finnish
contribution in Hai Phong. These kinds of projects normally have many complications and
problems. That was also the experience in Hai Phong, but finally issues were settled in time in a
good co-operation between relevant parties.

Cost benefit analysis shows positive cost/ benefit ratio in general, also in Hai phong. However, it
is a pity that the increase of tourism income has not been evaluated in the case of Hai Phong. That
makes Hai Phong figures low and non-comparative with other cities. Hai Phong City is a
remarkable feeding hub for tourists to Halong, Cat Ba and Do Son. It is most probable, that
hygiene environment makes Hai Phong a more attractive gate to the final tourist estimations.
During the monitoring period, the number of tourists increased 100 % in Hai Phong. The
financial impact of that should not be ignored.

One of the key sustainability factor of the sanitation schemes is the financial status of the
operating companies in the sanitation sector. The issue is discussed in a few chapters in the report.
However, the discussion leaves many issues open and does not reach a proper analytical level.

Sincerely yours
Max von Bonsdorff
Head of Development Cooperation

Comment/Action by ICR Team Leader/Author: As mentioned earlier, no touristic figures in
Haiphong will be included in the economic analysis. Other comments were incorporated in this
version. In addition, the TT would like to thank FINNIDA for their excellent cooperation and
strong commitment in Haiphong. This was a great example of good bilateral/ co-financing.

Comments from Mr. Antti Nykanen, Team Leader, CMC in Hai Phong (Email dated 18

Dear Hung,

I have reviewed the report and I don't find any incorrect issues there. In general there are a lot of
good findings (especially in M&E) which will be useful in following the CCESP. Could you send
me a copy of Cofinancier's (Ministry for Foreign Affairs) comments. It would be interesting to
see what the have commented.

Best regards,

Comments fr. Mr. Sytze Jarigsma, Team Leader, CMC in Danang (Email dated 11 May 09)

Dear Giang and Hung,

From the DHV side, there are no comments on the draft ICR. Many of the
Tables used in the ICR on the Danang project originate from a draft report prepared by us in
cooperation with Gerry Glazier (Institutional
componnent)and they have not changed, as far as we know.

However, the drawing sent to us separately, later on, is far from correct. I have contacted Mr. Huy
of the PMU PIIP Danang and I understand that the PMU will send you an updated picture that
shows the wastewater component correctly and that also will include the drainage component.

Kind regards,

Sytze Jarigsma
On behalf of DHV
CMC of Danang component

         Comment/Action by ICR Team Leader/Author: Danang map was revised and accepted

2. Original (and Revised) Trust Fund Activities/Components
- Bai Chay Sanitation (DKK 25.3 millions): Drainage, sewerage and sewage treatment, solid
   waste management; and
- Revolving fund for household sanitation improvement (DKK 7.3 millions)

3. Outcome Indicators
Together with other funding resources for Quang Ninh Sub-project, the TF had an important
contribution to the realization of relevant indicators. These are provided in details in the main
report:
- Reduction in the flooding: The flooding area has been reduced 80%. A total of 435,000
   people in the Province benefit from reduced flooding.
- Reduction in the incidence of water-related and vector-borne diseases: A total of 93,000
   people benefit from WW collection and treatment.

- Increased external investment: More other projects on sanitation area are under
   preparation. In particular, JICA plans to fund a new sanitation project for Vietnam with a
   total cost estimate of US$120 million.
- Immediate local environment has become cleaner: Samples were taken at three discharge
   points as indentified before. It was found that the results obtained at two points in Bai Chay
   Area were satisfactory while the treated water quality from Bai Chay WWTP met B Category
   as designed and thus contributed to environmental conditions improvement for Halong Bay.
   It is expected that the water quality in the last point will be improved when new Ha Khanh
   WWTP will be put under full operation
- Cost recovery and willingness-to-pay sanitation fee: During the project period, the PPC
   increased the WW fees and SWM fees four times. It was recorded that a high number of
   households paid these fees. The services providers, URENCO, are operating on a more
   commercial basis.


                                                 34

- Solid waste collection and safe disposals: It was recorded that solid waste of a high number
    of households (approx. 80,000HH) with population of 330,000 people was collected and
    safely disposed at sanitary landfills.
- Small sanitation revolving fund: A high number of 11,504 loans were provided to the
    households for improving toilet and sanitation facilities.
- Information-Education-Communication (IEC) Program: The IEC activities were carried
    out in 21 primary and secondary schools. The "Green Sundays" initiative was promoted and
    maintained. With active participation from Women Union, the environmental protection
    campaign was taken place in all wards of Ha Long City and Cam Pha Town

4. Other Significant Changes in Trust Fund Design
- There was no significant change in the TF design. Quang Ninh PPC asked DANIDA to use all
    allocated budget for an extension into phase II. On 8 October 2002, Danida objected the
    proposal of Quang Ninh PPC. Consequently, an amount of DKK 11,545.74 was cancelled
    from the trust fund, and so was the remaining amount separately allocated from bilateral grant
    provided by DANIDA. Afterwards, remaining activities had been funded by Quang Ninh
    PPC.

C. OUTCOME
1. Relevance of TF Objectives, Design and Implementation

- The TF is for co-financing with the Three Cities Sanitation Project which supports the CAS's
    goal to raise productivity through infrastructure by making the project cities more
    competitive, improving their "livability" and enhancing their bankability. It also contributes
    to the reform of the state-owned enterprises by making the companies currently responsible
    for sanitation and drainage more commercially focused and by increasing private sector
    participation, thereby making their eventual divesture more feasible. The TF is therefore
    relevant to both the CAS and the Bank's general urban and local government sector strategy.

2. Achievement of TF Development Objective


a) Sustained improvements to public health:
- The Danish TF contributed to improving sanitation conditions to 301,655 people in Quang
    Ninh Province.
- In terms of Increased Awareness in Halong, according to the Impact Assessment Reports (of
    which data was collected from mass organizations, the health department and monitoring of
    activities), the TF achieved their objectives to a relatively high extent. Information, Education
    and Communication (IEC) activities were carried out in the whole project area. Residents are
    now generally aware of environmental and health issues. A large number of residents
    benefited from the Revolving Fund and contributed to an improved environment through, for
    example, clean up campaigns and improved sanitation, and the general health situation has
    improved.

b) Increased economic development by reducing the incidence of flooding, upgrading the
    urban environment, and developing more efficient and financially sustainable sanitation and
    drainage companies (URENCOs) in Quang Ninh Province (Ha Long City and Cam Pha
    Town):
- In terms of institutional development, for the case of Halong, new procedures and practices
    for Urban Environmental Company's (URENCO) were completed and used in daily works.
    To this extent the objectives have been obtained. However it should be noted that the process

                                                 35

    of change in which the administration and the URENCO management has been now engaged
    is very dynamic. It is hoped that the sub-project has laid a strong foundation for continued
    institutional strengthening and HRD initiatives for these groups in the future in order to
    address changes that will continue to occur.
- A plan of increase of wastewater charge according to freshwater bill was drawn out in the FS
    Document for Loan Agreement with the Bank. People's Committee of Quang Ninh Province
    had issued Decisions regarding increase of wastewater charge for 5 times, from the flat fee of
    VND 200 per m3 to 10÷15% surcharge on water supply- The overall environmental
    impacts of the implementation of the sanitation components have been positive.
    Improvements of the drainage channel capacity have already decreased flooding in low-lying
    areas. Wastewater and septic sludge collection and treatment have helped improve
    considerably the living conditions in the project areas.
- Wastewater treatment has reduced the direct pollution load from the human population.
    Especially in Ha Long, the reduced pollution will improve the water quality and aquatic life
    especially near the shoreline of Bai Chay. Also, the introduction of sanitary landfill sites with
    proper membranes and leachate treatment plants has reduced the impact on the groundwater
    in the landfill areas.
- With the introduction of a sewage collection and treatment facility covering the town center
    area of the city, the concept of separating wastewater from rainwater has been introduced for
    the first time in Vietnam by the TF. Rapid industrial and urban development in Vietnam will
    create a pressure on the environment. Therefore extensive investments in wastewater
    treatment will be needed.

3. Efficiency
- In general, the results have been quite effective for the sanitation component. The works were
    carried out as planned in a reasonably timely manner. Most of the outputs were achieved, and
    targets were met.
- For the construction supervision, it is assessed that the results have been generally effective.
    The works were carried out as planned, and targets have been met. However, with many
    changes and extensions in the sub-project, it is difficult to evaluate whether the results have
    also been efficient. Originally, some 69 international and 198 national man-months were
    assigned to project management and supervision. In reality, almost 125 international and
    more than 450 national man-months were spent on the task. In other words, the input has
    doubled compared with the original plan. The main reason for the expansion of the
    supervision input is the contractors' lack of own quality assurance. The supervision
    organization had constantly attempted to assist the contractors to improve both quality control
    and organization, but in this respect without tangible results. Nevertheless, given the outside
    factors it is deemed that the construction supervision was implemented in a reasonably
    efficient way.
- With regard to the Institutional Strengthening (IS), Sub-Project had specifically addressed the
    institutional capacity development. The IS sub-project is assessed to substantially develop
    capacity for the two URENCO's. All of the main outputs that supported the log frame
    indicators of the sub-project were produced, and the process of institutionalization of the new
    procedures and practices used in daily operations of the URENCO's were completed. In
    addition, important capacity development took place within the PMU, where management
    and staff learned further developed skills to manage large international civil works contracts

Outstanding issues: these are some major outstanding issues:
- Completion of the Civil Works Contracts: During a meeting following an inspection by the
    PPC of the contractor in question in March 2006, the consultant pointed out the fact that the
    contractor's work force had decreased, and mentioned that with the current rate of progress

                                                  36

    the contractor would complete the works at least two months later than the scheduled end of
    June, 2006. Irrespective of this, the contractor without providing any tangible evidence
    guaranteed to complete all works on or even ahead of schedule. Subsequent to the meeting
    the contractor had further decreased his work force, and the consultant decided to recommend
    expulsion of the contractor as soon as possible. After consideration solutions, Quang Ninh
    Provincial People's Committee as well as PMU had conducted stronger actions, namely
    broadcasting the poor capacity provided by the contractor on National Television, issuance of
    request letter to Ministry of Construction ( Construction Company is directly under MOC) for
    assistance. After that move, the Contractor had mobilized more execution units which
    resulted in successfully completion of Bai Chay WWTP and it is handed over to the
    Employer for operation in the end of May 2007.
- Private Sector Involvement. Various aspects of the Private Public Partnership concept was
    presented and demonstrated. A private contractor, Invesco, was assigned for solid waste
    collection in Halong City. The Ha Long and Cam Pha URENCO are under transition period
    from directly administrative companies under PC to an autonomously operated companies
- Community related issues: There is a need for an in-depth impact study to assess whether the
    revolving fund has the desired impacts on poverty and the environment, and how deficiencies
    especially in terms of lacking benefits to poor households may be improved.
- The waste collection system does not yet satisfactorily function. Both the issue of insufficient
    fees and non-payment of fees, and the irregular dumping of waste need to be more directly
    addressed in order to ensure sustainability.

4. Development Impacts, including those that are Unintended/Unrelated to TF Objectives
- The TF generated public benefits to the project area's economies as a whole, and private
    benefits to individual households. A healthier workforce attributed by fewer water-borne
    diseases and less damage and disruption of production resulting from flooding has helped
    improved business's productivity. Reduced flood damage to roads and other infrastructure
    services has also helped lower road maintenance costs. Urban environmental improvement
    has given the project areas a more comparative advantage over others in competing for new
    investments. There is also another benefit to tourism in Ha Long city through reduced
    pollution of the popular swimming beaches in Ha Long Bay, as the famous World Heritage's
    site.

5. Overall TF Outcome
Overall outcomes of the Danish TF has been achieved.



D. RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

1. Follow-On Results and/or Investment Activities
Activity/Investment:
_____ Recipient/Other Investment; _____ Grant Project/Program; _____ Bank Project; _____
IFC Financial Project/Activity

2. Replicability
- As noted above, it is recorded that more projects are under preparation. In particular JICA is
    planning to fund a new sanitation project with total cost estimate of US$120 million.




                                                 37

3. Overall Risk to Development Outcome
- Whilst physical outputs were successfully achieved, institutional objectives focusing on the
   development of strong financially viable institutions were not. Almost all physical outputs
   were achieved and the institutions (URENCO and the PMU) have become stronger in
   managerial and technical sense. However, the objective of making them financially less
   dependent on cost recovery basis has not been achieved. During the course of the project, the
   PMU for the project was separated from URENCO. This caused serious problems as
   URENCO staff did not gather practical experiences in project management, and had less
   opportunity to learn new skills on the job, whilst PMU staff became less interested in the
   operational side of the project outputs.

E. PERFORMANCE

1. Bank:
The Bank's team was proactive in providing guidance and assistance to the Recipient in
implementation of the trust fund. Continuous supervision was provided. The Bank's team and the
Recipient regularly coordinated to review and revise activities for achieving intended's
objectives.

2. Recipient (for Recipient-executed TFs only):
The Recipient well managed the trust fund's activities. However, there were still some rooms for
improvement such as weak collaboration between line agencies, slow site compensation and
hand-over, and delayed bidding process.



F. LESSONS LEARNED / RECOMMENDATIONS

There are several major lessons learned from this TF:
- In the context of project decentralization, only local approval of contract works was required.
   This created a fast-track method for contract implementation, as it precluded any approval
   from central government such as Ministry of Construction. This allowed the contractor to
   work closely with the Department of Construction authorities and receive their close
   cooperation and support at critical approval periods in the contract implementation
- In terms of the design, a key emphasis should be placed on the use of appropriate technology
   which reflects both the level of expertise and financial resources available to operate and
   maintain the implemented investment. The simplest level of technology to achieve the stated
   goals should be utilized, so as to create a reliable, financially sustainable operating system. It
   is critical to choose a suitable technology that is adapted to local capacity, and community's
   needs and affordability.
- About IEC activities: It is important to have an insight knowledge of the local situation before
   launching the activities through: (i) a baseline study on the issue at stake before the start of
   the Awareness Campaign; (ii) a long term (6 months) anthropological study (using a KAP
   approach) of the communities' understanding of the project related issues. It also requires the
   use of the anthropological study results as a basis for detailed design of the awareness
   campaign and the creation of awareness raising materials fit to the communities.
- Regarding the preparation of a Communication Plan in collaboration with the Counterpart at
   the outset of the campaign, the Plan should contain a very detailed description of the TORs of



                                                 38

 the stakeholders (various government, project and community-based players), of the
 connection links between them, and of the progress monitoring system.
- Strong focus on setting up an institutional system with existing provincial and city authorities
 for ensuring the sustainability of IEC activities.
- Close collaboration with the other components of the Project.
- Support from the PPC and Commune People's Committee to the campaign throughout the
 Project life.
- Awareness campaign implemented in the communities by full-time employees
- Communication Agents (called Sanitation Trainers in the BMT-SSC).
- Simple system of subsidizing poor households for latrine construction.
- Integration between IEC activities and construction work.
