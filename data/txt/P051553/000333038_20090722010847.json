Some lessons learned included: 1) the\n            project successfully introduced the concept of user pay in\n            the sector. However, cost recovery targets proved to be too\n            ambitious and did not adequately account for the slow pace\n            of change in the legal framework and the risk of economic\n            crisis slowing plans to raise fees; 2) slow uptake of house\n            connections by households in the project areas has reduced\n            the efficacy of the sewerage system installed under the\n            project. Future project should consider working with the\n            Government to include house connections as part of the civil\n            works; 3) future projects working at a sub-national level\n            need to address the issue of protracted delays in the\n            approval of contracts, compensation and site clearances.\n            Strong commitment by local government is critical; 4) these\n            firms need to have not only technical expertise/financial\n            ability but also contractual management/project management\n            capacity. Adequate resources need to be mobilized for\n            achieving satisfactory performance; and 5) the valuable\n            lessons on building the capability and services of\n            sanitation and drainage companies need to be captured in a\n            systematic manner to guide future projects."}, "docdt": "2009-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
