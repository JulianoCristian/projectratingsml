In the Da Nang Sanitation Project wastewater\n            component, impacts include: a) during construction:\n            increased air pollution, increased discharge of water\n            pollutants affecting land, water, and inhabitants; b) during\n            operation; decrease in water, air and soil pollution. The Da\n            Nang Solid Waste component will have both negative (due to\n            the new landfill and increased transportation of waste) and\n            positive (increased capability to collect & manage solid\n            waste) impacts. The location of the Halong landfill\n            component will not cause any serious negative impacts on\n            natural flora and fauna, though care must be taken to not\n            endanger the local drinking water source. The drainage and\n            sewerage system in Halong will have an overall positive\n            impact, especially in the aquatic and human environment,\n            although to insure this, mitigation measures including water\n            control and leachate management must be implemented. The\n            Haiphong component will improve the overall urban\n            sanitation, positively affecting the human and aquatic\n            environment, although untreated waste water discharge will\n            continue the contamination of river water. Mitigation of\n            this would include the installation and regular de-sludging\n            of septic tanks connected to sewers."}, "docdt": "2003-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
