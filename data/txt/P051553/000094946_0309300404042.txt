Executive Summary
Background
Phase I of Danang Sanitation Project was approved in 1999 with total investment of about USD 41
million. The project aims to support improved sanitation services to 33 phuolngs in Danang's five urban
districts. Construiction of Phase I works are currently uliderway and are expected to bring substanitial net
benefits to Danang city. Due to savings aenerated through1,ll Phase I's bidding process, about II USD
million of aciditional drainage and wastewater works (hereafter knowin as the Additional Works Project)
have been approved both by World Banlk and Danang Pcoples' Committee.
The Additional Works Project
The majority of Additional Works Project funds will be used to support drainage works (USD 7.6
million). Wastewater works are the second bucigetaiy priority (USD 1.6 million), ancI a few small
componienits form the tertialy priority. Project componienits are sumlimiiarised below:
Drainage works: The Additional Works Project will construct drainage:
I. in Bihli Thuan ward fi-om Le Dinh Tham to Duy Tan Road;
2. from Dien Bien Phu Street to Danang Bay through Le Do Street;
3. from Dien Bien Phu Street (Xuani Hoa ponci) to Tran Cao Van Street (Phu Loc River);
4. from An Khe pond to Phu Loc River; and
5. from nMy Klhe to Bac Me An. Proposecl Wastewater Works.
*   Wastewater Works: The Additional Works Project will support:
1. small additions to the Phase I wastewater system in Hoa Cuong, Son Tra, and N,ii Hanh
Son catchments. These additions will increase the capacity of Danang's wastewvater
system by about 7%; and
2. install floating covers on Son Tra and Ngu Hanih Son wastewater treatment plants.
*  Beach Cleaninzg Works: The Additional Works Project will purchase beach cleaning equipment
to clear solid waste from the beaches of the South China Sea. These beaches are close to the
proposed draina,ge and sewerage works that are adjacent to the South China Sea.
The remaining Additional Works Project funds are allocated to consulting fees, contingencies, and taxes.
Alteriiatives
Numerous alternatives are being considered within the Additional Works Project. However, the practical
scope of optioins are limited, as the project needs to integrate wvith Phase I works - both in location and
operational design. The "No Project" alternative would likely mean that:
1. Flooding in the Additional Works Project area will contilnue which would continue to impact
public health, economic development, and transport.
2. Wastewater will contilue to drain into nearby rivers and beaches, which will negatively affect
public health and tourism.
3. Solid waste will continue to be dumped on popular beaches, whicih will negatively affect public
health and tourism.

In pacts
An assessment of the Additional Works Project's potential environmental impacts was conducteci for Pre-
construction, Constructioni, and Operation phases. The assessment evaluated a range of potential impacts
that could occur as a result of tihe Aciditional WVorks Project. The selection of potential impacts for
evaluation was based on site visits, discussionis with Phase i project staff, URENCO, DoSTE and others;
and throLIgh review of relevant documlients suchi as World Bank's Environmental Assessment Sourcebook,
Phase I environmenital assessment reports, the Additional Works Project's Feasibility Study.and othiers.
The below provides a sunmmary impact evaluation of potential impacts that could be createcd by the
Additional Works Project.

Public Consultation
The Additional Works Project conclucted two types of public consultations to date. The first was public
meetings. Thie PMU Director chaired three meetings at the district level to discuss the project and present
the draft EIA  and EMP. Thle meetings were attended by 20-60 local people, Women's Union
representatives, and People's Committee represenitatives. The general response from each meeting, was
positive. Comments and issues that were raised by local people were addressed by the PMU Director.

The PN4lU Director conclLided each meeting by informing people thait the EIA and EMP woould be
available for review at the Project-affected wvard-level People's Committees. The second type of
consultation was the PAP survey. The survey covered 143 out of a total of 187 households. As part of the
survey, households were informed of tihe project construction locations, specific details on whien and
where construction will occtir near their house, and information on the benefits the project will bring,
during operation. The stirvey found that households were very sLipportive of the project and felt that
operations-phase woould bring them numerous economic and social benefits.
During project construction, EMP (Volume 4 of the Detailed Engineering StLidy) will support a series
social impacts surveys oni houselholds that were contacted during the PAP. These suL-veys will be uised to
address OP 4.01's need for continuled public consuiltation once the draft EIA report has been prepared.
The surveys will:
*   Update PAPs of additional works activities;
*   Receive advice as to wvhether or not PAPS have been fairly compenisated; and
*  Receive information on thcir perceived impacts of the project, and suggestionls to mitigate any
significant negative impacts.
Disclosure
The Additional Works Project has undergone several activities to sLipport the requir-ement of disclosLire, as
described in Bank policies OD 4.01 and BP 17.50. These activities inclIcle: 1) visiting 75% of the
h1ouselholds in the project area to inform themil of project activities, and 2) regularly meeting witi
representatives of all affectecd Peoples' Committee wards.'
The next disclosure step is for this EtA report to be advertised in a major local newvspaper four times over
a two-mnonth period. The advertisement will state the EIA is available for public display for a two month
period during normal working hours at the following locations: 1) the information centre of DoNRE for
access by Danang citizens and NGOs; 2) The Peoples' Committees of the wards where local people could
be affected by the Additional Works project; and 3) The Vietnam Information Development Centre at 63
Ly Thai To in Hanoi, for access by NGOs and pLiblic display. A signed letter from PMU stating its
comimlitment to public disclosure is found in Appendix 5 of this report.
Environmental Management Plan
An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been produced for this Additional Works Project.
(Volume 4 of the detailed engineering study reports). The EMP: 1) identifies potential adverse impacts
and suggests measures to mitigate adverse impacts; 2) suggests programmes to monitor both the
effectiveness of the mitigation measures; and the numerous positive impacts created by Additional Works
Project; and 3) provides guidance on the institutional responsibilities for Pre-Construction, Constrtiction,
and Operation Phases.
Conclusion
This project's purpose is to mitigate priority urban environmental issues - namely, sewage and sanitation
services in areas that could not be supported by the Phase I project. The construction of these services will
create some short-term negative impacts, however, the Additional Works Project's long-term positive
impacts during operation outweighi its negative impacts.
Project affected wards are: Thanh Loc Dan, An Khe, Xuan Ha, Chinh Gian, Binh Thuan, F-oa Thuan, Phuoc Nly, Bac My An,
Hoa Cuong, Mani Thai, Tho Quang, I-oa Hai

Vietnam Three Cities Sanitation Project                        Additional Wo/orks Project - EIA
Danang Sub-project (Phase 1)                                                    August 2003
I Introduction
Phase I of Danang Sanitation Project *was approved bv Government of Vietnam in Decision No 4I4/QD-
TTg dated April 20, 1999 with total investment of about USD 41 million. Phase I will support improved
sanitation services to 33 pluonas in Danang's Five urban districts. Key drainage and wastcwater works
supported by the Phase I include:
*  installation of gravity interception drains (GlDs), connections and rising mains;
*  construction of dry weather flow diversion structires within major existing drains;
*  installation of submersible pump stations;
*  installation of primary treatment plants (Hoa Cuong, Phu Loc, Ngu Hanh Son, and Son Tra) vijth
capacities ranging from 3.7 to 45 NIL/day;
* construction of major drains in critical areas in Danang;
construction of public toilets, some of which are incorporated into solid waste transfer stations;
and
implementation of community based sanitation improvement programs involving communirv
education programs.
The construction of Phase I works is currently underway and is expected to bringy substantial net benefits
to Danang, ciry. Due to savings generated through Phase l's bidding, process, about 11 USD million of
additional drainage and wastewater works (hereafter known as the Additional Works Project) have been
approved both by World Bank (in Aide Mvlemoire of April 2, 2002) and Danang Peoples' Committee (in
Decision No 1450fVP of April II, 2002). A feasibility stu,dy for the additional works was prepared in the
second half of 2002. The final version was completed in November 2002. CIVC was assigned to prepare
detailed designs for all additional works. A start with design activities was made in Februarv 2003 and
this EIA report is part of the output of the engineering study.
This EIA report is evaluates the environmental impacts of the Additional Works Project. The report
follows the format and standards established by World Bank for Categorv A projects and was developed
using a number of information sources, includinag
* Additional Works Project's Feasibility Study and draft ELA report (November 2002);
* Draft Detailed Design Report of the Additional Works Project;
*  ETA and EMP reports for the ongoing Phase I project (by GHD-Kinhiill-VIWASE, 1999);
* Site EMP of ongoing Phase I project and Quarterl'y Environmental reports (GCCI, 2002);
*  World Bank social and environmental safeguard policies;
* GOV environmental protection laws, regulations, and standards;
* secondary environmental data collected by local scientific institLites and agencies;
* Field visits to the Additional Woorks Project area;
*  interviews, meetings, emails, and informal discussionis wvith World Bank staff, URENCO, Dananiga

2 Policy, Legal, and Administrative Framework
2.1        World Bank Policy on Environmental Assessment
The -Additional Works Project is classified as a Category A project and therefore reqLires thte completion
of a Plil-scale EIA. The World Barn's policy on conductin;o a full-scale EJ.-A is to follow Operationw
Directive 4.01: Environmental Assessment. This directive describes guidance on Bank-'s s,olicies and
procedures For conducting, environmental assessments of proposed projects. Annex B of the Operational
Directive specifies the requirements for an Eli report.
Additional World Bank policies that wvere engatted chrouoh the Additional Works Project's El[- process
include: OP 4. I Safeguarding Cultural Propertr in Bank-Financed Projects; and OP '4. 12 Th?V0oiunl7arv

Sourcebook 
2.2        Vietnamese Policy and Administrative Framew)ork cn Environmental
Assessment
2.2.1      Vietnamese Policy Framework
Vietnam's most relevarnt environmental policies for environmental assessment are:
(i)   Law on Protection of the E-nvironrmnent (LEP) was enacted in 1993. The LEP.
-   identifies the responsibilities of the state centre, provinces. organisations and individuals
to prevent and remedy environmental deterioration and pollution and carry out soecified
environmental protection functions;
-   provides for the development of environmental standards    and  submission  of
environmentaJ impact assessment reports on new and existine facilities:
-   provides for responsib:e parties to pay compensation for environmental damage;
- establishes the right of individuals and organisations to petition for ernforcemenc of
environmencal regulations;
-   cails for civil and criminal penalties for violations; and
-   encourages international environmental co-operation.
(ii)  Decree 175/CP wvas promulgated in 1994 to guilde implementation of the LEP and provides
broad guidelines for division of responsibility among tvlinistries; environrmental iinpact
assessments; pollltion prevention aiid disaster control; sources of Finance; and enivironmental
linspections ancd standards.
(iii)  Circular No. 490 was promulgated ill 199S to provide gu11idance on sertine7 up and appraising
environmental imEpact assessmenit reports for investmenit projects. The Circilar identifies tile
legal requirements accordine to tlie stages of i-nplementation of a project and its categor:v
cefires tile coElteiit of project sl.u ect to the E1A procedL:es. and soecif-ies manacemerne oFr:he
E'.A report appraisal.

To supplement tile above kev policies, thlere are a large range of decisions, regulations, anid standards mav
also be considered:
(iv)   Decree 24/2000/1ND-C specifies the implementation on the Law on Foreign Investment in
Vietnam (Article 82) concerning environmental protection as follows: 1) enterprises with
foreign investment capital and joint ventures are obligated to observe regulations, satist'v
standards in environment protection, and compiv with Vietnam legislation on environment
protection; 2) if investors applv international advanced environmental standards tllese
standards should be registered with .MoSTE.
(v)   Decree 52/1999/ND-CP   was appended to include environmental considerations for
construction management as follows: 1) for PFS, Provision 3 of Article 23 stipulates that
requirements for environment study relating to the "selection of construction sites, estimation
of land use area needed, in ways which comply to the principle of minimising land use and
environmental and social impacts, and resettlement to the lowest possible level". 2)
Provisions 4 and 7 of Article 24 stipulate that FS must propose "specific site options (or
regions, routes) which much match with construction plans (including documents on site
selection, together with proposed solutions for minimising environmental and social
impacts)", and "architectural alternatives, construction solutions, preliminary designs
suggested for selection, environment management and protection solutions". 3) For technical
desig,n: Section B, Provision 1, Article 37 and Section A, Provision 2, Article 38, contain
regulations on appraisal and approval of "techniques for the protection of environment and
ecology; for prevention and combating of explosion and fire and for occupational safety and
industrial sanitation."
(vi)   Decree 26/1996/CP provides regulations on the punishment of administrative violation of
Environmental Protection Law. Chapter I describes the general provisions for punishment
under the Environment Protection Law. Chapter 2, Article 6 details recommended
punishments for parties who violate environmental pollution and prevention act. These
punishments include financial penalties for not submitting an EIA report.
(vii)  Tieu Chaun Viet Nam (TCVNi) are national standards established by MtoSTE and applied to
all government agTencies. They  include  engineering, construction, scientific, and
environmental standards. MNvost TCVN standards are direct translations of ISO standards.
TCVN environmental standards include acceptable limits of many air, noise, and water
quality parameters. In general, the list of bio-physical parameters are broad enough such that
most monitoring programmes can employ TCVN standards as metrics of evaluation. There
are some exceptions -for example, sediment, soil, and vibration standards do not yet exist.
In these cases, it is common practice for ODA projects to use standards from other countries
or international organisations.
2.2.2     Vietnamese Administrative Framework
The Government of Vietnam   is in the process of creating a new administrative framework for
environmental management. For the Additional Works Project, the frameework's relevant institutes are as
followss:
(i)   Mfinistry of Natural ResoLirces and Environment (NIONiRE). MvIONRE wvas established bv a
Prime M>vinisterial Decision on November I1, 2002. This newn ministry will include four vice-
ministers, 16 departments, one newspaper, and one magazine. The new \/ONRE will merge
numerous departments from  several national agencies. These are outlined in Decree
91/9002IND-CP: Providingfor thtefunctions, dutties, powvers cuind organisationol struzctzule of
tlle 1fil7istry of iVatzurcd Resozurces and tle Environtnel7t.

Danang Sub-project (Phase 1)                                                    August 2003
3 Project Description
3.1        Project Name and Involved Agencies
Project Name:                  Additional Works of Danang Sanitation Project
Supervising Agency:            Danang People's Committee
The Employer:                  Danang Urban Environment Companyv
The Implementing Agency:       Danang Sanitation Project Nlanagement Unit
3.2        Project Objectives
The Additional Works Project's development objective is to further strengthen wastewater and drainage
services in Danang. This will be achieved through tvo immediate objectives:
1. increase the capacity of drainage and wvastewater services in new economic development areas;
and
2. reduce pollution impacts of two wastewater treatment plants.
3.3       Additional Works Project Justification
Danang city is in the process of rapid development: roads, bridges, residential and commercial areas,
wastewarer treatment plants, drainage systems, and solid waste collection systems are beingy constructed
and rehabilitated via a number of domestic and donor-funded interventions.
The USD 41 million Dananig Sanitation Project (Phase I) is playing a critical role in the city's
development. It is building four wastewater treatment plants, instal ling several kilometres of sewerage and
drainage lines, numerous pumping stations, and public toilets. It is improving solid waste collection
services and creating a new solid waste landfill for Danang city.
According to Phase I's EIA Report,2 the project's drainage and wastewater upgrade programme will
provide net positive environmental impacts to the aquatic and human environment. This includes: 1)
reduced frequency and severity of flooding experienced in Danang; 2) improved quality of waters which
previously received untreated wastewater from both domestic and non-domestic sources, thereby reducing
the load of containinants on the Han River and Danang Bay as well as a number of ponds and lakes in the
Danang area; 3) Sanitary conditions within residences will be improved, which will follovW through to
reduced contamination of groLindwater and surface waters, which are frequently used as sources of
domestic water. This will support improvements to community health and reduce the economic burden of
water-borne disease that previoLusly occuLred In Danang.
Due to savings generated through Phase l's bidding process, there is about [ I USD million of fuLids
available to continue development of sanitation works. The primary sanitation priority is drainage works
in areas that were not serviced by Phase I activities (see sections 3.4 to 3.7 for a summary hiformation, or
the Detailed Design Report for more information). Drainage works is the priority activity and wvill
consume about 80%   of the Additional Works Project budget. Wastewater works is the secondary
sanitation prioritv and accounts for less than 20% of the budget. The project will also fund minor services
and goods such as beach cleaning equipinent and covers for wastewater treatment plants. Collectively,

Therefore, a description of each major wvorks activiry is accompanied by some additional commnents on
Phase I activities that were considered the development of the Additional Works Project.
3.4         Proposed Drainage Works
The Additional Works Project will construct stormwater drainage 1) in Binh Thuan ward from Le Dini
Tham to Duv Tan Road; 2) From Dien Bien Phiu Street to Danan, Bay through Le Do Street; 3) fronm Dien
Bien Phu Street (Xuan Hoa pond) to Traln Cao Van Street (Phui Loc River); 4) from An Klhe ponld to PhLu
Loc River: and 5) from   Nly Khe to Bac N[e An. A summlnary of drainage wvorks supported by the
Additional Works Project is foLipd in Table I and Fiaure I.
Table 1:    Summary of proposed drainage works.
Description of Proposed Drainage Works
Location                  (a) purpose of drainage, (b) drain length (c) drain depth (d) drain size
1. Le Dinh Tham Drain     a. Increase drainage capacity and reduce flood risk in Binh Thuan ward
From Binh Thuan ward to   b. 61 Om
Duy Tan Street through Le  c. 2.0 - 2.6m
Dinh Tham Street
d. 2.2 x 1.5m - 2.7 x 1.5m (b x h)
Details: Main problem in the area is that large stormwater volumes flow in from the
North. The existing drains in Binh Thuan ward, connecting the old Thac Gian Lake to
the Han River, have insufficient capacity to meet the current drainage needs. Originally
almost the entire drain from the old Thac Gian Lake to the Han River was to be
upgraded as part of the ongoing Phase 1 Sub-project, but due to assumed budget
constraints it was decided that only the downstream section in Duy Tan Street (from Le
Dinh Tham T-junction to the Han River) was to be upgraded.
2. Le Do Drain            a. Divert storm water from the Airport and 29/3 Lake catchment areas and reduce
From Dien Bien Phu Street to  flood risk in low lying area between An Khe and Xuan Ha wards
Danang Bay through Le Do  b. 1044m
Street                    c. 2.0 - 3.3m
d. 2.0 x 1.5m - 2.0 x 1.7m (b x h)
Details: Thanh Khe district is developing rapidly. Recent surveys and capacity
calculations have revealed that the district's drainage system needs to be upgraded to
be more suitable with the development of the District. At the moment, the run-off from
the Airport and 29/3 Lake catchment areas flows along a watercourse/drain north of
Dien Bien Phu Street (on the border between An Khe and Xuan Ha wards) through a
low lying area towards the Phu Loc River. This low lying area is prone to frequent
flooding. Now that these low lying areas are being developed into residential areas the
stormwater coming from the Airport and 29/3 Lake catchment areas will be diverted
through the future Le Do drain. Apart from improving the flood situation along the future
drain alignment, the drain will also largely reduce flooding near 29/3 lake and Dien Bien
Phu Street

3. Xuan Hoa Drain         a. Increase drainage capacity to evacuate storm water from the north-west airport
From Dien Bien Phu Street    area south of Dien Bien Phu Street and reduce flood risk in low lying area between
(Xuan Hoa pond) to Tran      Dien Bien Phu Street and Tran Cao Van Street west of Ha Huy Tap Street; the area

c. 2.0 - 2.9m
d. 2.0 x 1.5m - 4.4 x 1.4m (b x h)
Details :The catchment of this drain includes northwest of Danang Airport and the
northern part of An Khe ward. At present, storm Nater from this area flows in an
uncontrolled way in the direction of the Phu Loc River, flooding relatively large areas.
The low lying area will be backfilled up to a level of 3m and developed as residential
area. The new Xuan Hoa drain will allow transmission of stormwater flows from the
catchment area, while at the same time protecting the new residential areas against
flood risks.
4. An Khe Drain           a. Increase drainage capacity to evacuate storm water from the valley in An Khe ward
From An Khe pond to Phu      south and east of the railway; the valley is to be back filled and further developed
Loc River                    into a residential area
b. 550m
c 2.2 - 2.8m
d. 8.0 x 2.Om (b x h)
Details
The An Khe drain is a large natural channel originating from the western side of the
Airport; it crosses the low lying areas on the western side of An Khe ward and the
marsh area in Thanh Loc Dan ward. However, in this area, construction of the An Khe
cultural park zone and residential areas will be taken up and the existing natural
channel will be filled up. The existing natural An Khe channel will be replaced by more
compact concrete box culvert that will prevent the inundation of the large areas of the
present channel. Thus the channel will not relieve existing flooding of the upstream
catchment, but it will allow the development of the area in its surroundings.
5. My Khe Drain           a. Increase drainage capacity to evacuate storm water from the area south of Nguyen
From My Khe to Bac Me An     Cong Tru Street and east of Ngu Hanh Son Street; the area is to be back filled and
further developed into a residential area
b. 3290m
c. 2.2-4.1m
d. 4.0x1.5m-7.5x2.Om (bxh)
Details: The drainage system in Son Tra and Ngu Hanh Son districts is not clearly
established. In the districts' area there are only few drains, located mainly in new
residential areas. MIore are being constructed continuously, mostly in a west-east
direction, but they all suffer from the same problem, that there is no adequate outfall to
the sea. As a result, much of the wastewater generated in the area collects in some
low lying areas and in small streams meandering through the area approximately 300
m from the beaches. The new My Khe drain will be a 3100 m long collector drain,
parallel to the beach at distance of approx. 300 m, which will pick up wastewater and
stormwater flows from all existing and future drains in the area. At three locations,
outfall drains will cut through the dunes towards the sea.
The area is currently undergoing a rapid transition with many new roads being
constructed and low areas filled in. The new drain will be an important infrastructural
asset that will enhance considerably the wellbeing of the people living in the area.

3.5         Proposed Wastewater VWorks
The Phase I project will support the developmenit of a wastewater collectioni svstem  in each of four
wastewater catchments in Danang (Phu Loc. Hoa Cuon-g, Son Tra, and Ngu Hanih Son). Each catchiment
will thus be provided with a wastewater collection system, generally located near outfalls wvhere drv
weather flows of wastewater will be diverted from storrnwater drains, and conveyed to a wastewater
treatment plant. The Hoa Cuong and Phu Loc systems are lar-e systems, caterina for the "old" city of

The importance of this extension to the Phase I works is more svmbolic than quanititative in nature.
Danang City has seen the need to add more wastewater interception devices to its arsenal and is prepared
to bear the furure additional costs for operation (including pumping) and maintenance. This is a major step
towards local autonomy of urban wvaste.vater systems.
The Feasibiitry Studv proposed three additional, stand-alone systems that could pump wastewater from
the additional areas independently to the wastewater treatment plants. The detailed engineering study ' has
shown that integration with the Phase [ works is cost saving. The additional area svstems will not be
constructed all as part of a new contract, bLIt parts will be included in oncoine Contract 013,, while parts
of the wastewater coilection systems now included in Contract 0 l 3 will be moved to a new contract. This
has led to the following result for the wastewater collection svstems:

Son Tra          Will be integrated with the Phase I system. Parts in new areas along Mly
Khe Beach will be constructed under a new contract. Some Mviains of
Phase I works will be made larger (as part of contract 013) to allow for the
increased flows from upstream additional works to be connected later.
Ngu Hanh Son     Despite the only minimal addition, a totally new system needed to be
designed that reflects the changed drainage patterns in the area (caused
by new drain no. 5, the MIy Khe drain)
The wastewater component will also include HDPE covers for the t-wo small treatment plants at SoIn Tra
and NgLi Hanh SoIn.

Vietnam Three Cities Sanitaticn Project                        Additional W'orks Project - EIA
Danang Sub-project (Phase 1)                                                    August 2003
4 Baseline Data
4.1        Demographic Information
Danang is located in the centre of Vietnam, 964 km northi of Ho Chi Ntlinh Cirv and 764 krm south of
Hanoi. It is the fourth largest citv in, V ietnam after Ho Chi L.itinh Citv. Hfanoi and H-ai Phon a.nd ser/es as
the commercial and tourist centre for the central region of Vietnam. The city is located on national
Hiigh.vay I and the Trans Vietnam railwav and has a major deep water sea port and an international
airport.
On the first of Januarv 1997, Danang became a Class I Citv under the direct control of the Central
Government of Vietnam. This was accompanied bv the division of Quang Nam-Danang province into
Danang City and Quang Nam Province. The newv city comprises six districts; Hai Chau. Thanh Khe, Son
Tra, Ngu Hanh son, Lien chieu, Hoa Phat / Hoa Tho and two regional districts Hoa Vang and Hoang sa.
an island district. The land area of the newv citv is 942.46 kmn, and according to the Project's Feasibilitv
Study, has a population ofaabout 705,000 of which 560,000 live in the five urban districts.
Danang is projected to grow to 892,000 bv 2010 and to 1,002,000 by 2015.
The average urban household's size is 5.2 persons. Approximately SS% of housing is permanent and
semi-permanent; the remaining 12%  is temporarv. Access to clean water is enjoyed bv 94%  of
households, although only 49% receive their clean water from citv pipes. Shallow wells and o[her water
sources are common in Danang. Households having sanitarv toilets was 84%. Electricity was connected to
97.9% of households. The number of households having television was 78%.
4.2        Geography and Climate6
Danang is located on a relatively flat alluvial coastal plain at the mouth of the Han River on the east coast
of Vietnam. The alluvial plain is part of a coastal delta which ranges in width from around 5 km to the
north of Danang to around 25 km near Hoi An, some 25 krn to the souti. The land in the cencral part of
the city lies between 3 to 6 metres above mean sea level. Danang is bounded to the north by Danang Bay
and Hai Van pass to the extreme north, to the east by the South China Sea, to the south by Dien Ban
district, and extends to the west to incorporate Hoa Vang district.
The Truong Son mountain range, with elevations reaching 2 598 m, is on the south western boundary of
Quang Nam Province, some 80 to 90 km inland from the coast. Some smaller hills, such as Ngoc Ca
Nhong and Ngoc Ba Na, which are between 1 000 and 1 500 m high, lie around 25 k-m to the west of
Danang Citv. Drainage from these mountains runs through a complex river system involving the Fi'an
River, CaLi Do River, Vinh Dien River and yen River, with the Han River runniincg generally from south to
north into Dananig Bay. Sea ports have been constructed on the western banki of the Han River in the
central Danang and along ihe tNortheastern Bay region, in the Son Tra district. The 30km lon, beach
which rulis north-southi betNVeen Son Tra and Hoi An is earnarked for tourism development.
Danang is within a tropical monsoon climatic region that experiences high tempeiature and humidity. The
annual average temperature is 250C and the annual average relative humi.idity is 32%. The hot, drv season
extends from February to Auiguist, with the wet season occurring from September to Januarv. Average
annual rainfall is 2,066 mm. Conditions in Danang are controlled bv tile prevailingtr south-Westerlies which
flow over the TruonIg Son i"vountain range from around Nv-av to October, and the northi-east monisooni,
which operates from aroulid September to April

4.3        Flora and Fauna
Danang has been populated by lhumanis tor over 600 years. Ifencc the terrcstrial and brackish wvater
swnamp ecosvstems wvithin the citv's bouLndaries hlave Undergone drastic changes. In tile urban areas,
veg7etation is primarily in the form of small parks and trees that line the city's streets. Accor-dinig to
information obtained from the Danana Environment, Technology and Science Dept. there are now almost
20,000 trees in Danang. which creates 260.000 m' of green space. This equates to 0.35 m'/persoll. much
less than the Government of Vietnam requlired level of 5 m-/person (f'or cities above 200.000 iniabitants).
In suburban and rural areas, t'he natural flora hlas been cleared for agricultural use, and smnall strips of
planted Eucalpy spp., Casuarina spp, and PinLis spp, are found around the city's edges. In these same
areas. indigenous wild animals having been replaced bv domestic animals and animals that tilrive well in
urban settings (rodents, some birds, etc).
Due to the proximity to the sea and the formation of nature reserJes. the ecosvstems bevonid DanangJ's
sub-urban boundaries are diverse. Within an hour of the citv's limits, three specialised areas hlave been
established for conservation of the ecosystem and protection of the environment. These are: Son Tra
peninsula (4,070 ha); South Hai Van area (19,050 ha) and iNgu Hanh Son area (400 la). In Son Tra area
there are 289 species of higrher plants, in SoLith Hai Van area there are 501 species. The animals in the
specialised areas bear strong character of coastal fauina. fn Son Tra peninsula there are 30 animnal species,
51 bird species, 20 reptilian and amphibian species. In Hai Van area there are 55 animal species, IS0 bird
species, 10 reptilian and amphibian species. In Nigu Hoanih Son there are mainly large wood trees, bearing
the character of limestone and granite mountain areas. AqLlatic species are still abundant. In Ho Nai area
are found 30 plankton plant species and 29 plankton animal species. In Vung Thung bav there are still 33
plankton plant species, 21 plankton animal species and 32 benthic animal species.
In the sea off Danang there are over 50 fishi species, of which 30 species are of hiah economic value.
Plankton fishes are predominant (60%), living mainlv in the near shore and offshore areas (70%). The
fishes are mostlv of small size. In the near snore area of Danang there are over 20 squid species and 24
shrimp species. In addition to these, there are cockle-fish. stock-fish, pearl mussels, and corals.
4.4        Health and Gender7
i'viany health problems experienced in Danang are associated with hygiene due to an inadequate water
supply and wastewater drainage. These include diarrhea, bacterial and amoebic dvsentery, typhoid,
cholera,.trachoma, glaucoma, Dengue fever, scabies, and impetigo. Poor drainagse and disposal of water
can also lead to outbreaks of Dengue fever and malaria. Due to the social customs of che residents of the
area, suich as the washing of soiled clothing in the river, which also serves as a water source, and the
sharing of uncooked food and drinking of unboilecd vater, diseases qulicklv spread from one area to
anothler.
Nifanv women also suffer from uinspecifiecl bacterial vaginitis, candidiasis and trichonianad infectionis but
do not seeki medical treatment as the diseases are recul-rent and the treatment often requires several
courses ofmeclicatioln.
Due to the problems of obtaining water, particularly for residents of poverty areas, pond and river water is
used for vegetable garden irrigation1, hIousC cleaning andc planting watering. Thle Lise of these \vaters is a
health hazard as the ponds and river containi drainage and sanitaltioll efflulent.

considered that tile Unhgvzienic livimn conditionis and the resultant diseases thev experienced wvere related
to poor sanitation and drainage as miLclh as to a poor water suppiv.
vlost of the carrving of water, cooking, laundry and house cleaning is conducted bv women. Due to the
distance of residence from water supplies in some poverty areas (up to 1Om) laundrv and bathing is
frequently conducted near the water source, tvpically a wel'l, to save carryinga the water back to the
residences. Due to poor drainage around these wells, the wastewater from these activities ponds around
the top of the wells and percolates through the soil to contaminate the underlying groundwvater.
Women also carrv the burden of caring for Family members affected by water-associated diseases. This
frequently conflicts with their away homework commitments and places a burden on both thieir earning
capacity and their reliability for attending work. Improvement in the hygiene levels will reduce thle
frequency and severity of water-associated diseases and substantially reduce the burden of care that rests
wvith women and the consequent demands on their time and energy.
4.5        Cultural Resources
There are some small pagodas, ,shrines, and graves in the Additional Works Project Area. Mvtost of these
are located in Son Tra District where the Son Tra sewage line will be constructed. FLirther details on
cultural resources, if affected by construction works, will be identified in the Additional Works Project's
Resettlement Action Plan.
4.6        Air Quality
Table 5 summarises recent results of air quality monitoring in Danang. These data were collected in over
20 locations throughout the city as part of the Phase I monitoring activities (see Figure 3). These data may
not be representative of Danang overall ambient air quality because: 1) they are located purposelv close to
construction areas, thus, potentially skewing results to show higher than normal pollution levels; and 2)
the locations are distributed in a manner that may not provide representative data for Danang. However,
they are presented here for reference because: I) they represent some of the most recent and reliable air
quality data for Danang; and 2) each paramerer has reasonably precise data sets, regardless of spatial and
temporal differences in sampling; and 3) the results presented below are reasonably consistent with older
air quality data sets in Danang.

Based on these and older data sets presented in tlhe 1999 EIA   Report, it appears that Danan-'s total
suspended particulate levels (i.e. dust) aenlerallv exceed TCVN    standard. Respiratory ailments are
common in Danang7, and it is most likely that these ailments are exacerbated by high dust levels in the
city. Conversely, mean values for noxicus gases (e.g. carbon dioxide, nitrite, sulphite, carboin monioxide,
and sulphur dioxide) are well within TCVN, standard. Studiies of air quality in other Vietnamese cities9
vielded comparable results: mean dust levels are high and mean noxious gas levels are lov.

4.8         Receiving Water Quality
Drainage in Danan- flows either directly to the Han River, Danana Bay, the South China Sea, or to inland
lakes and depressions and then drain to the coast. Figure 4 presents 2001-2003 results of water quality
monitoring in receiving waters that are near the Project (see Appendix 3 for raw data). Some observations
can be made:
*   Coliform levels and total suspended solids levels usually exceed or come close to TCVN standard
for marine waters (for bathing, purposes) along the coast of the South China Sea.
BOD levels seem to increase and coliform levels seem to decrease as one travels south along the
coastline of the South China Sea. BOD and DO levels along the South China Sea are well within
TCV/N standard for marine waters (for bathing, purposes).
Coliform  levels in the Phu Loc river sampling location are several times higher than TCVN
standard for surface water.
*   The sampling location at Phu Loc river seems to possess much higiler concentrations of pollutants
and lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen, compared to the sampling, location at Han River.
*   Not withstanding the fact that Han River is one of the most intensively used rivers (marine
transport, urban development, etc) in Danang. the river's sampling location generally displayed
measured values within TCVN standards .for surface water.

5 Environmental Impacts of the Additional Works Project
5.1        Impact Assessment Methodology
The potential impacts of the Additional W'orks Project were assessed as being in one of five cate0tories:
1. NiO INIPACT. The potential impac. of a project activitv is assessed as NO  NIMPACT if the project
activitv is physicallv removed in spac- or time from the environmental component.
2. MINOR INIPACT. If an impact occurs but does not meet the criteria for a Mvlajor Irmpact it is
assigned the categoryv MINOR. Minor impacts could be "ivInor negative"' or "MNlinor Posirive."'
3. i'LXJOR IMIPACT. An impact is said to be 'MIAJOR if the project activitv has potential to affect an
environmental component. M'vlajor impacts could be "iMajor Negative" or "Major Positive." The
following criteria were used to determine whether a given impact is MvAJOR:
(a)   spatial scale of the impact (site, local, regional, or national/ international);
(b)  time horizon of the impact (short, medium, or long term);
(c)   magnitude of the change in the environmental component brought about bv the project
activities (small, moderate, large);
(d)   importance to local human populations;
(e)   compliance with national, provincial, or district environmenral protection laws, standards,
and regulations';
(f)   Compliance with Vietnam's international commitments. and
(g)   World Bank- guidelines, policies, and regulations.
4. MITIGABLE I'vIP.ACT. The potential impact of a project activitv on an environmental component
is said to be MAITIGABLE if there is potential for a major negative impact and( the proposed
mitigation measure will prevent the impact or reduce the impact to acceptable levels. The following
strategies were employed in this assessment (presented in order of priority):
(a)  Avoid the impact. To `avoid" means to be able to change some aspect of the project
design, construction, or operation such that the impact no longer occLurs (e.g., changing the
alignment of a drainage line to avoid resettlement).
(b)  iVlinimise the impact. To "minirimise" means to implement measures that will reduce
impacts to acceptable levrls (e.g., ensuring that construction equipment meets TCVN
industrial emission standards).
(c)  Rectify the impact. To "rectify" means to allow an impact to OccuL, then afterwards take
measures to rehabilitate the environment to a level wvhereby the impact is within acceptable
limits (e.g., rehabilitate construction areas).
(d)   Compensate for the impacit. To "compensate" nmeans to allow the impact to occLIr, then
afterwards provide non-monetary compensation (first priority) or monetarv compensation
(second priority) for losses created by the impact
D. UNKNOWN IMPACT. The potential impact of a project activitv will be assessed as being
UNKNOWN if the magnitude of the effect can not be predicted for any of the following reasons:
(a)  the nature and location of the project activity is uLncertaini;
I Key Vietnamese documents include: Lav on Environmental Protection (1993): Clf 175 Providing Guidaince orn thc
Iniplementation of che Lav on Environmental Protection (1994); CP 490 Circular lettcr of Guidance on Settinlg up and
Appraising thc Environmiental Impact Assessmntiii Report ror Investment 'Irojects (199s): and Tit:u Clhuan Vietnam (1995,
1998. 2001) - national ambient and industrial air/watcr quallitv standards.

(d)   the spatial scale over \vhich the effect mav occur is unkllowvn.
5.2        Summary of Impacts
The ElR evaluated a range of potential impacts that could occur as a result of the Additional Works
Project. The selection of potential impacts for evaluationl wvas based on site visits, discussions wvith CNi-lC
staff, URELNCO, DoSTE and others (see Appendix 1); and thirou-h reviewv of relevant docunients such as
World Bank's Environinental Assessment SoLircebook, Phase [ environmental assessment reports, the
Additional Works Project's draft Detailed Design Report and others (see Appendix 3). Table 7 provides a
summary impact evaluationi of potential impacts that could be created bv the Additional Works Project.
These impacts are further detailed in Sections 5.3, 5.4. and 5.5.

Vietnam Three Cities Sanitation Project                         Additional Works Project - EiA

5.3        Pre-Construction Phase Impacts
Pre-construction phase activities inclUde resettlemnent, land allocatioin, and land clearing. The impact or
these activities on affected persons (resettlers, land owners) is loni term and, in many cases, permanent.
The Additional Works Project is developing a detailed Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). The RAPs
objectives include: 1) providing recommendations to minimise resettlement and land acqulisition, and 2)
provide fair compensation schemes for those whose land. houses. cultural property, and czraves must be
purchased or relocated. The RAP is a stand-alone docuLiment that can be uised as a reference for further
details on impacts identified in thiis section.
5.3.1      Resettlement and Relocation of Cultural Property - MITIGAE-LE
About 70 households (350 persons) will be directly affected bv the Additional Works Project. Others will
be affected indirectly, in case land clearance is proposed to be carried out over a wider stretch along the
future drains. in addition, some graves will jneed to be relocated. Details of resetlement ilTipacts are fOund
in Volume 2 of the Additional WVorks Reports, the Resettlement Action Plan.
This impact of resettlement is assessed as N;ITIGABLE. Thie proposed mitigation measLires are, in order
of priority: I) avoid the impact by designing alignment to reduce the need for resettlement: 2) minimise
the impact by acquiring a minimal rigTht of way/cleared area in locations where resettlement may occur;
and 3) if the former two mitigation methods are not practical, compensate Project Affected Peoole and
Families whose graves need to be moved. The Additional Works Project's compensation scheme is
presented in the Resettlement Action Plan. The Plan has been prepared according to WB guidelines and
Vietnamese legislatioll.
5.3.2      Land Acquisition - MiTIGABLE
The Additional Work.s Project does not reCquire land, as ali drains and wastewvater systems will be built in
road reserves. However, not all land for the roads concerned has vet been acquired. The RAP assesses the
land acquisition netfds for the road reserve in which the drains will be constructed.
The impacts of land acquisition are assessed as being Nl\ITIGABLE. The proposed mitigation measures
are, in order of priority: 1) avoid the impact by designing alienment to redLce the need for land
acquisition; 2) minimise the impact by acquiring a minimal right of way/cleared area in locations where
the purchasing of land may need to occur; and 3) if the former two mitigation methods are nor practical,
compensate land owners for loss of land.. The Additional Works Project's compensation scheme is
presented in the Resettlement Action Plan. The Plan has been prepared according to WB guidelines and
Vietnamese legislation.
5.3.3      Health Risks Related to Mines, Explosives and Toxic Substances - MITIGABLE
Danang was the hub of significant militarv action dUlringy the American War. Pliase I pre-construction
survevs Llicovered numerous unexploded ordnance near areas that have not been excavated in recent years
(e.g. the landfill site, the wastewater treatment plant sites). However, the excavation areas of the
Additional Works Projects lie entirelv \vithin Lirbani areas that have likely been excavated to install
numerous underground utilities. DiscussionIs With UREtNCO suLgest it is unlikely for Linexploded
ordnanice (UXO) to remain in the proposed excavation areas. However, as with anv Lirban area, there is a
risk that construction activities may come in contact with non-explosive substances that are lharmniLl to
humans (toxic barrels, waste materials).

This impact is assessed as NIITIGABLE. This impact can be mhinimised bv employing the followvin
mitigation measures: I) .-A toxic and dangerous substance survey can be carried out on sensitive or suspect
areas prior to commenicement of construction. This will be done in discussionI with tile Government of
Vietnam.; 2) All dangerous/toxic substances must be safelv removed and sCcured before construction
work begins.
5.4        Construction Phase Impacts
Construction phase impacts are generally short term, localised, and reversible. As withI most urbanl civil
works projects, construction phase inpacts Lisually have negative human healtl, safety, and environmental
consequences. This section identifies the most likely impacts that will arise during constructioni. and
provides both mitigation objectives and measures to acilieve those objectives. As described in the
Additional Works Project's Environmental Mlanagement Plan (ENIP), many! of these measures can be
directly inserted into Contractor Specifications. This will help ensure that the measures are woven into the
normal scope of works, that the measures can be monitored, and that if the measures are not achieved,
thien there is a means to apply negative consequenices to the delinquent party (in most cases, thie
Contractor).
5.4.1      Generation of Dust - MINOR NEGATIVE
Mvlost dust in Danang originates from large open areas, most of them recently backfilled for development
purposes. The backfill materials Llsed are relatively fine, under the sun, the soils become ever dryer, there
is no growth, vet, and dust is generated in large quantities whenever trucks or equipment drive over these
vast barren areas. Compared to the dust from these areas, dLIst added as a result from drainage and
wastewater construction activities is very minimal.
Construction-phase activities that generate some dust will primarily originate from two souirces. The first
source is materials transport. project materials (soil/sand, construction refuse, equipment, etc) will be
transported by large trucks. During the course of materials transport, the following will occur: soil and
sand will be released as airborne particulate from the truick loads; 2) tires will stir up dust as the trlck
travels over temporary and permanent roadworks; and 3) trucks will releasing airborne particuIate as part
of eThaust emissions. The second source is the release of particulate matter from stockpiles of sand and
soil. The impacts of dust generating activities may be most serious during the dry season, when dust levels
are already well above national standard and rain is not available to naturally mitigate the impacts of dust
generation.
This impact is assessed as VlilNOR NEGATIVE. Althoug,h detailed quantitative data on the number of
vehlicle-trips and number of stockpiles are not yet available, it is assumed that thie incremental increase in
Danang's ambient dList levels WLould be negligible. This assumption is based on an comparison of Pilase I
dust level data against older data sets in Danang. Notwithstanding the assessment of minor negative, the
following mitigation measures should be employed to minimise dust generated by the Additional Works
Project: I) Water sprays should be regularly uised oin piles of sand; 2) Wind fences sIloLld be installed if
prevailing winds generate dust; 3) Project vehicles carrying materials should be adequately covered.'9
5.4.2      Generation of Noise - MITIGABLE
Numerous project activities can contribute to tlle generationi of noise : vehicle movement, construction
machinery (jackhaminers, drilling equipmenit, excavation equipment); generators, etc. As the Additional
Woriks Project takes place entirelv within all Lirban area, increased noise levels often directly affect
h1ouselholds, bLisiness, pa,odas, etc.
" The common rnitigation method ot spraying roads to reduIce dust has been Cound to create some saktvc hazards in the Phase I
project, and theretore. has not been idenriticd as a mitigiltion measure in this EIA report.

Tlhis impact is assessed as M[ITIG.ABLE. The mitigation objective is to ensuire that houiseholds.
businesses. pagodas, etc are not disLturbed b. excessive nioise levcis during colnstructionl. Nlitinl,tioll of ;his
impact can occur by: 1) Ensuringr noise-generating works (using engines, heavy machinery. etc) do not
occur between 2200h and 0700h; 2) Project vehicles should meet ICVN 5943 (1995) standards for noise
emissions; 3) Project vehicles shoLild avoid the use of horns in urban areas, 4) Construction1 equipment
should meet relevant standards for noise emissions.
5.4.3      Generation of Air Pollution - MITIGABLE.
Danang's ambient air pollution levels (CO, N0O. COC, etc) are generally around 20% of the maximnum
limit identified by TCvNi standards. [t is not expected that cionstruction activities will significanltty
increase air pollut;ci levels because: i) urban air polilution is primarily caused by vehicular traffic and
industrial emissions; and 2) the incremental increase in vehicular traffic in Danang caused 'by the
Additional Works Project is minimal, and 3) tihe Adcditional Works Project will emplov relativelv smail
pieces of industrial equipment for the majority of construction1 works. Notwithstanding these comments, it
has been observed that Vietnamese urban upgrading projects employ outdated and heavily polluting
vehicles and equipment. Also, the burning of wa,vstes near the constructicn site -  and ns,!, c/ic% in te
urban area -  is commonplace in Vietnam. Any of these activities can cause substantial amTounts of
localised pollution that are readflv noticed by the general public.
This impact is assessed as MITIGABLE. The mLtigatiorn objective is to ensure hat ambient air cualirt Ls
not substantially degraded bv emissions From cons:ruction wvor,%s. M'Weasures to mitioate this impact
include: 1) wastes should not be burnt on sie; 2) ali Project vehicles should meet their relevant vehicle
standards for exhaust emissions (e.e. TCViN 5947-1; TCV-N 6433) and all indistrial equipmenc should
meet relevant standards for exhaust em issions (e.g. TCVN 5939, TC\VN 5940); 3) preventive maintenance
be performed on all Project vehicles on a monthiv schedule. All safety features will be checked and
repaired as necessary to ensure proper operation; 4) Project drivers and operators will perform a pre-
operational check, of their assigned vehic,es and equipme&it at the start of each working day. Each driver
should keep a record of the daily and monthlv pre-operational vehicle and equiprrient checks.
5.4.4      Traffic Congestion - MITiGABLE
The Additional Works Project will require dozens trucks and utility vehicles be integrated into Danang's
Lirban traffic composition during construction phase. When these verhicles must work andior travel thlrougih
Danang's narrower streets (i.e. Less than 3.5m wide) there is a risk of increased traffic congestion. Whilst
:coniestion'" is rnot easy to define, the chances of construction creating a true traffic Jam -xvhere traffic
completely ceases - is much lower than if the sarne construction works Were undertaken in a developed
country. This is because the vast majority of motorised vehicles in Danang are motorcycles.'4 Motorcycles
and bicycles can easily navigate through narrow areas and tak-e uip veTy litle space. Furthermore, as
Danang citizens are used to travelling on less than ideal road conditions (due to floods, poorly constructed
roads, and debris on roads) thev do not hiesitate to manoeuvre around construction sites and otiher traffic
hazarcs.
The degree of additional tratffic congestion created duirinig colnstruiction largely depends upoCn the phvsical
alianment of the drain in relation to the roadt5. There are two tvpes of alignment: perpendicLIiar and
parallel.
Parallel Alignmuent: During the onrgoilng Phase I project, it Was found that most of the traffic
congestion Waas caused when drains are constructed parallel to thle road axis and take up
considerable part of tlie road. Especially in narrow roads, contractor's equipmnent often blocked of
the remaining free part of the road, leaving little to no space for trafFic. During thle Additional

Works Project, two drains will be laid parallel to or In the road axis (Dinh Thani and Le Do drain)
and one part of one drain will be laid directlv undernieathi the road (My Khc drain). In all three of
these street areas, traffic volumc is light and it is anticipated that flow rate of motorcycles and
bicycles will not be sigmificantly affected (see Table 8).
Perpendlicuilar Aligniiewt: Drains crossing the roads form much1 less of a traffic hinidrance. In
perpendicular alignments, the drain can be built in t-wo sections, therebv always leaving, half of
the road available for traffic. If this is insufficient, a temporary bridge will be built over the
section under construction, to allow more traffic to pass. Once the drain in the first road half is
completed, the bridge can be reserved for heavy traffic, while motor bikes will be allowed to pass
over the newly completed drain. Formwork and supports will remain inside the draini to prevent
overloading. Allowing motorbikes a separate pass wav strongly improves the smooth flow of
traffic, while at the same time safety increases (see Table 3).

The overall impact ofthis limpact is assessed as MIITIG.-\BLE. Tile mitigation objcctive is to eLSLure trattic
does not become congested in the constructioin area and that traffic hazards are tnanaied to inimiliise risk
to road users. MNleasures to mitigate this impact include:
I. All construction vehicles shall clearly displav a project logo, and project allocated number. If anv
vehicles are in non-compliance, then thieir identification nutmber and lo_o can be noted by any
project entities (e.g. the Engineer, URENCO) or the general public.
2. Speed limits for the construction vehicles should be 10 km/Jhr on construction site and 30 km/hour
in Danang citY. These speed limit sig,ns should be posted on the construction vellicles.
3. The travel route for construction velicles should be designed to avoid areas of congestion.
4. Separate traffic lanes should be desigynated for cars/t,ucks and motorcycles/bicycles.
5. If project works occur after dark, a lighting system should be maintained suchi that vellicles and
pedestrians can clearly see the construction area.
6. Project should maintain fences throughout construction areas. These fences should define clearly
the construction boundarv that does not occupy the remainira traffic road and ensure traffic flow
in residential areas.
7. Traffic wedges/islands should be installed to allocate reasonable traffic flow in rushI IhoUrS; 5) one-
xvav flow of traffic should be promoted whenever practical.
9. Project should supply traffic to co-ordinate traffic flow in areas that are suibject to congestion.
10. If necessary when constructing parallel alignments, some or all of the adjacent side'.'alk' can be
tised temporarily for motorbike and bicycle access.
5.4.5      Odour Generation and Occupational Hygiene - MITiGABLE
The Additional Works Project has potential to create localised odours and occupational hygiene hazards.
Odours can be created when streets are flooded with wastewater and when wastes are dumped rear
construction sites or into water bodies which accumulate at a given point (mouth of river, beacih, end of
drain pipe, etc). Occupational hygiene hazards can be created wheen solid wastes or wastewater (both of
which can contain vermin and pathogens) comes in contact with work.ers or the general pUblic.
The impact is assessed as MI1lTIGABLE. The mitigzation objectives are to ensure that odour is not
offensive to persons beyond the drainaae/sewerate work site; and ensure ex-posure of emploVees to
pathogens is minimised. The measures to mitigate this impact include:
1. Work- sites should be cleared of residual solid wastes and wastewater before works are
ulndertakenl.
2. Construction workers should wear appropriate protective equipment sucih as gloves and
construction hats, Waterproof boots to be provided where necessary.
3. Wastexvater should be pumped to nearby drains Whenever necessary.
4. Wastewater flows shouLid be re-rou1ted whenever necessarv.
5. Sensitive areas (seashiore, food markets, etc) shiouid be kept clean of liquid anid solid wastes
created by the project.
5.4.6      Damage to Access Roads - MINOR NEGATIVE

Additional Works Project will travel on similar quality access roads with similar levels of intenisity as per
Phase I, it is expected that damage to access roads xvill be similariv negligible.
This impact is assessed as MINOR NEGATIVE. Notwithstanding- the assessment of minor negative, the
project can undertake the followvin2 measures to assure minimal impact to Danang's roads: I) before
construction, the pre-project state of site access roads should be recorded bv the project; 2) during
construction, site access roads should be inspected weekly and repairs made as required during
construction; 2) after construction, site access roads used by the Additional Works Project should be
inspected and compared to records taken during Pre-constructioni. if nocable road quaiitv difference exist.
the road should be repaired to its original condition.
5.4.7      Damage to Adjacent Property - MITIGABLE
Due to the close proximity of personal and commercial property to construction areas, there is a risk that
project activities (drilling, excavating, etc) may damage property outside the project's right-of-way. This
may include erosion, cracking of housing foundations, loss of utilities, and loss of productive land.
Thiis impact is assessed as NvITIGABLE. The mitigation objective is to ensLIre that adjacent property are
not permanently damaged as a result of construction phase activities. The measures to achieve mitigratiOn
objective include: Contractor should use adeqLiate sheet fitting and shoringJ to prevent damage to nearbv
houses. These protection measures should be approved by the Engineer prior to initiation of work; and 2)
compensation should be provided for damage to adjacent property that occurred due to inadequate
construction protection measures. Compensation amounts should reflect actual value of damage.
5.4.8      Soil Erosion and Sediment Transport - MITIGABLE
There are four main factors that influence the significance of soil erosion and sediment transport: I) water;
2) slope; 3) exposed soils; and 4) sensitivity of areas receiving sediment/areas being7 eroded. The first
factor, water, is primarily from rainfall. About 2066 mm of rain falls annually in Danang most of it
between the months of September to January. The second factor, slope, is not substantial iri Danane.
Although the city's outskirts are mountainous, the city is located on a relatively flat alluvial coastal plain.
The third factor is exposed soils. The Additional Works Project has the ability to increase the influence of
this factor because it will conduct excavation activities in over 20km of drainage lines. These lines will
usually requiire excavation works that are 3-6 m deep and 3-5m wvide. A summary of estimated soil
excavation quantities for the main drainage areas is found in Table 9.

As Tablc 9 suggests. most of the excavated soil will be used either to till up the swamps and low-lying
areas in wlhich the drains are constructed or placed alongside the drain. There will not be a large amounlt
of "exposed" soil to increase sediment transport and erosion. Furtlhermore. due to a 7-monthl dry season,
the potential for excavated soils to contribute to erosion/sedimiient transport is greatly reduced.
The fourtlh factor, environmental sensitivity of receiving waters/area being eroded. is considered to be
mirnor. As Figure I shows, the receiving waters are large ocean bays or the -Ian river, Danang's largest
river. The receivinQ areas of the ocean bavs are sandy beaches with minimal biological significanice. And
althougL1 some beach areas have recreational significance, this significanice is only during the ciry season
months, when erosion/sedimentation would not likely affect beach quality. The receiving areas of Han
river are used primarily for transport and shipping. Ancl, althoLIgh the HiIan houses some small-scale
fishing, it is expected that erosion created by constrLIcting the Le Dinhl Thamil draini will not affect fisheries
productioll in the Han River.
Considerinig the above factors, it is expected that sedimenit tranispor-t anIcl erosioni createcl by the Aciciitional
Works Project will not occur during the seveni-milonithi dr-y season. It is also expectecl that a small amounlt
erosion/sedimient transport may occur during the rainiy season, but this can be managed via implemenitilng,
a number- of contiactor specifications.
This impact is assessed as MIITIGABLE. The mitigationi objective is to ensLire that erosioni of soil along
the new drainage alignment and tranispor-t of solicls fi-om constrLicion works to waterways is mhi inised -
especially cluring the rainv season. The measures to achieve this objective are: I) soil distuL-bance should
be kept to a mininmulm1 and not unldertakell unltil immedliately prior to worlks starting In that area; 2) surface
ruinoff sh1ould be redirected around constructioni area, especially durinig rainy periods; and 3) excess soil
must be disposed in the existing site (e.g. to fill a natulal clepression), alongsicle a ch-ain, or off-site in a
pre-approved location.
5.4.9      Impacts on Vegetation - NOT SIGNIFICANT
Tlhere is very little gireen1 cover affected by the additionial wvorks. No trees will need to be reimoved, but at
the An Khe drain and the MvIy Khe section of the My Klhe drain there are some sections with water
hyacinthi that wvill be affected. DuL-ing construIctioln, the areas affected will .be relatively small, but the city
has planned to fill the low-lying areas around the drains, so in the future, the swampy areas will disappear
completely. All othel- drains are located in road reserves and/or ulbanised areas and do not affect any
green cover. The affected areas are shown in the Table I0 below.

This impact is assessed as NOT SIGNIFICANT. However-, as a precautionary measure, the following
comments coLIld be added to the Contractor Specifications: 1) the Contractor- should not CuIt, destroy, or
remove, any trees or vegetation without the permission of the Engin1eer; and 2) If the Contractor receives
approval for any suclh acts, the Contractor shoLld replace any existing trees with neNv trees in anotlher part
of Danang city (selection of new vegetated areas should be decided in conjunctioln with relevant Peoples'
Committees); 3) the re-vegetated area should be carefully maintained for at least twelve months after re-
vegetation.

Danang Sub-project (Phase 1)                                                     August 2003
5.4.10     Water Quality/Quantity Impacts on residential wells - MINOR NEGATIVE
A rapid survey of local houselholds' groundwater near My Khe beach foulid that about 80% of local
people use shallow wells (6-7 m deep) for domestic water suppIV.18 These wells are usually in sandy soil
and are often within 15 metres of proposed excavation areas for wastewater works (feeding Son Tra
wastexvater treatment plant) and drainage works flowing to the South China Sea.
Most of the drains are less than 2m deep. For their construiction simple shoring methods are used and the
trenches are kept dry by pumping. Trenches are kept dry by means of simple pumps placed at the trenchi
bottom. They do not significantly lower the water table of the surrounding area. Moreover, in order to
economise on construction costs, pumping is only carried out at critical moments, notably the casting of
the drain floor. lImmcciately after, the pumps are switched off, as water con do little harm to the recently
cast concrete.
Wastewater collection systems require deeper excavations, up to, and occasionally exceeding 5m. For the
deep excavations, Larsseln sheetpililng is used. This type of sheetpiliig is provided with slots, thus
providing a permanent sheet wall that prevents water from entering the trench. As dewatering takes place,
not withi a cleepwell dewatering system outsicle the sheet piling (wlhiclh Would lower the water table in the
surrounding areas) but in the same way as for the slhallow draini trenches, the outside water table is hardly
affectecd. Moreover, wvater fiom the trench is cdrained off outsicle but near- the trenclh and will partially add
to the groundwater volumnes.
Grounlidwater quality will not be affectecl by constructioni activities, except in cases of careless
mainteniance oni site of heavy equipment which couldl cause oil spillage.
These effects are assessed as MITIGABLE. Maintenianlce of vehicles and equipment must not take place at
project sites if they could cause oil spills. (see also Section 5.4.12) If it is found that water quality and/or
quantity of specific wells is being compromised, theni the mitigatio1n objective is to ensure that Project-
affected persons should receive domestic water that is, at a minimumn, equivalent in quality and quantity of
that prior to construction. This objective can be achieved by supplying an alternate source of water for
residents whose water supply will be affected by construction phase activities. Alternate souIce of water
sIhould be - at a minimum - of similar quality and quantity to affected persons' traditional source of
water.
5.4.11     Drainage Construction Impacts on Public and Worker Health - MITIGABLE
Drainage construction works often create short-term changes to the environmental character of its
immediate surroundings (i.e. roads where the works are being conducted). In Danang -  particularly
during the rainy season - these changes can inter alia create increased risk of flooding and increased risk
of wastewater and hazardous waste pollution. As the Additional Works Project will occur in urban areas,
construction activities have the potential to affect public and worker health.
This impact is assessed as MITIGABLE. The mitigation objective is to ensure that members of the public
and workers are not exposed to harm from direct or indirect contact with the drainage works. Specific
measures used in Phase 1 project include: 1) auxiliary drains and/or pumps should be installed/operated to
avoid uncontrolled spread of wastewater for transferring wastewater to the other drains; 2) during rainy
periods, water in building drains and side entry pits should be pumped out immediately such that all
streets remain safe for driving and free of wastewater; 3) petroleum products, explosives, and toxic
substances used at construction sites will be kept in safe locations away from the general public; and 5)
safety fences around areas of excavation (see impact section entitled "traffic congestion during
construction" for more details).

Project implementation.

and 5) safety fences arolind areas of excavationl (see impact section entitled "traffic conuestion durinz
construction" for more details).
5.4.12     Oil spills near the construction site - MITIGABLE
Petroleum  products (gasoline, oil. lubricants) are critical to the successful implementation of the
Additional Works Project. However, if these products spill onto nearby roads, in the construction areas, or
into water bodies, then the human and natural environment will be impacted. This includes inpacts
natural ecosvstems (rivers, oceans); increased risk of vehicular accidents (created bv slippery roads); and
increased risk of accidents bv combustion of petroleum products. Petroleum spills cccur bv: I) leakage
from poorly operated/maintained machinerv; 2) leakage from refilling machines with petroleum products
on site; 3) dumping petroleum wastes into water bodies, drainage systems, or nearbv solid waste piles.
This impact is assessed as tvITIGABLE. The mitigation objective is to ensure that members of the public
and workers are not harmed bv direct or indirect contact with oil spills. Mleasures to achieve this objective
include: I) Vehicles, pumps, and equipmenit that are leaking noticeable amounts of oil shall be
immediately repaired; and 2) Vehicles, pumps, and equipment shall not be serviced at site bitt taken to an
offsite repair areas.
5.4.13     Electricity management near the construction site - MITIGABLE
The project will require the use of on-site electrical supplies for a range of equipment and lighting needs.
Several activities (e.g. excavation, pipe fitting) may need to take place near existing undereround and
above-ground electrical utilities. And the project may need to provide temporary sources of power for
households and businesses near project affected areas. All of these situations could create a risk of electric
shock or electrocution to workers and the general public alike. Since much of the project works will be in
and around water the magnitude of this risk is reasonably high.
This impact is assessed as ivUTIGABLE. The mitigation objective is to ensure that members of the public
and work-ers are not harmed by electrical equipment and cables reqLiired to conduct construction works.
Mleasures to achieve the mitigation objective should include: 1) only approved electrical cables and other
pieces of electrical hardware should be used on the project site; 2) only qualified persons should install
and maintain electrical systems used at the project site. These people will be cleariv identified by their
clothing/hardhat.
5.4.14     Damage to underground utilities in the Construction area - MITIGABLE
The Additional Works Project will create over 20 km of trenches in wvhich to lay drainag,e and wastexvater
works. Almost all of the required excavation will be in urban areas that houses a range of underground
utilities (petroleum  lines, electrical cables, drinking water lines, telephone cables, and dedicate
cables/lines for MAinistry of Defence and local police). The impacts of accidentally severing these utilities
are threefold: I) the safety of workers and local people mav be threatened; 2) Utility service to relevant
communities may be cut; and 3) legal action may be taken against the individuals or companies that are
responsible for the severing utilitv service.
This impact is assessed as tMITIGABLE. The mitigation objective is to ensure the project does not
significantly affect existin  uniderground utilities. MIeasures to achieve this objective include: I) the
Additional Works Project should acqulire informationi on existing, utilities from Dananm PC; 2) the
Contractor should develop a plan to avoid uLidergrouLid utilities prior to excavation.

5.5        Operation Phase Impacts
Operation phase impacts will be lona tern and cumulative. As the Additional Works Project is essentiallv
a set of Lirban environmental mitigation measures, the operation phase impacts are almost entirelv
positive.
5.5.1      Solid waste accumulation at drainage outlets - MINOR NEGATIVE
Racks are located at the end of each outlet. Thle purpose of these racks are to collect solid waste such that
it does not flush out to the Danang Bav or the South China Sea. If these racks are not clearecd of solid
waste on a regular basis, then: I) solid waste will accumulate, causing a foul odour at drainage outlets:
and 2) the ability of the drainage outlet to function properly will be compromised.
This impact is assessed as v'itNOR NEGATIVE. The impact can be further minimised by regulariv
cleaning the trash racks at the drainage outlets and disposing of this waste in the Danangr landfill.
5.5.2      Impacts on Dengue Fever- MINOR POSITIVE
Recent studies in Vietnam and Australia have found that Dengue fever can be significantly reduced in
urban areas by introducing !Vfegalocyclops spp., a microscopic copepod, into urbani drainaae svstems.
These copepods feed upon the mosquito larva whose adult form is the vector for DengULe fever.
illfegalocyclops spp. are common and harmless to hiumans.
This impact is assessed as a NiTs[NOR POSITIVE. llfegalocyclops so,. can be purchased for a small
amount of money from a Hanoi institute that specialises in their production and delivery around Vietnam.
The specimens can be released in several manholes throughout Danan. INo further management is
required - the specimens can easilv breed and distribute themselves throughout the city.
5.5.3      Water Quality/Quantity Impacts on residential wells - MINOR NEGATIVE
As noted in the construction phase impacts section, it is possible that residential wells mav be affected
(minimally). After completion of drains, it may be foLind that, as stormwater run-off will be discharged
faster to receiving waters, groundwater resources will be replenished less than was the case wvith an
inadequate drainage system. In addition, the presence of a drain may cause the water table to drop
somewhat, but only very little, as the drains are quite shallow.
This impact is assessed as M9IINOR NEGATIVE. In the long run, increasing popLilation densities and the
faster run off of stormwater may cause a lower water table. It is generally found that more and more
families switch from shallow wells to piped water supplv. The water supply company continuously
increases its supply in the areas affected by the project and this process may need to be marginally speed
up as an effect of the project.
5.5.4      Changes to Pollution Loads in Receiving Waters - MAJOR POSITIVE
The operation of new wastewater services to the Additional Works Project area will improve the water
quality of Danang Bav, Mly Khe Beach, and the Han River. This improvement wvill be brought about via
t-wo wavs. First, dry wveather flowvs *vill be i7tercepted and pumped to the waste treatment plant
constructed durinig Phiase I. ThroughouIt anl average year, depending on a drain's catcliment, thie drain
interception svstem will be enLaged except for 2 to 20 times following moderate to heavv rain events.
This is a substantial improvement on tile conistanit flow of septic wastewater from the drains to the
receiving wvaters that occurs at present. Second, nzltrient inputs to receiving waters will be sLibstanitiallv
reduced. The interception of the dry weather flows will minimise the flow of nutrienlt-laden wastewater
into the receiving; waters. During the tines that the interception system is by-passed, the volLime of

My Khe is a very sensitive tourist destination so efforts to improve wastewater
management at My Khe are of sinmricant benefit to the local economy and Oanang as
a whole.
The new My Khe drain will imnorove local wastewater management by: 1) collecting
wastewater that is presently filtering into the beach or sitting in stagnant pools of water
near the beach. This rmiigates the problem that current situation is both unattractive
and smelly for tourists; and 2) during the dry season-when tcurists frequent South My
Khe and add substantial pressure to the area's existing wastewater system-the

5.5.5      Changes to Flood Control in the Project Area - MAJOR POSITIVE
The operation of new drainag7e systemns in the Additional WVork's Project Area will substantialiv reduce
local flooding and its associated neaative impacts, such as traffic congestion, propertv damagne, and
human health impacts.20 Flood control is supported by the Additional Works Project in three wavs. First,
the frequency, extent and severitv offlooding will be reduced through the enhancement of the draina ge
system. This will have a broad. range of positive effects for the residents, including health and socio-
economic benefits, improved transport access to school, work, and amenities during rainy periods.
financial savings (less monev spent on flood protection, less money spent repairing flood-damaged hoLIses
and productive land). Second, damage to infrastrzuctzure and property will be reduced by the control of
flooding throuoh the enhancement of the drainage system. And third, the screening of wastewater to
remote litter will significantlv reduce the quantitv of litter reaching the receiving waters. This will reduce
the fouling of shorelines by litter and reduce the hiazard posed to aquatic life throLugh1 entanglement in the
litter and ingestion of the litter.
The magnitude of the positive benefits is directlv related to the reduced flood frequency of each drailnage
area. Table 12 summarises the expected changes to flood frequencv as a result of the Additional Works
Project.

decrease thle frequency and intensitv of odoLurs that mav affect nearby residential and cotinlercial areas
and thley wiHl enlhance the treatment process. This will, in turn, reduce the frequencv of both mild illness
and complaints bv local people regardina the operationi of Son Tra and Ngu Hanhi Son plants and will
have a positive impact on the effluent quality.
This impact is assessed as vI[NOR POSITIVE. The Additional Works Project has been specificallv
designed to achieve this impact.

5.5.7      Land Utility Values/Development Options - MAJOR POSITIVE
Improved drainage and wastewater will: 1) increase the land Lltility value in the areas where sanitation
conditions are improved; and 2) bring about new commercial and residential development options for the
Additional Works Project area. These benefits Nvill support the achievement of Danang's urbani master
plan.
This impact is assessed as NIAJOR POSITIVE. The Additional Works Project has been specificallv
designed to achieve this impact.
5.5.8      Solid Waste at Beaches - MINOR POSITVE
The Additional Works Project will purchase and support operation of beach cleaning equipment. The
equipment will be used along the yfv Khe beach area and other beach areas along the South Chinia Sea.
Beach cleaning will: I) improve the aesthetic value, and inter alia, tourism valiue of local beaches, and 2)
reduce the risk of disease (from vermin, parasites, bacteria) to locals and tourists who use the beach areas.
This impact is assessed as MIvlfNOR POSITIVE. The Additional Works Project has been specifically
designed to achieve this impact.,

6 Analysis of Alternatives
As noted in Section 3. the Additional Wor'ks Project was desigQned to seamlessly link and complemenit the
Phase [ project. This means that drainage and sewane techniologies. design s.andards, and operations
approaches need to be compatible wvith the recently approved technologies. standards. and approaches
from Phase I project. Hence. the practical list of options available for the Additional Works Project are
perhaps more limiting thani in more autonoinous projects.
6.1       Drainage Options
6.1.1     Le Dinh Tham drain
WithoLit existing innFrastructure, there may have been alternatives to the selected option. However. che Le
Dinh Tham drain designed under the project will connect to a larger drain in Duyv Than Street. presentlv
underconstruction. Selecting adiiterent option now, ifeconoomically attractive atall, Would make tle DuV
Tan drain partly unnecessary. The selection of this drain and its alignment was made during the feasibilitv
studv for the Phase I project.
6.1.2     Le Do drain
Three options were considered in the Feasibility study and engineering stiLdies.
Option 1: Upgrade the drain along the existing route
The first option is to increase the capacityv of the existing watercourse/drain.
AdSvantages:     The middle stretcih of the route runs through an open area requiring no cutting of roads
or relocation of affected persons.
Limitations.     Due to the distance bet ween Dien Bien PhLl Street and the Phu Loc River (>3km) the
length of drain needing to be upgraded is considerable. The limited available hydraulic
slope Would require the width of the drain to be substantially more than that of the
existing drainsiwatercourse. As a result of the densirv of the built-up area alona
particularly the up- and down-stream ends of this route, this option wVould require a
significant amount of relocation.
Option 2:Partially upgradle the existing drain and construct a new drain througih Chinh Gian and
Tam Thuan residential areas to Danang Bay
The second option goes through Chinh Gian residential area, a concrere enterprise, Lane 256 Tran Cao
Van Street and Tain ThuLan residential area. This is a draini of arOLInCI 950m long connecting Dien Bien
PhIu Street with Danang Bay.
Advantages:      The length of drain is relativelv short and traffic will not be obstructed muchI during
construictioni. Also, the access road to the houses along the drain will be inproved.
LiMitatiO7S.:    The available area for constructionl is verv liited; the route runs along narrow alleys.
Due to the limited space heavy machinlerv cannot be used resultingl In an increased
tine of construction and an increased cost of conlstrLictioni. Also the number of people
afFected bv the construction and thle people to be relocatedc is substantial.

Vietnam Three Cities Sanitation Project                        Additional W/orks Project - EIA
Danang Sub-project (Phase 1)                                                    August 2003
Excavation and construction depthi is large due to low invert level of tile existing drain in ;uanl -ia wvard:
the resultintz low invcrt !evel at thCe outfial rcduccs the capacity of tIre drain bCcausc of tidal intluence.
Operation and maintenance costs are also expected to be high.
Option 3: Construct a completelv ncwv drain along Le Do Street to Dalian, Bay
The third option has a drain running along Le Do Street. This is a drain of around II OO1n lonm connecting
Dien Bien Phu Street with Danane Bay.
,4cvantages:     The benefits lie in the less costly construction because of the accessibility for heavy
equipment and resulting shorter construction period; also the depth of construction is
less. Required resettlement is very limited because tihe downstream section crossing an
existing neishbourhood is combined with the construction ofa new road between Tran
Cao Van Street and Danang Bay for which resettlement is already onvoinr. Also
operation and maintenance costs are expected to be lower.
Limitc:tions:    Construction along the Le Do Street will cause inconvenience For local residents and
obstruct traffic. albeit temporary. The length of drain is slighctv longer thani option 2.
but considerably shorter than option I.
Conclusion:
Based on the above advantases and limitations, option 3 to construct a drain along Le Do Street was
chosen.
6.1.3     Xuan Hoa drain
Two options wvere considered for Xuan Hoa drain.
Option 1: Uparade the drain alona the existina route
The first option is to increase the capacitv of the existing watercourse/drain. This Would mean that the
open earth channel is to be upgraded to a box channel section with sufficient capacity to discharge the
incoming upstream flow as well as the local drainage.
Aidvanta7ges:    Almost the entire length of the. drain runs through an open area requiring very limited
cutting of roads or relocation of affected persons. Access to the area for heavy
equipment is good except for the first couple of hundred meters. The area the drain
runs through will be developed into a residential area and can tak-e advantage of the
drainage capacity of the drain.
Limitations:     The length of drain is longer than thle second option by around 300 m. AlthougLL the
slope along the first couple of uLindred meters is considerable, along most of the rouIte
the available (hvdraulic) slope is limited.
Option 2: Draini along Ha Huv Tap Street
An alternative route considered is similar to the one for the drainage of Sari Bav and 29/3 Lakes to the east
(Le Do drain). From the crossingr with Dien Bien PhuLI Street tile drain rulis eastward in Dien Bien PIhu
Street. At the corner of Dieni Bien PhU Street and FHa HFuy Tap Screet the drain tLirns northward. From
there until Danang Bay the drain continues along Ha Huy Tap Street.

..l(1iYllnlctgcs.L  This route is shorter (aroundl 900 Im instead of aroulid I '00 i) than t(ie e\istine route.
Requircd rescttlemielint is vcry limited bccausc the doxnilstream section crossinu an
existing nei-hbourhlood is combined with the construction ofa new road between Tran
Cao Van Street and Danang Bav for which resettlement is already onicolnu. The rest of
the route1is along existing roads.
Limitations:     The route is almost entirelv along existing roads increasing the cost because of road
reconstruction. Construction along Ha Hiuy Tap Street will cause inconveillence tor
local residenis and obstruct traf5ic. This route will require crossing an existinig drain
going east to west just south of the railway (connecting the lowv lying area between
Xuan Ha and An Khe wards with the Phu Loc River). This drain has a very low inlvert
level and special arrangements Would hlave to be made in order to prevent the inflow
of seawater during high tide. Also, this route does not address the drainage of thie area
itself berwveen Dien Bien Phu Street and Tran Cao Van Street kwest of Fla Huv Tap
Street.
Conclusion:
Based on the above advaniages and limitations Option I to construct a drain along the existing rouie was
chosen.
6.1.4      An Khe drain
The only available, and most direct, route for the new drain is along the existing channel aroulid the
Taiwan Textile Factory to Phu Loc River.
6.1.5      My Khe drain
Two drainage options for M[y Khe area were considered - one that drains East and discharges to the South
China Sea. and one the drains west and discharges to the Han rive.
Option 1: Discharge to MIy Khe Beach.
Wastewater from main drain is discharged to NMy Khe Beach by three outlets.
Outlet I is the same as the existing one between LNCguyen Van Thoai Street and the Mty Khe Beach Hotels;
however, the invert of the drain is lowered and the cross-section of the drain is enlarged to 7.5m wide by
2m high. The outfall will receive most of the waste- and stormwater of the catchment east of Ngo Quyen
Street between Nguyen CuonIg Tru Street and south of Nguyen Van Thoai Street.
Outlet 2 is new and runs along the north boulidarv of the Sao Paolo M\/onasterv. The dimension of the
outlet drain is 7.5m wide and 2.0m high. The outfall will receive most of the waste- and stormnvater of the
catchmnent east of NgL Hanh Son Street betwveen south of Nguven Van Tlhoai Street and nortil of Ho Xuan
Huone Street.
Ouitlet 3 ruis along the same route as the existing natural watercourse to tile south of the Furama Resort.
The dimensioni of the outlet drain is 5.Om wvide and 2.0m high. The oLItfall will receive most of the waste-
and stornmwater of the catchment east of NMLI Harnil Son Street between nor-til of Ho Xuan HLIong Street
and the Furamila Resort.

Vietnam Three Cities Sanitation Project                         Additional Works Project - EIA
Danang Sub-project (Phase 1)                                                       August 2003
Adlvc117tC1ges.     Two of the tllree outlets follow the route of existing. drains. All tile outlet drains
Followv the shiortest route to thle surface water. ConsequentIV the invert levels and
cross-sections of the drains remain within limits.
Disadfvanrages:     Mzly Khe beach already attracts many local and international tourists and is to be
further developed into a high class tourist attraction. Construction of outfalls at
these locations 'will cause pollution of the beach area. Debris will _ive the beach an
unattractive sight; wastenwater overflows will create unsafe swvimmino wvater due to
pathogens.
Option 2: Discharg,e to the Han River.
In this option, wastewater and stormwater from the main drain is evacuated in westerlv direction towards
the Han River.
The collected water from the north end of the drain is discharged through a drain (8.0m wide by 2.Om
high) along Nguyen Cong Tru Street; discharge throug-h the Le Huu Trac Street is no longer an option
since the recent construction ofa large drain with a slope towards the beach away from the river.
Water from the middle part of the drain is discharged along the Phan TIi Street bv a lO.Om wide bv 2.Om
high drain.
A 7.5m wide by 2.Om wide drain along the Ho Xuan Huon, Street discharges the water from the south
end of the main drain.
Advantages:          No wastewater or stormwater will be discharged along ivLy Khe beach reducing
the risk of pollution of the prized tourist area.
Disadvantages:       The construction cost is considerably higher than Option I due to the greater
length of drains as well as the l'arge construction depth necessarv to cross the
relative high level of the Ngo Quyen/Ngu .Hanh Son Streets carriageway.
Mvforeover, although the Han River is not used for swimming, debris will reduce
the attractiveness of the boulevard being constructed all along, the river.
Recommendation:      Based on the above advantages and limitations, specifically the high construction
cost of Option 2, Option I - to construct the outfalls towards the beach - is
chosen.
The negrative impacts of Option I on the environment can mostly be mitigated by constructing trash
capture devices upstream of outfalls as well as wastewater interceptors. The beach cleaning machines
purchased in the framework of this project will deal with any debris passing the trash capture devices and
inadvertently cast from the outfalls. Finally, pathogens can survive in salt water for only a very short time,
much shorter than in fiesh water.
6.2        Wastewater Collection
In the feasibility stidy, all additional wastewater collection systems were proposed as "stand-alone"
systems, Nvhereby wastewater fromn the additional areas would be collected in relative small collection
systems and pumped by its local pumping station to the wastewvater treatment plants. [n all cases the
desig,ns included laying of small sewer pipes parallel to larger pipes to be laid ULinder the Phase I project.
All three additional sewer areas constructed by tile Additional Works Project are located along the Rising
Main (Rivl) between an area sewered under Phase I and the treatment plant. It seems logical to plug in the
newv systems into the RIv that are going to be there already as a result of Phase 1. Econom-nic comparison
has showvn that integrating the additional systems wvith Pliase I systemis resLIlts in considerable cost
savings, up to 30%. Integration was selected, therefore, in all cases.

6.3        The "No Project" Alternative
If the Additional Works Project wvas not ulidertakeni the following events miay occur:
*   Wit/tout proposetl lraIiinage )vnorks: flooding in areas that are proposed to be serviced bv the
Additional Works Project will continLIu. This will Floodingz will continLle to exacerbate hiealthl.
transport and safety issues for local people. Land valies and development potential of these areas
Hill continuLe to be relativelv low, in part becaLise the areas lack drainage amenities.
*    Vitloutt proposedl ivastewater ivorks: some newv and soon-to-be cleveloped areas wvill produce
more and more wastewater. This wastewater will continue to dumIp either: I) directlv into natural
water bodies sucIh as SouthI China Sea and local rivers -  this will exacerbate human health and
tourism impacts; or 2) directiv on land, which will gradualiv leach .o natural water bodies,
especially during the rainv season - this will also create human health and tourism impacts.
*   Vithouit proposed covers onz vastewater treatmtent plnnts: the primary treatment plants will
develop an unpleasant odour. The odour will wvaft to nearbv residential areas. This unpleasant
odour may: I) make some residents unwell, therebv reducing local health; 2) prompt affected
residents to complain to relevant authorities, which ultimately may require that those authorities
make a decision on how to deal with local complaints.
* Withlouit Beaclh Cleaning> Efquiipmzent and( Services: Beach sections that are heavily used wvill
remain cluttered with solid waste. This will continule to exacerbate human health impacts of
people livincg near the beach (e.g. vermin, parasites, svringes, pathogenic bacteria), and retard
toLirism development in and near the beach areas.

7 Public Consultation and Disclosure
7.1       Public Consultation
OP 4.01 specifies that borrowers of Category A projects must consult project-affected groups and local
nongrovernmental organizations (NGOs) about the project's environmental aspects and take their views
into account. To date, the Additional Works Project has conducted: 1) district-level meetings in each of
three project-affected districts, 2) a fuill-scale project affected persons (PAP) suIrvey.
7.1.1     District-Level Meetings
The PMU Director chaired three meeting,s at the district level to discuss the project andci its impacts on
local people - including a presentation on the EIA and EMP. A summnary of each meeting is provided in
the below table. Meeting minutCes in (Vietnamnese with English tranislation) are foLind in Appendix 4.

Issues Discussed During Meeting:
 Chairman of Bac My An Ward supported the project. He noted that it will be important to
minimise dust and prevent traffic jams near Bac My An's beaches. He is keen to start
construction as soon as possible, in order to reduce construction time during rainy season .
 Women's Union of local wards and local people were in support of the project. They believe that
drain construction will reduce water-borne diseases. The noted that construction work should be
done in a manner that is neat.
* PMU Director responded to construction concerns and discussed the Project's EMP. PMU
sought co-operation with local organisations during project construction and implementation.
PMU Director also said that the EIA will be shown at PC wards and will be publicly available.

Example Discussion During Meeting:
Thanh Khe District People's Committee were in agreement with the Project. They stressed that
the Contractor should have good mitigation methods to minimise the impacts of noise and dust.
They are keen to start construction as soon as possible, in order to reduce construction time
during rainy season .
Women's Unions of affected wards and local people that attended were in agreement with the
Project. They noted that the impacts of wastewater flooding the streets will need to be mitigated.
They suggested that sheet piling for construction works will be important to maintain safety of
workers and local people. They thought public education/awareness raising on dumping garbage
in the drainage system would be useful.
* PMU Director responded to construction concerns and discussed the Project's EMP further.
PMU Director also said that the EIA will be shown at PC wards and will be publicly available.

dust were construction impacts of concern.
a Womens' Associations of Phuoc My, and An Hai wards, as well as local people supported the
project.  They had numerous comments regarding the importance of minimising wastewater
flooding during construction, concerns about building on soft sand, etc.
 PMU Director responded to construction concerns. PMU Director also said that the EIA will be
shown at PC wards and will be publicly available.
7.1.2      PAP Survey
The survey covered 143 PAPs out of a total of 187 PAPs. A sumimniary of houses affected and interviewed
during the PAP are shown in Table 13.

The survey was conducted during June 2003, when both the Resettlement Action Plan and EIA report
were beingr prepared. The survey visited each project-affected household to:
Inform PAPs of the Additional Works Project. Tlis included showing them maps of the project
construction locations, providing specific details on wvhen and where constrmction will occur near
their house, and providing information on1 the benefits the project will bring during operation;
* Receive information and advice from PAPs on the impact of the project on their households.
The survey found that PAPs were very supportive of the project and felt that operations-phase would
bring them numerous economic and social benefits. The detailed results of the PAP survey are found in
Appendix 5.
7.1.3     Future Public Consultation Activities
During project construction, EMP (Volume 4 of the Detailed Engineering Study) will support a series
social impacts surveys on households that were contacted during the PAP. These suL-veys will be used to
address OP 4.01's need for continued public consultation once the draft EIA report has been prepared.
The surveys will:
Update PAPs of additional works activities;
* Receive advice as to whether or not PAPS have been fairly compensated; and
*  Receive information on their perceived impacts of the project, and suggestions to mitigate any
significant negative impacts.

7.2        Public Disclosure
According to OP 4.01 and BP 17.50, borrowers of Category A projects are to provide a summary of the
proposed project's objectives, desc.ription, and potential impacts. For consultation after the draft EA report
is prepared, the borrower provides a summary of the EA's conclusions the borrower makes the draft EA
report available at a public place accessible to project-affected groups and local NGOs. To satisfy these
disclosure requirements the Additional Works Project provided information oln project objectives,
description and potential impacts during the May-June 2003 PAP survey (see Section 7. 1). In addition, the
project representatives have met with representatives of all affected Peoples' Committee wards duL-ing,

Appendix 5:. Project Affected Persons- Survey
Appendix 5.1: Survey Results
During the interview process, questionnaires were either completed at the survey time or distributed for
later completion due to absence of owner's houselholds. All survey results are autlheniticated by the
commune authorities and the questionnaire forms were signed by the PAPs to indicate their agreement
with the stated losses. In some cases, public meetings -were arranged by the peoples' committees to assist
collection of related survey data from affected houselholds (see Appendix 4.2 for a blank questionnaire).
The Socio-economic survey covered 143 PAPs out of a total of 187 PAPs for the five components. The
details are shown in Table ai and Table a2.

household size of less than four persons. 1.3 % of the PAPs have a househiold size between 4 to 8 persons
and the remaining 18.2%.household are w-ith more than 8 members.

Danang Sub-project (Phase 1)                                    Environmental Impact Assessment
Education
Out of a total of 506 people, 133 (26.2%) have attained or are currently having primary school educationi.
The number and percentage of people with secondary and high school education are 148 (29.3%) and 162
(32. 1 %) respectively. A total of 63 persons (I12.4%) have attained college or university education.
Occupation
According to the survey results, most of the households are either salaried persons working in government
departments (42.1%) or in business and commerce (37.8%). A small number of houselholds also earn their
living by fishing (9.8%) or through agricultural activities (9.8%). Being close to the bay, most of the
households among this category come from Le Do area. The pattern is similar when a comparison is made
betrveen the households in the four components. This is because all the four components are ulidertaken in
the urbani areas and imlost of then hoLIseholds either live within the urbani area or close to it.
Hotuselhold Incomiies
'vlajority (50.3%) of the suiveyed houselholds hiave an average montily 11ousehiold incomes ranging
between one to 2 million VND. The percentage of those earning below one million VND is 32.2%. These
households can be considered as poor houselholds. 25 households or 17.5%, have an average monthly
hoLIsellold income of more than 2 million VND. Mviost of these come fiom the Le Do area.
Perception of the PAPs about the Project
As expected, all the surveyed houselholds have shown fulil agreement with the project objectives and are
aware of the potential benefits that it will bring- to the society in general and to the people withinl the
project areas in particular.
