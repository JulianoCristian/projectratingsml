Definition of Terms 
 
Cut-of-date 
The date of completion of inventory of losses during 
preparation of the RAP. Affected people and local communities 
will be informed of the cut-off date for each Project component, 
and that anyone moving into the Project Area after that date will 
not be entitled to compensation and assistance under the 
Project. 
Eligibility 
any person who at the cut-of-date was located within the area 
affected by the project, its sub-components, or other subproject 
parts thereof, and would have their: (i) standards of living 
adversely affected, (ii) rights, titles, or claim in any land 
(agricultural, grazing or forest), house or structure (be it 
residential, commercial permanent or temporary), or (iii) 
production assets such as business, occupation, place of work, 
residence, or habitat, or (iv) access to assets adversely affected 
(e.g. fishing rights). Eligibility is irrespective of: (a) formal 
legal rights to land, or (b) customary claim to land or asset, or 
(c) having no recognizable legal right or claim to the land they 
are occupying. 
Replacement cost 
is the term used to determine the amount sufficient to replace 
lost assets and cover transaction costs. For loses that cannot 
easily be valued or compensated for in monetary terms (e.g. 
access to public services, customers, and supplies; or to fishing, 
grazing, or forest areas), attempts are made to establish access 
to equivalent and culturally acceptable resources and earning 
opportunities. When domestic laws do not meet the standard of 
compensation at full replacement cost, compensation under 
domestic law is supplemented by additional measures necessary 
to meet the replacement cost standards. 
Resettlement  
is the general term related to land acquisition and compensation 
for loss of asset whether it involves actual relocation, loss of 
land, shelter, assets or other means of livelihood.

I. INTRODUCTION 
 
1. 
Consistent with Government strategy of developing the sanitation and drainage 
components of urban infrastructure in Vietnam in the period 2001 to 2010, Quang Ninh is 
included in a three cities programme in a World Bank (IDA) funded sanitation project, 
together with two other cities such as Danang and Hai Phong. 
2. 
The project aims to reduce flloding, improve the environment, promote economic 
development, and strengthen the institutional capacity of the sanitation and drainage 
companies. To achieve these objectives, the project includes 4 components: (i) drainage 
improvement, i.e. rehabilitation, upgrading and construction of drains and channels; (ii) 
sewerage and sewage treatment, involving development of new sewers, septic tank 
improvement, wastewater treatment; (iii) solid waste management, which includes waste 
collection and transfer, upgrade and construct landfills; and, (iv) institutional strengthening.  
3. 
The Project loan was approved and came into effectiveness in 1999, its construction 
works commenced in 2000 and are expected to be completed by the end of this year, 2004. 
This stage subsequently became known as Phase I.  
4.  
As result of lower than expected bids for some Phase I packages of the Quang Ninh 
Drainage and Sanitation project, considerable fund remained available for a second phase of 
improvements. On 22 April 2003, Quang Ninh People Committee issued decision Ref No 
1260/QD-UB which confirmed the amount available for the Phase II as U$D 12,643,000. 
5. 
The Phase II of the project includes the following physical, proposed follow up works:  
In Hon Gai: 
-
Construct Wastewater Treatment Plant,  
-
Combined sewers, 
-
Separate sewers, 
-
Seweage pumping mains,  
-
Seweage pumping station, 
-
Rehabilitation of tidal gates, 
-
Rehabilitation of canals and drains; 
In Bai Chay: 
-
Combined sewers, 
-
Rehabilitation of streams; 
In Cam Pha:  
-
Rehabilitation of streams; 
6. 
Among the above mentionned works of the Phase II, construction and rehabilitation of 
combined and separate sewers, seweage pumping mains and stations as well as 
rehabilitation of tidal gates in Hongai and combined sewers in Bai Chay likely do not cause 
resettlement impacts as they either base on respective exising works or will locate on the 
public land. The remained works including construction of Wastewater Treatment Plant and 
rehabilitation of canals and drains in
 Hon Gai; 
Rehabilitation of streams in
 Bai Chay 
and 
rehabilitation of streams in 
Cam Pha 
will
 
anticipate permanent or temporary acquisition of 
land and loss of assets and properties attached, imposing resettlement impacts to the local 
population. 
7. 
Based on results of preliminary inventories of losses and census survey of project 
affected people, this RAP is prepared for guiding implementation of compensation for all 
related losses and rehabilitation of people affected by the Phase II of the Quang Ninh 
Drainage and Sanitation Project. After its approval by Quang Ninh PPC and achieving of no 
objection from the WB, the RAP will obtain legal status and guide all resettlement activities of 
the project’s Phase 2

II. SCOPE OF LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT 
8. 
The Phase 2 of Quang Ninh subproject involves Cam Pha town and Hon Gai and Bai 
Chay of Ha Long city.  
9. 
During process of technical designing, many efforts have been given by Consultants 
in cooperation with Quang Ninh PMU and local authorities, alternative options have been 
considered, mitigation measures have been adopted to reduce negative impacts on local 
properties and people, which would be potentially caused by development of the subproject 
physical infrastructure. Mitigation measures taken to reduce the scale of resettlement 
impacts include followings: 
 
(i) 
The laying of pipes, raising mains, interceptor sewers..., wherever possible, 
has been designed in sidewalks, right of ways or in the areas of road corridor 
to avoid land acquisition and impacts on local assets. 
(ii) 
Slight adjustment of the existing sewers and drains alignment to reduce level 
of loss of properties and impacts on the local population. Sometimes, 
wherever possible, considerable realignments of drains and sewers have 
been taken to avoid relocation of the population; 
 
(iii) 
To reduce negative impacts caused by land acquisition for construction of 
sewers pumping stations and installation of WWTP, priorities have been given 
to select public land or land of lower economic value, in the as much as less 
populated areas. 
 
(iv) 
Selection of location of proposed access roads along the canals in Cam Pha 
and Bai Chay and location for Ha Khanh WWTP to the side that causes fewer 
property impacts and losses, or realignment of the proposed canal bank to 
avoid or reduce scale of resettlement; 
 
(v) 
Removing off certain section of project’s proposed access roads has avoided 
relocation of several potentially relocating PAPs and reduce level of impacts 
and number of PAPs in Quang Hanh (the Stream Km8), Cam Thinh ward (the 
Eastern Stream of Mechanical Enterprise) and Cam Thach wards (Cay Si 
stream) of Cam Pha town. 
 
10. 
According to resuIts of Census and inventory of affected assets, it is anticipated that 
the Phase II of Quang Ninh project will impact about 346,747 m2 of land, of which 332,471 
m2 will be acquired permanently (179,972 m2 of private and 152,499 m2 of public or other 
special use land) and only 308 m2 will be acquired temporarily (Table 1). There are 24,796 
m2 of residential  land and 149,144 m2 of gardern and agricultural land will be affected by 
the project’s phase 2. In total, about 11,233 m2 of house and secondary structures, 2009 m2 
of animal stable, 10,999 m2 of brick protection walls will be affected (See more details in 
Annexes 1-3) .

11. 
The total number of households to be potentially affected by the project is 520, with 
2,079 persons. Among the affected households, the subproject poses severe impacts on 123 
households: about 117 households will have to be relocated to the new place, 6 households 
will rebuild their main house on remaining land and 55 HHs, besides of relocation, will also 
loose 20% or more of total agricultural landholdings. There are 7 households lose their 
rented lodgements. The subproject will marginally affect 397 households, either losing 
garden land, brick protection walls, access bridges or some trees. A summary of 
resettlement impacts on PAPs for the Phase 2 of the project is presented in the Table 2

for affected people. A close cooperation between  the PMU and local authorities and related 
departments/agencies will be necessary to complete the different resettlement activities 
successfully. 
III. SOCIO-ECONOMIC 
INFORMATION 
3.1.  
Source of information 
13. 
Socioeconomic information of this RAP has come from several sources: (i) results of 
inventory of loss for 100% of affected households of Quang Ninh Project; (ii) results of socio-
economic household survey of from 15% and more marginally affected and more thana 50% 
of relocated HHs and severely affected farmers losing more than 20% of their total 
agricultural holding and consultation with the them; (iii) results of formal and unformal 
meetings and group disscussions with local authorities and social groups in project impacted  
areas. All these surveys were held by resettlement consultants in the October and November 
of 2004, in cooperation with Quang Ninh PMU and local authorities. There were special 
interviews with groups of severely affected people to collect data on (i) specific resettlement 
needs of relocating/severely affected and vulnerable groups of PAPs, (ii) resettlement 
concerns and preferences of affected families, and (iii) measures to minimize negative 
impacts. 
 
3.2. 
Impacts on land and structures 
14. 
Rehabilitation and/or construction of drainage and sewereage systems generally 
pose of linear character land acquisition impacts that mostly are marginal. However, the 
proposed construction of WWTP with its buffer zone and serewage/drainage accsess roads 
require considerable land for development. Thus, construction of the WWTP alone will 
require about 29.3 ha of land, of which the plant’s core area only recovers 7.0 ha belonged to 
16 HHs (with 4 HHs subjecting relocation) and  1 cool mining enteprise to be affected, while 
the WWTP’s buffer zone will require further 22.3 ha, causing relocation impacts to additional 
100 HHs. In total, there 18.0 ha of private land use rights will be acquired. Meanwhile, 
development of drainage and sewereage channels system will replace certain 12 HHs from 
their existing sites. In total, as mentioned above, there are 520 HHs with 2079 people will be 
impacted by the project, among which 117 HHs have to be relocated, 6 HHs have to rebuild 
houses on remaing land behind, 12 relocated HHs will also lose their commercial land, 7 
PAPs losing their rented housing, 55 HHs having their agricultural income severely affected. 
 
3.3. 
Socio-economic characteristics of PAPs: 
Demographic features:  
15
.
In cooperation with the PMU and with assistance of local authorities, the consultant  
have conducted census of all affected people and their sample socio-economic survey, 
paying special attention on severely affected HHs, including severely affected farmers and 
relocated PAPs. The survey was carried out during the November-December, 2004. 
According to results of the surveys of PAPs, almost all the HHs (99.6%) are of Kinh ethnic 
group. Exception is made only 2 HHs who are from Dao ethnic minority group)  
16. 
The Tables 3 and 4 below provides general demographic data of the PAPs and of 
their household’s heads. The average household’s size of the affected population is of 4.1 
person/HH, with the male ratio is of 52.6% of the total population, and chiledren under 18 
years old consist of 22.3 of the popultaion. The average number of labor of HHs is of 2.4 
pers/HH.

18. 
In general, the average education level of PAPs is considerable high, equal 9.3 of 
schooling years among those havingn’t got high education. The education of the HHHs in Bai 
Chay is higher than the total average ones. Illiteracy rate is quite low, equal to 1.9% for the 
whole project’s affected communities. Illiteracy is found mostly among the people aged 
above 60, where their average age is 63.7 as shown in the Table 4. However, in Ha Khanh 
commune of Han Gai, the illiteracy exists among some people between 40 and 60 years old. 
About  4.4% of the HHHs have high education.

Results of sample HH’s socio-economic survey again confirm the relative high 
education level of the affected population, where the average schooling attendance years is 
equal  (see Annex 4). Like the common situation of the country, the Illiteracy doesn’t exist 
among the young generation of affected people. 
3.5. Occupation: 
20. 
Cam Pha, Hon Gai and Bai Chay all are urban areas. The main industries of  Quang 
Ninh in general, and the towns/city in particular, include cool mining, shipping, tourism, and 
trade. The non-agricultural activities provide sources incomes for almost all affected 
households. The cool-mining and related industries provides employment and incomes for 
main part of its population. Cam Pha is the heart of the inductry. It likely describe why the 
occupation in state enterpises and retired income consist the most part of the surveyed 
PAPs. Tourism and tourism-related activities contribute very important shares in the local 
economy, especially for Bai Chay ward. Hon Gai is an important commercial center not only 
of the province, but also of the Northern Coastal region. Agricultural activities contribute a 
very modest part of HHs income among the affected population, or generally do not play the 
role. Exception is the case of Ha Khanh ward, where the WWTP is proposed. In Ha Khanh, a 
recently urbanized ward of Hon Gai, where swamp land is more or less left for cultivation and 
farming, a considerable part of local HHs still are engaged in agriculture (involving 26.5% of 
their active labors). They are specialized on production of vegetables and green spices, pig 
and fish raising, serving demand of the local towns including Ha Long city (Hon Gai, Bai 
Chay) and Cam Pha. For many PAPs of Ha Khanh, besides of non-farm sources, cultivation 
in residential garden serves as important source of household’s green diet, which usually has 
missed in their employment or income source records. The envisaged displacement of PAPs 
from the core area and buffer zone of the proposed WWTP will pose severe impacts on 
considerable number of Ha Khanh PAPs. 
21. 
The Table 6 and 7 below clearly present about the main economic activites of the 
affected population and their HHHs. More information on economic activities is provided in

22. 
Thank to dynamic economic development and related availability 
non-farm employment in project towns, the average income level of 
the area is satisfied moderate. This is reflected in results of the 
socio-economic survey of the PAPs, conducted by consultant during 
the RAP preparation. Total Average monthly income per capita for all 
PAPs surveyed is of 529,000 VND (See Table 8). There only 2 HHs 
among the total 129 HHs surveyed have average per capita income 
between 100,000- 200,000 VND/pers/month. Meanwhile, there 10 PAPs 
(7.7%) have average monthly income per person is higher than 
1,000,000VND/pers.month. The Table 9 presents distribution of PAPs 
according to income levels by project wards. (See more details in

All the PAPs surveyed have semi- or permanent houses. The ratio of HHs having 
permanent house and flushing toilets as well access to tape safe water is found higher in Bai 
Chay and Hon Gai inner wards than in Ha Khanh of Hon Gai and wards of Cam Pha towns. 
The access to safe water is short in Ha Khanh, where water pollution is widespread and 
causing serious health problem for local population, especially for the hamlet 3 which is 
closer to the pollution sources. (See Annexe 6) 
24. 
Possession of relatively valuable assets by the PAPs surveyed also confirmed about 
general average and above average living standards of the population. All HHs have access 
to electricity. Different levels of living standards could be easily discovered with possession 
of telephone, washing machine or consumption of gas for cooking...  (See Table 10)

IV.  
LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
4.1. 
World Bank Policy on Involuntary Resettlement 
25. 
The World Bank experience indicates that involuntary resettlement under 
development projects, if unmitigated, often give rise to severe economic, social, and 
environmental risks: production systems are dismantled; people face impoverishment when 
their productive assets or income sources are lost; people are relocated to environments 
where their productive skills may be less applicable and the competition for resources 
greater; community institutions and social networks are weakened; kin groups are dispersed; 
cultural identity, traditional authority, and the potential for mutual help are diminished or lost. 
Thus the World Bank policy regulated by OD 4.30 includes safeguards to address and 
mitigate these impoverishment risks. 
26. 
The basic guiding principle of the World Bank resettlement policy is that: 
(a) 
Involuntary resettlement should be avoided where feasible, or minimized 
exploring all viable alternative in project design; 
(b) 
Where it is not feasible to avoid resettlement, resettlement activities should be 
conceived and executed as sustainable development programs, providing 
sufficient investment resources to enable the person displaced by the Project to 
share in profit benefit. Displaced persons should be meaningful consulted and 
should have opportunities to participate in planning and implementing 
resettlement programs. 
(c) 
Displaced persons should be assisted in their efforts to improve their livelihoods 
and standards of living or at least to restore them, in real terms, to pre-
displacement levels or to levels prevailing prior to the beginning of project 
implementation, whichever is higher. 
 
27. 
The main objective of WB’s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement is to ensure that PAPs 
should be assisted to improve their living standards, income level and income generating 
capacity, or at least would be as well off as without the project. The policy stipulates that lack 
of legal certificate on land will not be an obstacle for a part of affected people to be entitled to 
compensation and rehabilitation. The policy requires that compensation for all losses should 
be made at replacement cost, without depreciation and deduction of savage materials. 
4.2. 
Relevant Vietnamese laws and bylaws 
28. 
In recent years, especially in 2003 and 2004, the Government has formulated several 
rules and regulations to protect the interests of displaced persons. Relevant Laws and 
bylaws that govern various aspects of land acquisition and resettlement include: 
 
(i) 
The Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, dated 15 Apr 1992. 
(ii) 
The New Land Law, dated on 26 November 2003, replaced the Land Law of 
1993 
(iii) 
The Decree 181/2004/ND-CP, dated 29 October 1004, providing guidelines for 
implementation of the New Land Law 2003. 
(iv) 
Decree 188/ND-CP, dated 16 November 2004, providing methods of evaluation 
of land prices and the frame for the prices of various categories of land. 
(v) 
The Circular No 114/2004/TT-BTC issued by MOF on 26 November 2004, 
providing guidelines for implementation of  the Decree No188/ND-CP 
(vi) 
Decree 197/CP, dated 3 December 2004, on compensation, assistance and 
resettlement in case of the Government recover land for the national and public 
interest. And issued guidelines in Circular No116/TT-BTC by the MOF, 7 
December 2004, for implementation of the Decree No197/ND-CP

.
The New Land Law 2003
,
regarding the land use rights and land acquisition, 
contains a number of new provisions and approaches, closer to the WB’s resettlement 
objectives and principles, which could be summarize as follows: 
i) Land Law 2003 gives new provisions toward land ownership: 
-
The State retains its prominent rights for land: right to decide purposes of land use through 
land use planning, land use plans; regulate duration of land use, land allocation, give land for 
rent, acquision of land, evaluate land prices.  
-
State retains its right to benefit from land through land financial policy, including right for 
regulating the value added of the land that is not a result of the land user’s investment. 
ii) The Land Law 2003 provides new regulations on land acquisition and land compensation, 
resettlement of people losing the acquired land: 
-
The State acquires land for purposes of Defence, National Security, National Interests, 
Public Interests, Economic development.  
-
At least ninety days before land recovery, for agricultural land, and one hundred and eighty 
days, for non-agricultural land, the competent State agencies shall have to notify the persons 
having land to be recovered about purpose of land acquisition, time and plan of relocation, 
overall plan of compensation, land clearance and resettlement. 
-
Compensation for land is based on the type of land use existed at the time the Decision on 
the land acquisition is issued. 
-
The persons losing the acquired land shall be compensated with the assignment of new 
land of the same land use purposes; if there no land available for compensations, the 
affected persons shall be compensated with the value of land use right existed at the time of 
issuance of decisions on land acquisition. 
-
Provincial PCs, PCs of Cities under direct Central Government prepare and should carry 
out resettlement projects before acquiring land for compensation with provision of dwelling 
house, residential land to affected persons who lose residential land and have to be 
relocated. Resettlement Sites should have at least equal or better conditions than the former 
ones. 
-
In cases there no resettlement sites available, the affected persons shall be compensated 
in cash and given priority to purchase or lease dwelling houses under the State’s ownership, 
for urban areas; be compensated with residential land, for rural areas; in cases if the value of 
land use right of the recovered land is higher than that of the land compensated, the affected 
persons shall be compensated for such differences in cash. 
-
In case of recovering productive land of households and/or individuals who are directly 
engaged in production, but there no land available for compensation to continue production, 
then besides of cash compensations, the affected persons shall also be assisted by the State 
for rehabilitation of their living conditions, for training to shift into new occupations, or be 
arranged for new employment. 
iii)  
Land Law 2003 has defined principles for State’s evaluation of land prices:  
-
Reflecting market price of land use right transfer, in normal market conditions; in case of 
existence of great difference between the identified land prices and the local market ones, it 
should be adjusted accordingly  
-
the bordering each other plots, having similar natural, socio-economical, infrastructure 
conditions, being under similar existing and planned type of land use, will have similar land 
prices; 
Page  17
Technical study of  "Quang Ninh Drainage and Sanitation Development Project” 
Resettlement Action Plan, Final,  6
th
 May, 2005.
 
12
-
land located in areas bordering between provinces, cities under Central Government, 
having similar natural, socio-economical, infrastructure conditions, under similar existing and 
planned type of land use, will have similar land prices; 
iv)  
Land Law 2003 provides: land prices regulated by PPC or PC of Cities under direct 
Central Government, will be publicly announced every the First of January annually. 
v)  
Lan Law 2003 clearly states about application of the Law, in which the Clause 2 of 
Article 3 regulates:  
-
In case if International treaties, which the Socialist Republic of Vietnam has signed or 
acceded, contain provisions different from the provisions of this Law, the provisions of such 
international treaties shall be applied. 
Decree 197/CP 
30. 
In this December, the 3rd, 2004, the Government has issued the Decree No 197/ND-
CP providing policy on compensation, assistance and resettlement in case the Government 
recover land, replacing the Decree No/1998/CP.  The Government has also issued 
guidelines for the implementation of this Decree (116/2004/TT-BTC). Along with the New 
Land Law 2004,
 the Decree 197/CP is one long more step approaching closer to the WB’s 
policy on Involuntary Resettlement. The main new contents of compensation and 
resettlement policy of the Decree 197/CP includes follows:   
 
(i) 
The Government limits its scope of compensation, assistance and resettlement, 
encouraging private project developer/investor itself to negotiate with affected 
people on compensation and resettlement;  
(ii) 
Assign PPCs to prepare and implement resettlement projects to compensate 
relocating people with housing or residential land before acquisition of their 
land.  
(iii) 
The Government unified compensate the recovered land with the price 
announced by the local PPC on the first day of the year, as governed by the 
Land Law 2003. The land price is reflecting market price of land use rights 
transfer in normal market conditions; 
(iv) 
The affected person losing land will be compensated with the land of the same 
land use purpose. In case there no land is available for “land for land” 
compensation, he/she will be compensated at the price reflecting the land use 
value at the time the Decision on land acquisition is issued; 
(v) 
Compensation for residential land is based on the actual land use;  
(vi) 
Regarding the agricultural land scattered in urban residential area and 
residential garden land and pond, besides of compensation for them as for 
agricultural land, there also will be given assistance equal from 20 to 50% of the 
actual value of the residential land of the same plot; 
(vii) 
Affected houses and structures attached to the acquired land are compensated 
at replacement cost without depreciation and deduction of salvage materials; 
(viii) 
Affected crops and trees are compensated at market and replacement cost 
respectively; 
(ix) 
Involuntary relocated person can choose one of the three relocation option: (a) 
compensated with housing; (b) compensated with assignment of a new 
residential plot; (c) compensated in cash for self relocation.  
(x) 
Assigned by PPC resettlement implementation unit has to inform affected 
person on proposed relocation options and publicly announced the options at 
their office and at local commune/ward People Committee where the project 
recovers the land and at resettlement site at least 20 days before the competent 
authority approve the resettlement option;

(xi) 
Rehabilitation assistance measures should be provided to the severely affected 
persons, including relocated people and those having income generating 
capacity affected; 
(xii) 
The rights and obligation of affected persons for compensation and 
resettlement; 
(xiii) 
Enforce implementation of the Decision on land acquisition to the case of 
violation. 
31. 
Generally the Land Law 2003 and Decree 197/CP almost meet the objectives of 
WB’s policy on involuntary resettlement.

V. compensation 
policy 
 
5.1.  
Objectives of resettlement 
32. 
The main objective of this Resettlement Plan (RP) is to ensure that all Project Affected 
Persons (PAP's) will be compensated for their losses at replacement cost
 
and provided with 
rehabilitation measures to assist them to improve, or at least maintain, their pre-project living 
standards and income earning capacity. 
33. 
The RP is based on (i) a census and inventory of affected assets and properties of 
100% of PAPs in the areas affected by the project’s physical components; (ii) on a 
socioeconomic survey with  50% of potentially relocating and severely PAPs and from 15% 
to 20% of all other, marginally affected PAPs, (iii) group discussions with PAPs, and (iv) 
consultation with local authorities and other concerned stakeholders. 
34.. 
The policies and principles adopted for compensation, relocation, and rehabilitation of 
the project affected people of the Project Phase II have been developed in accordance with 
the Resettlement Policy Framework approved by the Vietnam Government and WB on the 
project Appraisal.. It is based on results of surveys and followed Vietnam's legislation and the 
World Bank Operational Directives: OD 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement, OD 4.20 on 
Indigenous People and OPN 11.03 on Cultural Property. Wherever a gap exists between 
WB’s 
Policy on Involuntary Resettlement
 and Vietnamese law, the policies and principles 
adopted for the Project supersede the provisions of relevant decrees currently in force in Viet 
Nam 
 
35. 
After the RAP’s improvement of by Quang Ninh PPC and no objection from WB, the 
provisions and policies of this RAP will form the legal basis for the implementation of 
resettlement activities for the Phase II of Quang Ninh Drainage and Sanitation project. 
 
5.2. 
Project affected people 
36. 
A PAP is any person or persons, household, a firm or private institution, who, as of 
the cut-off date of the Project or any of its subcomponents or parts thereof, would have their: 
 
(i) 
Right, title or interest in any house, land (including residential, commercial, 
agricultural, forest and grazing land) or any other fixed or moveable asset 
acquired or possessed or otherwise adversely affected, in full or in part, 
permanently or temporarily; and/or 
(ii) 
Business, occupation, work, place of residence or habitat adversely affected, 
with or without displacement; and/or

date 
of eligibility for entitlement is the 14 December 2004, the date of 
completion of the inventory of losses survey for Quang Ninh project. 
 
5.3. Resettlement 
impacts 
38. 
As mentioned above, the Quang Ninh project will cause impacts on 520 HHs (with 
2079 people) and 14 collective units. So far the most PAPs haven’t got land use certificates, 
thus in many cases, it is still unclear about the legality of land use rights of the PAPs, 
especially regarding the cases of illegal encroachment on the public land. There 121 HHs are 
severely affected, among which 116 HHs have to be relocate  to new site, HHs have to 
rebuild their main houses on the remaining land, 13 HHs have their business affected and 55 
HHs (215 persons) will lose more than 20% of their agricultural holding. About other structure 
is impacted. The scope of land acquisition and resettlement impacts are summarized as

VII. Public consultation and grievance addressal 
7.1. 
Public consultation in project preparation stage 
58. 
During the Technical Designing of the Project Phase 2, the PMU and consultant tried 
to disseminate project information to local authorities and the public to provide brief 
information about the proposed project, its objective, components and proposed plan. The 
affected people were informed about the project resettlement policy and consulted on the 
modes of compensation.  
59. 
Local population and all PAPs express their full support to the project development. 
The PAPs from the most wards of the project are certain that their communities and they 
themselves will greatly benefit from the project, enjoying environmental and sanitation 
improvements.  
60. 
As Cam Pha and Ha Long is town and city with economy strongly based on cool-
mining industry and tourism activities, and the project’s improvement of drainage/sewerage 
systems mostly are taken in the more or less urbanized areas, the most of the affected 
people derive their main incomes from non-farm activities. Agriculture is rather an additional 
source of their income. Moreover, the land acquisition impacts caused by the project works 
have mainly lineal form and marginally impact the population. Thus, most of them prefer to 
receive compensation in cash for the land impacted (See annex 8).  
61. 
Special exception is the case of the WWTP having spatial areal distribution and 
taking its location in Ha Khanh ward of Ha Long city. There, despite of predominance of non-
agricultural activities, the farming continues to contribute an important part of household’s 
income for considerable number of the affected people. During the some most recent years, 
followed a common trend of the country economic development, there in Ha Khanh ward 
experiences strong process of private land transfer for establishing more or less consolidated 
productive farms of advanced farmers or recreational farmsteads of certain whealthy people. 
Land use has been intencified and become more productive, more profitable. Thus is why 
many of the PAPs of the ward were very concerned about the envisaged land loss, 
employment opportunities and possibility of rehabilitation of their income generation capacity. 
As Ha Khanh no more has agricultural land available for compensation, it seems the cash 
compensation is only alternative. In such case, the PAPs wish the project and local authority 
would assist them with non-farm employment opportunities.  
62. 
The results of the HHs survey showed that most of relocating PAPs in Ha Khanh and 
other wards express their willingess to resettle to the public resettlement sites (See Annex 9, 
10). There only very few cases where PAPs ask for cash compensation to arrange relocation 
by themselves. There is only one case that a PAP of Ha Khanh opted for receiving 
appartment as relocation option. However, in the public meeting held in Ha Khanh proposed 
WWTP, some PAPs considered that they need much more time to think and properly discuss 
among their family about their final relocation options. It implicated that the consultation 
process on the issue must be continued during the RAP’s implementation with the PAPs to 
record their actual needs and priorities to provide them appropriate, effective assistane for 
rehabilitating their living conditions and standards. Acorrding to the Quang Ninh PMU, the 
RSs in right proximity to the existing sites of the relocating PAPs have been planned to 
developed for resettlement of the PAPs in Hon Gai in the Seaside newly reclaimed site Cao 
Xanh-Ha Khanh
 and in Bai Chay; For the case of Cam Pha town, RS is 
proposed to be developed in Cam Binh ward
.
63. 
PAPs of the channel section from the mountain to the old national way No18, of Cay 
Si stream, in Cam Thach ward, PAPs of the Eastern stream of Mechanical repairing 
enteprise of Cam Thinh ward, and PAPs of the first section from the Highway No18 to the 
mountain of the Km8 stream of Quang Hanh commune, expressed the wish that the project 
is better to utilize the local existing nearby roads for post-project operation, maintainance and 
Page  28
Technical study of  "Quang Ninh Drainage and Sanitation Development Project” 
Resettlement Action Plan, Final,  6
th
 May, 2005.
 
23
management of project’s infrastructure, rather to build new access roads along the channels 
as they are being proposed in the designs. According to the PAPs, the move of such access 
roads or their respective sections out from investment could reduce scope of land acquisition 
and minimize negative impacts on them. To facilitating the project’s civil works, in case of 
diminishing off the proposed access roads, the local population for example of Cam Thach 
ward unifiedly agree to provide contractors access through their gardens for implementation 
of the construction. 
64. 
The compensation for affected land and properties will be based on market prices or 
replacement costs at time of resettlement implementation. 
However, authority of some project’s wards such as Cam Phu and Cam Son of Cam Pha, or 
Cao Xanh of Ha Long city, wished that their most prioritized local drainage needs would be 
reviewed again by the project for investment.  
 
7.2. 
Consultation Proposed During Implementation 
A. Information 
Dissemination 
and 
Consultation 
 
65. 
During project implementation, the PMU, assisted by the Project consultant, in 
cooperation with Cam Pha and Ha Long Resettlement Committees will undertake the 
following: 
(i) 
Provide information to resettlement committees at all levels on project policies and 
implementation procedures. 
(ii) 
Conduct information dissemination to and consultation with PAPs throughout the life 
of the Project. 
(iii) 
Update the provincial unit prices, and confirm land acquisition and impact on 
properties through a Detailed Measurement Survey (DMS) in consultation with PAPs. 
(iv) 
The  Town’s/City’s RCs will then apply prices, calculate compensation entitlements, 
and complete the Compensation Forms for each affected household. Information on 
entitlements will then be presented on an individual basis to PAPs in the DMS follow-
up visit to each household. 
(v) 
The Compensation Forms, showing the household’s affected assets and 
compensation entitlements, will then need to be signed by the PAPs to indicate their 
agreement with the assessment. Any complaints the PAPs have about the contents 
of the form will be recorded at this time. 
(vi) 
A letter/questionnaire about resettlement options will be given to all PAPs entitled to 
relocation (a) to inform them about resettlement options (a clear explanation of the 
consequences of choosing each option will be given), (b) to request that PAPs 
confirm their choice of resettlement option and their preliminary confirmation of 
resettlement site location, and (c) to request that PAPs indicate services such as 
education/health/markets that they are currently using and their current distance from 
such services. 
(vii) 
Consultation regarding PAPs preferred option for rehabilitation assistance. This 
applies to severely affected and vulnerable PAPs. The resettlement committee will 
inform PAPs of options and entitlement to rehabilitation assistance before asking 
them to indicate preferences for such rehabilitation assistance. 
 
B. Public 
Meetings 
66. 
Prior to the beginning of project implementation, a public meeting will be held in each 
commune to provide PAPs with additional information and an opportunity for open discussion 
about resettlement policies and procedures in each affected commune. A letter of invitation 
will be sent to all PAPs at least 2 weeks before the meeting in their area. This meeting is 
intended to clarify information that has been given to date and to provide PAPs with the 
opportunity to discuss issues of concern and obtain clarification. In addition to a letter 
informing the PAP, other means will be used to inform PAPs and the general public such as 
posters in prominent locations in the communes and districts where PAPs currently reside: 
radio, newspaper and public poster announcements. The letter and notices will advise the 
Page  29

24
time and location of the meeting, and who can attend. Both men and women from affected 
households will be encouraged to attend, as well as other interested community members. 
The meeting will explain the Project, and households’ rights and entitlements, and there will 
be opportunities to ask questions. Such meetings will be conducted periodically during the 
life of the Project. 
67. 
Relevant information will be given to the PAPs at the meetings (verbally, graphically, 
and/or on printed information sheets). Extra copies of the printed information sheets will be 
available at township and district offices throughout the Project area. The meetings are 
proposed to have the following format: 
(i) 
Explanations given verbally and in visual format, including written information and 
drawings of the proposed design for the different component of the Project. 
(ii) 
Adequate opportunities will be provided for PAPs to respond with questions and 
comments. PAPs will be encouraged to contribute their ideas for PAPs rehabilitation 
options. 
(iii) 
The T/C’sRCs will establish a complete list of all PAPs present at the meetings. 
(iv) 
The T/CRCs will make a complete record of all questions, comments, opinions and 
decisions that arise during the information/consultation meetings, and present a 
report of all the meetings to the relevant PMU. 
 
68. 
Information about the following will be given to the PAPs: 
(i) 
Project components. 
This includes the places where they can obtain more detailed 
information about the Project. 
(ii) 
Project impacts.
 Impacts on the people living and working in the affected areas of 
the Project including explanations about the need for land acquisition for the sewage 
channels, drains and WWTP, pumping stations and relevant 
(iii) 
PAPs' rights and entitlements.
 These will be defined for PAPs (with the cut-off 
date). The rights and entitlements for different impact on PAPs, including the 
entitlements for those losing businesses, jobs and income will be explained. Options 
for land-for-land and cash. Options regarding reorganizing and individual 
resettlement, and provisions and entitlements to be provided for each. Entitlement to 
rehabilitation assistance and opportunities for project-related employment. 
(iv) 
Grievance mechanism and the appeal process.
 PAPs will be informed that project 
policies and procedures are designed to ensure their pre-project living standards are 
restored. PAPs will also be informed that if there is any confusion or 
misunderstanding about any aspect of the Project, the resettlement committee can 
help resolve problems. If they have complaints about any aspect of the land 
acquisition, compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation process, including the 
compensation rates being offered for their losses, they have the right to make 
complaints and to have their complaints heard. PAPs will receive an explanation 
about how to access grievance redress procedures. 
(v) 
Right to participate and be consulted.
 The PAPs will be informed about their right 
to participate in the planning and implementation of the resettlement process. The

Hanoi. 
 
7.3. Grievance 
mechanism 
72. 
The PAP can raise any their complaint or grievance concerning any aspect of 
compensation and resettlement directly to the PMU for smooth solving emerged issue. If no 
amicable solution can be reached between these two parties, then the PAP can address their 
complaint/grievance through the formal system of grievance redressal. All the PAPs are 
exempted from any administrative and legal fees. The four-step mechanism for grievance 
redressal is provided as follows: 
Step
 1:
through commune authority verbally or in written form. The complaint can be 
discussed in an informal meeting with the plaintiff and the representative of PMU or the 
chairman of the people's committee at commune level. The people's committee at 
commune level will be responsible for resolving the issue within 15 days from the day it 
is lodged.  
Step 2
:
In case if  a PAP’s grievance can’t be solve at ward’s/commune’s level and/or 
an agreement could not be reached between the PMU and PAP, he/she can appeal 
their complaint/grievance to the district PC, which will work with the PMU to solve the 
issue within 30 days of registering the appeal.  
Step 3
:
If the PAP is not satisfied with decision of the DPC or in the absence of 
response from the DPC, the PAP can address to Quang Ninh PPC. The latter will 
provide decision within 30 days from the days it is lodged with the PPC.

The RAP’s implementation includes follows: 
1. 
Information Dissemination at beginning of project implementation. 
Prior to the 
commencement of civil works, PMU will provide information about the Project throughout the 
Project area. Information meetings will be held in all potentially affected communes to inform 
the communities about (i) the Project scope; (ii) impacts; (iii) entitlements for all categories of 
loss; (iv) schedule of activities beginning with the detailed measurement survey; (v) 
institutional responsibilities; and (vi) the grievance mechanism. The PIB will be prepared and

 After completion of the detailed 
design, followed the project landmarks being put on place, DMS will be conducted for each 
resettlement-related component. Results of the DMS will serve as a basis for compensation 
and updating RAP. Data will be computerized by the PMU. 
5. 
Pricing Application and Compensation to PAP.
 Resettlement committees at all 
levels will be responsible for pricing application and preparing compensation charts for each 
affected commune/district. These will be posted at each commune for the people to review 
and comments before submitting to the PPC for approval and the PMU. All compensation 
forms must be checked and signed by the PAPs to indicate their agreement. 
6. Compensation 
and 
allowances
 will be handled under the supervision of 
representatives of WPCs, T/CRCs and representatives of PAPs

IX. Cost and BUDGET 
76. 
Budget for the RAP implementation will be the counterpart funds. Quang Ninh PC will 
provide counterpart budget for compensation and resettlement implementation, which will be 
included in the project total investment cost.  
 
9.1.  
Compensation 
prices 
77.
 
Compensation cost estimate for temporary and permanently impacted land and 
attached properties have been based on: 
(i)  The New Land Law, dated on 26 November 2003, replaced the Land Law of 1993 
(ii) 
 
The Decree 181/2004/ND-CP, dated 29 October 1004, providing guidelines for 
implementation of the New Land Law 2003. 
(iii)  Decree 188/ND-CP, dated 16 November 2004, providing methods of evaluation of land 
prices and the frame for the prices of various categories of land. 
(iv)  The Circular No 114/2004/TT-BTC issued by MOF on 26 November 2004, providing 
guidelines for implementation of the Decree No188/ND-CP 
(v) 
 
Decree 197/CP, dated 3 December 2004, replaced the Decree 22/1998/CP, on 
compensation, assistance and resettlement in case of the Government recovers land for the 
national and public interest, and issued guidelines in Circular No116/TT-BTC by the MOF, 7 
December 2004, for implementation of the Decree No197/ND-CP
 
(vi)  Decision No 472/QD-UB, issued by Quang Ninh PPC, dated on the 5, March, 2001, on

prices. The cost estimate in this RP is based on: the issued by Quang Ninh PPC 
compensation unit prices of houses/structures and crops/trees; Decree No 188/ND-CP, 
dated on 16 December 2004 regarding the frame of the prices of various categolries of land, 
and on results of preliminary assessment of replacement costs and market prices, conducted 
by the Consultant in October-December of 2004. 
79. 
In stage of resettlement implementation, the compensation rates will be updated by 
the PPC to reflect current market prices for all types of losses.  
 
9.2. Cost 
Estimate 
80. 
Cost for RP consists of (i) RAP’s preparation cost, including preliminary inventory of 
losses, census survey and cost of DMS; (ii) compensation cost for affected land and attached

X. MONITORING 
AND 
EVALUATION 
10.1. Monitoring 
82. 
Monitoring is the continuous process of assessment of project implementation, in 
relation to agreed schedules, the use of inputs, infrastructure and services by the Project. 
Monitoring provides all stakeholders with continuous feedback on implementation. It 
identifies actual or potential successes and problems as early as possible to facilitate timely 
correction during project operation.   
83. Monitoring 
has 
two 
purposes: 
(i) 
To verify that project activities have been effectively completed including 
quantity, quality, and timeliness; and 
(ii) 
To assess whether and how well these activities are achieving the stated goal 
and purpose of the Project. 
84. 
Regular monitoring of the RAP implementation will be conducted by the PMU, the 
implementing agency, as well as by an independent external monitoring organization hired 
by the PMU. 
10.2. Internal Monitoring 
85. 
Internal monitoring of the implementation of the RAP will be the responsibility of the 
PMU, with the assistance of the Project consultant. The implementing agency will oversee 
the progress in resettlement preparation and implementation through regular progress 
reports.  
 
86. 
The main indicators that will be monitored regularly are: 
 
(i) 
payment of compensation to PAPs in various categories, according to the 
compensation policy described in the RAP; 
(ii) 
delivery of technical assistance, relocation, payment of subsistence, and 
moving allowances; 
(iii) 
delivery of income restoration and rehabilitation assistance entitlements; 
(iv) 
public information dissemination and consultation procedures; 
(v) 
adherence to grievance procedures and outstanding issues requiring 
manag
ement’s attention; 
(vi) 
priority of PAPs regarding the options offered; and 
(vii) 
Coordination and completion of resettlement activities and award of civil works 
contract. 
 
87. 
The implementing agencies will collect information every month from the different 
resettlement committees. A database of resettlement monitoring information regarding the 
Project will be maintained and updated every month. 
88. 
The implementing agencies will submit to the PMU a monitoring report on the 
progress on implementation of the RAP. These reports will be forwarded to the World Bank 
as part of the PMU’s regular quarterly report to the World Bank. The internal monitoring 
reports shall include the following topics: 
(i) 
The number of PAPs by category of impact per component, and the status of 
compensation payment and relocation and income restoration for each 
category. 
(ii) 
The amount of funds allocated for operations or for compensation and the 
amount of funds disbursed for each. 
(iii) 
The eventual outcome of complaints and grievances and any outstanding 
issues requiring action by management. 
(iv) Implementation 
problems.

(v) 
Revised actual resettlement implementation schedule. 
10.3.   External Monitoring 
89. 
Objectives.
 
The general objective of the external monitor is to provide an 
i
ndependent periodic review and assessment of achievement of resettlement objectives, the 
changes in living standards and livelihoods, restoration of the economic and social base of 
the affected people, the organizational effectiveness, impact and sustainability of 
entitlements, the need for further mitigation measures if any, and to learn strategic lessons 
for future policy formulation and planning. 
90. 
Agency Responsible
.
In accordance with the World Bank requirements for consultant 
procurement, PMU will hire an organization for the independent monitoring and evaluation of 
RAP’s implementation. This organization, to be called the Monitoring Organization (MO) will 
be specialized in the Social Sciences and experienced in resettlement monitoring. The MO 
should start their work as soon as the updated RAP has been approved. 
91. 
Monitoring and Evaluation Indicators
.
The following indicators will be monitored and 
evaluated by the MO: 
(i) 
Payment of compensation will be as follows: (a) full payment to be made to all 
affected persons sufficiently before land acquisition; (b) adequacy of payment 
to replace affected assets. 
(ii) 
Provision of technical assistance for house construction to PAPs who are 
rebuilding their structures on their remaining land, or building their own 
structures in new places as arranged by the Project, or on newly assigned 
plots. 
(iii) 
Provision of income restoration assistance. 
(iv) 
Public consultation and awareness of compensation policy: (a) PAPs should be fully 
informed and consulted about land acquisition, leasing and relocation 
activities; (b) the monitoring team should attend at least one public 
consultation meeting to monitor public consultation procedures, problems and 
issues that arise during the meetings, and solutions that are proposed; (c) 
public awareness of the compensation policy and entitlements will be 
assessed among the PAPs; and (d) assessment of awareness of various 
options available to PAPs as provided for in the RAP. 
(v) 
Affected persons should be monitored regarding restoration of productive 
activities. 
(vi) 
The level of satisfaction of PAPs with various aspects of the RAP will be 
monitored and recorded. The operation of the mechanisms for grievance 
redress, and the speed of grievance redress will be monitored. 
(vii) 
Throughout the implementation process, the trends of living standards will be 
observed and surveyed. Any potential problems in the restoration of living 
standards will be reported.  
10.4. Monitoring 
Methodology 
A. Sample 
Survey 
92. 
A socio-economic survey will be required before, during and after resettlement 
implementation to provide a clear comparison of success/failure of the resettlement plan. 
Monitoring will be on a sample basis. The sample size should be 100% of relocating 
households and severely affected farmers, and at least 10% of all other households. The 
sample survey should be conducted twice a year. 
93. 
The survey should include women, elderly persons, and other vulnerable target 
groups. It should have equal representation of male and female respondents.  
94. 
A Post-Resettlement Evaluation will be carried out 6 to 12 months after completion of 
all resettlement activities.

34
B. Database 
Storage 
95. 
The MO will maintain a database of resettlement monitoring information. It will contain 
files on results of independent monitoring, PAPs surveyed and will be updated based on 
information collected in successive rounds of data collection. All databases compiled will be 
fully accessible by the PMU and implementing agencies. 
C. Reporting 
96. 
The MO will be required to submit the findings of the periodical monitoring every 6 
months. These monitoring reports shall be submitted to the PMU, which in turn will submit 
the reports to the World Bank as an annex of its progress report. 
97. 
The report should contain (i) a report on the progress of RAP implementation; (ii) 
deviations, if any, from the provisions and principles of the RAP; (ii) identification of problem 
issues and recommended solutions so that implementing agencies are informed about the 
ongoing situation and can resolve problems in a timely manner; and (iv) a report on progress 
of the follow-up of problems and issues identified in the previous report. 
D. 
Monitoring Report Follow-Up 
98. 
The monitoring reports will be discussed in a meeting between the MO, PMU and 
implementing agencies, which will be held immediately after the MO’s submission of 
monitoring report. Necessary follow-up action will be taken based on the problems and 
issues identified in the reports and follow-up discussions. 
10.5. Evaluation 
99. 
Evaluation is an assessment at a given point of time of the impact of resettlement and 
whether stated objectives have been achieved. The external monitor will conduct an 
evaluation of the resettlement process and impact 6 to 12 months after completion of all 
resettlement activities using the same survey questionnaire and sample as used during the 
monitoring activities.
