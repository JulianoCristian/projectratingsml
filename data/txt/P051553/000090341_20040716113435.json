Legal users with temporary rights will receive the\n            same compensation described and also be allowed to opt for\n            either cash assistance for affected land corresponding to 30\n            percent of the replacement costs of affected land or cash\n            assistance for lost income from affected land. Legal users\n            leasing affected land will not only receive compensation for\n            lost crops, produce, and trees, but also receive cash\n            assistance from lost income from affected land for the time\n            remaining on their leases. Legal users with permanent rights\n            to use affected lands similarly receive cash compensation\n            and a choice of full title to land of equal area and\n            productivity or a combination of land plus cash plus\n            non-land-based strategies built around opportunities for\n            employment and self-employment and a rehabilitation\n            allowance equal to 10 years' profit from the affected\n            land. A public information campaign will be initiated upon\n            the plan's approval and continue for six months. PAPs\n            will be informed of their entitlements and be given the\n            opportunity to appeal. Payment of entitlements,\n            reorganization of PAPs and clearance of land must be\n            completed before project implementation.
