Vietnam were as follows: outcome was moderately\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was significant;\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory; and borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: while good project design makes the links\n            between project interventions and outcomes explicit through\n            a results-chain, the rationale for attribution needs to have\n            a sound theoretical foundation and appropriate performance\n            indicators. Urban infrastructure investments in sanitation\n            and drainage can produce outputs that contribute to\n            generalized project objectives, such as reduced\n            environmental pollution and flooding, but the links can be\n            complex and difficult to monitor. Achievements can only be\n            accurately measured when baselines are clear and data are\n            current on all relevant performance indicators. The project\n            showed that urban households were satisfied with the septic\n            tanks provided, regarding them as adequate final solutions\n            to their sanitation needs, making connections to local sewer\n            networks appear unnecessary to these households. As Vietnam\n            continues to urbanize rapidly, sector specialists will need\n            to monitor how well the household septic tank solution\n            continues to perform with increasing urban densities. At the\n            same time, the specialists would need to identify the\n            incentives that households might need to eventually move to\n            systemic solutions for urban sanitation. Dissemination and\n            dialogue among stakeholders can be more intense and\n            effective during discussion of preliminary findings and\n            recommendations than after the submission of a report in its\n            final version at the completion of the task, as the 2010\n            workshop in Hanoi demonstrated in this case."}, "docdt": "2012-04-23T00:00:00Z"}
