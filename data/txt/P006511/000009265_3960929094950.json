reduce its\n            exposure to the public sector; to reduce credit\n            segmentation; and to strengthen credit policies and\n            procedures.  The loan will accomplish these objectives by:\n            (a) ensuring that BNDES continues to increase the proportion\n            of lending to private sector borrowers in its total lending,\n            and that its operations through financial intermediaries are\n            undertaken increasingly and predominantly through private\n            sector intermediaries; (b) supporting BNDES'\n            reorganization which is designed to reduce BNDES'\n            directed credit lines and to finance financially and\n            economically sound projects; and (c) strengthening\n            BNDES' credit, planning, and audit departments.  The\n            project provides funds for civil works; inventories,\n            machinery and equipment; and training and technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1990-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
