Dear Mr. Modiano:
Please refer to the Loan Agreement (Private Sector Finance Project), dated

This is to record our agreement to your request that FINAME relend proceeds of

de 
Financiamento Industrial, enter into agreements, satisfactory to 
the Bank, with Financial 
Intermediaries for purposes of the participation by such 
Financial Intermediaries in the 
carrying out of Part A of the Project."
 
If you agree with the foregoing, please sign and date one copy of this letter in 
the space provided below and return it to us.
Because of their interest in this matter, copies of this letter are being sent 
to His Excellency Marcilio Marques Moreira, Minister of Economy, Finance and Planning,
