In the 1950's and 1960's,\n            ambitious, Flaps were drawn up for development of the\n            Narmada River but most of the plans were held up because of\n            inter-state disputes over the allocation of water. Thus,\n            today, the water resource remains virtually undeveloped.\n            This annex describes the planning process of the total\n            Narmada river development -- Gujarat or the Sardar Sarovar\n            Project (SSP) and the development as presently envisaged.\n            The complexity of the project and the many direct and\n            indirect ways in which it will affect the welfare of the\n            people of the beneficiary states, required a\n            multi-disciplinary planning approach. Further complicating\n            the planning process is the time frame of 22 years over\n            which the project would be implemented and during which many\n            unforeseen events may take place. Thus, the planners faced\n            the challenge of planning with uncertainty. As the SSP is\n            only one of several large reservoir projects planned for\n            regulation of the Narmada River, the planning had to take\n            account of the timing, scope, and objectives of upstream developments."}, "docdt": "1985-03-06T00:00:00Z"}
