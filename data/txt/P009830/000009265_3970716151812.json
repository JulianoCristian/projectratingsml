Development - Gujarat\n            Water Delivery and Drainage Project is part of an\n            inter-state program for the development of multi-purpose\n            hydropower and irrigation dams on the Narmada River and\n            their associated irrigation canal networks.  The program has\n            been designed to:  (a) further the progress of India's\n            long-term power plan; (b) bring potentially valuable\n            agricultural land in Gujarat and Rajasthan under irrigation;\n            and (c) supply domestic, municipal and industrial water for\n            Gujarat.  The project consists of the first three year time\n            slice of construction of a large main canal extending for\n            about 440 km through Gujarat to Rajasthan and an extensive\n            canal network.  A separate, parallel operation supported by\n            the Bank Group will finance construction of a dam and power\n            complex, including a storage reservoir extending about 210\n            kms upstream of the dam in Gujarat, into Maharashtra and\n            Madhya Pradesh.  The projects will install 1,450 MW of\n            hydroelectric generating capacity and associated\n            transmission facilities.  They will further irrigate about\n            1.9 million ha in Gujarat and create the potential for the\n            irrigation of about 70,000 ha in Rajasthan.  Finally, the\n            projects will supply about 1,300 million cubic meters per\n            annum of municipal and industrial water."}, "docdt": "1985-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
