will\n            build on the institutional and infrastructural achievements\n            of the first Seed Development Project (Cr.745-BA)\n            successfully completed in December l984. The first project\n            concentrated on creating a viable seed production\n            institution with a modest infrastructure to produce two seed\n            crops--paddy and cotton. The project will cover five\n            additional priority crops, expand into new geographic areas,\n            and introduce seed quality control up to the multiplication\n            of the last generation of seed (Certified Seed). The project\n            will also strengthen and expand the existing seed handling\n            institutions in order to establish a comprehensive seed\n            processing and distribution system. The project will achieve\n            this objective by fully developing 12 existing Government\n            farms for basic seed production. For the last generation of\n            seed, the project will organize a seed multiplication\n            structure with at least 17,000 private farmers participating\n            as contract seed growers. It will further expand and\n            strengthen seed quality control and increase the seed\n            processing capacity through installation of new processing\n            plants, including drying and storage. The project also\n            includes a technical assistance and a training component."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
