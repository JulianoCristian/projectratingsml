Key lessons include: 1) Institutionally, it is\n            necessary to expand the General Assembly of Agency for the\n            Execution of Infrastructure Works in Antananarivo (AGETIPA)\n            to reflect the composition envisaged in the appraisal\n            report. 2) It is essential that AGETIPA accesses additional\n            financial resources needed to carry out its activities from\n            other donors and local sources. 3) Regarding the packaging\n            of contracts, there should be a gradual shift towards larger\n            contracts. 4) With respect to procurement, International\n            Development Association shall ensure that technical audits\n            systematically include a review of contracts and an analysis\n            of compliance with procurement procedures. 5) During the\n            sub-project identification phase and preparation of work\n            plans of Agency for the Execution of Public Works (AGETIP)\n            projects, greater attention should be paid to the\n            city's overall infrastructure rehabilitation needs, and\n            a multiyear program and budget should be developed for\n            approval by the municipality. 6) Satisfactory implementation\n            of AGETIP projects require close supervision. 7) Concerning\n            the sustainability of project works, municipalities should\n            be required to draw up plans and budget for maintaining\n            repaired infrastructure. 8) With regard to choice of\n            technical options for repairing roads, job creation and\n            maintenance requirements should receive increased attention."}, "docdt": "1999-04-19T00:00:00Z"}
