subway network even further by\n            introducing transport demand management (TDM), constructing\n            inter-modal facilities, and expanding the transit system;\n            (b) enhance the capacity of Pusan's subway to\n            accommodate future growth and serve as an alternative to\n            auto use; and (c) strengthen the capacity of existing\n            institutions to plan and program urban transport\n            investments. The project will include the following\n            components: (a) congestion management, including parking\n            management and modal-integration facilities, East-West bus\n            lanes, and a 5 year TDM/transportation system(s) management\n            program; (b) expansion of Pusan Urban Transit System\n            capacity; and (c) institutional development to enhance staff\n            expertise in urban transport investment planning/programming."}, "docdt": "1994-11-15T00:00:00Z"}
