Production in these areas is limited and\n            hazardous due to poor drainage and frequent flooding. The\n            project would be part of the ongoing program conducted by\n            the government to increase paddy production by drainage and\n            flood control of a number of low-lying lands along stream\n            courses and adjacent to coastal lagoons. Project works\n            involve improvement of existing drainage system by\n            deepening, enlargement, and extension of the system,\n            improvement of the drainage outlets to the sea, and\n            construction of levees with control structures. These works\n            would be completed in five years. The project would improve\n            drainage, reduce flood hazards, and minimize salt water\n            intrusion, thereby enabling some 10,000 farmers to engage in\n            dependable double cropping of paddy."}, "docdt": "1969-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
