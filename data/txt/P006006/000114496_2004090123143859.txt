WHEREAS (A) the Bank has received a letter, dated July 1, 1997 from the 
Argentine Republic’s Province of Tucumán (the Province) describing a program of 
actions, objectives and policies designed to achieve adjustment of the public finances 
and public education and public health sectors of the Province (hereinafter called the 
Program), declaring the Province's commitment to the execution of the Program, and 
requesting assistance from the Bank in support of the Program during the execution 
thereof;
(B)
the Borrower has indicated to the Bank that the actions and conditions 
set forth in the Program and in Schedule 3 to this Agreement, described therein as 
agreed between the Province and the Bank, are consistent with the Borrower’s national 
policy framework regarding provincial reforms, which policy (without mandating 
specific numerical targets) encourages provinces of the Borrower to, inter alia:  (i) 
achieve and maintain balanced provincial public sector budgets; (ii) decrease the 
ratio of provincial public sector personnel expenditures to provincial public sector 
net current revenues; (iii) maintain or decrease the ratio of provincial public sector 
debt stock to provincial public sector current revenues; (iv) not incur debt to 
finance provincial public sector current expenditures except under certain limited 
circumstances; (v) in general improve their provincial public sector fiscal, 
financial, accounting and budgetary discipline in a manner consistent with their 
constitutions; (vi) participate in the National Public Investment System (Sistema 
Nacional de Inversión Pública); and (vii) in a manner consistent with national 
policies, achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness with regard to provincial 
public expenditures, particularly in the health and education sectors, all in an 
effort to widen the scope and increase the quality of provincial participation in said 
Page  2
sectors for the benefit of underprivileged segments of the population;
(C)
the Borrower has expressed its commitment to lend to and for use by the 
Province funds in local currency in amounts equivalent to the Loan amounts disbursed 
by the Bank; and
(D)
on the basis, inter alia, of the foregoing, the Bank has decided in 
support of the Program to provide such assistance to the Province by making the Loan 
to the Borrower in two tranches as hereinafter provided, thus allowing the Borrower to

Public Finances
1.
The Province has attained, for the period covered by any three continuous months 
among the nine months immediately preceding the Second Tranche Release Date, a

For purposes of this Schedule:

allocated as part of the annual consolidated provincial budgets approved by the 
Province’s legislature; and

5.
A financial discipline law has been presented, by the Province’s executive 
branch, to the provincial legislature for approval (and, if so approved, has entered

de Cuentas or of such auditors on said audits, as well as any such reports for 
subsequent completed fiscal years, publicly available (even if the law referred to in

7.
The Province is adhering to the terms of its public expenditure plan (covering 
the period up to the end of 1999) set forth in the Program.
Public Education Sector
8.
There have entered into effect and are being implemented, through regulations 
under provincial law no. 3470 of year 1967 or through any other legal method, the 
Province’s measures (set forth in provincial executive decree no. 505/14, dated March 
26, 1996) designed to rationalize the pay and benefits of educators who are on leave.
9.
The Province has attained, for the period covered by the first twelve of the 
thirteen months immediately preceding the Second Tranche Release Date, a level of 
provincial public education sector personnel salary and benefits expenditures equal to 
no more than 90% of provincial public education sector expenditures.  For purposes of 
this Schedule, "provincial public education sector expenditures" means those of the 
Province’s Ministry of Education, as well as those incurred for public school works 
and maintenance.
10.
The Province’s executive branch has presented to the Province’s legislature for

the fiscal year during which the Second Tranche Release Date falls), annual budgets 
for the provincial public education sector which:
(a)
make available for use in the provincial public education sector an 
annual amount equivalent, in real terms, to at least the annual amount budgeted for 
said sector for fiscal year 1996 (or equivalent to at least $280 million, whichever is 
higher);
(b)
allow savings, of amounts originally budgeted by the legislature for 
provincial public education sector personnel salary and benefits expenditures, to be 
used to cover non-personnel costs in said sector; and
Page  10
(c)
during the fiscal years covered by said budgets, maintain availability 
for use in the provincial public education sector of all funds budgeted for said 
sector, without permitting that such funds be transferred for use in other sectors, 
without permitting that such funds be shifted from investment cost line items to 
current expenditure line items and without in any other manner permitting that such 
funds be unavailable whenever the time comes to make actual payment for budgeted 
items.
11.
New rules for awarding provincial public subsidies to private schools in the 
Province, as well as the action plan for actually paying such subsidies in accordance 
with those rules, have been formalized by decree issued by the Province’s executive 
branch.
12.
The Province has put into effect and begun implementing an action plan to 
restructure the teacher training institutes administered by the Province.

approval, for each fiscal year beginning after the Effective Date (up to and including 
the fiscal year during which the Second Tranche Release Date falls), annual budgets 
for the provincial public health sector which:

services, through new payment systems instituted in support of said 
self-administration;
(b)
retain the majority of their collected revenues for their own use without 
having to channel such revenues through the provincial public sector budget; and
(c)
by law or by voluntary participation of their medical employees, apply to 
Page  11
such employees an employment scheme based on fixed-term contracts renewable solely by 
mutual agreement of the parties thereto, and containing merit-based performance bonus 
provisions.

(b)
the Province is systematically maintaining and updating a roster to 
identify all potential beneficiaries of said provincial health fund.

The Province has:
(a)
installed and is implementing an improved information system to keep 
records on accounts of beneficiaries of the OSP;
(b)
adopted and is maintaining a policy of allowing beneficiaries freedom to 
choose in which OSP, among those for which they are eligible, to become members; and
(c)
initiated and is implementing a new budget procedure whereby revenue 
sharing funds (fondos coparticipados), from the Province to provincial public entities 
that are not part of the Province’s centralized public administration (administración 
pública centralizada), can be made available by the Province directly to OSP (in cases 
where such public entities fail to make their required contributions to OSP and in 
amounts equal to such missing contributions).
