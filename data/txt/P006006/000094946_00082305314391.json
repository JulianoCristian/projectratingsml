The\n            operation has promoted the implementation of important\n            reforms in the health sector aimed at ensuring an efficient\n            and responsive delivery of public services within fiscally\n            sound policies. However, Tucuman's performance was\n            hampered by the lack of political support from the\n            provincial legislature and the lack of solid leadership in\n            the education sector. On the other hand, Tucuman's\n            highly successful experience with some individual\n            components, such as self-managed hospitals, can have a\n            strong demonstration effect for other provinces. The lessons\n            of experience from this project include: a)\n            Quick-disbursement loans directed to sub-national\n            governments can be effective complements of sector reforms\n            and operations. b) A determined executive branch supporting\n            sector champions with vision can successfully pursue a\n            reform effort under less than optimal political and social\n            conditions. c) Sector reforms are possible even when the\n            overriding priority is fiscal adjustment. d) The combination\n            of effective sector leadership and participatory mechanisms\n            in the design and implementation of reforms can be a\n            powerful tool for pursuing institutional change and\n            overcoming bureaucratic resistance."}, "docdt": "2000-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
