Reform Adjustment\n            Loan Projects will help the Tucuman, Rio Negro, Salta and\n            San Juan provinces to reform and restructure their\n            governments to ensure an efficient and responsive delivery\n            of public services (notably social services) within fiscally\n            sound policies. The loan will be disbursed depending on\n            successful implementation of the following reforms and\n            performance benchmarks: 1) public performance reviews will\n            assess: whether overall fiscal and debt targets were\n            reached, the composition of social sector expenditures, the\n            rationale for new borrowing to refinance old debt and/or to\n            finance priority investment programs, and the economic\n            justification for all large projects; 2) public finance\n            reforms include reestablishing provincial fiscal balance by\n            improving tax collection, reducing current government\n            expenditures - namely civil service reductions, and\n            shrinking provincial debt; 3) selected education reforms\n            include consolidating classes, controlling absenteeism,\n            reducing overhead costs, reconverting public teacher\n            training institutions, and introducing new subsidy systems\n            for private schools; benchmarks include reducing\n            non-essential personnel, improving student-teacher ratios,\n            and shifting personnel expenditures towards investment and\n            other outlays; and 4) selected health reforms include\n            separating provision and financing of public health services\n            by giving hospitals autonomy, implementing new management\n            and payment systems, improving insurance coverage by\n            identifying poor beneficiaries, defining the health package,\n            and legally implementing the new insurance system prior to\n            the last tranche release."}, "docdt": "1997-07-30T00:00:00Z"}
