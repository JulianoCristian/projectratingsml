                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Support for Poor and Disadvantaged Areas Project (SPADA) closed on 31 December, 2012. The project had been extended twice, to a cumulative extension of one year in total,
                         to allow for completion of an additional cycle of block grants in selected well performing areas and to enable the government to complete its impact studies.

                         All in all, despite initial delays and bottlenecks and a somewhat ambitious project design, the project has achieved well its development objectives by supporting more than 8,650
                         project activities aimed at helping local governments in some of Indonesia’s poorest areas to improve local governance, health, education, and basic infrastructure such as water
                         supply, sanitation, transport, and drainage. More than 1,250 health clinics and schools were rehabilitated or made more physically accessible. Training has been provided to

                         strengthen the capacity of close to 20,000 teachers and health workers, as well as more than 122,000 members of local health and education committees, village facilitators and
                         empowerment cadres. Communities now have better access to water, markets, and education, and improvement in health of young children and mothers is reported. These project
                         target indicators have all been met or exceeded.

                         A recent impact study shows that in the health care sector, the project increased the number of new patients by 41% and their satisfaction with the services provided was high.
                         Importantly, the project strengthened capacity and roles of community institutions and multi-stakeholder groups at the local level, particularly related to participatory planning
                         processes and implementation of transparency and accountability in the management of sub-projects - with women’s participation in planning and decision meetings averaging 30%.
                         Growth was promoted by increasing business registration in the target districts. About 3,500 beneficiaries received technical assistance in legal mechanisms and training on dispute
                         resolution, contributing to peace building in SPADA’s post-conflict districts. The project in general benefitted more than 4.7 million people (or about 57% of the total population in the
                         participating districts), about 42% of which are poor households.

                         During this ISR period in 2012, project assets and sub-projects were formally handed over by the Ministry of KPDT to the respective local governments for sustained ownership and
                         to assure maintenance and improvements, as needed.

                         The task team is pleased with the way in which completion of final project activities, transfer of assets to local governments, and the GoI’s impact study was prioritized and, on the
                         whole, effectively handled in the remaining months of the SPADA National project, bringing the project to a smooth closure. The reports on project completion are now well underway,
                         with the Bank’s ICR due by end of June 2013.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Support for Poor and Disadvantaged Areas Project (SPADA) closed on 31 December, 2012. The project had been extended twice, to a cumulative extension of one year in total,
                         to allow for completion of an additional cycle of block grants in selected well performing areas and to enable the government to complete its impact studies.

                         The reports on project completion are now well underway, with the Bank’s ICR due by end of June 2013.
