Some lessons learned included:\n            project design and appraisal had identified that\n            institutional weakness of Ministry for Development of\n            Disadvantaged Areas (MinDA) was a risk given that MinDA was\n            newly established, lacked experience, did not have line\n            agency representation at the local level, and was dependent\n            on local government agencies in poor and disadvantaged parts\n            of the country. A newly created ministry, appointed as the\n            implementing agency of a complex project for which they\n            actually had a limited mandate, and which was to be\n            implemented in remote and low-capacity districts, will take\n            considerable time to get organized and up to speed with\n            project implementation. After completion of sub-projects,\n            substantial efforts were made by MinDA to ensure that\n            project assets will be effectively operated and maintained\n            by the respective local governments. Assessment of district\n            capacity during the selection process (e.g. related to local\n            regulation and budget for operation and maintenance), as\n            well as capacity of local level institutions and human\n            resources to maintain and sustain project activities should\n            be part of the project design, not an after-thought. The\n            community institutions (for example, technical review teams,\n            sub-project management teams, sub-project maintenance teams,\n            school committees, and other multi stakeholder groups)\n            played significant roles in the whole cycle of SPADA\n            activities, from assessment, planning, implementation,\n            monitoring, to evaluation. Involvement of the technical\n            review teams in the participatory planning process for\n            example, enabled local governments to accommodate priorities\n            from the village levels, and allowed community groups to\n            identify and voice their real needs. The additional efforts\n            and investments will be needed to ensure sustained and\n            effective contribution from these institutions- the building\n            of community institutions may not successfully be achieved\n            within one project cycle."}, "docdt": "2013-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
