 INDONESIA — SUPPORT FOR POOR AND DISADVANTAGED AREAS PROJECT
                             P078070
CREDIT NO. 4076-ID AND LOAN NO. 7776-ID (FORMERLY LOAN NO. 4788-ID)

                                   Restructuring Paper


1. The closing date for the Indonesia, Support for Poor and Disadvantaged Areas
   Project (SPADA), Credit No. 4076-ID and Loan No. 7776-ID (formerly Loan No.
   4788-ID), P078070 will be extended from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012.
2. Project Performance: Project performance has been moderately satisfactory to date.
   While the project was initially delayed and has encountered implementation
   challenges, owing to low capacity in the implementing agency (PIU) and target
   districts compounded by complexity in design, recent implementation support
   missions by the task team have found demonstrated improvement in implementation
   progress, as documented in the most recent Aide Memoires and as reflected in the
   fact that the project has met and, in many cases, exceeded its results framework
   indicator targets. With this in mind, the task team confirms that the project
   development objective remains achievable.
3. Extension request: The Ministry of Finance formally submitted project extension
   requests to the Bank on June 28th and July 14th, 2011. The extension is to enable an
   additional round of block grants utilizing unused funds of USD1.9 million, saved as a
   result of the project’s initial delayed start and owing to cost-savings on the part of the
   Project Implementing Unit (PIU). The round would be implemented in seven
   districts in West Kalimantan and Central Sulawesi, selected based on the PIU’s
   evaluation of their good performance during the prior three cycles of implementation
   and offered as a performance reward. Additional activities would include extension of
   the National Management Consultant contracts to March 2011 and finalization of the
   borrower’s study on project results, to contribute to their project completion report.
4. The Borrower has an action plan to complete all activities that has been reviewed by
   and is satisfactory to the task team. Based on a meeting with MoF and Bappenas in
   July 2011 and as confirmed with KPDT in August 2011, it has been agreed that no
   reallocation of budget categories would be required. No new planning would be
   undertaken at field level with the inputs for the block grant process based on the plans
   prepared during the most recent cycle, started in June 2011. It is expected that sub-
   project implementation would be finalized by January 2012, with the administration
   of project closure in the period immediately following.
5. If approved, this would be the first extension to the project closing date.
