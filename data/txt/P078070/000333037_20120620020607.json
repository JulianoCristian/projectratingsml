The\n            reallocation has been requested in light of revised\n            expenditures to support the activities agreed under the\n            first project closing date extension, and in order to avoid\n            overdrawn budget categories. These activities include the\n            additional round of block grants, the associated extension\n            of the national management consultant contracts to March\n            2012 and the planned finalization of the borrower's\n            study on project outputs. The borrower has an action plan to\n            complete all activities. This plan has been reviewed by the\n            task team which has found it to be satisfactory.

The task team confirms\n            that the cumulative period of extension does not exceed two years."}, "docdt": "2012-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
