1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1. Context at Appraisal
Country and sector background. In the two decades leading up to 1997, Indonesia had
been a world leader in poverty reduction, with levels falling from over 60% to less than
15% of the population. Following the East Asia economic crisis in 1997, however,
poverty rates in Indonesia rose once again to a peak of 27% in early 1999. With the
political transition and reforms of the early 2000s, poverty levels again dropped, but
around half of all Indonesians remained clustered just above the poverty line, still highly
vulnerable to being pushed back into poverty. Measured by indicators such as those used
for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), large numbers of Indonesians continued
to suffer from lack of access to basic education, safe water, adequate sanitation,
electricity, and access to basic social services.

A particularly striking aspect of Indonesian development is the regional variation. In the
early 2000s rural provinces, such as the eastern islands, Tanah Papua, and parts of
Sumatra had rural poverty rates exceeding 50% of the rural population, and substantial
areas within the eastern islands still experience poverty and food insecurity. In addition to
high poverty and the difficult geography, problems in the off-Java areas in the early
2000s were exacerbated by occasional outbursts of violence and regional civic conflict,
particularly after the fall of the New Order government in 1998.

Rationale for Bank assistance. Due to the heightened needs in disadvantaged and post-
conflict areas – including damaged or destroyed infrastructure, disrupted essential
services, large numbers of internally displaced people, and lack of services for conflict
resolution – and with enduring risks of social disorder, there was a clear need for a
framework and an operation that could address poverty and governance in disadvantaged
areas in the newly decentralizing environment. The World Bank was already supporting
community-level participatory processes through the series of Kecamatan Development
Projects (KDP), a successful community-driven development (CDD) project which had
made significant investments in community planning and building village assets since
1998. The Bank recognized that community-based approaches in disadvantaged and
conflict-affected regions had to be complemented with supporting the new role of district
governments in arbitrating and deploying authority.

Soon after the 1998 political transition, Indonesia had embarked on an ambitious
decentralization program through Laws 22 and 25/1999 that became effective in 2001.
This shifted many government functions from the national level to the country's 430 local
governments. District heads, formerly appointed by Jakarta, were elected through direct
elections, local government spending rose significantly, and development services, such
as health and education, were transferred to the districts.

The Bank’s 2001-2003 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was built around promoting
better governance and institutional reform, but little was done to address the specific
problems of conflict areas. By 2004, the formation of a new government with a stated



                                                                 1
commitment to poverty reduction and the increasingly stable political environment
provided an improved opportunity to support development work in post-conflict areas,
addressing not only more basic needs relating to major reconstruction of infrastructure
and related service delivery gaps, but also attempting to repair the broken ‘social
contract’, restoring or instituting greater credibility in local government planning and
service provision. The 2003-2006 CAS reinforced the centrality of the governance
agenda, and the Bank was preparing several projects with district governments in a broad
effort to assist Indonesia with its decentralization program. A request had been received
from the GoI that the CDD approach used by KDP should also be applied for better
integration with regular government operations. Through planning for block grants,
participatory processes would be introduced at the community level and integrated with
district plans, filling a gap in Bank support between KDP/PNPM’s community planning
and other forms of intergovernmental fiscal transfer to fund district-generated proposals
(such as the ILGR and USDRP projects1).

In 2004, the government had created a special Ministry of Development for
Disadvantaged Areas (MinDA or KPDT) that produced an action plan to support better
governance and effective poverty reduction in the 199 poorest districts in Indonesia. The
core of this strategy were investments to build local capacities, provide basic services to
poor communities, promote growth by removing distortions and by providing public
infrastructure, and support appropriate processes for local-level reconciliation and
recovery. This provided the opportunity for the Bank to design a project that would fund
such investments, albeit in only a limited number of the poorest districts. A separate
project, Support for Poor and Disadvantaged Areas Project (SPADA), was therefore
prepared that would combine the comparative advantages of a CDD approach –
participatory planning and investments in communities – with support for development
planning in lagging and vulnerable areas, including those affected by conflict. The project
targeted community development priorities in 40, non-KDP, disadvantaged districts in
eight provinces (later reduced to 32 districts). In addition, to addressing issues of post-
conflict reconstruction, the design also included sub-components on private sector
development and community legal empowerment.

The province of Aceh had been considered for inclusion in this new project, but the 2004
tsunami disaster together with the post-conflict resolution following the Helsinki Accord
in 2005, provided a special case for Bank and donor support in Aceh. Following the same
design principles as SPADA ‘National’, a separate Bank operation, SPADA Aceh-Nias
(P079156), was therefore prepared and subsequently approved in January 2007, financed
by a grant from the Multi-donor Trust Fund for Aceh and North Sumatra (MDF) covering
all 17 districts in Aceh, and the 2 districts in the neighboring island of Nias. The project
closed in December 2011, and has a separate ICR (Report No. ICR00002260).
Nonetheless, the two ‘SPADA’ projects were closely related to each other, with similar

Project (USDRP) were local governance reforms project designed for rural and urban areas, respectively,
with the objective to support the establishment of accountable sub-national governments in Indonesia.




                                                                          2
development objectives, delivery modalities and operational frameworks. BAPPENAS
was the project management unit (PMU) for both SPADA projects.

1.2. Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
SPADA's overall objectives are ‘to strengthen governance, promote growth and improve
service delivery in some of the poorest districts of Indonesia: through (a) strengthening of
local participation in development planning; (b) promotion of private investment and job
creation; and (c) an increase in the utilization of effective education, health and dispute
resolution services’. 2 The key indicators in the Credit Agreement with targets in
parenthesis are3: (i) no. of project kecamatan (subdistricts) (453); (ii) project kabupaten
(districts) (40); (iii) % of kecamatan grants disbursed (>80); (iv) kabupaten grants
disbursed (>75); (v) baseline impact surveys completed (2); (vi) health and education
pilots completed (3); (vii). district health and education committees functioning (35);
(viii) kecamatan health needs assessments completed (150); (ix) % increase in poor
people completing 6 years (20); (x) kabupaten adopting school based management (20);
(xi) kecamatan business established (300); (xii) kabupaten business established (30);
(xiii) % community contributions to project (12%).

1.3.   Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
       Indicators, and reasons/justification
The PDO was formally revised in April 2010 to ‘strengthen governance, promote growth,
and improve service delivery in at least 32 of the poorest districts of Indonesia’. This
revision was made to reflect changes in the geographic scope of the project. Some
districts had been transferred to a separate ‘SPADA in Aceh and Nias’ project, to more
efficiently implement activities and more effectively address the specific needs of areas
recovering from the December 2004 tsunami. In addition, the target area for SPADA
‘National’ was realigned in a way that added more districts in non-tsunami affected areas.
This restructuring did not reduce the scope or impact of the project, since funds were
used to add sub-projects and activities in the target districts. The number of total
beneficiaries for the project was thus not reduced. Taking SPADA Aceh-Nias and
SPADA National together, the two projects covered a total of 51 districts.

The revision also addressed a discrepancy between the PAD and the original DCA. A
bullet point summary of main project activities from the PAD was merged into the PDO
statement itself in the DCA to list the means ‘through’ which the objectives would be
achieved. Since these are properly understood as the means for achieving the objectives

2
  There were some discrepancies in the statement of the PDO both within the PAD and between the PAD
and the Development Credit Agreement (DCA). These involved style more than substance. The statement
above is from the DCA, while the PAD additionally stated ‘…in 40 of the poorest districts’ while, when
fully operational, the project was active in 32 districts. An amendment to the legal agreement in April 2010
clarified both of these issues.

3
 Again, there were discrepancies between the PAD and the DCA, resulting in a large number of indicators.
A restructuring in 2010 clarified the discrepancies and reduced the number of indicators (see below under
Point 1.3)




                                                                            3
and for assessing the project’s success in doing so, they were not included in the revised
PDO.

Indicators were also revised to make the Results Framework easier to measure and
monitor. The original key and outcome indicators had been developed using the previous
Bank format for the logical framework, resulting in a large number of indicators in the
PAD and DCA. At the time of restructuring, the number of outcome indicators was
reduced from 36 to 15, and the key indicators were reduced by four, and revised for
clarification of language. The revised PDO-level indicators are:
    1. Improved access to cost-effective, high quality rural infrastructure (EIRR>20%)
        through participatory planning processes in 8 provinces
    2. Increased use of alternative dispute resolution and legal mechanisms by
        communities to resolve disputes peacefully in Maluku province
    3. Increase in new business registrations
    4. Increase in use of public health services
    5. Increase in national primary school test scores in participating districts
    6. Decrease in number of violent conflict incidents.

1.4. Main Beneficiaries
The main beneficiaries of the project are people living in disadvantaged areas in the 8
target provinces, especially those people who were affected by poverty, illiteracy and
poor quality education; disease and inadequate medical facilities; ineffective local
planning processes; communal conflicts, and limited, or lack of, access to justice.
Additional beneficiaries are small business people who were supported by the private
sector development initiative. Also, local government staff (at the district and sub-district
levels), education and health professionals, and legal staff, benefited from training and
improved working conditions. There was no revision to the definition of the main
beneficiaries during the project’s lifespan. The number of jurisdictions was, at the 2010
restructuring, reduced from 40 to 32, but the number and type of beneficiaries remained
the same, distributed differently within the project.

1.5. Original Components
The project consisted of four components, which are described below, with principal
financing from an investment loan from IBRD and a credit from IDA. Additional
investments included a DFID trust fund (TF-070672) that supported activities in Aceh,
and therefore is reported in ICR00002260 for the SPADA Aceh-Nias project. A JSDF
trust fund (TF-052800) during 2002-2005 also allowed for the preparation of the project.
This trust fund has a GRM filed that may be further referenced.

  In the PAD description of components there were some discrepancies in the cost estimates, the amounts in
the ICR have been revised to reflect the estimates in cost table in the PAD.


                                                                          4
districts ranging from equivalent US$ 50,000 to 100,000, depending on the sub-district
population. The grants could be used for any productive purpose, except for a small
negative list of items prohibited by Bank policy (i.e. weapons, pesticides, etc.). Projects
that required sustained operational support and recurrent funding, such as improvements
in schools or health clinics, had to demonstrate that such support and funding was
available. Fifteen percent of the grants were reserved for proposals from women's and
youth groups. The project's Operational Manual included fiduciary formats and record
keeping mechanisms that had been reviewed by the Bank and which had already
performed well in practice in KDP. However, SPADA differed from KDP in several
ways in that it:
      Included conflict damage assessments within the planning cycle (including
       pressures caused by hosting internally displaced people);
      Allowed for one-off grants to replace the catastrophic loss of productive assets,
       housing, and public buildings if agreed by the subdistrict forum;
      Used the planning cycle to encourage low-cost reconciliation measures such as
       sports leagues and cultural events;
      Emphasized reintegration of internally displaced persons through conflict
       resolution training for facilitators and community leaders;
      Invited district sector representatives and NGOs to subdistrict meetings;
      Promoted inter-village proposals jointly sponsored with line agencies and NGOs;
      Elected members from each subdistrict board (FAD) to advise the district
       development forum on priority needs identified in the subdistricts; and
      Included a program for alternative dispute resolution and legal assistance.

2. District Grants. The most notable difference from the KDP approach was that SPADA
also funded district-level projects. District block grants supported larger or more
technical proposals emerging from the sub-district planning process that also contributed
to reconstruction, cooperation, and development. The aim was to allow CDD operations
to be linked with the newly empowered districts, especially the planning boards and
technical service agencies. Such district projects were selected by the District
Development Forum on a quarterly basis using criteria that included demonstrable broad-
based benefits, cost and local contribution, and their technical and financial feasibility.
Projects that benefited more than one sub-district were favored by the scoring system.

Component B: Planning Grants (US13.5 million). District and sub-district grants
included some funds to provide operational support. These planning grants allowed
communities to organize planning seminars, contract advisers to assist with reviewing
proposals, carry out site visits to neighboring areas, and similar supportive and learning
activities. At the district level, the planning grants were primarily for travel to and from
meetings with local governments and specialized service providers. Funds were provided
for operating costs arising under the project on account of local contractual support staff
salaries other than salaries and benefits of the Recipient’s full time employees. This
component also supported training for the private sector committees established by the
project.


                                                                5
Component C: Implementation Support (US$ 38.7 million)
Routine Implementation Support. Three implementation support packages were
included in this component. First, technical assistance for the three different levels of
government: (i) a national management team, (ii) an oversight and monitoring unit in
each province, and (iii) a multi-sector support team in each participating district. Linked
to this management structure was a specialist procurement consultant to work with the
procurement committee to manage procurement, mainly during the project’s startup
period. Secondly, this component financed specialized consultants to carry out baseline
inventories, investment climate surveys, and needs assessments. In addition, capacity
support was provided to local governments and the communities for health and education
diagnostics, support for the private sector forums, and training district legislators in
public expenditure analysis and formulation and to provide training and operational
support for an alternative dispute resolution program. These resources were
complemented by counterpart funds of about US$10.5 million to cover government
implementation support, socialization and dissemination, and materials. In addition, to
address issues of post-conflict reconstruction, this component included two sub-
components of private sector development (PSD)5 and mediation and community legal
empowerment (MCLE). 6 These two sub-components were GoI executed and
implemented by non-governmental organizations (Yayasan Bina Karya Mandiri, Yayasan
Bina Swadaya and Crescent).

Trust Fund Support. Implementation of this component was also to be supported by a
Bank-administered JSDF trust fund (TF054749), ‘Grants for Returning and Integrating
Internally Displaced People in Conflict Affected Areas and Vouchers for Refugees’ for
an estimated amount of USD 3,375,900. This grant was implemented by the Directorate
of Social Assistance for Social Disaster Victims in the Ministry of Social Affairs through
an international NGO (ICMC, the International Catholic Migration Commission). The
aim of this grant was to provide returning refugees and other internally displaced people
(IDPs) with basic productive resources needed to facilitate their rapid transition to
productive life in host communities. The project consisted of three components: (1)
Implementation of a voucher program consisting of direct transfers in the form of
voucher to IDPs to be used to cover the costs of their relocation as well as the
incremental costs of facilities and services borne by host communities in North Maluku,
Central Sulawesi and Aceh; (2) provision of technical advisory services by non-
governmental organizations to develop capacity to administer the voucher program,
monitor its implementation and provide support as needed to IDPs; and (3)
implementation of monitoring and evaluation program through development of a
database to track IDPs, household welfare surveys to monitor IDPs and host household
recovery, and participatory techniques to provide in-depth assessment of the program.

Significant implementation support was also provided by the Bank-administered PNPM
Support Facility. Management of a complex project dealing with low-capacity

stakeholders cannot rely solely on Bank budget for effective implementation support.
SPADA would likely have been a failed project without the additional support afforded
by these trust funds. These grants allowed frequent and comprehensive implementation
support involving specialist resources, including a field team providing implementation
support and a fiduciary team maintaining fiduciary safeguards.

Special Program for Aceh. Originally, component C included $4.0 million earmarked
exclusively for three years of technical assistance to support the recovery of 12 tsunami-
affected districts in Aceh.7 The technical assistance would have prepared and overseen
normal SPADA procedures in Aceh, with the US$9.0 million for investment grants
provided from other grant resources, specifically the Bank-executed MDF.

Component D: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Studies ($1.8 million). The core of this
component was a package of quantitative and qualitative baseline and intermediate
surveys and case analyses that could track impacts due to project interventions. Funds
were also budgeted for independent audits that would begin in the project’s second year.
Also included were programs for conflict resolution, such as community land mapping or
options for community based trauma recovery. They were to be piloted in two or three
provinces before expanding them across the conflict regions.

1.6. Revised Components
At the time of restructuring in 2010, there was a revision of components, with the
addition of a component for capacity building. 8 It is also worth noting that under
Component C for Implementation Support, the SPADA project financed about US$ 3.4
million for implementation support, technical assistance and facilitators in 2007-2008 in
the 19 districts of Aceh and Nias, while the block grants for investments were funded, as
expected, by a special SPADA project for Aceh-Nias. In order to rapidly respond to the
particular needs in those locations, funding also included mapping of the socio-economic
conditions, assessment of social tensions, human resources and local government
capacity in the aftermath of the tsunami.

1.7. Other significant changes
In July 2009, the variable rate loan was converted to a fixed rate loan and the loan
number was changed. In April 2010, the project was restructured and the legal
agreements were amended. The main changes were as follows:
    1. US$ 2.9 million of the loan was re-allocated to increase block grants by US$ 0.4
       million, and planning grants by US$ 2.5 million. Correspondingly, the allocation

 The nationwide SPADA project was approved after the tsunami in Aceh but before the separate SPADA
Aceh-Nias project was finalized. After finalization, the nationwide SPADA project excluded Aceh and
Nias, which was reflected in a restructuring in 2010.

8
  The DCA did not detail projects components, but rather disbursement categories. The 2010 revision
referred back to the four original components of the PAD.




                                                                          7
      for implementation support was reduced by US$ 1.8 million, and the allocation
      for monitoring was reduced by US$ 1.1 million.
   2. The PDO objective was revised (see section 1.3 above).
   3. Revisions to the procurement schedule were made.
   4. The outputs / outcome indicators were revised.

Additional restructurings: In September 2011, the Bank approved an extension of the
project by 6 months to June 30, 2012 to allow completion of sub-project implementation.
This was formalized through an amendment to the Loan and Credit Agreements. In June
2012, the closing date was further extended to December 31, 2012 to allow finalization of
impact studies.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1. Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Project design. Bank preparations for a CDD project to operate in conflict-ridden areas
had begun in 2001, reviewing the possibility of applying KDP procedures to design a
program of investments in post-conflict communities. The proposed project, inter-
mittently called ‘Support for Conflict-Ridden Areas Project’ (SCRAP) or ‘Recovery
Support for Conflict-Ridden Areas Project’ (RSCRAP), was to be implemented by the
Ministry of Home Affairs and would help the government to develop and pilot strategies
to support transition to longer-term development in post-conflict areas. The project would
achieve this objective through three types of activities: (i) strengthening community-led
planning and dispute resolution processes; (ii) promoting private investment and job
creation; and (iii) increasing utilization of effective education and health services. A PID
for the project was prepared and made public in January 2004.

However, there were quite significant delays in the final preparations of the SCRAP
project, mainly due to internal GoI political discussions, including the 2004 national
elections and the resulting change in ministries. During negotiations with the new
Government in late 2004, the conflict-ridden areas project changed character and found a
new home in the Ministry for Development of Disadvantaged Areas. It also took a new
name to reflect these changes: ‘Support for Poor and Disadvantaged Areas Project’ or
SPADA. Reasons for these changes include the reduction of regional conflicts and a more
explicit focus by the new government on poverty reduction and disadvantaged areas, with
a special state ministry for development of disadvantaged areas, established by the new
government, and appointed to implement the SPADA project.

Building on the old conflict project, the new decentralization agenda and with a deepened
commitment to disadvantaged areas, the new design aimed to develop a framework for
addressing both poverty and governance in disadvantaged and post-conflict areas. The
key challenge was that in Indonesia’s poorest districts many government services
functioned poorly at best or, in conflict areas, had collapsed. Furthermore, emerging
lessons from KDP signaled that adjustments were needed in terms of links to district-
level operations and peace-building efforts.


                                                                8
Therefore, the new SPADA project was re-designed to concentrate on the planning
process itself, and specifically on three key areas whose goals were the improvement of
local livelihoods: (i) community-based planning, (ii) the improvement of the local
investment climate, and (iii) in response to community demands, better social services,
particularly in education and health. SPADA's overall strategy combined a broad
program for involving sectoral service providers with a bottom-up planning process to lay
the foundations for a sustainable approach that over time would be blended into improved
district planning and budgeting. Different from KDP, parts of the block grants were
earmarked for interventions to improve health and education service delivery at the
district level. The project also had an explicit focus on post-conflict reconstruction, aimed
to improve community legal awareness towards managing disputes and legal problem
based on their own capacity as a key factor to support economic and social development,
increase stability and security and social welfare. A final sub-component program was
aimed at assisting local government in creating enabling business and investment climate
through private sector development.

Participating provinces and districts. The newly established Ministry of Development
for Disadvantaged Areas had identified the 199 poorest districts in the country, and 40 of
these districts were originally included in the project9; the selected districts were located
in the following eight provinces: 10 Maluku, North Maluku, Central Sulawesi, Nusa
Tenggara Barat (later replaced by Lampung), West Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan,
Nusa Tenggara Timor and Aceh (replaced by Bengkulu).

Lessons taken into account. SPADA was able to build on an emerging body of research
and experience from Indonesian and international operations. The task team drew on the
Bank's increasingly broad experience with conflict work, and benefited from advice from
the Bank's Conflict Prevention Unit, and diagnostic and preparatory work funded by
related JSDF-funded projects. Some general lessons reflected in the proposed design
were: (i) ensuring that post conflict work as much as possible embeds good governance
and economic practices from the start; (ii) the importance of building upon existing
cultural resources and institutions that promote peace. However, at the time the project
was designed, there was still relatively limited experience in the Bank of working
operationally in post-conflict and politically fragile areas: in fact, the preparation and
implementation of SPADA – and its challenges – contributed to the development of the
operational policy on post-conflict projects. Implementation was thus characterized by
improvisation and ‘sailing while building the ship’, both by MinDA and the Bank.

From KDP, a main lesson was that community efforts needed more direct linkages to
district planning to be sustainable. This implied strengthening the existing institutions


9
  The PAD stated that the Project through a replication strategy ‘will extend to the 100 poorest districts in
Indonesia’. This is not mentioned in the Loan/Credit Agreements.
10
   A 2005 decree from GoI led to Nusa Tenggara being replaced by the province of Lampung; and
Bengkulu replaced Aceh because the latter was covered by a separate project. These changes reduced the
total number of participating districts to 32.


                                                                              9
rather than creating new ones; and inclusion of marginalized individuals and groups in
decision-making and as beneficiaries, achieved through inclusive processes rather than by
targeting aid. For the program to function well, strong support from local government
was needed, while preventing elite capture of the project processes. Also, early delivery
of at least some development benefits was considered as more important than protracted
planning and training programs to develop full capacity before any funds are released.
Demand-based programs such as KDP were thought to be less wasteful and more
appreciated than top down supply-driven programs, and projects in conflict areas should
have an exit strategy in case conflict resumes.

Risks and their mitigation. Project design and appraisal had rated the overall risk of the
project as ‘Substantial’ and proposed mitigation strategies and actions as follows:
      Institutional weakness was a major risk because MinDA was newly established
       and lacked experience. Furthermore, as a state ministry without line agencies,
       MinDA was dependent on local government agencies in disadvantaged and poor
       areas of the country, with limited capacity.
      To address the risk of conflict recurring and the security situation worsening, the
       project had a component on conflict resolution and post-conflict reintegration.
       The project would also have a flexible implementation design, being able to stop
       work and re-program; reduce or pull out staff so as not to put people at risk; use
       force majeure in consultant contracts.
      There was a high risk of delays because of weak local governments unable to run
       open planning processes and with low capacity for timely, quality implementation
       The project was provided with extra Bank oversight and supervision from a DFID
       trust fund (reported under SPADA Aceh-Nias) to ensure full implementation of
       the anti-corruption action plan and for capacity development and contract
       management.
      Financial management was rated as high risk, in particular how grant beneficiaries
       would use and account for the funds, and whether the funds were used for the
       intended purposes. Based on KDP experience, a comprehensive action plan was
       drawn up to mitigate the FM risks; it included special TA to the government’s
       project management unit (PMU) and Project Implementing Unit (PIU) and to the
       local implementation teams, independent monitoring by NGOs and journalists,
       internal controls and external audits. Adaptable management was proposed in case
       of abuse or misuse of funds, with the possibility to shift the project to different
       districts.


2.2. Implementation
The organizational arrangements for implementation consisted of a Project Management
Unit (PMU) at BAPPENAS and the project implementation unit (PIU) in MinDA. At the
local levels, district planning committees and project management units (Satker) were
established. Provincial and district coordination teams were established and led by local
BAPPEDA offices, in order to reinforce their role as coordinator for local planning.




                                                                10
Early implementation of the project was hampered by challenges related to
implementation capacity, funds flow and procurement procedures. Neither the national
management consultants (NMC) nor the eight provincial management consultants (PMC)
were operational until late 2006, the latter due to proposed key staff substitutions. The
central government budget for the first year of disbursement (2007) was late and funds
were not fully disbursed. In 2008, actual disbursements for project activities showed a lag
of 56% behind planned disbursements. Reviews also found weaknesses in the Bank's
procurement support. 11 national procurement packages were still outstanding in 2008. A
total of 46 procurement packages were planned under the project, and only 29 contracts
had been awarded by August 2012.

These initial difficulties and delays were due to a number of reasons: (i) KPDT’s lack of
experience with both the Bank and CDD projects; (ii) national-level problems with
procurement due to inconsistency between World Bank and GoI procurement guidelines,
(iii) late issuance of central government budget that caused poor quality planning; (iv)
difficulties with attracting qualified consultants willing to work at government-set salary
rates; (v) insufficient project management operating funds with poor performance and
high consultant turnover; (vi) the lack of an operational management information system
(MIS) limited the ability to effectively manage implementation and monitor progress; and
core technical assistance was still not in place, leaving important positions unfilled
because government had difficulties in recruiting qualified procurement, financial
management and private sector development specialists.

In early 2008, the Bank requested that (i) coordination between project actors be
increased; (ii) the consultants’ poor performance be improved, including for supervision
activities; and (iii) the procurement processes be accelerated, especially for the NMC,
PMC and DMC as well as other technical assistance such as procurement and financial
management, and implementation assistance for Private Sector Development and for
Mediation and Community Legal Empowerment. During the same period, GOI had
already taken some corrective actions by holding weekly coordination meetings between
BAPPENAS and MinDA. But procurement delays continued to impede progress
throughout 2008, and supervision by consultants was deemed to be ineffective due in part
to poor training and insufficient remuneration and operational costs.

Having identified the pitfalls of delay fairly early on, and in order to mitigate against a
vacuum in technical assistance to project implementation, in 2007, MinDA and the Bank
established joint task teams to assist project implementation. The task team responded to
late procurement by hiring a full-time procurement analyst in COSU, dedicated to
SPADA. The Bank's procurement team had also conducted numerous training sessions
for the PCs and PIU staff between 2005 and 2008. In an attempt to accelerate the
mobilization of consultants, the Bank also offered assistance with simplifying and
streamlining procurement processes.

The JSDF trust fund (TF054749) on ‘Grants for Returning and Integrating Internally
Displaced People in Conflict Affected Areas and Vouchers for Refugees’ also had
significant issues. The project only managed to disburse 12% of total funds (USD



                                                               11
404,354.97). During its implementation, funds were only used to identify the target group
registration of IDPs, and review the target group’s proposal. But the implementing
agency was unable to disburse grants to the target groups. Challenges include slow
implementation due to several changes in project management and lack of procurement
and financial management administration of implementing agency. Late progress was
also caused by lack of familiarity with government systems of implementing partner
ICMC. In 2009, the Bank rejected the grant extension due to late progress and the fact
that sustainability of any of the activities was unlikely. The Government instead focused
on adopting the same participatory approach in identified post-conflict provinces.

Progress of Implementation and Mid-term review (MTR). As a result of the early
challenges described above, the development objectives and overall progress at that time
were rated as ‘moderately unsatisfactory’. Specifically, financial management (FM),
project management, procurement, and M&E were rated as ‘unsatisfactory’.
Disbursement was only at 41% by 2009, and a mid-term review (MTR) was conducted in
February-March 2009, jointly with the MTR for the SPADA Aceh-Nias project. Some 15
problems and corresponding actions were identified and agreed, mainly relating to
procurement, financial management, and general project monitoring and management.

Following the MTR, with the GoI and Bank working jointly to overcome the earlier
problems and delays described above, the progress of implementation started to improve,
and planning and community block grants from the carry-over 2007 and the 2008 cycle
were disbursed. Also, several key procurement packages were in the final stages of
procurement, and an improved MIS was scheduled to become operational in 2009. Since
the prospects for continuing good implementation support were assessed to be good
during the MTR, GoI and Bank agreed to restructure the project.

Restructuring approved in 2010. In addition to revising the PDO and reducing the
number of target districts from 40 to 32, project restructuring comprised a number of
other changes:
      Revised results framework with redefined indicators and targets;
      Changes in planned activities, such as dropping two M&E activities that were
       deemed non-essential at that stage of the project;
      Simplification of procurement tasks by dropping those procurement packages
       with activities that could easily be folded into existing contracts by amending
       their scope;
      Reallocation of funds by increasing the categories for block grants by US$0.4
       million and for planning grants by US$2.5 million, and reducing the categories for
       implementation support and M&E correspondingly (see above); and
      Commitment to improve financial management (FM) practices at all levels
       through additional training, qualified FM specialists in the field, increased
       supervision and monitoring by facilitators, and regular bank reconciliation
       procedures by KPDT.




                                                              12
The main benefits of the restructuring were better quality monitoring of project progress
and impacts, more funds for block grants, and simpler procurement. A project paper and
memorandum proposing the restructuring were prepared in January 2010, and the
necessary amendments to the financing agreements were approved in April 2010.

Improved performance in 2010-2012. During subsequent review missions in 2010, the
Bank found that 13 of the 15 agreed actions in the MTR had been taken and project
performance had improved, especially the completion of sub-projects, fiduciary control
and dealing with fraud and mismanagement cases. Full block grants were disbursed in
2009, 2010 and 2011.

The main reason for this turn-around was improved support from the NMC and PIU, a
strengthening of the MinDA management team, and that the capacity development
provided by MinDA and the Bank Task Team to project stakeholders started to bear fruit.
The effectiveness of the program depended on intensive facilitation, technical assistance
and supervision. The SPADA projects had in 2010-11 a team of 20 technical specialists
in Jakarta. At the provincial and district levels in the eight provinces, SPADA had 421
professional staff members.

During the second half of 2011, after the completion of sub-projects, much effort went
into project documentation and closing. This included the formal hand-over of SPADA
sub-projects from MinDA to respective local governments so that O&M funds could be
allocated. Project documentation and inventory were completed by December 2011, and
sub-projects were formally handed over by MinDA to the respective district governments
in participating districts by December 2011 for formal registration. ‘SPADA
Maintenance Teams’ have been established in all districts, and guidelines and training
provided by MinDA. Although outside of the direct control of MinDA, most districts
have committed themselves to provide budgets for operations and maintenance.

A closing date extension to June 30, 2012 was agreed to allow completion of sub-projects
and final activities in two provinces. In May 2012, a further extension of the closing date
to December 31, 2012 was approved to allow completion of the impact studies needed for
the PCR and ICR.


2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Design: The core SPADA monitoring and evaluation was a package of quantitative and
qualitative baseline and intermediate surveys and case analyses to track impacts due to
project interventions. The M&E policy and direction were under responsibility of
BAPPENAS’s Project Management Unit (PMU), while the day-to-day management of
the M&E activities were implemented by MinDA’s Project Implementation Unit (PIU).
This framework was designed to be conducted through a series of exercises, including
community participatory monitoring, regular field supervision and monthly progress
reporting through MIS, independent monitoring by civil society groups, qualitative and
quantitative household surveys, technical/sectoral studies (EIRR, facility and user
surveys), private sector development assessment tools, conflict incidence mapping,



                                                               13
vulnerable population impact assessments, training tracer impact assessments, and
financial audits.

Implementation: Although the concept for the M&E design in the PAD was ambitiously
comprehensive, it appears that neither GOI agencies nor the Bank paid sufficient
attention to the overall execution of the framework. Most seriously, no independent base-
line study was commissioned. Instead, it was decided that SPADA would use data from
the planned nation-wide Governance and Decentralization Survey (GDS) as base-line.
However, the data generated by the GDS could not be disaggregated to be used as sub-
district base-line data. The MIS for the SPADA program had serious problems, and
‘availability and accuracy of data’ was rated at 5% during 2007/2008 by Bank staff. By
mid-2008 Bank supervision still reported that there was no MIS standard on reporting,
and procurement delays and poor quality technical assistance were blamed for the MIS
problems. Reasons include inadequate resources at the field level for data collection,
unreliable MIS hardware and software (including lack of internet connection), and
insufficient resources at MinDA for procurement and oversight. Because of late
procurement, the exercises of independent monitoring by civil society groups including
public expenditure reviews by NGOs, community participatory monitoring and
evaluation, training tracer impact assessments, as well as health and education monitoring
were cancelled.

To somewhat compensate for the lack of analytical studies, the Task Team commissioned
in 2011 an independent review of the development planning aspects of the SPADA
program. 11 Towards the end of the project, MinDA, in collaboration with the Bank,
decided to collect data on levels of school and health center utilization and to determine
the economic rate of return of sub-projects. A full independent project impact study was
finally carried out by MinDA in October-November 2012 (see Annex 5), which allowed
KPI data to be collected. The PMU at BAPPENAS carried out an evaluation of the
project using DFID trust fund resources and lesson learned workshops with stakeholders
were held in 2011 in Jakarta and Medan. The DFID trust funds also generated ten
relevant analytical studies and evaluations on various aspects of post-conflict governance
and mitigation. Together, these attempts from 2010 onwards allowed sufficient data to be
collected to track indicators in the project results framework. A lesson learned workshop
for community groups, project staff and participating local governments was held in
November 2011. As a result, it is possible to show the achievement of the PDO using the
KPIs.

Utilization. MinDA’s monitoring deficiencies adversely affected the availability of
progress reports from MinDA to the Bank. Annual ‘clinics’ to improve the MIS were
organized by the Bank between 2007 and 2010, and there were also special weekly
clinics held in 2010 and 2011. Regular field visits and monthly progress reports by
project team from the field level made considerable contributions to project M&E,
enabling project teams at the central level to understand whether the project was on

course and whether the intervention was having their desired effect. Specific meetings
with key parties were arranged to discuss the findings and corrective actions required.
The mapping and regular update of conflict incidence (conducted in collaboration with
the World Bank’s Conflict and Development Team) also allowed the project team to
understand more about how to deal effectively with conflict and recovery.
Implementation of a complaints handling system as well as financial audits was reported
to be effective to support implementation of principles of transparency and
accountability. Further, as improvements were made concerning availability and quality
of data, the MIS data was fully utilized and became the main source in preparing project
reports, particularly at the later stages of the project. While the MIS reached only 30% of
data availability and accuracy in 2009, it had improved to more than 85% in 2011.
During project hand-over in 2011, training was provided to local governments in the
utilization of the MIS, and the full data set was handed over to respective district
governments (BAPPEDA).

2.4. Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Four safeguard policies were triggered: (i) Environmental Assessment, (ii) Natural
Habitat, (iii) Indigenous Peoples, and (iv) Projects in Disputed Areas. The overall
safeguard compliance was satisfactory throughout project implementation with no serious
problems.

Environmental Safeguards. Project appraisal had concluded that the small-scale
construction or rehabilitation sub-projects financed by SPADA would have minor
environmental impacts only. This assumption was based on the experience and review of
earlier CDD projects, particularly the KDP series of projects. Similar to these projects,
environmental impacts were to be mitigated and managed through a checklist approach,
supplemented by a negative list of known, potentially damaging, types of sub-projects.
Implementation of these mitigation measures was to be the responsibility of technical
facilitators at the district level, and relevant training was to be provided.

There are no reports of any environmental problems or complaints arising during
implementation. However, environmental supervision and monitoring began rather late
for the SPADA projects, and there was only one training event for environmental
safeguards, held by the Bank in 2011. In spite of limited records of any monitoring that
may have been done early in the project, an assessment by World Bank Safeguard Team
in February 2012 indicated that safeguard policies has been applied in SPADA
implementation, and that the project had incorporated environmental issues in the project
operational manual. Technical assistance to project teams at the local level to integrate
environmental assessment into certification of sub-projects was also provided.

Social Safeguards. The PAD had proposed to use guidelines for land acquisition – the
major potential social safeguards issue in CDD projects – as had been used, and refined
over the years by the KDP projects. These guidelines were incorporated into the project
operating manual: two methods were allowed and well socialized, i.e. voluntary land
donation, or donation with compensation, and consultation was required, and also a
record of donations and associated agreements. However, no records are available of any



                                                               15
systematic monitoring of land acquisition. There were some complaints through the
complaints handling system related to land acquisition but all are reported resolved.

Safeguard assessment by World Bank Safeguard Team in February 2012 confirmed that
perspectives of gender equity and involvement of ethnic groups had been applied in
project implementation. Indigenous people concerns had been incorporated into project
implementation (e.g. Dayak Tribes in West Kalimantan, and Bajo Tribes in Central
Sulawesi), and activities in disputed areas (e.g. North Maluku, Maluku, and Central
Sulawesi) had incorporated peace-building perspectives.

Procurement. Procurement activity planned by the project consisted of 24 Consultants’
Qualification Selection (CQS) packages – mainly for monitoring and studies, 17 Quality
and Cost based Selection (QCBS) packages for technical assistance, three assignments
for individual consultants (IC) and two goods procured by national competitive bidding
(NCB). Procurement performance was initially very poor with only a few packages
finalized according to the procurement schedule, and many delayed by up to a year and
frequently with more than two amendments. The packages for procurement and FM
support were contracted more than two years behind schedule, and subsequently had to
be procured again because the selected firm was debarred. And five CQS packages
(including some monitoring/evaluation activities) were dropped altogether because,
owing to delay, they were either not relevant to project activities anymore or the MTR
had recommended their cancellation. The causes for the poor procurement performance
were: (i) the complexity of the procedures; (ii) the lack of experience and technical skills
of MinDA staff who were new to World Bank processes; and (iii) insufficient capacity
(although the Bank provided procurement training in 2007 and 2008, and MinDA in
2010). The procurement delays and cancellations of several technical assistance packages
– a total of 29 packages (59% QCBS, 24% CQS and the rest were IC and NCB) awarded
out of 46 packages planned – had adverse impacts on the progress and quality of project
implementation. Mitigation actions by the Bank only started to take effect in late 2008,
when disbursement figures began to normalize. By 2010, procurement performance had
improved sufficiently to give the project a rating of ‘Moderately Satisfactory’.

Financial Management, including Audits and Complaints Handling. Financial
management (FM) had been identified as high risk and mitigation measures had been
proposed in the PAD, but the performance of FM throughout much of the project
implementation remained moderately unsatisfactory. By November 2007, MinDA had
not submitted any financial monitoring reports since the grant became effective. The
Bank urged that an individual FM specialist consultant be appointed to assist on all FM
aspects of the project. FM training at the community level was either inadequate or not
done. Late procurement and the low quality of technical assistance contributed to the
poor performance of FM, and poor FM was one of the causes of the moderately
unsatisfactory rating of the project in 2008. In early 2009, the Bank again recommended
to address FM problems with additional training and technical assistance. Funds were
allocated for independent project audits, but not used because MinDA preferred to use
GoI auditors. Audit findings related mainly to the interpretation of tax liability by local
governments. The complaints handling system – modeled on the system used by the KDP



                                                                16
projects – was the core of the anti-corruption plan and did demonstrate effectiveness in
reducing fraud and applying sanctions, such as dismissal of staff and/or legal action,
especially if misused funds are not returned. Overall, the rate of follow-up and resolution
for complaints was high and reached almost 100% by grant closing. It is unfortunate that
this system – used in a number of CDD projects over the years – is solely project-based
and not yet established within government structures12. To respond to the demand for a
more effective control of the financial issues, with additional attention from the Bank task
team and responsiveness by MinDA, the project mobilized additional consultants to
district and provincial level in early 2011, and provided more intensive technical
assistance to local project team, particularly related preparation of financial
records/reports and finalization of fraud cases. By mid-2011, with additional attention
from the Bank task team and responsiveness by MinDA (including appointment of key
additional TA), financial performance improved sufficiently to give the project a FM
rating of ‘Moderately Satisfactory’. Throughout the project, none of the audits were
qualified.

2.5. Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
All project activities in SPADA participating districts were completed in 2011, except for
an additional cycle of sub-grants to seven high-performing districts in West Kalimantan
and Central Sulawesi which were finalized in March 2012. In collaboration with local
governments, project documentation and inventory of physical assets were completed by
December 2011, and infrastructure projects were formally handed over by MinDA to
their respective local governments in early 2012. Notably, all districts committed
themselves to provide O&M budgets in 2012-13 after project closure.

Training in infrastructure maintenance was provided to local government units and
community groups, and a manual on O&M distributed to all project stakeholders. Based
on what, ultimately, was a well operating MIS system, MinDA has also committed itself
to incorporate the SPADA MIS system in their regular tracking of disadvantaged areas. A
free-standing project supported through the national budget by MinDA (‘Bedah Desa’) is
also using similar approaches to SPADA by providing block grants to communities to
meet their basic development needs. Administrative systems for this project are also
based on those of SPADA. The private sector development work under the project
triggered much regional excitement about the need to focus more explicitly on
agricultural value chains and rural livelihoods in these areas, which is part of a new
project presently being designed by MinDA in collaboration with the Bank. The PNPM
Road Map, which is currently being developed by central government (coordinated by
the Secretariat of Vice President), also recognizes some lessons from SPADA for better
design of CDD initiatives in Indonesia in the future, including asset transfer to local




12
  In this context it is important to note that in 2011 the Bank, through the PNPM Support Facility, initiated
discussions with government with aim of working with the national Corruption Eradication Commission
(KPK) to further reduce fraud and misuse of funds in all CDD projects in the Bank’s Indonesia portfolio.
KPK and the National Steering Team for PNPM (Pokja Pengendali PNPM) conducted a media campaign
to build awareness and socialization, including positive lessons from SPADA.


                                                                            17
government and communities, and the role of multi-stakeholder community institutions
for the success of community empowerment projects.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1. Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The CDD approach to investing in community assets and improving participatory
planning was relevant, and provided much-needed community infrastructure and support
for rural livelihoods in the targeted locations, while building trust in government
processes. SPADA showed that communities, given resources and support, can meet a
range of their own development needs even within sectors such as basic health care and
education. However, SPADA also demonstrated that this needs to be matched with
supply-side responses, which was done by the project at its best: linking up with local
government sectoral agencies and securing the commitment of local legislative councils
to improve budget allocations.

The selection of 32 poorest districts in eight provinces (Bengkulu, Lampung, West
Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, Central Sulawesi, East Nusa Tenggara, Maluku, and
North Maluku) known for their conditions of poverty, low human development
indicators, and the prevalence of conflict, was also appropriate. The project’s aim was to
strengthen local participation in development planning, promote private investment and
job creation, and increase utilization of effective education, health, and dispute resolution
services. The MTR in February 2009 reconfirmed the relevance of the project’s
objectives and design while attempting to improve implementation performance
undermined by capacity and procurement bottlenecks.

Elements of project design and implementation also focused on several key areas of the
Bank’s 2009-2012 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Indonesia, namely (i)
community development, (ii) sub-national government institutions and systems, and (iii)
infrastructure. In fact, ‘the centerpiece of Bank engagement has been a long-term
relationship providing knowledge and financing services to the PNPM program.
Institution building is a fundamental part of Bank support for PNPM, with a wide range
of activities to strengthen accountability and enhance capacity at the community level.’13
As SPADA was part of the PNPM Mandiri framework, it was fully relevant to the CPS.

3.2. Achievement of Project Development Objectives
SPADA achieved its development objectives by supporting more than 8,600 project
activities and meeting a range of indicators aimed at helping local governments in some
of Indonesia’s poorest areas to improve local governance, health, education and basic
infrastructure such as water supply, sanitation, transport, and drainage. An independent
lesson-learned study by PATTIRO 14 also concluded that SPADA activities in general

  PATTIRO –World Bank/PNPM Support Facility: Lesson Learned Study on SPADA Planning and
Service Delivery. 2011.


                                                                     18
were successful in strengthening development planning, particularly through financing
activities that had not been accommodated in district budgets. Furthermore, the capacity
building provided under SPADA was appreciated, particularly in trainings that directly
related to community demand for quality public services.

While the number of districts was reduced from 40 to 32 at the time of the MTR,
outcome areas were not affected, as the number and type of beneficiaries remained the
same, and an increase in resulting outputs was seen. An additional round of block grants
in 2011 in seven high-performing project districts compensated for the reduced number
of jurisdictions.

The project has largely achieved its PDO as per the following:

   a. Local-level governance was strengthened through the project’s contribution to
      the building capacity of district governments. The participatory planning process
      allowed community groups to identify their real needs and enabled local
      governments to accommodate these priorities. Specifically the local planning
      boards (Bappeda) and the three technical agencies responsible for project
      activities (Public Works, Education and Health) were strengthened by the project.
      The project involved more than 40,000 local government officials in participatory
      planning and program management. Local authorities and community groups in
      the targeted districts have expressed their commitment to apply the promoted
      participatory planning process as well as to maintain the initiatives when the
      project has ended. All participating districts report use of participatory planning
      processes and the concept of participatory ‘technical review teams’. The
      PATTIRO study found that the multi-stakeholder groups in health and education
      were successful in interacting with local government agencies, promoting
      improved governance outcomes by improving relations between communities and
      local government technical agencies.

       However, there was some naivety on the part of both the Bank and the
       implementation unit in terms of how the project would interact with local
       government planning, and a limited understanding of the challenges posed by a
       deeply entrenched bureaucracy and rent-seeking political economy. Neither the
       implementing agency nor the Bank were able to provide a strong framework for
       the type of local government reforms that the project intended to bring about,
       beyond training, capacity enhancements and increased ownership. This limited
       the ultimate impact of the project to systematically improve district development
       planning. In conclusion, then, the outcomes on governance were mixed even
       though governance mechanisms within the project itself provided a good
       framework for implementation.

   b. Outcomes for growth appeared positive and although there was only one specific
      indicator for this outcome, the underlying enabling conditions to help promote
      private sector economic growth improved, such as regulatory requirements and
      lower barriers to entry, better infrastructure and services, and to some extent



                                                                 19
         governance. Through the establishment of one stop service shops (OSS) for
         business licenses, local businesses benefited from better access, simplified
         procedures and requirements, and less time and money spent when obtaining
         business licenses. There was an increase of 73% in business registration in the
         target districts. The one stop shops are still in operation in 2012. The
         establishment of ‘Forum Daerah Usaha Kecil dan Menengah’ (district forum for
         small and medium scale enterprises) in the target districts enhanced the capacity
         of the SMEs to organize themselves, have a better policy dialogue with local
         authorities, and advocate for local economic governance reform. Several local
         regulations were revised to reduce the costs of doing business for SMEs,
         including lowering of government fees for village markets, micro, small and
         medium enterprise development, community participation on preparation of local
         regulation, and fees for business and trading licensing.

     c. Access to basic public services was improved as reflected in the output targets
        and high satisfaction levels achieved. More than 1,250 health clinics and schools
        were rehabilitated or made more accessible. Training has been provided to
        strengthen the capacity of more than 19,000 teachers and health workers, as well
        as more than 122,000 members of local health and education committees, village
        facilitators and empowerment cadres. Communities are reporting better access to
        water, markets, and education, and improvements in the health of young children
        and mothers. Secondary data from the Ministry of Health shows that the numbers
        of new patients increased by 41% in the project sites. In the end-of-project impact
        assessment, a total of 91% of respondents reported satisfaction with education
        services provided by the project; 89% with health services; and 98% classified
        infrastructure sub-projects as ‘good’ or ‘satisfactory’. Almost 12,000 teachers and
        7,000 health workers received training, and primary school enrollment rates
        increased drastically, although the project team acknowledges that, for this last
        indicator, SPADA was only one contributor amongst others. Data from GoI
        however shows that the national primary school test scores in the participating
        districts decreased 21% from 63 in 2008 to 50 in 2010. This indicator is below the
        target, and beyond the influence of the project. The decline is possibly related to
        the introduction of a new national scoring system during that time period.

3.3. Efficiency15
In December 2011 and June 2012, the SPADA PIU conducted an assessment of a small
selected sample 16 of typical infrastructure sub-projects to determine the actual EIRR.
Results indicate that average EIRRs for SPADA projects are approximately 34.41%, with
higher values for roads, bridges and clean water projects, and lower values for



15
   It should be noted that there was a discrepancy between the higher targets in the DCA (35%) compared
to the 20% in the PAD. The restructuring in 2010 used the PAD target of 20%.

16
  32 sub-projects from 8 districts – including road/bridge, water supply and irrigation – were selected; they
represent 0.4% of the total number of sub-projects.


                                                                            20
irrigation/drainage and public toilet projects. Even though the sample was small, it were
randomly selected and the data can be extrapolated to the entire project. Furthermore, the
EIRR level is roughly commensurate – when adjusted to similar time horizons – with
EIRR levels calculated for similar subprojects completed by the PNPM Rural program in
seven provinces in 2004 and 2012. Similar patterns were also found in these previous
PNPM-Rural studies, where EIRR levels were higher for road/bridge and clean water
projects, and slightly lower for irrigation/drainage projects. Greater efficiency was also
achieved through the use of village labor and construction management in villages
compared to similar, contractor-built infrastructure. Although based on a relatively small
sample, it can be confidently concluded that SPADA met its efficiency indicators.

3.4. Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The project was relevant in addressing problems of governance and poverty in the
poorest districts of the country and was also relevant to the Indonesia Country
Partnership Strategy. Governance outcomes were mixed, particularly in terms of
outcomes beyond the project implementation structure itself. Promotion of growth in
terms of both new businesses and a better enabling environment was very positive, and
evidence of improved service delivery was strong. Results demonstrate that the physical
investments at the end of the project improved economic efficiency. SPADA met five out
of six PDO indicator targets and 14 out of 15 intermediate outcome indicators. However,
there were early delays and implementation bottlenecks, which led to efficiency
shortcomings, and a rating of MS is therefore justified.

It should also be noted that not all achievements can be attributed to the project. Health
and education outcomes have improved during the past decade in Indonesia, and although
the project in the target districts has provided some impetus for these changes, the project
cannot claim full credit for these accomplishments.

3.5. Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Although not a formal objective, nor measured directly in its narrowest income
dimension, the project is likely to have significant poverty impacts as it was targeted to
poor, disadvantaged and post-conflict areas, all with high rates of poverty incidence.
SPADA improved local infrastructure and services, the quality of basic health and
education, and also promoted small business growth and thereby employment creation.
Through the Mediation and Community Legal Empowerment component (MCLE),
SPADA also provided legal assistance and dispute resolution as a key factor to support
economic and social development, increase stability and security and social welfare.
SPADA was also found to increase the variation of community proposals, adding other
community concerns to the ‘general CDD project pattern’ of village roads and bridges.17
Women’s participation in planning and decision meetings averaged 30%. The project in

general benefitted more than 4.7 million people (or about 57% of the total population in
the participating districts), about 42% of which are poor households. Youth sub-projects
were also used as mean to create amity and goodwill among community members, and
thus reduce conflict.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The projects strengthened capacity and roles of community institutions and multi-
stakeholder groups at local level, particularly related to participatory planning processes
and implementation of transparency and accountability in the management of sub-
projects. SPADA has also built capacity of two important public institutions, the Ministry
of Disadvantaged Areas and the Regional Planning Agencies (BAPPEDA) – as well as
local technical agencies (Dinas) that have been directly involved in project management.
This includes improvement in technical aspects of CDD program management, and
reform in mechanisms to strengthen implementation of good governance principles in
development processes. At grant closing, MinDA projected that the new policies will
likely be sustained and that the skills and capacities acquired will assure longer term
benefits from these reforms.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
Few, if any, unintended outcomes were identified, but feedback in stakeholder sessions
would suggest that a project like SPADA raises expectations of a next phase with another
round of grants to satisfy unmet needs of poor and disadvantaged communities. An
external lesson learned study by PATTIRO found that SPADA and PNPM programs with
their assured funding may have a ‘substitution effect’ with regard to community
participation in the regular planning processes at the local level; this is likely due to the
minimum level of accommodation of community proposals in the district budget. This is
one of the reasons why in PNPM, with some ‘maturity’ and experience now established
in local planning processes and positive lessons introduced and learned through the CDD
project process, the new GoI policy of ‘One Village, One Plan’ is now being adopted.

3.6. Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
An end-of-project impact study carried out in 2012 collected beneficiary satisfaction
information in eight provinces in order to summarize the performance of the SPADA
initiative against its achievement indicators and targets. The study focuses on satisfaction
with the provision of health and education services provided through, or financed in part by,
SPADA. The results showed positive impacts. On average, 90% of students were
‘satisfied’ or ‘very satisfied’ with education services provided by teachers trained by the
project. And 94% of patients were ‘satisfied’ or ‘very satisfied’ with health services
provided by midwives and cadres trained by the project. Services needed by patients were
prenatal, immunization, childbirth and general health checkup. See Annex 5 for full details.

In February 2012, a lesson learned workshop attended by project staff, government
officials and community representatives were held in Palu (Central Sulawesi) to draw
lessons from project implementation. Feedback included:
- Confirmation of the need to continue funding CDD projects, since villages do not
    have enough discretionary funds to cover their development needs;


                                                                 22
-   Activities funded through the block grants and planning grants were highly relevant,
    especially rural infrastructure and capacity building of teachers and health workers;
-   Provincial and district planning boards (Bappeda) were effective in their coordination
    role with other technical agencies;
-   Late issuance of central government budget (DIPA) caused poor quality planning and
    implementation of subprojects in the short time that was available;
-   Role of provincial BAPPEDA office was considered insufficient; this was due to their
    limited budget for supervising the project. In the future, it is hoped that BAPPEDA
    can play a greater coordination role, by for example hosting quarterly meetings to
    review the progress implementation, and follow up supervision to the project would
    be done based on the meeting recommendation;
-   Different schedules of SPADA and regular planning processes led to a lack of
    synergy between project activities and regular government programs;
-   There was very limited community involvement in monitoring project activities, but
    good involvement in planning and implementation;
-   Low quality of consultants/facilitators resulted in inadequate supervision - the latter
    was due to insufficient budget allocation for consultants in a very competitive
    employment environment; and
-   For future projects, there should be a clear method to calculate the portion and ratio of
    planning and block grant for selected location. For example, the planning grant in
    some sub-districts was equal to block grant allocation and was not equal to the
    number of villages within a district.

A more detailed report on this workshop can be found in Annex 6.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
The public infrastructure funded under the project is likely to be sustained. Sub-projects
were designed and built in a simple and cost effective manner, and are reported as easy
and affordable to operate and maintain. Sub-projects were selected by the involved
communities, increasing stakeholder commitment to future operations. Participating local
governments have expressed their commitment to maintain these assets, and maintenance
teams are established in all districts; however, insufficient policy and budget available at
local level might risk their sustainability. Likewise, even though local governments have
committed themselves to use SPADA governance processes, including participation and
sharing of information, there is a moderate risk concerning effective implementation of
participatory planning in sub-districts and districts due to the lack of a clear legal
framework. The one stop service shops and local regulation for business promotion
developed through the project seem to be sustainable, and were still in operation in 2012.
Lastly, continued social conflicts in some project sites (e.g. in Central Sulawesi, Maluku,
Central Kalimantan), could affect governance and growth outcomes. Taken all these
factors into account, the risk rating is Moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1. Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

-   The Bank responded well to local demand with a new design, and adapted to a rapidly
    shifting policy and institutional context;
-   The Bank was successful in mobilizing grants through multi- and bilateral trust funds
    that supported the PDOs;
-   Owing to the long preparation period and multiple stakeholder demands, the project,
    as designed, was too ambitious and attempted to cover too many diverse activities and
    locations, including some difficult pilots such as improving access to justice, and
    support for conflict resolution;
-   There were inconsistencies and discrepancies in and between key project preparation
    and lending documents (e.g. PAD, DCA, and Result Framework);
-   The Bank designed a results framework with too many performance indicators, some
    of which were over-ambitious and for which results would be unattributable, others of
    which had output targets set too low, or where no baseline was available or properly
    planned. Furthermore, there were differences between some of the intermediary
    indicators listed in the PAD, the DCA and the M&E framework developed by the
    project, and little attention to assessment of governance impacts, despite this being a
    key part of the PDO; and
-   There was limited understanding of the challenges posed by a deeply entrenched
    bureaucracy and how the project would interact with local government planning. The
    Bank underestimated the local governance resilience in the planning system, in which
    grants outside of the regular system do not necessarily spill-over or impact the regular
    planning process.

In conclusion, the Bank developed a complex governance project to be implemented in
fragile, remote and conflict-prone areas of Indonesia by a newly established and untested
implementation unit, with key risks not well mitigated, leading to significant delays in
early implementation. While QAG rated the quality of entry as Satisfactory, the ICR team,
although unable to find documents to review the justification, finds that rating overly
generous. Based on the considerations above, the rating is Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory




                                                                24
-    Supervision was frequent and intensive and attempted to address the considerable
     number of implementation problems, funded in part through Bank Executed Trust
     Funds at the PNPM Support Facility18
-    Findings and recommendations were discussed on a regular basis with GOI’s project
     team;
-    Advice and reporting by Bank staff (e.g. through back-to-office reports, aide
     memoires and management letters) was good throughout implementation;
-    The availability of a number of trust funds was well used for doing much more
     intense supervision and implementation support. Collaboration with other units (e.g.
     PREM, OSU, PSF’s Field Team) in the missions, supported the task team to
     comprehensively analyze findings and develop recommendations;
-    Bank staff worked assiduously on the problem areas, where tensions existed between
     GoI and Bank guidelines, in FM, procurement (especially for mobilizing consultants
     in the field) and poor capacity, but only towards the end of the project, with new
     leadership in MinDA was some success achieved in overcoming the impediments to
     efficient procurement, good FM and a well-functioning MIS; and
-    Regular coordination meetings with GOI to monitor and discuss progress of the
     agreed follow-up actions allowed the Task Team and GOI to appropriately identify
     further actions required

Despite the initial problems and procurement delays, the Bank’s supervision efforts and
implementation support helped to slowly improve performance, especially in the period
after the MTR and 2010 restructuring. It significantly improved the way the task team
and GOI’s project team worked together in addressing systematic project issues (e.g.
financial management, procurement, monitoring and reporting, and project sustainability)
and in managing project risks. Based on these considerations, the rating is Moderately
Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
The rating for overall performance is the lowest of (a) and (b) above.

5.2. Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

-    The government had made poverty reduction and post-conflict reconstruction one of
     its top priorities, and support for this project was strong;




18
   The World Bank-executed PNPM Support Facility or PSF was established in 2007 as a flexible
institutional mechanism whereby donors can provide high quality, coordinated technical advice and
targeted financial assistance in support of the GoI’s PNPM with both the ‘guarantees’ of a robust system,
and with the space for creativity and innovation.




                                                                           25
-   GoI, through BAPPENAS, prepared a national strategy for conflict prevention and
    mitigation and made the project part of it;
-   National level government had created a special, multi-sector working group, headed
    by BAPPENAS, specifically to guide the development of this project;
-   BAPPENAS/PMU provided strong guidance and quality enhancement support to
    MinDA;
-   GoI provided budget resources for financing the block grants and administrative
    support;
-   Even though having significant ‘teething problems’ at the outset, MinDA and the
    various levels of management consultants gained experience and capacity, and the
    project disbursed fully in 2009, 2010 and 2011; and
-   More efforts are required to effectively facilitate inter-ministerial coordination and
    synchronization of CDD initiatives, and in delivering government programs
    particularly in poor districts and disadvantaged areas.

Although there were considerable delays early during implementation, GoI efforts and
performance were sufficient to overcome the numerous initial difficulties. Based on this
consideration, the rating is Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

-   Through finalization of more than 8,600 project activities, MinDA succeeded to
    facilitate improvement of local infrastructure and services, quality of basic health and
    education, promotion of small business growth and employment creation, as well as
    enhancement of local governments capacity in managing CDD activities;
-   MinDA succeeded in introducing participatory planning in participating districts.
    Local authorities and community groups appreciated and have expressed their
    concern to apply the introduced planning process;
-   Due to their lack of experience and capacity MinDA staff were not able to procure
    consultants services in a timely manner; many packages were delayed - 30% by more
    than a year;
-   Late establishment of the SPADA secretariat caused uncertainties and delays;
-   Release of the government funds (DIPA) was consistently late with adverse effects on
    project implementation at the sub-district levels;
-   Only limited M&E studies were carried out during project implementation, and no
    base-line study;
-   After the MTR, MinDA managed to improve implementation performance sufficiently
    to meet the Bank’s quality requirement for an extension of the closing date;
-   Procurement, FM and the MIS improved during the latter two years of the project.
    The complaints handling system was generally effective in resolving fraud cases;



                                                                26
-   Quick and proper responses from MinDA to the demand for a more intensive technical
    assistance at the field level during project closure period by mobilizing additional
    resources from PIU Secretariat as field consultants had been demobilized; and
-   Lessons from SPADA implementation have been utilized by MinDA in improving
    similar community development programs.

Similar to the rating of the Recipient performance, following considerable initial delays
and capacity issues, the implementing agency improved their performance throughout the
implementation period, and especially following the MTR. A complex project with many
sub-components was implemented by a new and untested ministry in poor and remote
areas that managed in the end to deliver the project objectives. Taken this into account, a
rating of Moderately Satisfactory is considered appropriate.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Recipient Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The rating for overall Recipient performance is the lowest of (a) and (b) above. After a
slow start with significant teething problems, project performance improved over the full
course of project implementation and the project reached most of its development
objectives, enough to warrant a MS rating over the full period of the project.


6. Lessons Learned

Working with a new ministry as implementing agency in fragile local contexts:
Project design and appraisal had identified that institutional weakness of MinDA was a
risk given that MinDA was newly established, lacked experience, did not have line
agency representation at the local level, and was dependent on local government agencies
in poor and disadvantaged parts of the country. A newly created Ministry, appointed as
the implementing agency of a complex project for which they actually had a limited
mandate, and which was to be implemented in remote and low-capacity districts, will
take considerable time to get organized and up to speed with project implementation. In
such situations, one of SPADA’s clear lessons is to resist the temptation to ‘over-design’
the related operation. Needs in such disadvantaged areas are considerable and multi-
sectoral, nonetheless, with the related capacity constraints and risks, immediately tasking
a new agency with delivery of a complicated project is likely to run into delays and
bottlenecks. Certainly when dealing with a new ministry or implementing agency,
additional training, special consultants and associated resources for implementation
support must be provided in the project and by the Bank’s task team. Action plans must
be jointly drafted, mitigation measures clearly outlined, and followed-through by a
competent task team. This could not have been done without trust funded resources made
available through the Bank-administered PNPM Support Facility.

Sustainability of project assets: After completion of sub-projects, substantial efforts
were made by MinDA to ensure that project assets would be effectively operated and
maintained by the respective local governments. Participating districts expressed their


                                                               27
commitment to provide budget for operations and maintenance, which was a considerable
and positive achievement by MinDA. A formal project asset hand-over from MinDA to
respective local governments was conducted and the ‘SPADA Project Maintenance
Teams’ were established in all districts. Guidelines and training were provided to district
governments (e.g. to local planning boards and the technical agencies responsible for
project activities, i.e. public works, education and health). Nevertheless, unclear local
regulations and mechanisms to continue the activities when the project ended as well as
insufficient local budget available to support the maintenance continued to be challenging
issues. Assessment of district capacity during the selection process (e.g. related to local
regulation and budget for operation and maintenance), as well as capacity of local level
institutions and human resources to maintain and sustain project activities should be part
of the project design, not an after-thought.

Strengthening community institutions to ensure sustainability of project initiatives:
The community institutions (e.g. Technical Review Teams, Sub-project Management
Teams, Sub-project Maintenance Teams, School Committees, and other multi-
stakeholder groups) played significant roles in the whole cycle of SPADA activities, from
assessment, planning, implementation, monitoring, to evaluation. Involvement of the
technical review teams in the participatory planning process for example, enabled local
governments to accommodate priorities from the village levels, and allowed community
groups to identify and voice their real needs. At the project end, these institutions are
expected to play an increased role in community engagement activities as a whole,
particularly in facilitating participatory planning processes, community organization and
mobilization of resources, and in promoting social accountability and implementation of
good governance principles. Lessons from SPADA show, however, that additional efforts
and investments would be needed to ensure sustained and effective contribution from
these institutions – the building of community institutions may not successfully be
achieved within one project cycle.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

Both MinDA (PIU) and Bappenas (PMU) have, in their written comments to the draft
ICR, provided broad agreement with the document. They have reported that the main
issues during implementation were: (i) several activities were planned by the SPADA
task team using local budget financing but were not properly communicated right from
the start; (ii) delays in the implementation guidelines (which led to delays in
disbursement) were partly caused by interventions by Bank staff in technical design; (iii)
the procurement committee lacked support for procurement processes as advice was
based on Bank guidelines and did not take GoI guidelines and the specificities of
disadvantaged areas into consideration; (iv) advice was provided by the Bank’s task team
without reference to State Administration Processes; and (v) SPADA integrated well with
the overall regional planning, with several districts inspired to improved their
development planning development by adopting local regulations.




                                                               28
These comments reflect the tension that existed throughout the project between the
Bank’s fiduciary requirements and the reliance among local governments on country
systems. In future projects, it is recommended that clarifications and capacity building to
local governments is done early in the implementation stage.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

All data on the project outputs have been drawn from MinDA’s draft completion report
as recorded in the project MIS.

Component A – Sub District Grants
Types and details of outputs
The main project outputs were delivered under this component. Total disbursed grants for
sub-projects amount to 99.76%, with 100% utilization. They span three sectors for
utilization of sub district grants namely health, education, and infrastructure, while the
sub-district grants were utilized for those three sectors and supported youth activities.
The activities were not only physical outputs, but also non-physical outputs, as described
in the Table below:

In summary, 47% of block grants were utilized to support the improvement of health and
education and youth activities. The youth component mainly covered purchasing of
sports equipment, rehabilitated of badminton or volley courts and training for small
business. These youth sub-projects were used as a means to create peace and reduce
conflict. And in accordance with the Borrower’s Completion report, at least 50% of
infrastructure sub-projects were supporting the private sector development component.

Quality of outputs
A challenge has been to ensure the availability of operation and maintenance (O&M)
costs for sub-projects. Referring to a study carried out in late 2012, around 67% of
samples were adequately maintained. Prior to project closing in 2012, the training for an
established maintenance team was delivered as a key forward planning and mitigation
action and the inventory of project assets was also reported by KPDT to PNPM Pokja
Pengendali to ensure asset hand over from SPADA to PNPM Rural.

Component Two – District Grants
The project disbursed 100% of district allocations for grants, supporting construction of
636 new infrastructure sub-projects, with an additional 430 schools and 259 health clinics
rehabilitated. As in component one, there were two types of grant disbursed, e.g. planning
and block grants. The planning grant was utilized to support district decision meeting
forums, technical review meetings, and capacity building to support the planning
activities, including also for business forum meetings and private sector committee
training. Detail outputs supported by this component described below:

Quality of outputs
The quality of 88% of the infrastructure built was classified as satisfactory. The same
concerns on maintenance of sub-projects also applied at district level, yet, based on an
independent study, it has been confirmed that 96.4% of infrastructure sub-projects were
maintained and supported by local government budget. KPDT also managed to register
the sub-projects into the Accounting and Management Information Systems of State
Property.

Component Three – Capacity Development
There were three types of activity supported by this component, e.g. legal assistance and
Aid Dispute Resolution (ADR), capacity building for health and education, and
promoting private investment. The component was successfully implemented. Through
mediation and community legal empowerment and private sector development initiatives,
the project provided legal aid and case handling assistance to more than 60,000 persons,
and recommendations on regulatory improvement was available in five districts. Some
recommendations focused on the area of revision of retribution rate on local market and
village markets; micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) development, community
participation in preparation of local regulations, and retribution rate on business and
trading licensing (SIUP) and restaurants. Most of these activities were supported by
planning and block grants. Detail achievements against targets are available in Table 3

Component Four – Implementation Support
Total funds disbursed for implementation support were 94.1%, utilized to finance
management consultants at national, provincial, and district, sub-district facilitators,
technical assistance for procurement and financial management, implementing agency of
private sector development and mediation and community legal empowerment, media
monitoring, consulting firm for output study, training of trainers for school and health
committees, and lesson learned workshops. 14% of funds allocated were utilized to
support provision of technical assistance for SPADA in Aceh and Nias, e.g. consulting
services at provincial and district level, consulting firm for needs assessment of health
and education, and pre-assignment training for Aceh and Nias provincial and district
consultants during early implementation (2006-2008).

Below is the number of consultants that supported SPADA. Note that some consulting
services for province based monitoring, law and dispute resolution research, monitoring
and evaluation district capacity building, and technical assistance for women headed
household were cancelled due to the delayed project procurement processes.

The core consultants from national to district level and sub-district facilitators were
mobilized in time in mid-2007 to provide technical assistance for disbursement of block
and planning grants. Delays in procurement caused the late mobilization of consultants
for private sector development, mediation and community legal empowerment and
procurement and Financial Management. Consultants were almost fully mobilized in
2009.

Consultants Year of Mobilization
 Year    Planned     Actual    Percentage
 2007      447        320         72%
 2008      447        320         72%
 2009      447        362         81%
 2010      447        406         91%

 2012       72        70          97%

Referring to Annual Reports and the Project Completion Report prepared by MinDA in
addition to observation during implementation support missions, the quality of technical
assistance was improved parallel with the mobilization of consultants in 2009. The
challenges faced during implementation were: coordination among different consultants
managed by different consulting services firms; and filling empty positions in remote
locations. The utilization of supervision costs by consultants to province, district, sub-
district, and villages was more than 60%, meaning that consultants spent most of their
time in providing technical assistance to local governments, community and sub ordinary
consultants.

Based on focus group discussions on private sector development activity during the ouput
study, the businesses felt that technical assistance provided was too short and did not
enable them to receive additional benefit to develop local business and advocacy for
enabling business environment. The technical assistance in financial management has
contributed to consistently improving financial management implementation in SPADA.
The presence of procurement consultants at national and sub national level was able to
escalate the procurement process at national level and improve understanding of local
government and communities on procurement procedures for utilizing district and sub-
district block grants.

Component Five– Monitoring, and Special Studies
This component was not utilized by the borrower and was reallocated to support the other
components such as providing additional block grants to seven districts in West
Kalimantan and Central Sulawesi in 2011 and consulting services for implementation.
The Borrower was utilizing national budget funds and DFID TF 09666 for monitoring
and evaluation (refer to SPADA Aceh-Nias, ICR no 2260). This included the following
TA and studies: (a) Manual on SPADA monitoring and evaluation includes testing of the
manual at 7 SPADA provinces and 10 districts; and (b) Study on SPADA acceptance and

effectiveness level through EIRR analysis and client satisfaction survey at Simeleu in
Aceh, Alor and Flores Timor in East Nusa Tenggara. A full independent project impact
study was finally carried out by MinDA in October-November 2012 funded through
Implementation Support Funds. Other outputs targeted under this component, e.g. 1
unified MIS system functioning, was also achieved through utilization of Component
Four implementation support.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Introduction. In 2012, the Project Implementation Unit conducted a rapid assessment to
analyze the economic benefits of the small-scale infrastructure subprojects financed by
the project. This annex summarizes the report prepared by PIU, which contains an
analysis of a sample of 32 infrastructure subprojects in eight districts in all project
provinces. These subprojects represent about 0.37 percent of all subprojects. They were
chosen to roughly represent the overall sub-project mix and were analyzed according to
an EIRR methodology developed by the KDP/PNPM projects. Results indicate that the
average EIRR sub-projects is 34.41%, with higher values for road, small jetty, market &
bridge, and lower values for irrigation, drainage, electricity and public toilet sub-projects.
The analysis covered the results of three type of economic and financial analysis: (i)
economic internal rate of return, (ii) net present value, and (iii) benefit cost ratio.

Economic Internal Rate of Return. These EIRRs are roughly similar to EIRRs
calculated for similar subprojects completed by the PNPM Rural program in East and
Central Java, South and West Sulawesi, West Kalimantan, North Sumatera, and NTT
provinces in 2004 and 2012 (see Torrens 2005 and World Bank 2012). The patterns are
also similar to these previous PNPM-Rural studies, where EIRR levels were higher for
road and bridge and water supply projects, and slightly lower for irrigation and drainage
projects.

This and previous EIRR studies have been relatively expensive given the methodology's
preference for technical specialists (engineers and economists) to both gather data from


                                                                  37
the field and perform the EIRR analysis and calculations. Additionally, the usefulness of
the EIRR methodology itself to reliably capture the actual gains from these types of
community-planned and community-built small-scale infrastructure projects is
increasingly being called into question. Given these concerns, but equally importantly
because the SPADA results from the smaller sample conform broadly to previous
analyses, the Task Team and MinDA decided not to launch a full-scale, SPADA EIRR.

Net Present Value. NPV is an indicator of how much value an investment or project
adds to the local development. On the average over five years from 2007 to 2012, the
infrastructure sub-project yields IDR 61,654,054 IDR. Yet, public toilet project was
considered not to be undertaken for the future project, because the negative value of NPV
i.e. IDR 3,442,384.

Cost Benefit Ratio. Average ratio between cost and benefit for each sub project is 2.00,
which indicates that the investment for the sample infrastructure sub-project that was
supported by block grants provided benefit two times the investment cost.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Assessment Results

1. Assessment Objective
This assessment, carried out in three stages December 2011- October 2012, collected
beneficiary satisfaction information in 12 districts in eight provinces in order to
summarize the performance of the SPADA project against its achievement indicators and
targets. The study focuses on evaluation on sustainability issues of infrastructure sub
projects, satisfaction with the provision of health and education services provided through,
or financed in part by, the project.

2. Assessment Design
The beneficiary assessment is quantitative in nature: by sampling a roughly
representative set of confirmed project beneficiaries, it will provide the information
necessary to estimate average beneficiary satisfaction and average sustainability aspect
on infrastructure sub project. This estimate is limited, however, by both SPADA
operational details and study design. Firstly, baseline, pre-project satisfaction information
does not exist. Secondly, SPADA typically finances ongoing services and programs (in
health and education) delivered by local governments and service providers and in so
doing expands the coverage of these previously existing services. For both reasons, the
assessment as designed cannot measure the impact of the SPADA program against a
valid counterfactual. In order to ensure that satisfaction as measured can be attributed to
particular SPADA projects (rather than just general or ongoing activities in a locality),
the survey instruments and sampling strategy will generate enough identifying
information to link confirmed beneficiaries with particular projects and locations. At
district level, the assessment on sustainability for infrastructure sub projects was designed
to capture the evaluation on physical quality, status of inventory infrastructure sub-
project as local government asset and local budget support for operational and
maintenance (OM). While at sub-district, it was focused on functioning of OM team,
budget availability for OM, and local government support for sustainability.

The World Bank’s Task Team provided TA and implementation support throughout the
survey.

3. Coverage
Data collection (carried out by Project Implementation Unit – MinDA) was completed in
the week 19 to 23 December 2011 and 5 to 7 June 2012 by the SPADA PIU in eight
district and 9 to 17 October, 2012 in twelve districts in eight provinces by an independent
research firm, Ciriajasa Engineering Consultants. These districts were selected
purposively by PIU for their confirmed delivery of education and health services and
diversity of infrastructure sub-projects supported by SPADA block grants – see below.

4. Samples
Many SPADA-supported projects are quite small in geographic or population coverage
and are specific to needs and capacities of each locality, so comparability between



                                                                 41
SPADA-supported projects is not always straightforward. In order to achieve a measure
of performance that is as general as possible – a measure that could reasonably represent
performance across all SPADA-supported initiatives – and to be able to compare between
geographic regions, the study sampled only projects that are widely implemented in
nearly all 32 districts and 186 sub-districts. Total respondents for assessment were 400
for health and 400 for education sector. While for the infrastructure covered 184 sub-
projects across the sample locations.

5. Method of Analyses
The analysis estimates rates of satisfaction by project type, by geographic region, and by
participant type (as well as overall satisfaction across all participants contacted) and rates
of sustainability by level of block grant. As the survey instrument includes several
distinct (but not independent) questions regarding satisfaction and sustainability with
different, each distinct question and response will be weighted in order to estimate
average satisfaction and sustainability. The formulation of these weights is part of the
analytic program and the analysis will include a section on their derivation. The study
provides information about proxy of infrastructure sustainability, individual, household,
and village-level factors influencing beneficiary satisfaction to provide SPADA
implementers and practitioners with advice on more effective implementation.

6. Result
The results showed positive impacts, as follows: The draft report of the Borrower’s
completion report shows that, on average, 90% of students were satisfied with education
services provided by teachers trained by the project. And 94% of patients were satisfied
with health services provided by midwives and cadres trained by the project.

The results show that the services needed by patients were prenatal, immunization,
childbirth and general health checkup. The percentage for health services satisfaction was
derived from patients who were very satisfied and satisfied with their midwives and
cadres (see Table 5.1).

Total                                100%

For the project’s education component, the study focused on quality of infrastructure e.g.
school, classroom, and equipment, quality teacher and implementation of school based
management and administration. The results are summarized on the Table 5.2.

As reported on Table 5.3, sustainability of infrastructure sub-projects supported by
district block grant is quite high at 96.24% of sub-projects will be maintained and
operated in accordance with their economic value. While it contrary with the sub-district
supported sub-project, the sustainability only 67.30%, most of challenges were the clarity
of community contribution and mechanism of maintenance of public good infrastructure.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

A stakeholder workshop was held at Hotel Rama in Palu, Central Sulawesi on February
20, 2012. 25 people participated in the one-day group event, as follows:

      Project Implementation Unit (PIU) Ministry of Development for Disadvantaged
       Area
      District Holding Commitment Officer (SATKER)
      District Sub Project Implementing Unit (UPKD) Health
      District Sub Project Implementing Unit (UPKD) Education
      District Sub Project Implementing Unit (UPKD) Infrastructure
      District Technical Review Team (TKT)
      District Management Team (TPK)
      District Management Consultant
      Provincial Management Consultant
      Beneficiaries
      World Bank task and ICR team members

Participants provided feedback on what worked and what did not work during the project
implementation as well as lesson learned for the similar project in the future. The
participants were divided into two groups by district, and each group discussed and
reflected on three main issues: planning process, implementation, and sustainability; the
group discussion was facilitated by National Management Consultant staff. The outputs
of the group discussions were brought to the workshop plenum to agree on the findings.
Some personal insights from the stakeholder event are presented below:

Reflection on the implementation of SPADA

Head of Village – Pulau Tiga Village Menui Kepulauan Sub-District Morowali
District:
‘The project has provided lower cost of electricity for our villages, previously we have to
pay monthly fee around IDR 150,000. But with supported from the project, we received
diesel 150KVA and electricity network that connecting villagers houses. Since then we
only pay monthly fee IDR 30,000 for gasoline and diesel fuel’.

Project Stakeholder of Tolli Sub District Banggai District:
‘We are very grateful with the clean water facility and bridge built by the project. These
facilities are utilized for household and health clinic. The provision of clean water could
revitalize the function of clinic and bridge can lower transportation cost for our children
to school’.

Project Stakeholder of Tojo Una-Una District:
‘The development of harbor market at Wakai Village Una-Una Sub-District support
livelihood on the local community as well as provision of electricity at Lebity Village
save a lot of household expenditure; now they only have to pay IDR 15,000 for gasoline
and diesel fuel’



                                                               44
Summary of Workshop Findings

1. The project and local government regular planning (Musrenbang) cycle were not
   parallel and therefore could not contribute in term of budget sharing at the same year.
   The selection process of activities of SPADA was based on the village meeting,
   where community was identifying need and problems and discussed these at sub-
   district meeting. The sub-district technical review team then preparing proposal to
   address the problem and need. The sub-district technical review team was also
   referring to list of activities that were proposed through regular process. Unfunded
   proposal could be possible to access the project grant.
2. The late issuance of the central government budgets (DIPA) caused poor quality of
   sub-project planning.
3. The block grant was also supporting the training for health and education workers,
   but there was an issue of continuation because of local budget limitation.
   Nevertheless, the local government and project beneficiaries found that the training
   activity was could leverage the benefit of physical sub-project built by the grant.
4. Role of Bappeda province was considered insufficient; this was due to their limited
   budget for supervising the project. In the future, it was expected that Bappeda plays
   greater role, example by hosting quarterly meeting to review the progress
   implementation, and follow up supervision to the project would be done based on the
   meeting recommendation.
5. Central government supervision did not reach Morowali, the district that is the
   furthest from Poso. In the future, central government role is expected to be more
   active and efficient.
6. All districts perceived the Bank's role more as sort of ‘auditor’, not supervisory or
   support. That was due to misinterpretation of Bank's supervisory which was usually
   overseeing the financial and procurement aspect through report and physical works.
   They were referring and comparing with the Government Audit visit.
7. Community was expecting the local government support for sub-projects
   maintenance, especially for large scale sub-projects and training activities. For other
   local scale sub-projects, the project has established maintenance team that committed
   for maintenance.
8. For future project, there should be a clear method to calculate the portion and ratio of
   planning and block grant for selected location. For example, the planning grant in
   some sub-districts was equal to block grant allocation and was not equal to number of
   village within district.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The Task Team has received the MinDA’s Project Completion Report (PCR), which is
summarized below. The full PCR is available in the project files.

Introduction
The implementation of SPADA in 32 of the poorest and most conflict-prone districts in
Indonesia was highly relevant in supporting the Government of Indonesia to improve
access to basic infrastructure, education and health, and reduce community conflicts.
SPADA supported the national strategy of regional development by enhancing capacity
of local governments and communities in disadvantages areas in CDD program
management and improvement of public services. Working in eight provinces (32
districts, 186 sub-districts), the project benefitted 4,771,900 people, or 56.74% of the
total population in the participating districts. The project disbursed more than 99% of the
allocated block grants and planning grants.

Project Accomplishments
In general, the project has completed the planned project activities and reached or
exceeded the expected project targets specified in the key performance indicators. The
project completion report features some major accomplishments, including:

   Capacity Building
    The project strengthened capacity of the local governments and community groups in
    participatory planning process and in the implementation of principles of
    responsiveness, transparency and accountability in program management. Capacity
    building activities conducted through the project, including: (1) a total of 3,622
    participants, representing community groups, NGOs, and local governments
    improved their knowledge and skills in mediation and community legal
    empowerment; (2) a total of 11,935 teachers and members of school committees
    attended training; (3) a total 7,039 health workers received training; (4) a total of
    40,262 local governments (from village, sub-district, and district levels) received
    training related to the improvement of program management and public services. The
    project also recorded 202,438 people directly involved in the participatory planning
    exercises facilitated by the project. More than 25% of the total beneficiaries are
    women; and about 42% of the total beneficiaries are poor households.

   Finalization of Sub-projects
    A total of 8,651 sub-projects finalized to support improvement of basic infrastructure
    (4,015 sub-projects, or 46.41%), education (2,123 sub-projects, 24.54%), health care
    (1,608 sub-projects, 18.59%), and youth activities (905 sub-projects, 10.46%). About
    80% of the grants utilized to support sub-projects at sub-district level, and about 20%
    for sub-projects at district level. The technical agency sub project implementing unit
    (Unit Pelaksana Kegiatan Dinas) implemented 7,836 sub-projects (90.58%), and the
    remains (9.42%) conducted in collaboration with third parties.




                                                                46
   Complaints Handling
    The project recorded a total of 1,906 cases from audits, directly reported by
    communities, and supervision missions, involving Rp. 9.260.487.388. The project
    finalized 1900 cases (or 99.7%), and returned the misused of fund of Rp. 9,117,254
    (or 98.45%). Finalization of the remaining cases has been handed over to authorities.

   Effectiveness, Efficiency , and Sustainability of the Sub-projects
    Assessments to the implementation and results of the sub-projects were conducted in
    December 2011 and June 2012 in eight provinces (eight districts, 40 samples), while
    the specific project output studies was conducted in September-November 2012 in 6
    provinces (12 districts, 306 samples).

    The assessments showed that about 90% of the respondents were satisfied with
    SPADA services in education sector, and a total of 94% respondents satisfied with
    healthcare projects. About 98% of projects in education sector were categorized as
    satisfactory, and 96% sub-projects in health sector categorized in this level of quality.
    For basic infrastructure, measured by economic internal rate of return, the project has
    improved access to cost-effective infrastructure of 34%. In term of quality, a total of
    91% of respondents in a MinDA assessment reported satisfaction with education
    services provided by the project; 89% with health services; and 98% classified
    infrastructure sub-projects as ‘good’ or ‘satisfactory’. On the subject of private sector
    development (PSD), the assessment showed that the SPADA has supported the
    increase a total of 73% of new business registration and the establishment of 27
    private sector forums in 27 districts. In the area of mediation and community legal
    empowerment, the project provided training to a total of 3,470 beneficiaries, and legal
    aid assistance provided to 32 cases.

    At the closing stage, the project facilitated project assets hand over to local authorities
    for maintenance and improvements, and also provided specific technical assistance
    concerning integration of participatory planning into the regular development process.
    The project assets have now been formally taken over by all participating districts.
    Several districts have started to adapt the introduced planning process into their
    regular planning of Musrenbang.

Project Management
   Implementation Support by Consultants
    In collaboration with several consulting firms, the project was supported by 24
    consultants at central level (National Management Consultants, NMC) and mobilized
    a total of 391 consultants (or 92.65% of the total required consultants; end target was
    70%) to facilitate project activities in the field. Through implementation of sub-
    projects (infrastructure, education, health, and youth) and specific technical
    assistance in the areas of private sector development and legal aid, the consultants
    facilitated improvement of participatory planning process and enhancement of
    capacity of local governments in program management. The project also developed
    and distributed a series of project manuals, and provided technical assistance to the


                                                                  47
    local government and local project team in managing project activities –
    emphasizing in financial management, procurement, performance of consultants,
    complaints handling, application of management information system (MIS), and
    project closing exercises. Specific attention was paid to the improvement of capacity
    of the technical agency implementing units in financial management and monitoring.

    While the project made a considerable accomplishment in this area, improvement
    was needed in the area of consultant management. Working with different consulting
    firms at districts, provincial, and national levels, made the project have difficulties in
    monitoring and evaluating performance of the consultants.

   Monitoring and Evaluation
    The project reported application of MIS utilized in all districts and data was used as
    the main sources for the progress reports. Regular supervision visits to districts
    regularly conducted to corroborate the reported progress, and coordination meetings
    with key parties arranged for corrective actions. For evaluation, in collaboration with
    other parties, the project conducted a baseline survey (GDS), thematic studies,
    synthesis of lessons learned, and a final project result assessments. Results from the
    studies and assessments used to measure accomplishments against key performance
    indicators and preparation of project completion report. The M&E policy and
    direction were under responsibility of BAPPENAS’s Project Management Unit
    (PMU), while the day-to-day management of the M&E activities were implemented
    by MinDA’s Project Implementation Unit (PIU).

    Based on the stages in the project management (socialization/pre-implementation,
    planning, implementation, results, and review/post-implementation), the monitoring
    and evaluation highlighted some major challenges. This includes, lack of utilization
    of communication media and fund allocated to support socialization activities;
    inadequate skills of the project team in facilitating the participatory planning process
    –in addition to the need to synchronize the time frame with the regular planning
    process; lacking management of consultants and coordination with local
    governments and delay of DIPA; and insufficient regulation and operational funds at
    districts to maintain the project assets and support continuity of project intervention
    in the future.

Lessons Learned and Recommendations
MinDA organized workshops on Project Lessons Learned in Makassar, November 2011
and on Project Completion in Jakarta, December 2012, involving all key project
stakeholders, synthesizing project challenges and lessons learned from different aspects
of project implementation, including facilitation of participatory planning process,
integration of perspectives of marginalized groups into project management, provision of
technical assistance, strengthening of local institutions, implementation of principles of
transparency and accountability, communication, and sustainability of intervention after
the project ended. The report highlighted both ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ lessons learned,
among others:



                                                                 48
   ‘Positive’ Lessons Learned
       Mechanism of ‘technical review’ in the process of participatory planning plays
        important roles in the enhancement of capacity of local governments and
        community groups in undertanding local priorities. The community groups are
        now able to express their point of views and to analytically discuss their priorities.
        More access to community forums was agreed to be the main factors.
       Implementation of safeguard mechanims in financial management, community
        accountability forums, and audit by BPKP, are very effective to promote
        implementation of transparency and accountability in project financial
        management. This contributed to the accomplishment of project in preventing and
        finalizing the fraud cases and returning 98.45% of the misused fund.
       Preparation of project accountability reports by local authorities and agreement on
        the project assets hand over to the participating districts at the end of project
        period was effective to encourage the districts to maintain the project assets and
        continue the project initiatives in the future.

    ‘Negative’ Lessons Learned
     Insufficient coordination among local agenicies and inadequate scheme to involve
       local parliament in project management, hampered the project in synergizing its
       activities, as well as with the regular development process and with other similar
       CDD programs. 
     Lack of supports from local regulations concerning implementation of
       participatory planning process and continuity of the interventions, slowed down
       the adoption of the approaches promoted by SPADA. 
     Unsatisfactory management of consultant services was one of the major issues in
       the provision of technical assistance to project team at the field level, particulalrly
       in financial management and preparation of progress reports. 
         
    Recommendations 
     Developing a better strategy to actively involve local parliament in project
       management, particularly in strengthening local regulation to support
       participatory planning process.  
     Simplifying project structure and mechanism. 
     Developing a better mechanism in consultants recruitment. 
     Avoiding delay of DIPA.
