                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         In June 2012, a second extension to the project closing date was approved, taking this to December 31, 2012 - a cumulative extension of 12 months beyond the project's original
                         closing date. This 'restructuring' was approved in tandem with an agreed reallocation of proceeds among budget categories, to enable completion of final physical works and
                         completion of other delayed activities, including an output assessment study for the project’s key performance indicators.
