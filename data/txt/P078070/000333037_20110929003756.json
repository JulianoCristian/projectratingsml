Areas (SPADA) Project for Indonesia is to\n            strengthen governance, promote growth, and improve service\n            delivery in at least 32 of the poorest districts of\n            Indonesia. Project performance has been moderately\n            satisfactory to date.  While the project was initially\n            delayed and has encountered implementation challenges, owing\n            to low capacity in the implementing agency and target\n            districts compounded by complexity in design, recent\n            implementation support missions by the task team have found\n            demonstrated improvement in implementation progress, as\n            documented in the most recent aide memoires and as reflected\n            in the fact that the project has met and, in many cases,\n            exceeded its results framework indicator targets.  With this\n            in mind, the task team confirms that the project development\n            objective remains achievable.  The Ministry of Finance\n            formally submitted project extension requests to the Bank on\n            June 28th and July 14th, 2011.  The extension is to enable\n            an additional round of block grants utilizing unused funds\n            of USD1.9 million, saved as a result of the project's\n            initial delayed start and owing to cost-savings on the part\n            of the Project Implementing Unit (PIU)."}, "docdt": "2011-09-18T00:00:00Z"}
