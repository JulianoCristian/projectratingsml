risk to\n            development outcome. Both the Bank and the Borrower received\n            moderately satisfactory ratings for their performances.\n            There were two restructurings of this project and they are\n            as follows: (1) The Jordanian Government decided to finance\n            the Petra Gateway (Component 2) from its resources, thus the\n            component was dropped. The facility was built with UNESCO\u0092s\n            oversight on technical, social and environmental safeguard\n            compliance. The project was extended by 6 months, and there\n            were a few other, minor changes. (2) Cancellation of\n            Component 3 (Local Economic Development) for two reasons:\n            the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities was uncomfortable\n            with this component, as they recognized their limited\n            capacity to implement it. The World Bank-supported Local\n            Economic Development component was undersized, and dwarfed\n            by other partner contributions. Extension of the closing\n            date from by one year to complete the works in Ajloun. The\n            restructuring also included other minor changes. The scopes\n            of the results framework and components 1, 3, and 4 were\n            adjusted to align with the aforementioned restructurings.\n            Four lessons were learned from this project: a) The\n            integration of tourism, cultural heritage, business\n            development, urban upgrading, poverty reduction and city\n            management results in a total that is more than the sum of\n            the parts. b) Right-sizing investments in integrated\n            cultural heritage projects balances the need for critical\n            mass in a number of cities while avoiding spreading efforts\n            too thin in too many locations; c) Applying good design and\n            implementation practices helps projects to achieve their\n            objectives, and more importantly, ensure that beneficiaries\n            actually benefit; and d) A solid understanding of the\n            incentives, skill gaps and political economy among all key\n            stakeholders is essential to design institutional\n            arrangements in a complex environment with multiple\n            stakeholders and to inform unavoidable adjustments during implementation."}, "docdt": "2015-01-30T00:00:00Z"}
