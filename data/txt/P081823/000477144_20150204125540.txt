                                        Table 1 A quick overview

a)   Tourism accounted for 11% of Jordan’s GDP at appraisal (2007). Past tourism development had
     focused on Petra and a few other top attractions, but the 2004 National Tourism Strategy argued for
     diversification, increasing employment, and integration of tourism into local economic development.

b) These elements fitted the Jordan CAS very well and brought to bear the Bank’s considerable
   experience and knowledge in this field.

c)   This project was highly relevant, well prepared, with strong borrower and beneficiary ownership, and a
     convincing rationale for Bank support. Early implementation (2008) reflected the solid preparation,
     with staff in place, work plans available, immediate disbursements done, safeguards for resettlement
     agreed and operational, and contracts being delivered.

d) However, by 2010 three factors beyond the scope of the project had slowed implementation: (i) the
   Arab spring (and from 2011 the Syrian crisis); (ii) the global economic downturn; and (iii) the country-
   wide process of (a) devolvement of implementation from the Ministry of Planning to the Line
   Ministries; and (b) a start-and-stop process of decentralizing selected tasks to the municipalities.

e)   Implementation also slowed down as a result from changes in staffing, both within the Government
     and at the Bank, but the MTR was fielded timely and proposed a restructuring. Ratings dropped to MU
     for DO and IP for a while.

f)   The first restructuring (Level 1, 2011) dropped the construction of the Visitor Center at Petra as the
     Government decided to use its own funding. UNESCO ensured safeguard compliance and technical
     quality. However, the restructuring failed to fundamentally improve the PDO, indicators and M&E.

g) The project was extended twice for a total of 18 months to allow for the unforeseen delays mentioned
   above. During the second extension, it was decided to do an impact assessment, to be carried out by
   one of the world’s leading Universities in this field.

h) By project closing in March 2014, the results of the impact evaluation were still being analyzed, and
   the project was rated MU overall in the final ISR.

i)   The data from the impact assessment have become available for this ICR and indicate solid
     achievements for all indicators, and beyond. The project achieved, or exceeded its restructured targets.

j)   The Government is committed to follow-up operations, while businesses continue to grow in the five
     communities, and Municipalities are attracting domestic and international investment and tourists.

1.1     Context at Appraisal

1. Tourism is one of the pillars of the Jordanian economy, accounting for 11% of GDP at the
time of appraisal (2007). Tourism was also Jordan’s largest export sector, its second highest
earner of foreign exchange, and its fifth largest employer. Past tourism development had focused
on Petra, Jordan’s premier attraction, and on a handful of other top sites. However, over the
decade preceding the project, Jordan had been falling behind other destinations in the region in
terms of growth rate, market share, length of stay, and earnings per tourist arrival.

2. Jordan’s 2004 National Tourist Strategy targeted deepening and diversifying Jordan’s tourism
products, improving quality, and increasing employment, business turnover and fiscal yield. The
medium term objective was to develop a denser structure of multi-attraction circuits to appeal to a
wider range of visitors especially outside Amman, encourage longer stays, spread tourism-driven
benefits, and create opportunities for private investment and employment. This tourist strategy
was later confirmed in Jordan’s National Agenda 2007-2017. 1

3. At the same time, the strategy recognized the need for greater integration of the elements of
the model now used widely: (i) domestic and international tourism; (ii) local economic
development; (iii) improving and safeguarding cultural and natural heritage sites; (iv) opening up
while preserving historic city cores; (v) increasing the capacity of municipalities to manage urban
development; and (vi) reducing poverty and raising the standard of living of the people living and
working in the historic centers.

4. Support to this program matched the Bank’s Jordan Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
(2006-2010). The CAS aimed to assist the Government to harness its considerable cultural
heritage for tourism development, economic revitalization, and job creation. In particular, it
would “support local development through increased access to services and economic
opportunities” (CAS Cluster 2).

5. The Bank brought considerable in-country experience, including two past tourism
development projects and three urban and municipal development projects. In addition, the Bank
had accumulated global experience in supporting cultural heritage and sustainable tourism
development, and had prepared a cultural heritage strategy for the MENA region (2001), whose
recommendations were embedded in the project design.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

6. The original PDO 2 was to contribute to: (a) tourism development in five key historically and
culturally important cities (Jerash, Karak, Madaba, Salt, and Ajloun), and thereby create the

  The Jordan National Tourism Strategy (2004) informed and initiated this project. The MNA sector
knowledge and tourism strategy paper (2001) formulated recommendations that are embedded in this
project. In 2002, a grant of USD 350,000 was awarded from the Multi Donor Trust Fund for Cultural
Heritage and Sustainable Tourism (donor: Italy) to develop the project concept. Lessons from similar
projects, both global and five in-country projects have also been incorporated.

  This ICR found a few discrepancies in the PDO between the Loan Agreement (which is used above, as
the only legally binding formulation), the PAD, and the log frame of the PAD. The Borrower’s report uses
the Loan Agreement formulation. On the first objective, the PAD Annex states: “To contribute to tourism

7. The revised PDO was to: support tourism development in five historically and culturally
important cities (Jerash, Karak, Madaba, Salt, and Ajloun) and thereby contribute to local
economic development. In other words, the construction of the Petra Gateway (as well as some
smaller elements) was dropped from the project.

8. Beneficiaries included men and women living and working in the five cities. Another group
of beneficiaries included domestic and international tourists. Cities were improved, and as a result,
local businesses opened up to cater to both locals and tourists. There were no changes in
beneficiary targeting during the implementation of the project.

1.5     Original Components (as approved)

9. Component 1: Revitalization of Historic City Centers, Urban Infrastructure Improvements
and Cultural Landscape Regeneration. This accounted for 84.2% of Bank financing, or USD
47.14 million. The component comprised the following activities in and around the historic cores
of Jerash, Karak, Madaba, Salt and Ajloun: (1.1) upgrading of and improvements to street
networks and allied public spaces; (1.2) rehabilitation and upgrading of pivotal urban spaces;
(1.3) rehabilitation of facades and landscaping and furnishing of primary streets; (1.4) renovation
and preservation of selected heritage buildings through adaptive reuse – including a Salt Pilot
Historic Preservation Fund for privately owned buildings; (1.5) traffic and parking management;
(1.6) construction or rehabilitation of essential municipal buildings and facilities; (1.7)
regeneration of cultural (natural) landscapes (Ajloun only); and (1.8) design and supervision
services.

10. Component 2: Petra Gateway. This accounted for 9.2% of Bank financing, or USD 5.17
million. The component was to support: (2.1) construction of a new Visitors’ Center at Petra
Sanctuary; and (2.2) related consultant services.

                                                    4
11. Component 3: Local Economic Development. This accounted for only 2.1% of Bank
financing, or USD 1.15 million. The component was to provide financial and technical assistance
to local entrepreneurs and community groups for the creation or expansion of environmentally
appropriate and financially viable small and medium enterprises in the project areas.

12. Component 4: Capacity Building and Project Management. This accounted for 4.5% of
Bank financing, or $2.55 million. The component included: (4.1) municipal capacity building,
including improved development and management of historic centers by municipalities, local
strategic partnerships amongst municipalities and local community and business groups, and
Municipal Revitalization Pacts which would underpin project investment in additional core
infrastructure; and (4.2) project management and institutional support.

1.6       Revised Components

13. A request for Level 1 project restructuring was received from the borrower on April 19, 2011
after it had been suggested by the MTR in November 2009. The restructuring involved changes to
the PDO and other features, as requested by the Borrower, and described below:

a) Cancellation of Component 2 (Petra gateway). The Visitor Center in Petra was conceived in
   a land-use plan under the Second Tourism project and a site agreed upon. The facility was
   appraised by the Bank and included in this project with early feasibility work done. However,
   during implementation the Government decided to use its own funding for the construction,
   USD 2.5 million, while benefitting from a USAID grant of about USD 125,000 for detailed
   design and bidding documents. For technical, social and environmental safeguard
   compliance, UNESCO oversight and adequate Jordanian legislation were in place. The
   construction of the facility in Petra was tendered out following the Jordanian national
   procurement of public works. The percentage of Bank financing for the Petra component at
   appraisal was 9.2% of the Bank financed project, and those funds were re-allocated to allow
   for cost increases, largely in component 1. UNESCO continues to advice on sustainable
   management of the facility.

b) Update the scope of the following three components:

         Component 1 (Revitalization of historic city areas and urban infrastructure
          improvements). A number of lower priority activities were dropped, due to the evolving
          situation on the ground. For example, the Salt Heritage Fund was cancelled, as private
          homeowners took the urban regeneration much further themselves, as a result of a more
          favorable economic environment, created by the project;

         Component 3 (Local Economic Development) was adjusted, reduced (and eventually
          dropped at the second restructuring); and

         Component 4 (Capacity Building and Project Management) which was adjusted and
          reduced to focus on training, as studies and technical activities were being financed with
          grant funds from other partners. However, it must be noted that key elements of this
          component (the Municipal Revitalization Pacts for instance) had already proven their
          worth and were supported with local resources.



                                                  5
         Update the Project Results Framework and make it consistent with the reformulation of
          the PDO and proposed changes to project design.

         Reallocation of loan proceeds to reflect project design changes.

         Extension of the Loan's closing date for six (6) months, from September 30, 2012 until
          March 31, 2013 to enable the completion of ongoing contracts and other commitments in
          the project.

         Changes to the disbursement conditions due to the cancellation of Component 2 and the
          Salt Heritage Fund.

14. With the Level 1 restructuring, Bank financing remained USD 56 million. The total project
cost, including Bank and borrower financing, before and after restructuring, is shown in the table
below.

1.7       Other significant changes

15. In January 2013, due to the need of completing complex works in a very delicate project
location (the mosque in Ajloun) and a few other sites, the Government requested a second
extension of the project closing date. The Bank approved this request in March 2013 through a
Level 2 restructuring. The closing date was extended from March 31, 2013, to March 31, 2014.

16. At the same time, Component 3 (Local Economic Development, USD 1 million, 2.1% of the
Bank financed project) was dropped two main reasons:

a) First, MoTA was not entirely comfortable with this component in view of its limited capacity
   to implement. In retrospect, it is likely that MoTA would have subcontracted this
   component’s implementation, raising questions about capacity retention and efficiency.
b) Second, there was a good supply of grant funding for LED and solid capacity to implement
   outside MoTA. The World Bank-supported component was dwarfed by other partner
   contributions, including USAID, Japan, the EU and others. For instance:
    USAID has a five year, USD 70 million Local Enterprise program called LENS being
       implemented by FHI 360;
    USAID also has another five year, USD 40 million Workforce Development Program
       being implemented by DAI;



                                                  6
       In Madaba, USAID under the Tourism project had already provided USD 2 million in
        grants to support small tourism related businesses; shop owners contributed another USD
        0.5 million;
       In Salt, USAID budgeted USD 250,000 for small grants but only gave out USD 85,000
        because only 14 applications met requirements;
       A number of Jordanian organizations are managing similar programs such as the
        Development and Employment Fund (DEV) and the Women’s Fund.

17.     When interpreting the findings from the economic impact assessment, the project can
thus not claim benefits from direct investments in the specific Local Economic Development
grants, but can justifiably be proud of the strong evidence of indirect benefits from the much
larger investments in urban upgrading, resulting in improved businesses, employment and
reduced poverty. Even in the absence of Component 3, the number of jobs created by the project
substantially surpassed the target, as documented by the economic impact assessment, which also
analyzed and confirmed their attribution to the project.

18. With the second restructuring, other minor changes were made, without impacting the PDO
and the indicators (Level 2). Bank financing was reduced from USD 56 million to USD 55
million with the remainder of component 3 (Local Economic Development) dropped. The total
project cost, including Bank and borrower financing, before and after restructuring, is shown at
the table below. The project closed on March 31, 2014 with USD 50,781,707.11 disbursed and
4,218,292.89 undisbursed.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19. The project was prepared around cultural heritage and sustainable tourism linked to urban
upgrading in historic city cores. The project design reflected lessons from earlier experience in
the country, notably from the Bank-supported tourism development projects and urban
development projects. One lesson was that design had to take account of the complexity of local


                                                  7
interests and environment and to ensure a broad support base for the project. This was to be done
through a participatory preparation process, through Strategic Partnerships with the community,
and through Municipal Revitalization Pacts, which allowed community voice and permitted
continuous adjustments as needed over the life of the project.

20. The project design required sound institutional capacity from the implementing agency,
MoTA, across a broad range of sectors, including water supply, sanitation and municipal public
works, in addition to the Ministry’s core attributes of tourism and cultural heritage. This need
had been recognized by the earlier Second Tourism Development Project, and staffing and
capacity strengthening of the project unit, MoTA’s Technical Development Department (TDD),
were built into the project. The PAD foresaw the recruitment of an additional 17 staff to TDD’s
existing 15 personnel, together with equipment and training.

21. The M&E system was a key weakness of the Second Tourism Development Project, and the
need for design and implementation of an integrated M&E system and related capacity building
was appropriately highlighted in the design of this project.

2.2     Implementation

a)      Factors beyond Government control

22. The global economic downturn and the Arab Spring (and from 2010 the Syrian crisis)
negatively impacted all aspects of life in Jordan. The country suffered a fiscal crisis and restricted
the budget ceiling for project expenditures. In 2010, for example, the budget was capped at the
equivalent of USD 4 million against contract commitments of USD 24 million, necessitating the
phasing and lengthening of implementation. This allowed the project to deliver, but it slowed
implementation and explains the need for the total of 18 months of extensions.

23. Herein lies an apparent contradiction: claiming a more favorable economic environment in
the five cities, while at the same time blaming the global economic downturn and the Syrian crisis
for slowing implementation. It is perhaps one of the key strengths of this project that both
statements are true. Even during this time of crisis, the rehabilitation of city centers, making
them more attractive for local inhabitants, businesses, and tourists, resulted in a major increase in
businesses (see 3.2) in those upgraded city centers.

24. Although domestic tourism numbers in Jordan as a whole fell by about 11% from 2008 to
2012, domestic tourist numbers in the target cities grew by about 18% over the same period.
Foreign tourists in the five project cities rose as a share of total foreign tourists in Jordan – in
2006-7 about 8% of foreign tourists visited the five sites, in 2013 it was 11%.

25. The project also experienced price increases for commodities, which translated into higher
than estimated contract prices and cost overruns. These overruns were addressed in the 2011
project restructuring. In the end, the actual project costs exceeded the estimates by more than
160%.

b)      Factors under Government control

26. Even with changes in Ministers, the objectives and the relevance of the project remained
high. But due to changes in interlocutors at both central and local levels, and to an increasing

                                                  8
workload in MoTA, implementation slowed down and by 2010 the project entered ‘at risk’ status.
To speed up implementation, MoTA decided to strengthen the implementation team and
temporarily postpone works on further sites. In particular, technical and managerial capacity was
strengthened and the consulting engineers reinforced. Monitoring, measuring and managing for
Outcomes remained a challenge, but was addressed through the commissioning of an economic
impact assessment conducted by project closure.

c)       Factors under implementing agency control

27. Project preparation had been characterized by partnerships with municipalities and
engagement of communities, as set out in the Municipal Revitalization Pacts. At project start-up,
contracts were quickly let for works in the most important project sites, Madaba and Salt, and
land acquisition and resettlement issues were satisfactorily handled. Procurement plans were
ready, and staff in place.

28. Despite early stresses in collaboration 3 between the line Ministries and the decentralizing
municipalities, over time all parties worked collaboratively during implementation. The
consultative model established during preparation was appreciated by the participating
municipalities, and during implementation these municipalities asked for increased consultation,
as the benefits of such an approach had become apparent. The implementation team worked
flexibly to enhance this mechanism, also employing a communication specialist, a municipal
specialist, and full time community liaison officers for each city. The municipalities in turn
assigned the dedicated Municipal Program Coordinators as counterparts to the project.

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

a)       M&E design

29. M&E was highlighted as a weakness in earlier Bank-supported operations, and MoTA was
new to Bank operations, although quite familiar with contracting goods and services out.
Specialized consultancy services were thus included in this project’s design, to be provided at
national and local levels to prepare the system. However, the PDO, indicators and results
framework were poorly formulated. The PDO largely describes a set of activities, rather than
define what would constitute success by the end of the project. In particular, the PDO did not
identify the beneficiaries, nor did it formulate what changes were meant to happen in their
livelihoods.




3
  An example how initial stresses can be overcome comes from planning for traffic and parking
management, for which a subcomponent (1.5) was designed. Traffic flow was part of the TORs for the
street rehabilitation in Karak, Madaba, and Jerash. As it turned out, traffic restrictions in tourism areas need
time to get the buy in of the local residents. Early results on traffic management in the project were mixed.
The agreed solution was to conduct consultative studies on small, yet effective changes to traffic
management and parking, to balance the various needs of locals, urban planners and tourists.




                                                       9
b)        M&E implementation

30. During implementation, the Results Framework was used to tabulate data from survey forms.
Municipal units collected data and conducted sampling exercises thus building capacity and
fostering ownership. The M&E system did provide information to track the key indicators (see
3.2 below) but did not properly reflect the project outcomes, thus explaining the decision to
undertake the independent economic impact assessment towards the end of the project. Early
Implementation Status Reports (ISR) highlighted the lacking outcome data, and the MTR
proposed a level 1 restructuring. The Results Framework was subsequently revised, without
altering its scope or fundamentally improving its design. That is surprising, as the QALP 8
(September 2010) observed that “The project is now in need of a fundamental restructuring.”

c) M&E utilization

31. Staff at national and local levels were already familiar with implementation and output
monitoring. Under the project they have been trained to better monitor, manage and measure
development outcomes. In particular, the intensive collaboration with the University that
undertook an economic impact assessment (see box below) proved a key motivating and learning
experience. The capacity built, and ownership fostered at local level has been very positive, as
measured in the impact analysis. In addition, and although of limited methodological soundness,
daily local monitoring of works by the local communities (as routinely happened) has been a
powerful incentive for contractors to deliver quality, on time, and within budget. The hands-on
interest from the mayors and the highest levels of the Jordanian Government is also likely to
ensure sustainability of the M&E capacity developed under the project.


                                    Table 8     An economic impact assessment

a) The Government and the Bank commissioned a research study to Maquarie University, Australia to
   assess the economic impacts of the project investments. Maquarie University is one of the leading
   institutions in the world on evaluating the impact of cultural heritage projects.
b) The study collected and analyzed existing data and undertook original data collection through surveys
   in Madaba and Salt, as well as in a control city, Irbid.
c) The study demonstrated the added value of investments in cultural heritage in the target cities and
   compiled new and original data pertaining to the socio-economic impacts of such investments,
   particularly in regard to employment and income generation.
d) The study used tested economic methodologies for ex-post impact evaluation that have been applied in
   similar studies elsewhere, identifying direct, indirect and induced impacts of the investments. The
   study also looked at effects of the project on major stakeholder groups.4




4
  There are a few counter-intuitive data in the assessment, coming from the control city. Business expansion on some
indicators appears better in Irbid (the control city) than in either project city. Household income also looks better in the
control city. The ICR understands that Irbid might not have been the most appropriate city to provide counterfactuals,
as it is considerably bigger than any of the five project cities and recognizes the major variations between the project
cities. Also, apart from representativity, these findings may indicate one of the successes of the project: attracting
tourists and businesses to wider circuits with more cities, --possibly including non-project cities-- with longer stays and
increased spending. In conclusion, the ICR is impressed with the important results achieved as evidenced in the impact
assessment, and largely agrees with the evidence of attribution.

2.4      Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

32. The project activities in densely populated city centers had various land acquisition and
resettlement requirements. These were handled by Government in line with Bank requirements
and the Resettlement Policy Framework. Two Resettlement Action Plans were prepared for
Jerash and Karak and two abbreviated Resettlement Action Plans were prepared for Salt and
Ajloun. Site specific Resettlement Action Plans were prepared for Jerash, Karak and Salt, and
these were substantially respected during implementation. The process required time, as common
in Bank projects focusing on urban areas, particularly in Salt, where land acquisition was
important and Ajloun, where the relocation of vendors was required before works could start.
The actual resettlement impacts were slightly smaller than the impacts documented in
Resettlement Action Plans at appraisal stage:

33. The actual resettlement cost was slightly higher than the estimated resettlement cost at the
Resettlement Action Plans, because the actual compensation value was higher than what was
planned (see table below).

34. The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was based on Jordanian legislation and Bank
guidelines. Consultants delivered several awareness and training workshops for stakeholders and
supervised respect of the EMP in works contracting and implementation. Compliance was
substantial, with minor exceptions on dust control and noise, which had negligible negative
impacts.

35. Procurement of works, goods and selection of consultants made use of possible flexibility of
the Bank’s Guidelines to make use of Government's regulations when appropriate, in alignment
with the Loan agreement (especially with respect to the NCB provisions). Procurement
incorporated budget requirements and procurement planning. Rectifications and adjustments were
timely and integrated in the procurement plan and disbursement forecasting. Financial

implementation.

2.5       Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

36. It is likely that the project’s impact will be measurable after closure, as forecast in the
economic impact analysis. The Government is already working on similar projects with several
partners and it may discuss a possible follow-up World Bank operation.

37. Perhaps, the most important aspect of future sustainability is the proof of concept, bringing
together cultural heritage, local economic development and urban management. Although
somewhat similar projects had been initiated before (Fez, before 2000 and Lebanon in 2003), this
project was among the first to bring all elements together in an effective and sustainable fashion.
This concept is now being applied widely in Bank-financed projects in other countries, including
Lebanon, Georgia, Armenia, Haiti, China, and Russia.

38. To facilitate replicability, the project benefitted from a grant from the Multi Donor Trust
Fund for Cultural Heritage and Sustainable Tourism (in 2013, donor: Italy) of US$300,000. This
grant supported a variety of studies on two additional locations, on which now the Government is
intervening with its own resources and also supported a study to identify potential investment
opportunities for future operations.

39. In the five participating cities in Jordan, as works were being completed and handed over, the
municipalities still lacked adequate financial means to undertake the necessary operation and
maintenance (O&M). This was largely due to uncertainties in the decentralization process in
Jordan, as referred to in the Borrower’s report. Agreement on a comprehensive O&M manual had
been reached at the end of 2011 (ISR #11). The ICR mission found that all participating
municipalities are determined to protect the new assets as a priority, as they see the economic
value of the assets.

40. Many facilities built under the project were designed with cost recovery in mind and included
commercial areas that municipalities could rent out. The inclusion of these commercial areas,
notably in Salt, was a successful result of the ongoing consultation between MoTA and the
participating municipalities.


                  Table 11 Examples of Commitment to Operation and Maintenance

     Madaba allocated JD 500,000 for street maintenance and JD 1 million for upgrading tourism
      infrastructure.
     Jerash has adequate capacity and resources, and the new mayor and the city manager confirmed to the
      ICR team that O&M of project assets would be given priority.
     In Salt, facilities built under the project included spaces that could be rented out, ensuring revenues
      that can be reinvested in the O&M of the asset.
     Support to the establishment of ‘City Core Management Units’ was provided during the project.
       Larger, more prosperous municipalities of Salt and Madaba showed capacity to maintain assets.
       In Karak and Ajloun, the situation was initially more challenging, but as tourism has continued to
           develop, the municipalities made available the required capacity and resources.

3.        Assessment of Outcomes

3.1       Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

a)        Relevance of Objective

41. Rating: High

42. This project had the overall development goal of making secondary cities better places to live
in (for the local population) and more attractive places to visit (for domestic and international
tourists). The project-generated benefits demonstrated the relevance of this operation to Jordan’s
economic growth and poverty reduction strategy, and to the Bank’s twin corporate goals,
addressing extreme poverty (as it invested in city cores, where the poor live), and supporting
shared prosperity (creating conditions for businesses to thrive in city centers, where tourists can
be attracted).

43. Relevance became even greater at project closure. Jordan has suffered multiple exogenous
shocks, including the global economic downturn, regional instability, the Syrian crisis, and the
influx of refugees. The sensitivity of tourism to these external shocks and, more generally, to the
perception of the Middle East as a risky tourist destination, has been amply demonstrated by the
fluctuations in overall tourist numbers in Jordan. During the project period, tourism showed a
steadily rising trend to 2010 (6.9 million foreign visitors) and a sharp drop-off thereafter
(declining to 4.3 million foreign visitors in 2013). In contrast, visitor numbers and local
businesses increased in the project cities over the same time period (see 3.2 Achievements).
Additionally, the project is highly relevant to the current CPS (2012-2015) priority of “enhancing
inclusion, pursuing local development, and addressing poverty pockets.”

b)        Relevance of design

44. Rating: Substantial

45. This project was designed to bring about multi-attraction circuits, bringing tourists to
secondary cities, thus encouraging longer stays and higher average expenditures, and linking
tourism more closely to local businesses and benefiting the local residents. Such a combination of
investments is now considered good practice, which is adapted and applied globally. The
downside of this integrated approach is a possible overload of activities, and the project design
was indeed quite ambitious in terms of number of stakeholders, geographic locations, and
safeguard requirements, given the capacity and time constraints.

46.   The project had four components (see 1.5), integrating five key elements to achieve the PDO:
     Improved inner city infrastructure (components 1 and 2);
     Better public asset management and local resource mobilization (components 1 and 4);
     Increased local ownership and business participation (components 3 and 4);
     Poverty reduction (components 1, 3 and 4) ; and
     Combined tourist attractiveness and cultural heritage preservation (components 1 and 2).

c)        Relevance of Implementation.

47. Although implementation relevance is not rated, the ICR notes several positive aspects, not
least of which is the fact that the project continued to operate and deliver impressive results in

                                                13
challenging and worsening environment. Also, the generally excellent relations between the Bank
team and several groups of stakeholders -particularly at local level- are noted, despite the frequent
changes of TTL. The inevitable challenges that emerged, mostly due to factors exogenous to the
project, but some caused by dwindling interest and commitment in MoTA, were handled through
dialogue and resulted in confirmation of the continued relevance of the project to both
Government and Bank priorities at the time of the 2011 restructuring.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

48. Rating against the original PDO and intermediate objectives: Modest

49. Rating against the restructured PDO and intermediate objectives: High

50. The overall, weighted rating of the this project’s achievement of its objectives: Substantial

3.2.1   Achievement of original Project Development Objectives

51. Rating: Modest

52. The original PDO has achieved or exceeded most of its targets, but the Petra Gateway was
dropped. Thus, the achievement of the original PDO is rated as Modest. Most of the indicators
have been achieved or exceeded. The length of stay of visitors in the five sites shows an increase
over the pre-project period and is more than a quarter above target. This compares to a 28%
decline in length of stay nationwide (Annex 3), showing concentration of tourism in the five
municipalities participating into the project. The increase in the length of stay is a good indicator
of success as it measures two components of the PDO – tourism development and contribution to
local economic development. For both these indicators, the economic impact assessment provides
evidence of their attribution to the project. (Annex 3) Property values have increased rapidly and
are now more than double their target levels, with positive impacts on real estate tax revenue. The
risk of gentrification is mitigated by a high rate of home ownership, while virtually all renters
have returned to their houses and businesses.

53. Although the Visitor Center in Petra was dropped during the first restructuring and
consequently the rating for the original PDO is Modest, the project can justifiably claim some
achievements getting the Gateway realized. It was conceived in a Bank-supported land-use plan
under the Second Tourism project. The land-use planning, started under the Second Tourism
project, continued during preparation and appraisal of this project, and was a period of intense
collaboration with occasionally frank exchanges about the exact placement of the site. The many
decisions taken at that time have proven to be the right ones. The facility was appraised by the
Bank and included in the project. Had the Bank not had this dialogue with the Government of
Jordan, the likelihood of a much less desirable Gateway (or no Gateway at all) would have been
high. The ICR team was reassured that for technical, social and environmental safeguard
compliance, UNESCO oversight and adequate Jordanian legislation were in place. UNESCO
provided technical expertise and continues to advice on sustainable management of the facility.

54. As explained in section 1.6 (revised components) three other aspects were changed during
restructuring:

   Cancellation of Salt Heritage Fund

                                                 14

   Capacity building and project management was focused on training

3.2.2     Achievement of restructured Project Development Objectives

55. Rating: High

56. The restructuring was delayed, but made sensible changes in the components of the project,
set better priorities, in agreement between the Government and the Bank, and reallocated some of
the funding. Both PDO indicators (as restructured) exceeded their targets.

57. Of the seven intermediate objectives agreed after restructuring, three were right on target,
three exceeded their targets (one by a wide margin: more than eight times the foreseen number of
facilities improved), and only one achieved less than its target: 93 businesses created out of a
planned 100. Significantly, the largest project component (1. revitalizing historic city centers and

urban infrastructure) delivered 100% of what had been planned. Some results were only
confirmed at the time of the economic impact analysis, or of the ICR mission (July 2014).

3.2.3   Achievements beyond the indicators

58. The key findings of the economic impact assessment (see 2.3) are given below, with details to
be found in Annex 3. In addition, the results of beneficiary assessments are summarized in 3.6,
below.

59. A positive impact on tourist numbers. Total visitors to the principal attractions in the five
project sites reached about 700,000 in 2013, above levels prior to the project which averaged
600,000 2005-7, despite the economic and security situation in the region. Foreign tourists to the
principal heritage sites in the five project cities rose as a share of total foreign tourists in Jordan –
in 2006-7 about 8% of foreign tourists visited the five sites, in 2013 it was 11%. Although
domestic tourism numbers in Jordan as a whole fell by about 11% from 2008 to 2012, domestic
tourist numbers in the target cities grew by about 18% over the same period.

60. A rise in tourism-related employment. Tourism-related employment grew in the five cities at
a substantially faster rate than for Jordan as a whole. Employment in tourist shops increased by
200% in project sites during 2007-2013, against a 70% rise for Jordan as a whole. Employment
in tourist and travel agencies grew strongly (80%) in the target cities over the same period. The
study, together with the parallel findings in the borrower’s report, also found out that the project
created 697 direct jobs and 306 indirect jobs, for a total of 1003 jobs, with a further 200 jobs as an
induced impact on employment, against an initial target of 500 combined indirect and indirect
jobs.

61. Increased employment and income. The study assessed benefits city by city (see box below).
The findings confirmed that the local economy is gaining employment and income benefits from
the project, and this trend can be expected to continue.

62. The works undertaken have substantially helped to break key constraints that were holding
back tourism and community development in the target sites, despite the activities that were
cancelled, because those implemented were of high priority.

63. The generation of benefits from the improvements in the historic cores of the target cities will
continue. The project laid a firm foundation for future growth in tourist numbers, incomes from
tourism, and employment opportunities in the tourist industry, and the results provide tangible
evidence of success.

64. The project also produced intangible benefits by improving cultural heritage conservation,
and stimulating communities’ awareness of the importance of heritage in celebrating the richness
of Jordanian culture.

65. Considerable capacity has been built as a result from the Municipal Revitalization Pacts
doing the design and overseeing implementation of works. Community Partnerships, which
facilitated the exchange of ideas, organized by Municipal Program Coordinators, helped
significantly in solving problems, especially during the design and early implementation phases.

66. A strong sense of ownership and enhanced capacity among mayors and municipal council
members in the five project areas as evidenced by many initiatives to attract investors, market the
city, and ensure sustained funding.


                   Table 14     City-by-city economic benefits beyond the M&E framework

a) Madaba. Production and sales of handicrafts in both the formal and informal sectors have increased in
   project areas and continue to do so. Government has now established the city as a transit destination
   for travelers: tour operators pick up transit passengers from the airport for a guided day (often
   including overnight stay) to be spent at the city. Madaba now boasts 470 licensed furnished
   apartments with another 210 currently under construction; many more are rented out on an individual
   basis. Restaurants do not now let go of seasonal staff as they expect tourism year round.
b) Salt. Rehabilitated shops re-opened up in the historic core, and the renovated square build under the
   project 5 has been used for successful festivals and on a daily basis by the community. There is an
   increase in inquiries for real estate around the Saha to serve as hotels or restaurants, and real estate
   prices have increased 200% in the past two years, after the completion of the facility. The Saha is
   increasingly a launching pad for tourists to start their tours around the city. The impacts are likely to
   rise steadily as the city invests to move towards World Heritage nomination.
c) Karak. Tourism-related employment in project areas during 2007–2012 grew at an annual rate of
   10%, compared to 4% in Jordan as a whole. Seasonal employment and seasonal housing rentals are a
   significant source of income, including in the 70 day period between Ramadan and Adha feasts when
   Shiites come to visit local shrines. The three months of summer provide additional seasonal rental
   opportunities. The local MoTA office has added furnished apartments to its brochures.
d) Ajloun. There has been growth in hotel employment, more registered handicraft associations and a
   substantial increase in expenditure per head by daily visitors. The Sons of Ajloun Society (a CBO)
   holds the keys to numerous residences that it lets out to visitors. The completion of the mosque
   expansion, the oldest in Jordan, is expected to make this trend even more positive.
e) Jerash. Employment in tourism has not grown as rapid as in the other project cities, confirming that
   this site, where works were completed late, may still have untapped potential. However, some of the
   streets have been narrowed through the project and congestion has increased; traffic remains a major
   constraint and needs to be tackled as a priority.


3.3         Efficiency

67. Rating: Substantial

68. Using econometric methods, the economic impact assessment assessed what the tourist
numbers to the principal sites in each of the five cities would have been if the project had not
been undertaken. The study then estimated an annual increase of about 18% in tourist numbers
(about 120,000 tourists) compared to what the numbers would have been in the absence of the
project. The annual expenditure generated by this increase in tourist numbers was estimated at
around JD 6 million. The study also estimated the multiplier effects of the increased expenditure
due to the additional tourists. The indirect multiplier effects (due to backward linkages) were
estimated at JD 2.7 million, while induced multiplier effects resulting from increased consumer
spending were estimated to be approximately JD 3.5 million.

69. At appraisal, pure cost-benefit analysis was found to be not appropriate due to the difficulty
of quantifying benefits and assigning a monetary value. Instead a cost-effectiveness approach
was proposed, to determine whether the project represented the least cost solution by an analysis
of cost per unit of input. Overall, quality of works varied from acceptable to very good. Quality
of street works was exceptionally good in Madaba and Salt, while in Jerash and Ajloun it was
acceptable. Asphalting was of high quality in all cities. The construction quality of the mosque
annex in Ajloun was also very good, as acknowledged by His Royal Highness the King of Jordan
during his visits to the site, as was the rehabilitation of the Saraya Building in Madaba.

70. In general, Jordan has higher construction costs (costs per unit of output) than other countries
in the region - about 10%-20% (see Table below). A comparison of sewage networks for
example for two similar World Bank projects would put a kilometer at USD 36,000 in Lebanon
and about USD 40,000 in Jordan. Jordan also has higher costs per unit of input, such as costs of
materials, while daily labor rates were also higher than in neighboring Lebanon.6

71. The ICR finds the total of 18 months extensions justified in the light of the formidable
delaying factors of global economic downturn, Syrian crisis and National Government
restructuring and thus does not consider that a negative factor in rating efficiency. On the other
hand, the period between the MTR recommending a restructuring and the actual restructuring was
too long, and not particularly efficient. (see Borrower Performance)

3.4.1     The Disconnect dilemma

74. Despite an innovative and ambitious project, the implementation team felt confident that
the project had achieved a great deal in an adverse operating context. At the same time, the team
acknowledged that substantiating these achievements was not entirely possible –some of the data
not being available at the time. To address this situation the team accepted the need to rate the last
ISR as MU with the expectation (shared by staff and management) that the comprehensive report
would yield the evidence to support a more accurate and positive rating at the time of the ICR.



7
 The project underwent a revision of the PDO in 2011 when the project had 63% disbursed. The above
weighing only considers actual disbursements at the time of the restructuring. It could be argued that USD
5 million were canceled and undisbursed, so the actual amount disbursed at that time (USD 35 million) was
closer to 69% of the loan amount used. Applying 69% and 31% result in 3.62, which is still an MS. It is
unfortunate that the restructuring was delayed, as an earlier restructuring would have resulted in a more
robust MS rating.

3.5       Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
a)        Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

75. As discussed above, the project investments have improved infrastructure and service
provision in five historic city cores where poverty rates are high and unemployment and under-
employment are prevalent. A high ownership rate prevented gentrification, even in presence of
substantial increase in real estate values and virtually all renters returned to their improved
businesses. The result has been a clear improvement in standards of living and access to services
as detailed in Annex 3, and highlighted in 3.2 above.

76. Several investments also benefitted specific populations. At Ajloun, for instance, the
expansion of the mosque has enhanced a national and local religious and cultural asset - it is the
oldest mosque in the country – while creating first rate community facilities and providing
women with a defined, up-to-standard place to meet and socialize. In Madaba, the street and
sidewalk upgrading is the first such project to meet Jordanian norms for disabled access. The
Saha in Salt provides a meeting place for young people, in a region of the world where investing
in youth and creating urban spaces for them is of critical importance.

b)        Institutional Change/Strengthening

77. As described above, MoTA’s effectiveness started high, then dwindled, and ended again on
a high note. As a result, MoTA has acquired confidence and experience from project
implementation. This is evidenced by the increased capacity of MoTA to access grant funds with
other donors and concessional loans from IFIs.

78. Municipalities are now well aware of the need to combine tourism promotion and
management of their historic city cores. All five cities have a deeper appreciation for the planning
and execution of O&M, they are incorporating safety in their traffic planning, and have found
ways to mobilize resources, for instance. On the other hand, there was limited institutional
analysis during implementation during a period of unclear decentralization. Some capacity
building activities were dropped, and the capacity built among temporary contracted staff in the
CMUs (see Borrower’s Report) has not been assured. Thus, the ICR team rates the institutional
strengthening as Modest.

c)        Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

79.     None

3.6.1     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

80. Micro-level beneficiary surveys in Madaba and Salt conducted as part of the economic
impact assessment looked at the effects of the project on major stakeholder groups:

     Clear majorities of businesses (around 85% in Madaba and 65% in Salt) reported that the
      upgraded city cores are now attractive places for customers.
     Hoteliers in Madaba reported clear evidence of the appeal of the historic center of the city as
      a location for an overnight stay for tourists.



                                                  20
     Cultural institutions are growing, with the average number of employees per institution rising
      (between 2007-2013) in Madaba from 1 to 8, and in Salt from 12 to 16.
     The majority of institutions (80%) in Madaba and Salt agreed or strongly agreed that the
      project had a positive impact in terms of visitors, both Jordanian and foreign.
     Roughly 70% of visitors in Madaba and 80% in Salt agreed that conservation works
      improved livability.
     About three quarter of respondents agreed that the improved core now “gives a sense of
      Jordanian cultural identity.”

4.         Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

81.      Rating: Significant

82. Going forward, the main risk to tourism development and poverty reduction is the overall
situation in the Middle East, and the Syrian crisis in particular. The impact, if this risk were to
materialize is hard to foresee. The ICR rates the risk to the Outcomes as Significant.

83. The risk assessment done at appraisal was comprehensive, and made sense, while many of
the mitigating factors came into play. As a result, some of the key risks identified at appraisal
have been effectively mitigated, and are unlikely to remain risk factors. For instance, poor local
leadership, elite capture, an unwilling private sector, and disinterested populations are no longer
risks.

84. On the other hand, resource availability was rated as Negligible at appraisal, and that may
have been too low a risk rating, as it turned out. Also, the Borrower’s report notes that “weak
capacity building and poor CMU staffing might hinder the sustainability of operation and
maintenance [..] and cause loss of institutional memory”. As explained below (Comments on
Borrower report), the ICR partially agrees with the reservations about capacity built at MoTA.
However, local tourist institutions, the municipalities, and communities of residents and business
owners achieved significant capacity, and demonstrate their sustainability. The early signs of
institutional changes in Jordan’s public sector should perhaps have been investigated better, if not
at appraisal, then during implementation to better manage the associated risks.

 Counterpart funding, decentralization and devolvement issues.
 Institutional arrangements, with a better skill gap analysis, an incentive review among all

 M&E system design, implementation, and capacity built and retained.

5.        Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1       Bank Performance

a)     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

86.     Rating: Satisfactory

87. Overall, project preparation, design, and quality at entry were sound (see 2.1 above). Bank
inputs during preparation and appraisal helped to deliver a strategically relevant and thoroughly
prepared project where extensive consultations promised strong ownership and engagement at
central, municipal, and community levels. Lessons from previous experience were well
incorporated and the risk management strategy was sound. Although ambitious, project design
made sense and combined the key ingredients in an effective manner to achieve integration and
efficiency. Safeguards and fiduciary aspects were carefully appraised and prepared. The project
was ready for implementation: there were no major procurement issues, no implementation
delays, and disbursements started early on, with adequate staffing in place. On the other hand, the



                                                22
                                                                                           8
results orientation (including RF, PDO and M&E) was less than satisfactory.                    Thus, Bank
performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated Satisfactory.

88. This ICR agrees with the QAG review of quality at entry (QEA8, August 2007), which
considered this a well-prepared project. QAG noted how three sub-sectors - cultural heritage,
tourism, and municipal management - were innovatively brought together to spur local economic
development and how the project took a tailored, non-conventional approach to urban policy,
building on in-depth sectoral knowledge and participation of key stakeholders with adequate
attention to social and environmental aspects. QAG rated the overall quality at entry as
Satisfactory, with environmental and fiduciary aspects rated Highly Satisfactory, and five quality
dimensions rated Satisfactory. Implementation Arrangements were rated Moderately Satisfactory,
however, as the panel felt that the project implementation period was short (5 years) given the
comprehensiveness of the project and past experience within the sector in Jordan. The Region
broadly accepted this assessment.

b)      Quality of Supervision

89.   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

90. Overall, the supervision teams did a good job, despite five changes of Task Team Leaders.
The team built excellent relations with a multitude of stakeholders and partners and provided key
technical expertise in a timely fashion. The quality of the 16 ISRs was good, candid in its
observations, and realistic in its ratings, although the upgrade of the DO rating before the
restructuring had been finalized seemed premature.

91.   On the other hand, key moments for Bank decisions were not used optimally:
        The QER was not used to improve the quality of the RF/PDO/Indicators
        The MTR was underutilized to prepare for the restructuring
        Restructuring One was delayed 9 and did not improve RF/PDO/M&E
        Restructuring Two (project extension) may have been too modest




8
   The ICR undertook a retrospective assessment of Quality at Entry by unbundling QaE into selected
elements. Those elements were rated, and given a numerical value, allowing a theoretical averaging. The
elements are as follows, with their ratings: Relevance (HS); Borrower commitment (S); Knowledge base
(HS); WB Rationale (S); Results orientation (U); Institutional analysis (MS); Risk analysis (MS); Due
diligence in Fiduciary and Safeguards (HS); Project design (S); and Readiness for implementation (S).
The simple average would be 4.8 (S).

9
  The period between MTR and Restructuring showed dwindling interest in government (at least among the
leadership at the time) and the delay of the restructuring should perhaps have been taken up by the Sector
Manager, requesting the Country Director to discuss at appropriate levels. That delay now unfavorably
weighs the Outcome to the pre-restructuring period. Had it been done in time, the weighted MS rating for
Outcome would have been more robust and possible closer to an S rating.




                                                   23
92.   Thus, the rating for Quality of Supervision is Moderately Satisfactory.

93. This rating is in line with the QALP 8 findings (Sept 2010) that concluded that the
likelihood of achieving the DO was Moderately Unlikely, the Quality of Design and Quality of
Bank Supervision were both judged to be ’Moderately Satisfactory’ while Implementation
Progress was rated ’Moderately Unsatisfactory’. It concluded that “The project is now in need of
a fundamental restructuring.” The QALP was carried out more than three years before project
closure, so can only be an indication, but the ICR strongly agrees with its conclusion on the need
for a fundamental restructuring.

c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

94.   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

95. The Bank did an excellent job in assisting the Government of Jordan prepare this project.
Quality at entry was good and early implementation demonstrated the solid ownership,
preparation and design logic. During supervision, the ICR sees evidence of a solid, professional
team working in partnership with the Borrower and Partners. However, it considers the
performance of the Bank as a whole less than satisfactory, as several key opportunities were
missed to improve this project. Therefore, overall Bank performance is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.

5.2     Borrower Performance

a)      Government Performance

96.   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

97. The project was an excellent fit to Government priorities, and ownership and commitment
were strong, particularly at the beginning of the project, when important decisions had to be taken
to kick off important activities. The quality of preparation by the Government was high, and
inter-ministerial cooperation was good, particularly with the Ministry of Municipal Affairs
(MoMA). The Government complied with all covenants.

98. On the other hand, three factors had negative effects on implementation: (i) the institutional
changes that impacted the relations between Ministries and between MoTA and the communities;
(ii) the budget cap (see 2.2 above); and (iii) the frequent changes of Ministers and municipal
Governments. Also, the rationale for the Government to finance the construction of the Petra
Gateway from its own resources remained a missed opportunity for the project; the delay of the
first restructuring for more than a year negatively impacted the project, the refusal to request an
extension beyond one year, although the logic for a longer extension seemed compelling.

99. Collaboration of the Technical Development Department of MoTA with the municipalities
required efforts to be established and become fully functional. The Borrowers’ report states that
“community participation in the targeted cities presented a chronic resistance and dissatisfaction
at least during the first half of project implementation period in most of the cases.”



                                                24
100. The ICR team understands that initial collaboration may have required efforts, but that
problems were resolved relatively quickly as a result of the frequent consultations. Already the
third ISR mentions that “The project is progressing satisfactorily, which is due largely to the fact
that the Technical Development Department (TDD) has been able to establish a close working
relationship with the municipalities and that the newly elected mayors have confirmed their
strong commitment to the project and are proceeding with the necessary staffing of the city-core
management units.”


                                   Table 19    10,000 “likes” for Salt

While the ICR was prepared, in July 2014, the Salt municipality erected a giant screen at the Saha (one of
the project sites) for locals to watch the World Cup in Brazil. Pictures appeared on Facebook along with
the following comment: “Little did we know that in the process of rehabilitating Sahat Al Ain in Salt that
this reclaimed public space will be fully populated as an open theater on one summer night and by that
creating a rare social scenery in Jordan. The Government, the World Bank and the municipality totally got
it right”. The post received about 10,000 likes, proving the appreciation for the project.


b)       Implementing Agency Performance

101. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

102. On the whole, the TDD ensured that adequate decisions were taken to address problems
arising during implementation, with more realistic phasing of the works and the appointment of a
number of additional engineers as examples. In terms of safeguards, issues were satisfactorily
resolved while the Government made available the required funding. Community Liaison
Officers acted as interface with and between municipalities and the Project-Affected Persons
generally expressed satisfaction with the “fair process”. All affected people were satisfied with
the compensation and resettlement package. The compensation rates for all lost assets were
determined based on market value and reflected replacement cost. The compensation process for
the renters was fair in terms of quantity and quality and the value was adequate, especially taking
into consideration the fact the renters eventually went back to improved and renovated shops.
Safeguards emerge as a very satisfactory aspect of the project. Fiduciary compliance was
observed, financial management was satisfactorily conducted, and audit compliance was
satisfactory in terms of quality and timely submission. All audits were unqualified. On the other
hand, the poor M&E throughout the project, despite multiple opportunities and incentives for
improvement, weighs quite negatively on the implementation agency performance and can only
be partially offset by the economic impact assessment. Hence, the ICR rates IA performance
Moderately Satisfactory.

c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

103. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

104. Overall, Jordanian commitment to achieving the PDO fluctuated, but ended strong. When
the budgetary environment became constrained, considerable efforts were made to continue
implementation, but necessitating extensions of the project. Safeguard and Fiduciary aspects of
the project were done very well, but M&E remained a serious shortcoming.

6. Lessons Learned

105. Four lessons were learned from this project:

a) The integration of tourism, cultural heritage, business development, urban upgrading, poverty
   reduction and city management results in a total that is more than the sum of the parts.
b) Right-sizing investments in integrated cultural heritage projects balances the need for critical
   mass in a number of cities while avoiding spreading efforts too thin in too many locations;
c) Applying good design and implementation practices helps projects to achieve their objectives,
   and more importantly, ensure that beneficiaries actually benefit; and
d) A solid understanding of the incentives, skill gaps and political economy among all key
   stakeholders is essential to design institutional arrangements in a complex environment with
   multiple stakeholders and to inform unavoidable adjustments during implementation.

106. Integration. In cases where cultural heritage sites are situated in cities, an integrated
approach combining tourism, cultural heritage, urban upgrading, and poverty reduction can drive
a powerful economic dynamic. Full integration, as learned in this project, demonstrates that
simply improving an access road for tourist buses or putting in place an improved sewer
infrastructure, will not provide the optimal outcomes, and may be of dubious sustainability and
inclusiveness. Consultation between the local stakeholders (local male and female residents,
actual and prospective business owners, public utility managers, municipality representatives,
cultural heritage site managers, and mayors, for instance) and the project team is essential. The
most interesting results were achieved where close interaction between stakeholders was ensured.
Recruiting communication and community outreach staff had a positive effect.

107. Right-sizing. Investments in the integrated approach to cultural heritage need to be right-
sized, both at the level of individual cities, and at the National level. Considerations to determine
the critical size include the following.
     Consider both the potential of cultural heritage to attract visitors, as well as the
         opportunity for local people to make a living. Thus, for instance, simply refinishing a
         building façade, or putting a bicycle route in, won’t be enough. Conversely, redoing the
         whole of urban transport including roads, buses and management practices, will be too
         much.
     Focus on what is needed to make the city attractive for locals and visitors, by carefully
         blending improvement of key municipal services (water, sanitation, electricity, access,
         parking, safety) with promotion of local businesses that cater to locals and tourists.
     As a very rough guide, and limited to countries somewhat similar to Jordan and
         depending on the needed upgrading, investments of less than USD 5 million per city
         might not have the critical mass, while investments of more than USD 20 million would
         risk dilution into non-core activities.
     The development of the five selected sites helped build a denser network of higher
         quality tourist circuits. This project’s model can help raise a country’s profile as a stand-
         alone tourist destination and thereby improve the resilience of its tourist sector to the
         threat of external shocks.
     The wider application of this lesson will depend on the particular country, and the list of
         sites to be included may need to be established by detailed surveys among prospective
         tourists and national tourism boards.
     Again, as a very rough guide, experience in Jordan indicates that in countries with limited
         implementation capacity more than ten geographically dispersed sites would be a
         challenge to implement, while the overhead of fewer than three or four sites would be
         quite high.

                                                 26
108. Good practice. Projects ignore good practice at their peril. Some shortcomings were
exogenous, but some were clearly under the joint control of the Government and the Bank. For
future operations, this project underscored the importance to apply good practice in the following
areas.
     Early action is needed to adapt to changing circumstances or emerging performance
        issues. The Bank and the Borrower have many tools to address needed change, but not
        using these tools has considerable costs. For instance, this project would have been truly
        outstanding:
         Had the team heeded the QER advice to improve the PDO and indicators;
         Had the MTR had a stronger mandate and more focused terms of reference;
         Had the Government not delayed the restructuring;
         Had the Government agreed with a slightly longer extension; and
         Had counterpart funding been available in the foreseen timeframe.
     Set a PDO and results that are precise, relevant and confidently monitorable. Although
        definition of indicators for a cultural heritage and tourism project is difficult, the
        economic impact assessment provides a wealth of possible indicators that capture the
        results of the investment in urban infrastructure and services, and indicators that track
        details of poverty reduction and business growth (Annex 3).
     Better monitoring of unit costs and least-cost options are an empowering tool for
        beneficiaries and other stakeholders, in addition to being a fiduciary requirement.

109. Understanding institutions. In projects where roles and responsibilities are spread among
different implementing agents, which is almost always the case in projects applying this model, a
thorough institutional analysis is needed at appraisal. That analysis needs to be checked for
relevance during the MTR, particularly in countries undergoing decentralization or other
institutional change. Such an institutional analysis would include:
 An inventory of available and required human resources;
 A skill gap analysis to determine the outlines of a training plan;
 An understanding of the key public sector human resource policies, including the incentive
     structure, compensation criteria, and sanction policies; and
 An understanding of the political economy to inform the risk analysis and guide attractive
     and sustainable public and private sector staffing arrangements.

7.      Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

a)      Borrower/implementing agencies

110. The Borrower provided a comprehensive, clearly written, and balanced report that largely
concurs with the ICR findings. The ICR team is grateful to the Government of Jordan to have
provided an important contribution to the expanding knowledge base on this type of project and
the ICR provides the following observations to inform future discussion and practice:

                                            rather than providing direct funding to local businesses, the
                                            benefits in those businesses were largely the consequence of
                                            project-supported urban upgrading. Moreover, those benefits

                                    Recommendations for Future Projects
1. Community Participation
                                         Agree. This recommendation underscores the ICR lesson learned
                                         about the need to do a solid institutional assessment that would

2. Capacity Building and
Maintaining the Institutional
Memory
Although it is much easier to build
up the full capacity of project related
                                         Agree. The ICR team refers to Bank evidence on the lack of

municipalities, and rely less on
imported qualified personnel. This
shall also maintain and allow to the
transfer of the institutional memory.
3. Comprehensive and diversified
development model
It is recommended to increase the
diversification of the tourism
developmental projects by providing
a more balanced distribution of
activities beyond infrastructure
components and the built
environment. This can be done by
initiating periodic tourism-related
events, community training, Local         Agreed.

Annex 4. Economic and Financial Analysis

1. This annex provides a summary of a special evaluation study commissioned by the
Government and the Bank to Macquarie University of Australia, to assess economic impacts of
project investments. The study used tested economic methodologies for ex post impact
evaluation to derive indicators of the direct, indirect, and induced effects generated by the
investments. The study was carried out by Prof. Dr. David Throsby and Dr. Ekaterina Petetskaya.

2. The economic impact assessment collected and analyzed existing data from a variety of
World Bank and Jordanian Government sources, and have undertaken original data collection in
the field in two of the cities, through extensive surveys, in Madaba and Salt, as well as in a
control city, Irbid, which was not included in the project. The results of the pilots were then
extrapolated to all project locations.

Major outcomes

3. Regarding tourist numbers, total visitors to the principal attractions in the five project sites
reached 675,000 in 2013, above levels prior to the project which averaged 600,000 in 2005-7.

4. Foreign tourist numbers in Jordan, which had been following an overall upward trend during
the period from 2002 up to 2009, fell away sharply in 2010 because of a range of external factors
including the conflict in neighboring Syria. Despite so, foreign tourists to the principal attractions
in the five project sites rose as a share of total foreign tourists – in 2006-7 about 8% of foreign
tourists visited the five sites, in 2013 it was 11%.

5. Domestic tourism numbers in Jordan also fell (by about 11 percent) from 2008 to 2012, but
in the target cities over this period, domestic tourist numbers grew by about 18 percent.

Econometric analysis

6. The substantial fluctuations in tourist numbers tend to swamp any effect on numbers that
may have been exerted by the project improvements. However, econometric modelling
overcomes these problems to some extent and enables estimation of the net effects of the project
on tourist numbers. The study estimates an annual increase of about 18% in tourist numbers
(about 120,000 tourists) compared to what the numbers would have been in the absence of the
project. The annual expenditure generated by this increase in tourist numbers is estimated at
around JD 6 million.

7. The study also estimated the multiplier effects of the increased expenditure due to the
additional tourists. The indirect multiplier effects (due to backward linkages) are estimated at JD
2.7 million, while induced multiplier effects resulting from increased consumer spending are
estimated to be approximately JD 3.5 million. Regarding employment, the study estimated the
direct impact on employment resulting from the increase in tourist expenditure as 697 jobs
throughout the Jordanian economy. The indirect impact on employment was estimated at 106
jobs, with a further 200 jobs also being added as an induced impact on employment. The study
provides evidences for the attribution of these jobs to the project.




                                                 48
Tourism-related employment

8. Tourism-related employment grew at a faster rate in Karak and Ajloun than for Jordan as a
whole, whereas in Salt there was a slight decline in the period 2007 to 2012. The main drivers of
tourist-related employment came from tourist shops – the number of employees in such
businesses doubled between 2007 and 2013 in the five targeted cities, a bigger increase than in
the whole country, where these numbers increased by 70%. Employment in tourist and travel
agencies also grew in the target cities over the same period (80%), indicating a growth in this
sector that will underpin further development in the years ahead.

Results of the micro-level surveys of major stakeholder groups
9. The economic impact assessment involved surveys of: (1) businesses; (2) tourist
accommodation; (3) cultural institutions; (4) households; and (5) visitors, particularly in Madaba
and Salt. Representative results for these five groups of stakeholders are as follows:

Businesses

10. Employment in tourist-related businesses in Madaba has remained reasonably steady overall
since the project inception. There has been a significant increase in real estate prices for
commercial property since the inception of the project in both locations (50% and 70% in
Madaba and Salt, respectively). Clear majorities of respondents (around 85% in Madaba and 65%
in Salt) were of the opinion that the historic cores in both cities are attractive places for customers
and just over 60% of respondents in Madaba and 75% of those in Salt agreed that the historic core
could be described as a prestigious business location.

Tourist accommodation

11. The survey covered hotels in both locations. Most Madaba hotels are satisfied with their
location in the historic core and would locate there again if starting out. The center of Salt is a
more difficult location to access – so far the only hotel there is just outside the core. Most
respondents expected to increase their staffing levels in the future. There is clear evidence of the
appeal of the historic center of the city as a location for an overnight stay for tourists. The
majority of respondents thought that the historic core is a prestigious place for business location.
These results again confirm the positive role that cultural heritage plays in the tourism industry,
through its influence on the decision-making of both tourists themselves and the providers of
tourism services.

Cultural institutions

12. There has been considerable growth in activity in the years since the project amongst the
cultural institutions surveyed. For example, in the case of employment, between 2007 and 2013,
the average number of employees in cultural institutions grew from 12 to 16 employees per
organization in Salt and in Madaba from 1 to 8 employees. Likewise, average salaries increased
by approximately 20 percent in both places. When asked about their opinion regarding the
impact that the project has had on them, the majority of institutions in Madaba (80%) and in Salt
(80% to 90%) agreed or strongly agreed that there has been a positive impact in terms of visitors,
both Jordanian and foreigners. In regard to future plans, four institutions in the Salt historic core
and three in the Madaba historic core foreshadowed some changes to improve business operations

                                                  49
in the future, such as renovation, renewal of exhibits, opening a café, souvenir shop or gallery,
launching new program, activities, etc.

Households

13. Residents who live in the historic cores expressed their satisfaction or dissatisfaction about
the core as a place to live. In Madaba 65% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the
statement that the historic core is attractive as a place to live. In general living costs in the historic
core do not seem to be significantly higher than in other parts of either city.

Visitors

14. In view of the fact that the rehabilitation of the historic cores in Madaba and Salt was
undertaken under the project with the explicit intention of improving facilities and access for
tourists, it was important for this study to find out something about the attitudes of visitors to the
city centers – do they think that the historic core is culturally important, or do they think that
investing in its rehabilitation is a waste of money. The majority of visitors in both Madaba and
Salt said they were there because they “wanted to visit the historic core as a cultural site”, an
affirmation of the drawing power of heritage for tourists. Roughly 70% of respondents in Madaba
and 80% in Salt supported the proposition that restoration of the core actually improves it; 75% of
Madaba respondents and a slightly higher proportion in Salt agreeing that the core “gives a sense
of Jordanian cultural identity”. The majority of visitors disagreed with the proposition that
investment in the core is a waste of money, or that it should be demolished. The educational
potential of cultural heritage is illustrated by the significant numbers of people claiming to have
learnt something about heritage while visiting the core.

Conclusions

15.     The economic impact assessment has been concerned to evaluate the results of the project
within a broad cost/benefit framework. The question to be addressed within this framework has
been whether or not the initial investment of over $70 million in the project has generated a time-
stream of net benefits that will justify the capital cost. The study concluded that the generation of
benefits from the improvements in the historic cores of the target cities is getting underway, and
the study outlines significant initial results.

16. Main conclusions are:

17. Econometric methods can assess what the tourist numbers to the principal sites in each of the
five cities would have been if the project had not been undertaken; preliminary results from this
analysis indicate a generally positive impact on numbers, and it might be expected that these
predictions will continue into the future.

18. Similarly the surveys of the stakeholder groups in the two case-study cities have yielded
primary data showing the improvements that these groups have so far recognised in their
commercial operations or in their experience of living in or in visiting the historic core, and it is
likely that the best of these sorts of responses will continue to grow. There have been some
unfavourable outcomes caused not by the project but as a result of external factors, particularly
those that have affected inbound tourist numbers. The overall tone to be recognised in the survey
results is positive.

                                                   50
19. The data assembled and analyses undertaken in have provided a solid basis for making a
judgement as to the existing and potential benefits arising from the project. This judgement
points clearly to the fact that, although there has been some variations in outcomes between the
different cities, the works undertaken have helped to break key constraints that were holding back
tourism and community development in the target sites.

20. The economic impact assessment concludes affirming that the project can be judged as
having been successful overall in laying a firm foundation for future growth in tourist numbers,
incomes from tourism, and employment opportunities in the tourist industry. At the same time
the project has initiated both directly and indirectly an improvement in levels of cultural heritage
conservation, and stimulated an awakening in the community’s awareness of the importance of
heritage in defining and celebrating the richness of Jordanian culture and identity.

Annex 6. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Prepared by Bashar Haddaden on behalf of MoTA, July 24, 2014

Executive Summary (Verbatim)

1. The objective of this assignment is to develop the project final report analysing project
outputs vis-à-vis project design, outlining expected outcomes and benefits, and reporting on
overall implementation.

2. The Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Urban Development Project (CHTDP) is Co-financed
by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the GoJ for USD 56
million and USD 15.08 million respectively. The implemented activities under the CHTUDP
extended over a period of seven years, from the approval date in January 30, 2007 up to the
project scheduled closure date of March 31, 2014. The primary implementation responsibility of
the CHTUDP resided with the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities (MOTA)-particularly with its
Technical Development Department (TDD).

3. The project has involved the revitalization of historic city centers, urban infrastructure
improvements and cultural landscapes regeneration in and around the historic cores of five
targeted cities: Ajloun, Jerash, Karak, Madaba and Salt, with the objective of promoting physical
and economic development. Results’ indicators have shown that the Project Development
Objectives were successfully achieved.

4. The actual implementation of the project’s various components was only recently entirely
completed which means that the project’s inception is very recent. Most of the project
restructured and planned activities were effectively implemented with a satisfactory disbursement
level despite some delays and cost deviations.

5. The project restructuring and amendments to Loan agreement substantially affected the
original scope of work, project design, and means of intervention. Nevertheless; the project
represents a unique, unprecedented opportunity of practice demonstrating the local and
governmental skill set, and abilities utilized in managing nation-wide multidisciplinary activities
requiring complex coordination and strong synergy among stakeholders to deliver a successful
sustainable model for tourism. It is unfortunate thought that the sustainability of this model might
be hindered due to the probable loss of institutional memory shall the capacity of the PMs and
CMUs deteriorate in the near future.

Key Recommendations

a) Assess the needed level of community participation in relation to the anticipated impacts on
   the community
b) Utilize more staff members from the implementing and coordinating agencies and rely less on
   hiring
c) Provide a more balanced distribution of activities beyond infrastructure and streamline with
   municipal urban and strategic plans
d) Have a more area/ destination/ region concentrated intervention

Selected parts of the report

6. Components. While the original CHTUDP design consisted of four components, the finally
revisited project components were reduced to two: Component 1, Revitalization of historic city
centers, urban infrastructure improvements and cultural landscapes regeneration and Component
2 Capacity Building and Project Management. Components’ costs are summarized under (Annex
5: Summary of Project Costs). The implementation of Component 1, Revitalization of historic
city centers, urban infrastructure improvements and cultural landscapes regeneration, was carried
out through activities in and around the historic cores of the cities of Jerash, Karak, Madaba, Salt
and Ajloun and has completed most of the included sub-components. The implementation of
Component 2, Capacity building and project management [originally Component 4, renumbered
Component 4 following project restructuring, note added by the ICR team], was completed and
conducted through the Provision of Training to MoTA and municipal staff in developing an
action plan for the operations and maintenance of the assets that are being developed as part of
the CHTUD.

7. Compliance with safeguards and country legislation. Three safeguard policies were
triggered by the CHTUD project. Environmental Assessment (OP/BP/GP 4.01), Cultural Property
(OP 4.1 1) and Involuntary Resettlement IOPA3P 4.12), and in accordance with World Bank
Operational Policy 4.01 (January 1998), this Project was rated a category “B”, with an
anticipation that there will be Limited negative social and environmental impacts that are easily
mitigated during the implementation of the rehabilitation and construction works.

8. Consequently, an Environmental Assessment (EA) was carried out by MoTA-TDD through
a contract with specialized consultant. The EA process was participatory and has featured
stakeholder workshops and meetings with municipal councils, business owners, residents, NGOs
and special interest groups.

9. On Cultural Property, the project has been designed to ensure compliance with the
Jordanian law for the protection and conservation of cultural property, which is also in
compliance with Bank policy. Contracts included provisions for “chance finds” and the few cases
which encountered remains of cultural heritage value, the Department of Antiquities intervened to
verify the cultural integrity of the finds and recommended measures for the works which have
been implemented accordingly. The contracts for restoration of historical buildings included in
the project were also in compliance with the Jordanian laws and the Bank policy. The few minor
issues identified during construction that triggered this policy have been corrected to maintain the
integrity of the cultural property.

10. On Involuntary Resettlement, a project-wide Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and
subsequent city-specific Resettlement Action Plans, has been prepared for the project as a whole,
and site-specific Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) have been produced for the cities of Jerash,
Karak and Salt. The Project Management Team and MoTA Senior Officials’ were diligent and
committed to implementing the Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan and the OP 4.12 was
substantially complied with although a number of delays have been experienced.

11. [On community participation,] Community Liaison Officers (CLO) were appointed by each
city including Ajloun to follow up with the project affected persons (PAP) and act as a conduit
between concerned municipalities and affected communities. Nevertheless, for quite a long time



                                                55
of the project’s duration, it was noticed that none of these CLOs were full timers as originally
planned except for Salt and Karak at a later stage.

12. Procurement. The Technical Development Department (TDD) at MoTA was the party
responsible for procurement activities associated with the project and have had the main
responsibility for the management of the procurement process. The overall procurement capacity
of the implementing agency for handling the procurement and contracts management was
adequate for the project purposes. According to the project design as per the PAD, the frequency
of procurement supervision missions was determined at one every six months, with the first year
requiring three missions to ensure proper implementation start-up as the majority of procurement
packaging launch and processing. Since project initiation seven years ago, the total number of
procurement plans should have reached around 28 versions by January/February 2014. It is
difficult to assess the frequency of procurement plan updating out of the provided documents
since the collected procurement plan files are not consistent in format, titles, file names, and
distinctive dates. Nevertheless, reports and extracts of the procurement plans obtained from the
available Aid Memoires were also revised and compared, where the procurement processing was
found satisfactory. The Procurement and financial departments were closely coordinating
allocation of budget and foreseen disbursements. The project maintained and monitored the
procurement plan/cycle.

13. Monitoring and Evaluation. Based on the lessons learned from the Second Jordan Tourism
Development project regarding the recognized lack of a structured M&E system built into the
project design, the CHTUDP made a clear provision for the design and implementation of an
integrated M&E system as part of the Capacity Strengthening of the implementing agency
MOTA-TDD. Accordingly, Component 4 was designed to cover the costs of specialized
consultancy services aimed at designing and managing the M&E system for the project over the
five years of implementation. In particular, the project was to support the creation of an
Integrated Monitoring and Evaluation system working at different levels (linking MoTA, the
Municipalities and MoMA) and serving different monitoring purposes. The contract of the M&E
consultant was terminated and the TDD became the party responsible for monitoring the projects
indicators. While the failed consultancy has resulted in a considerable delay in the M&E
schedule, a system was prepared to capture the progress of the project. The TDD team developed
survey forms within an overall system to collect data on most of the indicators by engaging the
city core management units and conducting sampling exercises. The M&E framework of the
project underwent few changes along the project progress. This was partially in effect of project
restructuring and the two amendments of the loan agreement in addition to better reflect project
progress and comprehend the positive results achieved by the project. This is especially in terms
of new and extended business activities in project areas as a result of the urban upgrading
exercises successfully implemented.

14. Expected Project benefits. Results’ indicators have shown that the Project Development
Objectives were successfully achieved. The actual implementation of the project’s various
components was only recently entirely completed which means that the project’s inception has
just started.

15. The eminent upgrades of the built environment for the targeted five cities underlines the fact
that projected benefits are in line with the lifetime of the implemented infrastructure itself. It is
well stated in (Throsby, May 2014) that the generation of benefits from the improvements in the
historic cores of the target cities is just getting underway, and the possibility of measuring effects

                                                 56
in terms of increased outputs, incomes, employment and so on, is extremely problematical after
such a short time period.

16. Predictions and analysis results of tourist numbers in the principle sites in each of the five
cities indicate a generally positive impact on numbers, and it might be expected that these
predictions will continue into the future. Indeed, it is highly probable that when the improvements
in the target cities initiated by the project become integral in urban and social fabric, the rate of
growth of tourist numbers might increase further.

17. Surveys of the major stakeholder groups in the two case-study cities – businesses, tourist
accommodations, cultural institutions, households and visitors – show that the improvements
these groups have are recognized in their commercial operations, experience of living, or visiting
the historic core, but again it is likely that the best of these sorts of responses is yet to come.

18. The data assembled and analyses undertaken in the mentioned study have provided a solid
basis for making a judgment as to the existing and potential benefits arising from the CHTUD
project. It is clear that, although there has been some variation in outcomes between the different
cities, the works undertaken have helped to break key constraints that were holding back tourism
and community development in the target sites.

19. Therefore, the project can be judged as having been successful overall in laying a firm
foundation for future growth in tourist numbers, incomes from tourism, and employment
opportunities in the tourist industry.

20. At the same time the project has initiated both directly and indirectly an improvement in
levels of cultural heritage conservation, and stimulated an awakening in the community’s
awareness of the importance of heritage in defining and celebrating the richness of Jordanian
culture and identity.

21. Other future benefits the project would have is mostly related to the capacity building of the
different stakeholders that were involved in carrying out project activities and the potential
utilization of such knowledge in future applications, whether in the same-targeted cities or other
destinations yet to be developed.

22. Performance of project implementation unit. As the overall implementing agency, MOTA
and more specifically the TDD retained the most critical role in project implementation and
determining of project success. In summary, MoTA is the party responsible for ensuring that the
Project is delivered in accordance with its aims and objectives, at an acceptable quality, and on
time and within budget. MoTA is also responsible for overseeing the work of the other agencies
involved in the project, particularly the PMs, and for ensuring that Bank guidelines, including,
inter alia: procurement, accounting, environment, and resettlement are met. In performing its
duties during the course of project implementation, the overall performance of the project
implementation unit (TDD) was satisfactory.

23. Performance of Central Entities. The Key Central entities involved in project
implementation are the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, Ministry of Planning and International
Cooperation, the Department of Antiquities, in addition to the Project Steering Committee (PSC)
comprising the Secretary Generals or their nominees of MoTA, MoMA, MoPIC and DOA, as
well as the Director of the Jordan Tourist Board (JTB). Despite the challenges and bureaucracies

                                                 57
faced during project implementation, the joint effort of the central entities was satisfactory. Their
role was essential for supporting the project implementation and implementing agency. PSC
could have been more effective and central to the coordination of efforts and expediting cross-
ministerial procedures.

24. Performance of Local Governments and Peripheral Entities. The performance of PMs
varied from a municipality to another ranging from satisfactory to highly satisfactory. As the PMs
learning curve was progressing, their respective performance witnessed fluctuation across
different project activities. Community partnership was the most problematic at certain project
implementation stages; however, critical issues were resolved at last due to PMs distinguished
efforts leading to a successful implementation of planned activities.

25. International Best Practices and Role of International Finance Institutions. International
best practices were practically tailored to meet the local needs of the targeted cities, where they
brought in expertise was employed in the preparation of project novel concepts and designs.
Moreover, and during project implementation while issues and obstacles were arising, hands-on
alternatives and solutions were profoundly proposed and discussed with the implementing agency
and other stakeholders.

26. Bank performance. Throughout the project, the performance of the World Bank was
satisfactory. There was continuous follow up by the project team and Bank related staff on the
progress of implementation on all components and on financial, procurement and management
matters. This ensured the mobilization of a multi-disciplinary team with international exposure
very much needed to oversee project activities. Safeguard policies were diligently monitored and
timely addressed as well.

Lessons Learned and recommendations

(Also see ICR paragraph 7: Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing
Agencies/Partners)

27. Project Successes
a) The revised Project Development Objectives were successfully achieved
b) Most of the project restructured and planned activities were effectively implemented with
    satisfactory disbursement level exceeding 85%.
c) The project benefited local communities in target cities as well as visitors and tourists, where
    the estimated annual increase of tourism was 18 percent in tourist numbers (about 120
    thousand tourists) accompanied with positive contribution to the local economic development
    in those cities.
d) The project represents a unique, unprecedented opportunity of practice demonstrating the
    local and governmental skill set, and abilities utilized in managing nation-wide
    multidisciplinary activities requiring complex coordination and strong synergy among
    stakeholders.
e) The project developmental program is considered a successful sustainable model for tourism
    and it has formed nuclei for further tourism-related activities in target cities and city cores
    that can be replicated and/or expanded.

28. Project Failures
a) The project restructuring and amendments to Loan agreement substantially affected the
   original scope of work, project design, and means of intervention. PDOs were revised and

                                                 58
     restated, project components and activities substantially downscaled. Out of four components,
     two were cancelled, Petra Gateway and Local Economic Development, while a considerable
     change altered the forth component (Capacity Building) limiting it to training.
b)   While the followed development model promotes sustainability, the weak Capacity Building
     in PMs and poor CMUs staffing might hinder the sustainability of operation and maintenance
     of the accomplished activities in city cores and cause losses and/or damages to the obtained
     institutional memory.
c)   The significant downsizing of project activities confined the previously comprehensive
     program of intervention to less diverse one almost limited to the built/physical environment.
d)   Community participation in the targeted cities presented a chronical resistance and
     dissatisfaction at least during the first half of project implementation period in most of the
     cases. This could be related to the adopted participation model which might not been suitable
     to the level of impact on the community.
e)   Actual Project cost exceeded Cost estimations by more than 160% and has therefore lead to
     cancellation of activities.

Recommendations for Future Projects

29. Community Participation. For future tourism development projects/programs, it is
recommended to conduct an assessment of the needed level of community participation in
relation to the anticipated impacts on the community due to proposed project interventions.

30. Capacity Building and Maintaining the Institutional Memory. Although it is much
easier to build up the full capacity of project related implementation and coordination units, by
bringing in and hiring new staff members with relevant experience, nevertheless it has proven to
be less sustainable on the medium and long term. Therefore, it is recommended to utilize more
staff members from the implementing and coordinating agencies, such as MOTA and PMs, and
rely less on imported qualified personnel. This shall also maintain and allow to the transfer of the
institutional memory.

31. Comprehensive and diversified development model. It is recommended to increase the
diversification of the tourism developmental projects by providing a more balanced distribution
of activities beyond infrastructure components and the built environment. This can be done by
initiating periodic tourism-related events, community training, LED component…etc, where this
shall expedite the generation of economic and tourism activities in city cores rather than wait for
market forces. Works in city cores is recommended to be more hinged with the municipal direct
needs and be well integrated with its future urban and strategic plans.

32. More Focused target areas/destinations. It is recommended to minimize diffusion, thus
select a fewer number of included cities in future projects and have a more area/ destination/
region concentrated intervention. This shall consolidate efforts, require less resources and force
irrefutable results.
