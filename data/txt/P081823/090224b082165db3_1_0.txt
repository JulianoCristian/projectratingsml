                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objectives of the Project are to support tourism development in five historically and culturally important cities - Jerash, Karak, Madaba, Salt, Aljoun, - and thereby
                         contribute to local economic development.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the final stage of project implementation. Remaining works are taking place in the core historic district of Ajloun. All other works are now completed in the other cities, where
                         they have created conditions for tourism and local economic development, particularly in Madaba and Salt.
                         Remaining activities will also include training for the operation and maintenance of assets procured through the project.
