The improved administrative\n            capacity of the MNEYS will enhance responsiveness, and\n            ensure a sectoral strategic capacity. Professional\n            development will be addressed, to include the establishment\n            of a Strategic Planning Unit, and, the rationalization of\n            the teaching staff, will include the identification, and\n            implementation of policy measures for an improved\n            distribution of teachers, and schools. In addition, an in\n            depth operational study, and an action plan will be\n            conducted, and implemented, addressing a more equitable\n            system of educational financing; and, 2) the quality\n            enhancement component will upgrade public educational\n            facilities, through civil works, and furniture/equipment\n            supply.
