Project for Lebanon were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: a\n            separate political consensus process is needed, after\n            reforms are ready. Technical and professional consultations\n            on proposed reforms are necessary but not sufficient. A\n            minimum degree and sufficient period of stability is needed\n            following conflict for a country to develop its capacity to\n            prepare, adopt, and implement sector-wide or far-reaching\n            reforms. Until that capacity is in place, targeted reforms\n            could be implemented on a step-by-step basis perhaps through\n            ministerial decrees. Operational manuals for projects in a\n            fragile implementation environment with high staff turnover\n            need to be more detailed than usual in order to maintain\n            implementation momentum. The manual should address the\n            details of responsibilities of various implementation\n            entities involved, processes, procedures, sequencing of\n            operational steps, needed clearances, coordination\n            mechanisms, etc. Simplicity and clarity of project design\n            and goals, taking truly into account Government ownership\n            and local institutional capacity, showed once again to be\n            critical for satisfactory outcomes. Development of the\n            internal capacity to prepare and formulate a sector strategy\n            and required policies requires the recruitment of new staff\n            with the requisite skills along with building the capacity\n            of existing staff and providing them exposure to policy issues."}, "docdt": "2010-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
