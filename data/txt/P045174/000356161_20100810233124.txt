I.       PROGRAM CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

 1.1     CONTEXT AT APPRAISAL

 1.       In spite of Lebanon's initial recovery from the effects of the 1975-90 civil conflict, profound
 challenges remained. Lebanon continued to face external hostilities and interference that set back the
 reconstruction effort. More importantly, perhaps, internal political conflict persisted to the extent that it
 established an environment of continued uncertainty and fragility which hindered the ability of
 institutions to function properly; the country suffered from the lack of a systematic institutional decision-
 making process. Efforts to rebuild the civil service were launched in 1993 with Bank support but could
 not gain traction; implementation experience revealed that the country was not politically ready for, or
 institutionally capable of, comprehensive reform efforts. Such was the context and working environment
 at project Appraisal, and indeed this context persevered all through the implementation period and the
 time of ICR preparation. The project and the ICR should be viewed within a post-conflict context which
 renders institutional capacity quite fragile ­ a view also expressed by QAG in its QSA-5 report on the
 Project in 2002.

 2.      Restoring basic infrastructure services proved to take more time, effort, and financial resources
 than initially envisaged. Restoring social services proved to be even more complicated. The immediate
 post-conflict priority of the Government in the education sector was the reconstruction and rehabilitation
 of damaged public schools, mainly under the leadership of the Council for Development and
 Reconstruction (CDR) that had rehabilitated or rebuilt 370 school facilities between 1992 and 1997.
 Within that period, the Education Center for Research and Development (ECRD)--an autonomous entity
 under the aegis of the Minister of Education in charge of pedagogic development, teacher training,
 developing evaluation tools, and education data collection--issued the Plan for Educational Reform in
 Lebanon, as well as reformed curricula, and produced new textbooks.

 3.      A steady decline in growth and incomes during the second half of the 1990s resulted in migration
 of students from private to public schools ­ against traditional norms. More than two thirds of Lebanese
 students were enrolled in private schools at the time. The Government increased its efforts to improve
 education quality in public schools and convened the First National Conference on Education in 1996
 which identified the main challenges facing the sector to be (i) weak institutional capacity, and (ii) low
 quality and efficiency. The Bank was asked to assist Government efforts in this sector in 1997. The
 Education Development Project (EDP) ­ originally the General Education Project (GEP) - was prepared
 during 1998-2000 and became effective in late 2000.

 4.      The goals of the project were in line with a strategic focus of the 1997 Lebanon CAS - to upgrade
 the human resource base by, inter alia, focusing on basic education, with a particular emphasis on
 improving quality and on supporting further expansion. Project preparation benefited from a sector Public
 Expenditure Review (PER) prepared in 1998, and several background studies on teaching staff issues and
 obstacles to school attendance that were undertaken during project preparation. The previous Bank
 operation in general education in Lebanon dated back to the early 1970s.

 1.2     ORIGINAL PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES (PDO)

 5.     The original development objectives of the GEP were to enhance the capacity of the Ministry of
 National Education, Youth and Sport (MNEYS, became the Ministry of Education and Higher Education
 in 2002 - MEHE) to function as an effective manager of the education sector; and (ii) restore the



                                                      1
credibility of the public education system through improvements in quality and efficiency, and increased
access. Key Indicators were:

      a. Management and institutional development: (i) the reorganization of the MNEYS in line with
         functional responsibilities; (ii) the availability of accurate and timely annual education data; and
         (iii) the development, dissemination, and implementation of a national, long-term education
         strategy.
      b. Quality: (i) an increase in completion rates at grades 6 and 9; and (ii) the narrowing of the gap in
         learning achievements between public and private schools.

1.3       REVISED PDO

6.      Implementation experience during 2000-2003, and political realities, demonstrated that the
project scope and design were beyond the capacity of current institutions to implement. The project was
thus simplified to prepare for, rather than implement, reforms as originally envisaged. The Bank's
Executive Board approved the restructuring on May 17, 2004, with the same loan amount, cancelled the
second phase of school construction, but expanded the scope of the project to include the VTE sub-sector
and incorporated some components from the separate Vocational and Technical Education project that
closed at the end of 2003. The project name was thus changed from General Education Project to
Education Development Project.

7.       VTE activities were incorporated at the strong request of an incoming Minister for a chance to
implement reforms in the VTE sub-sector as well. Bank management had decided not to extend the VTE
project beyond December 2003 upon review of the portfolio, Project compliance with loan conditions,
and "assessment of the fragility of the institutional environment". The incoming Minister, at the time of
restructuring in early 2004, stressed the adverse impact of this Bank decision on the ability of the
Government to mobilize support from other donors to this sector and on the morale of VTE staff, and
asked to incorporate some activities from the closed VTE project into the restructured GEP project. Based
on demonstrated improvements in GEP implementation, the Bank obliged the incoming Minister's
request.

8.      The revised PDO, as stated in the Agreement Amending the Loan Agreement dated June 9, 2004,
was "to assist the Borrower in building the knowledge base, analytical tools and the institutional capacity
required to initiate reform of the general and vocational education systems in the Borrower's territory
while also enhancing access through a modest program of school construction in priority areas of need."

9.        Key indicators were revised as follows:
      ·   MEHE has completed an integrated program of policy formulation, and ratified the elements of
          an education sector reform program.
      ·   Statistical information is available to enable the efficiency and effectiveness of the education
          system to be monitored on a real time basis.
      ·   Resource flows within the general education and vocational streams have been documented and
          mechanisms developed for equitable resource allocation.
      ·   A process of organizational strengthening, and staff development has been completed.

1.4       MAIN BENEFICIARIES

10.      The project originally targeted the following beneficiaries: (a) 20,000 primary and secondary
pupils to benefit from extended or newly constructed schools each year; (b) 130,000 pupils (45 percent of
enrollments) to benefit from the introduction of new technologies in secondary schools; (c) 20,000


                                                      2
teachers (50 percent of total) to benefit from in-service training in the public sector and 2,000 in the
private subsidized sector; (d) an estimated 25,000 new pupils migrating each year from private to public
schools, who tend to be from poorer households; (e) 4,000 pupils to participate in a pilot experiment; and
(f) 2,000 administrative staff to benefit from professional development schemes. In the long term, the
project aimed to revamp the quality of education in public schools, target the public education funding
system towards poorer households, and ultimately overhaul public institutions in charge of the education
sector. Upon restructuring, the project focused on preparing the analytical tools and institutional capacity
needed to implement reforms and did not specify such information.

                                                              5
1.6     REVISED COMPONENTS

11.     The project was reorganized into four new project components, with added works, goods, and
consulting services in the VTE domain as follows:

        Part A: Policy Planning and Information Management

  (i)   Preparation of a National Education Strategy (NES) which: (i) sets forth objectives, activities and
        an implementation plan for an initial three-year period; and (ii) addresses the reform of both the
        general and vocational education streams in an integrated manner.
  (ii) (a) Development of EMIS within the Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MEHE) and
       the establishment of the Information Management Unit (IMU) within MEHE. (b) Provision of
       computer equipment for this Part A.2 (a) of the Project.
  (iii) Completion of a study of the financing of the general and vocational education streams to: (i)
        identify and document all monetary and non-monetary flows; and (ii) enable effective and
        sustainable resource allocation strategies to be formulated.
  (iv) Completion of a study to assess the organizational structure and capacity of those agencies
       responsible for the administration of general and vocational education to determine the readiness
       and ability of the said agencies to implement a reform program arising from the preparation of an
       integrated sector strategy.

        Part B: Strengthening of School Leadership. Pedagogical Capacity and Assessment of
        Academic Achievement

  (i)   Carrying out a program of leadership development for school principals and directors of training
        centers to: (i) improve their leadership, motivational and management skills; and (ii) enhance
        their understanding of international trends in competency based and contextualized learning.
  (ii) Completion of a program of teacher/instructor training to develop the pedagogical, information
       communication technology (ICT) or occupational skills required for the effective implementation
       of an education reform program.
  (iii) Completion of a study to review the processes for assessment of academic achievement for the
        general education stream and the establishment of databanks for the storage of electronic images,
        learning products and examination questions for general and vocational education.

        Part C: Upgrading Education Facilities

  (i)   Carrying out a program to upgrade public education facilities, including the construction,
        furnishing and equipping of eleven (11) new public schools in areas of priority need.
  (ii) Acquisition of essential equipment for VTE laboratories and workshops.
  (iii) Establishment of core ICT infrastructure to enable effective operation of EMIS.

        Part D: Project Management

  (i)  Establishment and operation of PMU to manage the carrying out of Project activities associated
       with general education and vocational education streams.
  (ii) Acquisition of equipment, and the provision of consultant services, training and other necessary
       items of support for this Part D of the Project.



                                                    6
1.7     OTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

12.      Clear implementation momentum emerged upon project restructuring in the general education
sub-sector. However, several attempts to start implementation of VTE activities (incorporated upon
restructuring) demonstrated that institutional weaknesses and lack of decision-making in the VTE sub-
sector were not surmountable. Following recommendations of the December 2005 Country Portfolio
Performance Review (CPPR), the Government and the Bank agreed (as approved by the Country Director
on June 21, 2006) to cancel some (mainly equipment procurement) VTE activities under the project and
the corresponding loan amounts. The project loan thus decreased from US$56.57 million to US$44.58
million. Development Objectives were not formally changed to reflect this development.

13.     The project closing date was extended for two years, from December 31, 2005 to December 31,
2007, at the time of restructuring during which implementation momentum picked up noticeably.
Commitments reached 75% of the loan amount in early 2007. Based on implementation results, and to
allow for complete delivery of project outputs, the closing date was further extended, first to December
31, 2008, then again to December 31, 2009.

II.     KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

14.      Lebanon is well known for its rich human capital base and has demonstrated its ability to
mobilize financial resources when needed to realize its development potential. However, Lebanon
continues to suffer from the impact of old and new, security and political, external and internal conflicts
long after the civil war officially ended in 1990. The social, political, and security environment that
prevailed all through EDP preparation and implementation was effectively one of conflict and/or post-
conflict even though Lebanon is not officially classified by the Bank as such for operational purposes.
Protracted and repeated conflicts in the country established an environment of sustained fragility in the
sense that institutions could not adhere to a systematic decision making process shielded from political
and private interests. Furthermore, the political dynamic of the country continued to get increasingly
complicated which exacerbated a prevailing sense of security, social, and economic instability. Broader
civil service and administrative reforms, needed to provide a context for and institutional support to
needed sector reforms, were attempted in the mid 1990s - after the civil war ended - with World Bank
support but failed to gain traction. This is the context within which implementation effort and outcomes
should be viewed and assessed.

2.1     PROJECT PREPARATION, DESIGN AND QUALITY AT ENTRY

15.      Project preparation built upon Government initiatives to enhance sector performance, including
the First National Conference on Education in 1996 and a National Committee created by the Minister of
Education in 1999 to prepare the foundation for a comprehensive education sector strategy. Preparation
efforts benefited from a Japan Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) preparation fund
managed by ECRD and followed a highly participatory approach with a wide array of stakeholders.
Background analytical studies included a sector PER prepared in 1998, several "high-quality studies on
critical issues," and two series of case studies that were produced in preparation of the project. The
project team benefited from the ongoing implementation experience of various UN agencies.

16.      Project design was too ambitious and complex given the weak institutional capacity of MNEYS
and the unstable political environment of the country which precluded major reforms in any sector. Those
realities were clearly articulated in the PAD as follows:




                                                    7
      ·   "The challenges facing public administration in general, and the public education sector (the most
          vulnerable sector) in particular, cannot be overcome through a single operation. This is especially
          true given the fact that the capacity of the education administration is still more part of the
          problem than part of the solution. Therefore, the project should be viewed as the first in a series
          of operations."

      ·   "Other aspects of the political and economic life (e.g., civil service) will have to change and
          improve in order to make sustained change possible in the education sector."

17.      Despite this clear assessment, the project team nevertheless chose "to attack on several fronts
(rather than) focus on prioritized issues", as stated in the PAD, based on the view that "Rehabilitating a
devastated education sector cannot be undertaken by targeting only selected aspects; it requires action at
several levels, on several functions, and with the involvement of several actors." ICR interviews revealed
that the Project Preparation Team decided to pursue such a high-risk approach based on Government
Legislative and Executive encouragement to do so. The Team made this choice upon (i) direct dialogue
with the Education Committee of the Members of Parliament who expressed strong support to timely,
comprehensive sector reforms, and (ii) timely creation by the Minister of Education, during project
preparation, of a National Committee to facilitate speedy completion and adoption of the NES.
Furthermore, as noted in previous CAS Completion Reports, some Bank projects prepared during the
same period were encouraged by the Prime Minister at the time, himself a very dedicated person with
extremely ambitious reconstruction and development plans for the country, to be very ambitious.

18.      A Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA5) dated October 15, 2002 made the following
statement as regards project design: "The project underestimated the severe weakness in the institutional
and organization framework and the complexity of the political and decision-making system." It added:
"This project falls somewhere between a post-conflict operation and a regular sector investment
operation." Project design incorporated phasing, sequencing, and experimentation mechanisms as
mitigation measures against inherent risks to such a comprehensive approach and to low institutional
capacity. These mitigation measures were not adequate or sufficient to address institutional weaknesses
identified by the Project Team.

19.     Another clear element of complexity--also noted in the PAD--is the involvement of various
agencies in project implementation, namely MNEYS, ECRD, CDR, and the Pedagogic Inspectorate. The
PAD acknowledged the risk that each of those agencies could pursue a different approach to implement
adopted measures and rated it Moderate; the PAD also acknowledged the risk of cooperation among them
and rated it Substantial. Those risks were to be mitigated by preparing Memorandums of Understanding
(MOU) clarifying respective roles, responsibilities, and coordination mechanisms to be signed by all
those agencies. Implementing agencies could not agree on their respective roles which proved to be one
of the main impediments to effective goods and works procurement; MOUs were not signed despite
repeated Bank follow-up.

2.2       IMPLEMENTATION

20.     Government effort to implement the project was not apparent prior to restructuring. Appointment
of a new minister somewhat reticent about the project just after project effectiveness (as noted in QSA5)
did not help. Implementation Progress rating was downgraded to Unsatisfactory in June 2002. Decision-
making and implementation efforts marginally improved following a proactive suggestion by the Bank's
Task Team to establish: (i) an Executive Committee to facilitate and support strategic decision-making by
the Minister; and (ii) a Coordinators Forum for heads of project sub-components to share implementation
experience.



                                                      8
21.      The QSA5 (which took place prior to restructuring) reported that supervision efforts by the Bank
Team were intensive, opportunistic, focused on problem solving and entailed a substantial amount of
technical assistance and capacity building; it also highlighted the need for realistic project ratings. The
Assessment recommended that greater efforts be made to prioritize and streamline activities, and to gain
more insights into political economy issues. The Panel reached the judgment that Bank supervision during
the reviewed period was Satisfactory. The Team did act upon the recommendations of the QSA5.
22.      By the time of the planned Mid-Term Review in 2003, and under a new Minister who focused on
moving the project forward, the case for project restructuring was strongly advocated by the Bank Team.
Project implementation effectively started after restructuring in 2004, then slowed down following
political upheaval in 2005, after which it was back on track and performed very well until project closing.
Implementation Progress maintained a Satisfactory rating since June 2006.
23.      Following restructuring, implementation momentum was impressively maintained despite
political, social, and security turmoil that started with the assassination of the Prime Minister in early
2005, military conflict with Israel in summer 2006, followed by an internal political stale mate and
paralysis in Parliament and the Council of Ministers for three years (through 2009), along with an internal
military clash in May 2008, Presidential and Parliamentary elections in 2009, and uncertainty surrounding
delayed formation of a new Cabinet through the end of 2009. Maintaining implementation efforts and
showing good results under such circumstances reflects strong ownership, dedication, and courage by all
Government officials involved in project implementation and by members of the Bank team.


24.       Three implementation issues were notable during the post-restructuring phase:
      -   First, implementation of VTE activities added to the project upon restructuring was not possible.
          Aide memoires following restructuring noted the lack of readiness of the former VTE PMU
          Director to provide constructive support and share information, and eventually reported that it
          became progressively apparent to the Project Team that institutional weaknesses, lack of clear
          policy direction, lack of strategic priorities, and lack of transparency of decision-making
          prevented the Project Team from allocating additional efforts to VTE activities. The new Minister
          who requested incorporation of VTE activities at the time of restructuring was changed before he
          was able to show VTE implementation results as he did with the general education sector.
          Following a Country Portfolio Performance Review in December 2005, the Government and the
          Bank agreed to cancel VTE components from the loan (mainly acquisition of equipment), and
          project legal agreements were amended accordingly; however, there was no (second) formal
          restructuring of the project to take into account cancellation of VTE activities. Still, analytical
          outputs of the project (namely the NES, Sector Financing study, and Organization Development
          study of MEHE) did cover the VTE sector.
      -   Second, implementation of construction activities under CDR gained momentum following
          restructuring, but proved to be short-lived. CDR rules and procedures seem to have evolved in a
          manner that defeats the purpose of facilitating effective implementation of re/construction
          activities (as noted in the PAD and later in the QSA5). Agreement on the scope of CDR
          responsibilities under the project could not be reached. Implementation of a relatively small
          construction program under EDP would understandably become of secondary importance to CDR
          once major emergency reconstruction activities resulting from summer 2006 hostilities were
          launched.
      -   Third, effective implementation of a comprehensive set of EDP IT components seemed to
          require specific skills that were not easily developed by a PMU during the normal course of
          project implementation. Protracted delays in establishing and staffing a dedicated IT unit within
          the Ministry, delays in decisions on recruitment of needed PMU staff, and high IT staff turn-over


                                                      9
        within the PMU delayed implementation of IT activities and prevented IT outputs from being
        fully operational before project closing.


2.3     MONITORING AND EVALUATION

25.      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) efforts under the project, both at inception and at
restructuring, focused on monitoring implementation progress and reporting outcomes. This was deemed
necessary by the Task Team at the time in order to support the generation of an implementation
momentum and to facilitate coordination and horizontal integration among sub-components. Once
implementation momentum picked up, the Task Team planned to build the PMU capacity to monitor
outcomes and impact.

26.      A detailed Project Implementation Plan was finalized during project preparation and ready to be
used for output monitoring purposes. The monitoring system relied on accounting and project scheduling
software. Task Team efforts in this domain were reflected in Project Aide Memoires that consistently
showed detailed, updated implementation plans. Following project restructuring, a Planning, Monitoring
and Evaluation Specialist was hired by the PMU who revised the Project Implementation Plan, prepared a
Project Implementation Manual, and integrated those documents with the Project Procurement Plan. The
restructuring follow-up mission of June 2004 focused on developing those implementation tools.

27.    Once implementation momentum took hold, an international expert joined the Task Team and
produced a report to help evolve existing M&E systems towards capturing outcomes. Unfortunately,
PMU staff turnover and delays in recruitment prevented further progress. The ICR mission advised and
worked with PMU staff to try to report some project outcomes and impact; these are presented in a table
under Section VI of Annex 7.

2.4   SAFEGUARD AND FIDUCIARY COMPLIANCE

28.     Safeguards compliance was satisfactory during implementation. There were no significant
environmental or social safeguards issues reported in project Aide Memoires. Procurement and Financial
Management generally posed no significant risks during implementation except towards the end of the
project when CDR was not able to timely address arising construction and goods procurement issues and
when the PMU was not able to introduce a fixed-asset management system that could record equipment
and furniture procured under the project in an institutional and sustainable manner.

29.      Adequate attention was given to capacity building in the fiduciary domain during
implementation, and arising issues were addressed with effective assistance from the Bank. Procurement
rules were simplified at the time of restructuring to facilitate selection of consultants and provision of
training, procurement followed World Bank rules, and two Procurement Post-Review reports prepared in
June 2005 and January 2010 confirm the above findings. Financial Management of the project was also
simplified in the early implementation stages based on observed implementation capacity, and continued
to be satisfactory during implementation. Internal controls were reported to be adequate except towards
the end of the project as noted in the paragraph above.

2.5   POST-COMPLETION OPERATION/NEXT PHASE

30.     Towards the end of the project, the Minister of Education officially asked the Bank to identify
resources for a program of transitional support to EDP in order to maintain implementation momentum,
and to initiate a second phase of the education sector reform program. The October 2009 aide memoire
confirms that US$1 million out of the US$6 million Second Emergency Social Protection and


                                                   10
 Implementation Support Program (TF092582) was available for this purpose. Transition arrangements
 were in place, for example, to render some of the IT-related outputs delivered under the project fully
 operational. A new education project, Education Reform for Quality Schools, was scheduled for
 Appraisal in early FY11.

 31.      ICR discussions with Ministry officials and PMU staff, stakeholders, and Bank staff after project
 closing confirm that EDP outputs are being utilized. Most notably, the new Minister of Education pursued
 a systematic political process to ensure political ownership of the Strategy by various stakeholders, which
 resulted in formal adoption of the Strategy by the Council of Ministers in April 2010. Following on this
 critical achievement, legal documents needed to implement the recommendations of the MEHE
 Organization Development study were being finalized. The Central Data Repository component of EMIS
 was being utilized for some administrative functions utilizing 2002-2008 data.

III.     ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

 3.1     RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES, DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION

 32.      Project objectives remain very relevant to the development priorities of the country. The objective
 of the 2005 CAS is to help Lebanon build its public institutions to transition out of its current macro-
 economic imbalances, to address the social and environmental implications of the transition in an
 equitable fashion, and to lay the foundations for job creation and growth. The project mainly focused on
 institutional development in a sector that was known for its weak institutional capacity ­ as reported in
 the PAD.

 33.     Human capital development was one of the pillars of the 2005 CAS which was reiterated in the
 2007 Interim Strategy Note. The project directly supported this pillar by strengthening capacity, both at
 the Ministry and school level, to enhance the quality of public education services in the country. The
 project also enhanced access to education in targeted areas. Furthermore, project analytical outputs (NES
 and the Sector Financing study) were utilized by the authorities in 2007 to prepare a set of priority
 measures and actions to be taken in the education sector which were discussed at the Paris III donor
 conference.

 34.      The country continued to be in a fragile and uncertain environment that limited the ability of
 institutions to develop and function properly. The focus of the restructured project on providing assistance
 to prepare the needed tools and instruments for sector policy formulation and implementation proved to
 be necessary and adequate given local institutional capacity to prepare for sector reforms.

 3.2     ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES

 35.    Original PDOs of the project were not achieved. The Ministry did not have the tools and
 instruments needed to become an `effective manager of the education sector'. The original Key Indicators
 became irrelevant after restructuring.

 36.     The EDP achieved to a large extent the revised PDOs of building the knowledge and capacity
 required to initiate sector reforms and completing a modest school construction program. Annex 2
 presents in more detail the outputs achieved under the restructured project components. An important
 exception here is that some activities in the VTE sub-sector that were added at the time of restructuring
 were not implemented (due to Government internal reasons as explained in paragraph 23 above) and later
 dropped. N                                                     were achieved as follows:



                                                     11
·     The National Education Strategy was delivered and adopted by the Council of Ministers soon after
      project closing. ESDS, which developed basic planning and policy capacity, was institutionalized
      within MEHE.

·     The Organization Development study for MEHE was delivered and agreed upon among key officials.
      Draft laws to effect this organization change started to be finalized upon adoption of the NES by the
      Council of Ministers to be presented to Parliament.

·     A comprehensive study on education sector financing was delivered along with the requisite capacity
      to formulate and assess alternative financing scenarios and mechanisms.

·     EMIS and school IT connectivity components and activities were delivered and were partially
      operational by project closing; transitional arrangements were in place to render them fully
      operational.

·     Various IT tools and systems for education achievement assessment were operational in several
      domains rendering assessments more efficient and transparent.

·     Programs to empower school Principals and enhance the capacity of teachers were delivered with
      high demonstration effect stemming from the positive impact of empowering school officials on
      learning outcomes and school management.
·     The (revised, smaller) general education school construction program, and related equipment and
      furniture, were delivered.

3.3       EFFICIENCY

37.      The original loan amount of US$56.6 million was not changed at the time of restructuring when
the second phase of school construction was cancelled and some activities in the VTE domain were
added. The loan amount was reduced to US$44.6 million when some activities in the VTE sub-sector
(mainly equipment procurement) were cancelled. Total disbursements amounted to US$42.6 million. As
the project is mainly geared towards preparing the analytical basis and building the institutional capacity
to initiate reforms, no attempt is made to calculate economic or financial rates of return on project
investments.

38.      The Government's School Construction Technical Audit presented detailed data on school
construction and concluded that the quality of construction is generally good or acceptable. It noted that
average construction cost per square meter increased by 40 percent compared to original estimates, and
lists several reasons for that including higher construction materials prices that soared concurrently with
energy prices during the construction period. The Audit also noted that equipment procured under the
project for schools such as water treatment equipment, water pumps, electricity generators, boilers, etc.,
were often over-dimensioned.

3.4     JUSTIFICATION OF OVERALL OUTCOME RATINGS

Rating: Marginally Unsatisfactory

39.     Following the ICR Guidelines on outcome ratings for projects with formally restructured PDOs,
the Overall Outcome Rating is based on combined pre and post restructuring ratings weighted by the
respective disbursement ratios net of any cancellation. In this case, disbursements pre-restructuring were
around 5 percent only of the loan amount and thus do not materially affect ratings.


                                                     12
40.      Outcome is rated Unsatisfactory against the original PDOs ­ which became not applicable upon
restructuring.

41.      Outcome is rated Marginally Unsatisfactory against the revised PDOs.

42.     Outcomes post-restructuring are quite encouraging based on the following considerations: (i) the
core aim to develop the necessary tools to prepare and implement reforms was fully achieved, especially
after formal Government adoption of the Sector Strategy in April 2010; (ii) the high impact of the
Leadership Development component on performance of school Principals and the positive demonstration
effect of the impact of empowerment at the school level; (iii) evolution and institutionalization of the
PMU within the Ministry as the ESDS; and (iv) outputs were delivered under a truly challenging
environment.

43.      However, some components were not achieved (VTE activities) or fully operational (IT related
activities) by project closing. The project was extended for four years causing significant delays in
delivering its outputs and outcomes. More specifically, there were: (i) minor shortcomings in ensuring IT-
related components (EMIS, school connectivity, assessment of achievement) were fully operational by
project closing; (ii) moderate shortcomings in building the PMU and MEHE's institutional capacity due
to high staff turnover and delays in recruitment; and (iii) significant delays in implementation of the
construction component. While some VTE activities, mainly related to equipment procurement, were
cancelled, core analytical and policy-oriented activities of the project (NES, Sector Financing framework,
Organization Development of MEHE) did address related issues in the VTE sub-sector which is why the
Project Team believed there is no need for another formal project restructuring after some VTE activities
(not directly related to core sector policy issues or directly impacting PDOs) were cancelled.

3.5      OVERALL THEMES, OTHER OUTCOMES AND IMPACTS

      (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

44.      A pillar of the 2005 CAS is human capital development in order to help mitigate the poverty and
adverse social impacts of significant macroeconomic imbalances. This project aimed at preparing for
sector reforms that would eventually improve learning achievement for students in public schools ­ who
are traditionally from lower income families ­ so that they could better capitalize on available job
opportunities. In addition, the school construction component directly targeted areas of higher demand for
public schools when parents in those areas were not able to afford private tuition due to deteriorating
economic conditions. There were no direct gender activities under the project; the PAD reported that
gender disparities in the education sector were low at all levels.

      (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

45.     The EDP achieved a few critical results in this domain given the continuously fragile and
uncertain environment in the country which hinders the ability of institutions to function properly:

      (a) Development of policy and planning capacity within MEHE: The PMU developed some policy,
          planning, and IT capacity during EDP implementation, evolved to become the ESDS, and was
          institutionalized within MEHE. The Ministry was not structured or staffed to perform such
          functions before EDP was implemented. ESDS will have a significant role in implementing the
          NES after it was adopted by the Council of Ministers, and will have a key role in preparing and
          delivering the new Bank follow-up project.



                                                    13
      (b) Development of leadership at the school level: This program was delivered with good impact on
          student achievement and school management, and prepared over-achieving Principals to guide
          and assist others. This is especially important in a fragile environment like Lebanon's where
          officials at the school level would be called upon to exercise leadership and take initiatives to
          complement efforts by Ministry officials.
      (c) Development of coordination mechanisms among implementing agencies: The Task Team
          assisted the creation and functioning of an Executive Committee, under a Minister who was
          reticent about collaboration with the Bank, to facilitate and support timely decision-making and
          coordinate implementation efforts at the top level. This approach proved extremely helpful in
          maintaining implementation efforts during frequent Ministerial transitions, and also quite
          effective while it was adopted under the school construction component managed by CDR.


      (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

46.    The Government and the Bank were proactive and opportunistic in utilizing project outputs
beyond project scope as follows:

      ·   At the request of the Government, assistance was provided under the project to assess the damage
          to schools resulting from the 2006 hostilities thus providing the basis for donor assistance to
          emergency school reconstruction and rehabilitation.
      ·   EDP analytical outputs (National Education Strategy, Sector Financing study) were used to
          prepare the education component of the Economic and Social Impact Assessment needed to
          coordinate donor assistance.
      ·   Technical assistance was provided to MEHE to utilize the outputs of the Education Financing
          Study to prepare a performance-based budget framework for the period 2009-11 in cooperation
          with the Ministry of Finance.

IV.       ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

Overall risk to development outcomes is Moderate.

47.      Lebanon continues to suffer from an uncertain political environment and fragile institutions
which poses significant risks to development outcomes of the EDP. However, encouraging signs and
results have emerged which would mitigate existing risks to some extent and improve the sustainability of
results achieved. Specifically:

      ·   The Government formally asked the Bank to put in place transitional arrangements and prepare a
          follow-up operation well before project closing in late 2009 in order to maintain implementation
          momentum. This request reflected Government commitment to maintain implementation
          momentum and aim for reforms in the sector which has been noticeably sustained since project
          restructuring and across several Ministerial transitions.
      ·   The EDP PMU evolved into the ESDS and was institutionalized within MEHE before project
          closing which preserved policy, planning, and IT management capacities developed under EDP.
      ·   By April 2010, the Council of Ministers formally endorsed the NES following systematic
          political consultation with all parties concerned, and established a Ministerial Committee to
          prepare implementation arrangements. Lebanon did officially put in place a comprehensive




                                                     14
           strategy for the sector to anchor future reforms. This is the most important achievement of the
           EDP.
       ·   Along with NES adoption, the Council of Ministers appointed a Ministerial Committee to prepare
           for implementation of the NES. Consequently, draft legal amendments needed to implement the
           recommendations of the MEHE Organization Development study were being finalized.
       ·   The Leadership Development component resulted in significant improvements at the school level
           in terms of student achievement and school management. MEHE also developed significant
           capacity and instruments to roll-out such programs which would be supported under the follow-
           up Bank project.
       ·   Various EMIS, IT and Assessment Achievement outputs were being utilized and streamlined in
           regular MEHE operations even before becoming fully operational with good results on efficiency
           and transparency of affected processes. Transition arrangements already in place would ensure
           those outputs become fully operational and would further develop MEHE capacity to fully utilize
           those tools.
       ·   As for construction outputs, the Audit report points to the need to allocate some resources to
           address construction design issues, and to provide adequate operations and maintenance
           expenditures, in order to ensure the longevity of school construction and installed heavy
           equipment. Still, the Audit judges the quality of construction as good or acceptable.

 48.      Those important developments bode well for a sustained reform momentum in the sector. MEHE
 would need continued assistance and strengthening to be able to sustain reforms in a fragile environment
 and without a parallel, supporting program of civil service and administrative reform. The World Bank
 will timely help maintain the emerging education sector reform momentum with a follow-up education
 project scheduled for Appraisal in July 2010.

V.     ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

 5.1       BANK PERFORMANCE

 (a)       Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
           Rating: Unsatisfactory

 49.      The PAD clearly pointed to serious political and institutional capacity risks in its detailed analysis
 of existing circumstances in Lebanon at the time of project preparation. Nevertheless, the Project Team
 chose to aim at far-reaching and comprehensive sector reforms following encouragement to do so by
 officials in the Legislative and Executive branches of Government. Section 2.1 above addressed those
 issues in detail and highlighted the conclusions of QSA5 as regards Quality at Entry issues. In short, the
 above rating is based on the following specific factors:

       ·   Project design was far beyond what existing political and institutional capacity could handle.

       ·   Far too many reforms were targeted by this operation when the PAD correctly concluded that a
           series of projects was needed to implement needed reforms.
       ·   Roles and responsibilities of several agencies involved in project implementation were not agreed
           and finalized.
       ·   Measures to mitigate project design risks were not sufficient or adequate.




                                                       15
(b)       Quality of Supervision
          Rating: Satisfactory

50.      Supervision by the Bank since project launch showed sufficient understanding and flexibility to
restructure the project, address arising implementation issues, and support implementation momentum
under difficult circumstances. Continuity of several members of the Task Team is noticeable; effectively
two Task Team Leaders led the project over 10 years both located in the Country Office. Transitional
arrangements at the end of the project were orderly. The Team could have taken advantage of strong field
presence to be perhaps more forceful in addressing implementation and recruitment delays ­ yet one
needs to be mindful of the political and security turmoil during the implementation period. The above
rating is based on the following specific factors:

      ·   Bank supervision efforts were satisfactory ­ as noted in QSA5 - in the pre-restructuring period
          even when Government commitment and implementation effort were not evident. The QSA5
          rating comprised Highly Satisfactory rating for both Focus on Development Effectiveness and
          Supervision of Fiduciary and Safeguards Aspects, Satisfactory rating for Adequacy of
          Supervision Inputs and Processes, and Unsatisfactory rating for Realism of Project Performance
          Ratings ­ which turned more realistic since.
      ·   Formal project restructuring was initiated when circumstances allowed and proved to address the
          shortcomings of the initial project design; agreed procurement and FM arrangements were also
          adequately revised.
      ·   Project Implementation Plans were clear, detailed and continuously updated.
      ·   Supervision and implementation assistance took advantage of various CPPRs and adequately
          involved Country Unit Management, Sector Management, and various stakeholders.
      ·   Bank Team proactively supported decision making at the Minister level through facilitating the
          establishment of high level committees to support decision making and coordinate
          implementation efforts among various implementing agencies.
      ·   Bank assistance was readily available during outright security conflict(s) and under difficult
          political circumstances.
      ·   Bank assistance took advantage of several arising opportunities to help the Government use
          project outputs beyond the scope of the project.

51.      Bank management provided direct support to project implementation. Sector Management
relocated the two TTLs who were responsible for most of the implementation period to the field and
allocated sufficient supervision resources. Both Sector and Country Unit Management effectively
participated in periodic country portfolio reviews that provided strategic guidance to implementation
efforts, as reported in project aide memoires, and participated in the meetings of several missions. The
Bank earned the trust of the authorities in this sector and became its main development partner. CMU
Management noted that as a result of the effective working relationship with MEHE, the new education
sector planned for Appraisal in July 2011 will be the first project to be delivered under the new CPS
scheduled for Board discussion in early FY11.

(c)       Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
          Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

52.    ICR Rating Guidelines for Overall Bank Performance when Quality at Entry is Unsatisfactory
while Quality of Supervision is Satisfactory is to follow the Outcome rating (which is Marginally


                                                    16
Unsatisfactory in this case) "except when Bank performance did not significantly affect the particular
outcome". This is a case where Bank performance did not affect Outcome ratings.

53.      Outcome rating would have been better than indicated in Section 3.4 had the Government been
able to break long-standing institutional and decision-making gridlock in the VTE sector which prevented
implementation of activities in this domain that were incorporated at Government request. These were
issues well beyond the ability of the Bank or the Task Team to address. Furthermore, the Task Team
effectively addressed Quality at Entry shortcomings through a formal restructuring and adequate
implementation support that facilitated the eventual delivery of project outputs.

5.2     BORROWER PERFORMANCE

(a)     Government Performance
        Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

54.     Government performance is an issue as regards lack of ownership during the pre-restructuring
period and the inability to implement some VTE activities added to the EDP upon Government request at
the time of restructuring. Delays in appointment of needed MEHE staff to take-over project outputs and
ensure the transition of capacity from the PMU to MEHE persisted throughout the project. Clear signs of
lack of ownership during the pre-restructuring phase were reversed post-restructuring and performance
was very encouraging under several Ministerial transitions and even under unfavorable political and
security circumstances.

(b)     Implementing Agency Performance
        Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

55.      MNEYS, ECRD, CDR, and the Education Inspectorate were the implementing agencies of the
project. The PMU was originally under ECRD but was moved to MEHE around the time of project
restructuring in 2004. Implementation effort varied across agencies and over time eventually leading to
practical realization of envisaged outputs.

56.      Strong commitment by the PMU to achieve project objectives was demonstrated throughout
project implementation. Fiduciary arrangements were properly followed, the M&E system was developed
and utilized to follow-up on implementation progress, and a participatory approach that adequately
consulted stakeholders on studies prepared by the project was followed. The PMU evolved to become the
ESDS and was institutionalized within MEHE by project closing. The PMU was not able to address
delays in appointments and recruitment of key PMU staff, before and after restructuring, to address staff
turnover.

57.      Based on extensive experience in managing school and other construction activities financed by
World Bank and many other donors, CDR was given the responsibility for EDP's construction
component. Signs of increasingly complicated bureaucracy at CDR at the time of project preparation, as
noted in the PAD, eventually adversely affected implementation momentum: CDR was not able to timely
address delays in implementation of EDP construction activities, and was not able to resolve a critical
problem with a contractor. An effective coordination mechanism among CDR, PMU, and the Bank was
put in place which demonstrated good and timely results in moving construction works forward around
2005 upon project restructuring; however, this proved not sustainable following change in CDR
leadership and the need for CDR to focus on emergency reconstruction efforts following the 2006
hostilities.




                                                   17
  58.     ECRD was initially in charge of overall project coordination and housed the PMU which evolved
  from ECRD's unit that managed the PHRD project preparation grant. Based on early implementation
  experience and difficulties encountered in coordinating various implementing agencies, ECRD decided to
  re-focus its efforts on its areas of comparative advantage in the education sector and overall project
  coordination became the responsibility of the Ministry in 2002 upon a decision by the project Executive
  Committee. The PMU formally became under MEHE in 2004 around the time of project restructuring.
  ECRD was responsible for implementation of the Teacher Training and Pedagogical Development
  components which were among the components that moved well in cooperation with various stakeholders
  concerned. ECRD was also forthcoming in providing all the education data it collects within its mandate
  which allowed for practical testing and functioning of the Central Data Repository component of the
  EMIS, as confirmed by ICR interviews with ECRD, ESDS, and Bank staff.

  (c)       Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
            Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

  59.      It is very difficult to make such an assessment for this project. While major shortcomings in
  ownership, coordination, and implementation efforts were evident in the early stages of implementation, a
  remarkable turnaround was quite apparent in (Government and implementing agencies) performance in
  the post restructuring period which made it possible to realize project outputs to a large extent and take
  advantage of arising opportunities to try to implement reforms. The Borrower certainly earned a better
  overall rating for its post restructuring performance than the rating given above; however, the rating has
  to cover the implementation experience during both pre- and post-restructuring periods.

VI.     LESSONS LEARNED

  60.      There are two sets of issues and thus lessons learned emerging from implementation of this
  project. One relates to preparation and implementation of projects within a fragile and highly uncertain
  environment like that of Lebanon; the Lebanon CAS emphasizes `transition' aspects perhaps to stress
  continuously evolving circumstances in the country. The other relates to implementation of education
  sector reforms in general.

  61.     As noted in the QSA5 report, protracted conflict in a country does affect institutional decision-
  making processes and inhibits the emergence of a culture of collaboration and coordination among
  various entities. In this regard, implementation experience of the EDP points to the following:

        ·   A separate political consensus process is needed, after proposed reforms are ready, to explicitly
            address political sensitivities and develop political ownership. Technical and professional
            consultations on proposed reforms are necessary but not sufficient.
        ·   A minimum degree and sufficient period of stability is needed following conflict for a country to
            develop its capacity to prepare, adopt, and implement sector-wide or far-reaching reforms. Until
            that capacity is in place, targeted reforms could be implemented on a step-by-step basis perhaps
            through ministerial decrees.
        ·   Establishment and continuous functioning of a high level committee, including all heads of
            agencies involved in project implementation, with direct Bank assistance, proved helpful to: (i)
            facilitate decision making at the top level; (ii) coordinate implementation efforts; and (iii)
            maintain implementation momentum through frequent ministerial transitions.
        ·   Dedicated emergency reconstruction Government entities, like CDR in Lebanon, might not be
            able to accord the same urgency to implement components of smaller, less urgent projects.
            Projects that choose to tap into the comparative advantage of such entities should (i) provide


                                                       18
        dedicated staff from project resources to work with the staff of those specialized entities, and (ii)
        agree with those entities during project preparation to allocate sufficient staff and resources to
        implement the agreed components.

    ·   Operational manuals for projects in a fragile implementation environment with high staff turnover
        need to be more detailed than usual in order to maintain implementation momentum. The manual
        should address the details of responsibilities of various implementation entities involved,
        processes, procedures, sequencing of operational steps, needed clearances, coordination
        mechanisms, etc. as well as set timeframes for various steps.

62.     This Project, upon restructuring, focused on preparation of the needed foundations to effect sector
reforms. Lessons of implementation experience point to the following:

    ·   Simplicity and clarity of project design and goals, taking truly into account Government
        ownership and local institutional capacity, showed once again to be critical for satisfactory
        outcomes. Task Teams should be realistic in setting goals, and should not abandon the
        conclusions of assessments they make during project preparation.
    ·   Development of the internal capacity to prepare and formulate a sector strategy and required
        policies requires the recruitment of new staff with the requisite skills along with building the
        capacity of existing staff and providing them exposure to policy issues. As noted in the PAD,
        there was an absence of central regulatory and policy-setting functions (and skills) in MNEYS
        that EDP tried to address.
    ·   Effective implementation of comprehensive EMIS/IT components requires timely recruitment
        and continuity of a sufficient number of suitable staff - both at the PMU and the Ministry - to
        ensure outputs are delivered, fully operational by project closing, and to ensure requisite internal
        capacity is developed in the Ministry.

A-1       National Education Strategy

Expected Output
1.      "A national education sector strategy for Lebanon has been prepared and endorsed by the
Council of Ministers. The strategy includes a policy framework together with a series of enabling
objectives for the general and vocation education streams. Each objective is supported by an identified
action plan with lead responsibility assigned for implementation of all activities."
Implementation Summary and Level of Completion
2.       The Lebanese Association for Educational Studies (LAES) was contracted under the Project to
prepare the NES. Following an extensive process of situational analysis and consultation with all
stakeholder groups, LAES delivered a "National Education Strategy" that includes vision and mission
statements for the Ministry, followed by detailed strategies and objectives for sector development under
the following themes: (i) education available on the basis of equal opportunity; (ii) quality education that
contributes to building a knowledge society; (iii) education that contributes to social integration; and, (iv)
education that contributes to economic development.

3.      The output was satisfactorily achieved by project closing except for endorsement by the Council
of Ministers ­ the Cabinet was not functional and practically did not meet during 2006-2009. Following
Presidential and Parliamentary elections in 2009 and formation of a new Cabinet in late 2009, the
incoming Minister pursued a systematic, comprehensive political consultation process in early 2010
which did lead to formal adoption of the Strategy by the Cabinet in April 2010.

A-2       Education Management Information System

Expected Output
4.      "An Education Management Information System (EMIS) has been established at MEHE, together
with an Information Management Unit (IMU) and a program of end-user training. The EMIS is an
integrated system that has been designed to meet the specific information needs of the general education
and vocational education streams. A School Information System (SIS), linked to the EMIS, is in place to
support information needs at the individual school level."
Implementation Summary and Level of Completion
5.      EMIS components were delivered but not fully operational for use by the Ministry. The EMIS
includes multiple elements:

         i.  Business Processes: The initial EMIS needs assessment reviewed existing processes and
             provided recommendations for improvements to allow efficient utilization of new
             technologies including necessary institutional support mechanisms. Project transition
             arrangements provide for a review of regulations and adaptation of processes to allow for
             streamlined use of the EMIS in the day-to-day administrative running of the Ministry.
      ii. School Information System: The SIS serves both school level requirements (i.e., student

              SIS software package was developed, equipment was delivered to all schools in Lebanon,
              relevant staff was trained, but SIS is operational in less than 10% of schools in Lebanon.
      iii. Training of Human Resources: As part of the EMIS consultant's contract, training was
              delivered to all concerned staff and departments in MEHE on the EMIS modules.
      iv. Infrastructure: Significant progress was made in provision of personal computers to Ministry
              departments, networking of the headquarters building, as well as servers and related
              equipment (storage area network, etc.). One hundred schools were connected by high speed
              Internet to headquarters to allow online provision of data from schools.
      v. Institutional Mechanisms: An Information Management Unit (IMU) was to be institutionalized
              in the Ministry based on a recommendation by the Organization Development study. Staff
              turnover and difficulties in recruitment led the Ministry to fold the functions of the IMU into
              the ESDS in 2007, supposedly an interim measure.

A-3       Education System Financing

Expected Output
6.      "A comprehensive study of the financing of the general education and vocational education
streams in Lebanon has been completed. This study has identified and documented all monetary and non-
monetary resource flows within the public and private education sectors in Lebanon. Outputs from the
study would enable resource allocation strategies to be formulated in order to support universal and
equitable access goals in a sustainable manner."
Implementation Summary and Level of Completion
7.       A comprehensive situational analysis phase was completed, resulting in the identification of all
financial resource flows into and out of the sector, and the building of an econometric model designed to
enable assessment of the financial implications arising from the adoption of alternative policy options.
Using this data, series of 6 Technical Papers were prepared to assess the costs associated with teacher
distribution and rationalization, non-MEHE expenditures, student enrolment and distribution, and
budgetary adjustments associated with priority funding requirements. A Budget Circular issued by MOF
in June 2007 required the Ministry to prepare a Medium Term Expenditure Framework for the sector for
the period 2009 ­ 2011, and to initiate the adoption of a Program Based Budgeting approach. Using this
study, framework Program Based Budgets were prepared for the 2009 ­ 20011 period.

8.       The output from the Education Finance component has not only been fully achieved, but has been
significantly expanded in terms of supporting MOF policy directions towards the adoption of PBB
procedures.
A-4       Organizational Development
Expected Output

9.      "An assessment of the MEHE organizational structure and institutional capacity to implement an
education reform program based on identified national goals and objectives has been completed.
A process for organizational re-structuring has been agreed and a staff development program initiated."
Implementation Summary and Level of Completion
10.      An audit initially examined the legal, organizational and operational aspects of the Ministry then
identified many ambiguities, functional duplications, legal gaps or constraints, and internal inefficiencies.
A study was then delivered in four phases: (i) design of a recommended new organizational structure; (ii)
definition of the proposed functionality of each organizational unit; (iii) development of work flow


                                                      22
diagrams for all major functions of the ministry; and (iv) delivery of staff training. Design of the proposed
new organizational structure was undertaken in collaboration with an executive committee chaired by the
Minister which included the three Director Generals, the ECRD President, and Directors of the Primary
and Secondary Directorates. Output from this work was discussed with the Public Service Bureau to
ensure alignment with other public service reform initiatives. A new organization chart was endorsed by
the Minister, revised laws were prepared.

11.    The output of this component was mostly completed. Following adoption of the NES by the
Council of Ministers, draft laws and regulations needed to implement the recommendations of the study
were being finalized to be presented to Parliament.

Component B: Strengthening School Leadership, Pedagogical Capacity, and the Assessment of
Academic Achievement

B-1     Leadership Development

Expected Output

12.     "School Principals and Training Center Directors have completed a professional development
program designed to improve leadership, motivational, and management skills, together with improved
understanding of international trends in competency based contextualized learning. Principals and
Directors are aware of, and participants in, the development of strategic education sector reform plans."

Implementation Summary and Level of Completion

13.     Approximately 450 school principals over two phases enrolled in a Leadership Development
program consisting of direct training program at the Leadership Institute, self study of four mandatory
modules and two out of six elective modules, a practicum to formulate a school development plan for
candidates' respective schools. The 20 top achievers went on a study tour to Canada upon which they
were designated as Master Trainers for subsequent rounds of program delivery and to help with on-the-
job guidance for other principals. The expected output from this component has been fully achieved.

14.      During the course of component delivery, extensive measures have been taken to ensure
institutionalization and sustainability of the leadership development program. These include: (i)
establishment of a formal relationship with the Lebanese University to support future delivery of the
program; (ii) issuance of a Ministerial Decree institutionalizing the roles and responsibilities the Ministry,
Lebanese University Faculty of Education, and ECRD as regards program delivery; (iii) issuance of a
Ministerial Decree establishing a 15 percent salary incentive for personnel completing the Leadership
Development program, and criteria for designation of School Principals.

B-2     Teacher/Instructor Development

Expected Output

15.     "A cadre of master teachers/trainers has received training in pedagogical, occupational skills, or
ICT applications. A progressive program of upgrading for teachers/instructors has been implemented for
the general education and vocational education streams."

                                                     23
16.     A teacher development program for the general education stream was collaboratively developed
and subsequently financed by MEHE, ECRD and the Bureau de Coopération Française (later subsumed
by Agence Française de Developpement). Initially, a country wide needs assessment for teacher training
by subject and by region was prepared, and a core group of teacher trainers was developed. Six regional
training centers and 11 satellite centers were developed and equipped, and a teacher evaluation tool was
developed and applied. Each regional training center now develops annual course offerings, which is
accessed by teachers on an as needed basis. Upon request, training centers can offer training directly in
the school. During 2005-2008, 25,000 teachers participated in training, typically of three days duration.

17.     The output from the component was achieved except for VTE activities that were cancelled.

B-3     Assessment of Academic Achievement

Expected Output

18.      "Institutional arrangements for administration of the assessment of academic achievement have
been revised to enhance efficiency and consistency. Databanks for the storage of electronic images,
learning products and examination questions have been established. System users have been trained.
Pilot testing has been completed at the GE secondary and VTE levels."

Implementation Summary and Level of Completion

19.      The following systems were developed: (i) Question Bank System (QBS) housing all sample
questions to be used for generating exams; (ii) Examination Generation System (EGS) to generate the
official exams by subject, scope, and level of difficulty from QBS; and (iii) Examination Management
System (EMS) to prepare, print, and process the issuance of examinations correction sheets. All technical
and pedagogical services were delivered and were applied in 2008 and most recently in June 2009 to
administer the General Science stream of the official exams. System application revealed some
administrative and technical gaps that were covered under transitional arrangements put in place after
project closing.

Component C: Upgrading Education Facilities

C- Civil Works

Expected Output

20.     "11 new schools in priority areas have been constructed and are operational."

Implementation Summary and Level of Completion

21.      The Government's School Construction Technical Audit of October 2009 reports that the 11
project construction activities were completed and were all functioning. The Audit notes that architectural
aspects are good, quality of construction is good or acceptable, and all procured heavy equipment was
installed. It highlights some shortcomings related to higher than planned costs, low student enrollments
(Bank staff reported enrollments were as planned the year after), some detail mistakes that undermine the
rational use of some constructed spaces, roof leaks were noticed in some schools, and finally notes that
many heavy equipment installed under the project were not functioning as schools did not have the
needed budget.

               Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

I.      Development Objectives (DOs)

1.      The "Education Development Project (EDP)" started as the "General Education Project (GEP)"
subject of the Loan Agreement dated April 7 2000.
2.       The objectives of the GEP were initially set to "support the Government's ongoing efforts to: (i)
enhance the capacity of the MNEYS to function as an effective manager of the education sector; and (ii)
restore the credibility of the public education system through improvements in quality and efficiency, and
increased access."
3.      In the year 2004 a restructuring process got implemented. The PDOs were revised to read as
follows:"To enhance access and build the knowledge base and institutional capacity in MEHE that is
necessary to initiate reform of the general and vocational education systems in Lebanon."
4.    In the year 2005, the World Bank in agreement with MEHE cancelled the financing of all
components and activities related to the VTE sector.

II.     Adequacy of the objectives

5.        According to the GEP PAD, the initial GEP DOs were anchored in the overall CAS focus as
articulated in the November 1997 document which is to upgrade the human resource base by, inter alia,
focusing on the basic education with a particular emphasis on improving quality and on supporting
further expansion.

6.      The restructuring came as a response to extensive discussions with the MEHE and was endorsed
by the Ministry of Finance. The PDOs were revised to reflect the new objectives of building the necessary
capacity, knowledge base and analytical tools to initiate reform of the general and vocational and
technical education streams instead of undertaking them. The revised DOs were in line with the
Government priority to provide quality education in public schools for equity and access purposes while
maintaining consistency with the CAS goal.

III.    Design

7.      The design of the project was successful in tackling some of the major issues that were
inescapable in order to facilitate the initiation and implementation of a comprehensive plan for improving
the education system in Lebanon. These issues included the "need to (i) adopt a system-wide approach to
reform; (ii) to formulate a national policy framework for the education sector; (iii) to enhance the
administrative capacity at the school level and at the ministry level; and (iv) to introduce and boost the
use of the information technology advances to ensure an up-to-date approach to fulfilling the identified
needs".

8.       Nevertheless, the project design showed some weaknesses at different levels which were partially
addressed throughout the lifetime of the project. On the overall objective level, the AM of the 2004
restructuring mission stated that "both of the GE and VTE projects were over-designed in terms of
institutional capacity to develop and implement complex activities in the fields of policy analysis,
strategic planning, or organizational reform to achieve enhanced administrative efficiency." Thus was the
resultant need "to refocus investments from the Bank loan on building the knowledge base and
institutional readiness upon which to design an effective reform program, as opposed to engage in reform
activities themselves."



                                                   30
9.      On the components level, the design of some components showed weakness in terms of
awareness of the administrative context. More specifically, the design of the EMIS component was
stretched in and out repeatedly throughout the project lifetime1. The design and implementation methods
of the GIS were also revisited due to structural constraints and to the identification of available resources
within the governmental structure in the year 2007, which lead to major cost savings and more sustainable
implementation plans.

IV.       Implementation

10.     Having an independent agency in charge of the procurement process of major contracts and the
entailed administrative stages at this agency introduced delays to the process and jeopardized the
objectives of many projects. As a remedial action many contracts were revisited and amounts reallocated
to allow the EDP team to process the procurement of some of the main contracts.

11.      The commitment of the World Bank team and the dedication of the EDP team played a major role
in supporting MEHE during the assault period in July 2006 and during the post-conflict stage. The active
role of the World Bank in proposing and processing supportive solutions and solutions is acknowledged
in terms of its substantial positive impact on the role played by MEHE during that stage.


V.        Operational Experience

(1) "Experience gained during the implementation had identified the importance of decision-making at
the most senior level as well as the importance of horizontal mechanisms to ensure collaboration between
all stakeholders."

(2) "Experience had shown the importance and necessity of strong management and leadership skills
required in supervising and coordinating the various operational aspects of the project."

(3) The delay in recruitment of specialists to positions such as procurement, planning, monitoring and
evaluation, and economist, had major implications on the functions related to these positions and related
projects objectives.

(4) The design of large components requiring critical changes (organizational, procedural) at different
levels in a single component/project managed by a single consultant to be implemented simultaneously
was found inefficient (e.g. EMIS).

 (5) Options are available to make use of services provided by existing governmental agencies (e.g. MoD
in the case of GIS) to ensure savings in cost and sustainability of the projects, it is important to explore in-
depth available options for achieving objectives during the identification phase of the different projects.

      EMIS started as a decision support system designed to function on an underlying Central Education Database and
      Repository (CEDAR) in 2003. In 2005 it was re-designed to include, in addition to the DSS and the CEDAR, a full set of
      administrative modules aiming at the automation of the entire administrative processes within MEHE, and the needed
      hardware. The scope and design of EMIS were revisited one more time in 2007 at which point the scope was reduced again
      "to focus on the key systems required by MEHE". (Aide-Memoires World Bank Missions, April 2004, October 2006, April
      2007)

VII.      Lessons Learned

Borrower
-     The GEP/EDP was launched in the absence of an education sector development strategy that is
      officially adopted. Actually, the EDP aimed among other objectives at the development and
      endorsement of a National Education Strategy (NES). One of the internal criticisms of the EDP at its
      earlier stages was that the EDP components are designed in the absence of a strategic plan to guide
      the design and planned objectives of these components. Currently the MEHE and all related
      institutions are benefiting from the outcomes of the EDP specifically the NES to develop the
      Education Sector Development Plan.
-     The DOs of the GEP/EDP were clear yet its design was in some way complicated which reflected the
      fact the need existed to develop a better understanding of the context of MEHE during the conception
      phase of the project. This was revealed through (1) the restructuring process which repositioned the
      project on the right track; (2) the cancellation of the VTE related parts; and (3) the repetitive re-
      designing of some of the main components of the EDP.
-     The first phase of the project was challenging due to the lack of expertise in procurement following
      WB guidelines. This lead to slowness in the launching phase of the project. The EDP invested in
      building capacity in these areas, the accumulated experience allowed EDP to overcome such
      challenges and helped move the activities forward at a faster pace. This accumulated experience
      allowed the EDP team to provide MEHE with the assistance to become capable of overcoming
      obstacles when the need exists to implement projects of similar nature.

World Bank

-     The GEP/EDP faced major challenges during the launching phase of the project. The intensive
      technical assistance provided by the World Bank and the team work approach which they encouraged
      by involving team members at GEP/EDP and MEHE stakeholders in the discussions related to the
      project preparation and implementation allowed a highly efficient capacity building mechanism to
      take place. It was observed that the higher the frequency of the missions and the close collaboration
      between the bank team members with the EDP team member were the faster is the progress. This
      close and direct collaboration allows the tackling of encountered obstacles in a given activity at
      earlier stages.
