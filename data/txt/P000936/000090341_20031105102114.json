Local Government\n            Development Project for Ghana were as follows: the outcome\n            was satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was modest, the Bank and\n            the borrower performance were both satisfactory. The lessons\n            learned indicate that decentralization should form a major\n            part of the project objectives only when the Government has\n            demonstrated its commitment in practice. Projects assisted\n            by various donors should be better coordinated and\n            harmonized at the District level. Waste management equipment\n            should only be supplied to the public sector under\n            exceptional circumstances. Such equipment is not adequately\n            maintained by the public sector. Property revaluation\n            programs should only be carried out if anticipated increases\n            in revenue exceed the costs. IDA subsidies deposited into a\n            District Operations and Maintenance (O&M) account are\n            unlikely to increase the sustainability of infrastructure\n            services in the long-run. In the absence of any form of\n            performance monitoring and evaluation system in Ghana's\n            construction industry, all future urban projects should have\n            built-in mechanisms to ensure quality and efficiency of\n            construction delivery. Project implementation support to the\n            Districts should be provided by the Regional Coordinating\n            Councils (RCC). The project established four Zonal offices,\n            staffed by consultants, to provide technical assistance in\n            policy planning, knowledge transfer, and capacity building\n            to District Assembly staff. The project management teams\n            should be composed of staff with a variety of skills, to\n            include institutional, financial management and planning,\n            and not only engineering and accounting. This applies\n            especially to projects with a decentralization and local\n            government capacity building orientation. Proposed contracts\n            should be chosen with the participation of the effected\n            population and should be contained in District Assembly\n            (Das) Medium-Term Development plans. This will reduce the\n            risk that a decision made by local officials is questioned,\n            or even changed, by their successors when an\n            all-too-frequent change in the local leadership takes place.\n            Project activities involving aerial photography, mapping,\n            land valuation, and other land-related themes should be\n            implemented in collaboration with the Ministry of Lands and Forestry."}, "docdt": "2003-10-28T00:00:00Z"}
