improve basic infrastructure and services in 11 key medium\n            sized cities, to support the government's\n            decentralization program and to strengthen the technical,\n            managerial, and financial capacity of the participation\n            District Assemblies (DAs). There are two main components.\n            The first, rehabilitation and upgrading of urban\n            infrastructure and services, consists of: (a) rehabilitation\n            of existing town center roads and associated storm drains\n            plus traffic management measures; (b) upgrading of existing\n            public markets and motor parks; and (c) improvements in\n            solid waste collection and disposal and in urban sanitation.\n            DAs will also receive assistance in setting up Operation and\n            Maintenance Funds. The second component, institutional\n            strengthening, comprises: (a) the provision of technical\n            assistance, training, and equipment for capacity building of\n            the 11 DAs in the areas of management, municipal finance,\n            and engineering; and (b) strengthening of the capacity of\n            selected central government agencies to support the\n            Districts in the areas of mapping, property valuation,\n            planning, policy and training, and implementation."}, "docdt": "1994-01-18T00:00:00Z"}
