The\n            project will selectively strengthen and improve important\n            road sections with high traffic intensity to increase the\n            capacity and service life of these roads on an economically\n            viable basis. The proposed project will also address the\n            needs of the Ministry of Works with respect to improving its\n            capacity for road maintenance and traffic management.\n            Establishing effective automobile emission control\n            procedures and manpower development in the sector is also\n            part of the project as well as improved traffic management,\n            traffic safety and environmental improvement such as vehicle\n            emission control."}, "docdt": "1989-10-19T00:00:00Z"}
