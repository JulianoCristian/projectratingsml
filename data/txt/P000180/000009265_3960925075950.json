 (PCR) for the Kirimiro Rural Development Project. The\n            project aimed at: (a) assisting smallholders to improve the\n            productivity of their holdings, and thereby increase their\n            food consumption and income, through the provision of\n            inputs, the strengthening of extension services and the\n            implementation of appropriate erosion control measures; (b)\n            improving rural living conditions by building of maintaining\n            water sources, equipping social centers and developing wood\n            resources to be used as fuel wood, building poles and\n            timber; and (c) improving the quality of Burundi coffee by\n            building washing stations. The project signaled a change\n            from the Government's previous agricultural development\n            strategy. Instead of centralized governmental departments\n            being used to develop coffee production, Regional\n            Development Companies (RDCs) were to be created as\n            decentralized agencies, to be made responsible for the\n            integrated development of their respective regions\n            (foodcrops, coffee, infrastructure, erosion control). One\n            RDC was therefore set up under this project to carry out the\n            activities that had previously been the responsibility of\n            separate departments."}, "docdt": "1992-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
