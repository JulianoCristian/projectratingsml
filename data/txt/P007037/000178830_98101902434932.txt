REPORT AND RECOITFENDATIONS
OF THE
PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED LOAN AND A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE
REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR FOR A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit herewith the following report and recommendations on
a proposed Loan from the Bank in an amount in various currencies equiva-
lent to $9.0 million and a proposed Development Credit from the Associa-
tion in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $8.0 million, both
to the Republic of Ecuador to assist in financing a 5-year highway con-
struction and maintenance project. The proposed Loan and Credit would be
made within the framework of a financial consortium including the Agency
for International Development (AID) and the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB).
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        In 1954 the Bank, in its firsti loan to Ecuador, lent $8.5 mil-
lion (later reduced to $7.5 million) to the Comite de Vialidad (Loan 94
EC) for the construction and improvement of about 500 KM of trunk roads
serving the coastal province of Guayas. A few sections of the original
project roads could not be completed because of a shortage of funds re-
sulting from substantial under-estimates of the cost of the project and
the short (7-year) amortization period of the loan. Nevertheless, the
roads completed with the assistance of this loan played an important role
In the development of the Guayas province and the expansion of -cuadorts
banana production. The loan was fully repaid in March 1964.
3.        In 1957 the Bank made a loan of $14.5 million to the Republic
of Ecuador (Loan 176 EC) to assist in the construction and improvement
of 533 KE of trunk roads4 Three of the four project roads are virtually
completed and are already open to traffic and providing benefits to the
economy0 The fourth road (Chone - Santo Domingo), was included in the
project on a contingent basis: the Borrower agreed that construction of
this road would not be started until the Bank was satisfied that suffi-
cient funds would be available and that satisfactory progress had been
achieved on the rest of the project. The road was started prematurely
in 1961 - 1962 and although a reduction was made in the percentage of
total cost being financed from the loan,Bank loan funds for construction
were exhausted in late 1962.  The road is now only about 60% complete.
The Bank loan also included funds for a maintenance program; these funds
are virtually exhausted ,nd the program is not yet completed.



- 2 -
Early in 1962 the Arosemena Government, which had just taken
office, approached the Bank for further financial assistance to: (i)
complete the Bank-financed project under construction; (ii) continue
and expand the maintenance program; and (iii) construct and improve two
major trunk roads within a new 5-year highway program. A separate appli-
cation at about the same time to the AID for financing three other trunk
roads was transferred to the Bank for consideration. A review of these
applications indicated the need for further engineering and economic
studies by consultants to establish reliable cost estimates and economic
justification of these roads. The Government engaged new consultants in
April 1962 and their report on the project, which was made available to
the Bank in late 1962,forms the principal basis for the evaluation of
the proposed project.
5.        Following a review of this report, the Government agreed to
defer the construction of one of the roads of somewhat lower priority0
Even so, the remaining program was large in relation to the Government's
then available resources and the Government also requested financial as-
sistance for other parts of its 5-year highway program from AID and the
Inter-American Bank. In order to facilitate an orderly approach to the
financing of highways the Bank agreed to undertake the leadership of a
consortium of the lending agencies which would jointly assist in financing
the most important part of the 5-year highway program provided the Govern-
ment would, before undertaking major new construction, (i) substantially
increase and consolidate its revenues to enable it to carry out the pro-
ject and the balance of its second 5-year highway program; (ii) give
immediate attention to improvement of maintenance operations and (iii)
substantially complete the first Bank-financed project.
6,        By June 1963 the Bank and the Association had reached agreement
in principle with AID and the Inter-American Development Bank on a joint
financing plan for the project, and invited the Government to enter into
preliminary negotiations for a loan and credit under the principal condi-
tions mentioned in Para. 5 above. These discussions were interrupted in
early July 1963 when the Arosemena Government was deposed by a military
Junta. By late 1963, after it became apparent that a responsible Govern-
ment was in control, discussions on the project were resumed.
7.        Following satisfactory measures by the Government in March 1964
to substantially increase and consolidate its resources for the 5-year
highway program, the Bank and the Association entered into formal negotia-
tions for the proposed loan and credit. The Government was represented
by its Ambassador in NWashington, by the Undersecretary of the Ministry
of Public ii1orks, and by other officials of the Ministry and the National
Planning Boarde These negotiations were substantially completed in the
latter half of April 1964.
8.        In accordance with the agreed Financing Plan for the consortium
program (see Table 6 of the Appraisal Report) parallel loans of $13.3
million and $6 million are to be made by AID and the Inter-American Bank.



- 3 -
The AID loan would finance part of the local component of construction
cost and part of the foreign and local component of the maintenance pro-
gram. This loan, which would be repayable in dollars, would have a term
of 40 years, including 10 years grace, with interest at 3/h of 1% per
annum for the first 10 years and 2% thereafter.  The IDB loan would cover
part of the foreign component of the construction program, and would have
a term of 20 to 25 years, including 41 years grace. Interest would be at
IDhBs current rate (presently 5-3/4% per annum). Negotiations between
the Government and these agencies are at an advanced stage, and are expec-
ted to be completed by about M4ay 25.   It is expected that these loans
would be signed simultaneously with or shortly after the proposed loan
and credit.
9.        The proposed Development Credit would be the first financing
by the Association in Ecuador.
10.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's seventh to Ecuador and
would increase the total of Bank lending to $54 million, net of cancella-
tions. The Bank has already made the following loans in Ecuador:

PART ITI - APPRAISAL OF TEE PROPC6ED LOALN MI-TD DMEXLOP1ETNT CWDR
13.       A detailed Appraisal (TO 422-a) of the Project is attached
(No. 1).



- 5 -
14.       The Project for which the proposed loan and credit would be made
would be carried out in two separate but overlapping stages and consist
of the followring Parts (see Schedule 2 of the draft Loan Agreement):
Stage I
Part A  - Completion of construction of the unfinished portions
of the earlier Bank-financed project (Loan 176 EC)0
Part B  - Continuation and expansion of the highway maintenance
program over a 5-year period.
Part C - Engineering services in connection with:    (i) Parts A
and B of the Project; (ii) three related highway sec-
tions being financed by AID and IDB under the consor-
tium arrangements; and (iii) studies and design of
highways included in Part D below.
Stage II
Part D  - The construction of four trunk roads totalling approxi-
mately 502 KM.
Part E  - Engineering services for supervision of construction
of Part D highways.
Part F  - Engineering and economic studies of further highways
to be selected in agreement with the Bank.
15.       The Borrower will concentrate in the first stage on the completion
of the earlier Bank-financed roads, on improvement of maintenance and on
preparation of the engineering plans for the 502 KI of new roads (to be
constructed in the second stage).  Loan and credit funds for the second
stage would not be made available until the Borrower had achieved a satis-
factory state of performance under the first stage.  (See paragraph 30(c)
below).
16.       The maintenance of roads in Ecuador has been neglected in the
past.  With the continued expansion of the highwzay network, an adequate
maintenance program is essential to protect the substantial capital in-
vestments already made and to be made in highways under the second 5-year
program. The cost of the 5-year program of rehabilitation and maintenance
is $,)20 mnillion, of which $5.5 million is for imported equipment, material
and supplies.
17.       The high priority of the Project roads and of the substantial
maintenance program to be undertaken is confirmed by the conclusions of
the general Transportation Study, which will soon be available, and for
which the Bank provided a technical assistance grant.   The roads to be



- 6 -
constructed or improved under the project will make news and productive e
lands in the coastal region accessible by modern means of transportation,
establish reliable communications between important urban centers, and
substantially redluce vehicle-operating costs, Savings in transport costs
to the road users are estimated to range from 20% to 35% on completion
of the roads.  These savings alone represent a return ranging from 6% to
20% per annum on the total investment in the roads over their economic life.
It is difficult to quantify with accuracy the benefits to be expected
from the net increase in agricultural output from lands made accessible
by the new. roads, The development which has taken place in regions made
accessible by roads finenced by the Bank in Ecuador in the past demon-
strates, however, that thie agricultural benefits to be expected on this
account are substantial within a short time after the roads are built
and continue to increase for some time thereafter.
18.       The total cost of the consortium program is $62.2 million.    Of
this amount, the external lending agencies would provide loans and
credits totalling $39 million (63%) and the Government would contribute
$23.2 million (37%). The Government's contribution includes the equiva-
lent of $d14h5 million for the local costs of both deferred and routine
maintenance. Excluding maintenance, the Governament would contribute
about 25% of the cost of the consortium program.
19.       The Government has taken inportant fiscal measures to provide
increased revenues to carry out its 5-year highway development plan on
a sound basis.  A unified tax was for the first time applied to all
banana exports.  A National Highway Fund w¢as established in the Central
Bank to receive the revenues of several existing taxes devoted to high-
ways, part of the proceeds of the banana export tax, and other new
revenues. The Highway Rund will receive from all such sources approxi-
mately $7S5 million in the 5-year period i964 - 1968. The Central Bank
will act as a trustee to ensure that the Government's contribution to
the consortium program and to the payment of certain highway debts (in-
cluding the Bank Loan 176 EC and the proposed Loan and Credit) will have
first priority on the revenues of the Highway Fund.
20.       The Hlighway Fund revenues of $75 million will be used for the
consortium program ($23.2 million), for service on internal and external
highway debts ($20 million), for provincial roads and roads to the Oriente
($10 million), and for other high priority national roads ($22 million)
many of which are alre--dy under construction. Excluding debt service
and maintenance, Government contributions will cover about 60% of the
cost of the execution of its 5-year highway construction program.



- 7 -
Procedures for procurement, administration and execution of the Project
21.       All construction contracts and equipment purchases in the Pro-
ject have been or will be awarded on the basis of international competi-
tive bidding. The Agency for International Development and the Inter-
American Bank, to the extent possible, intend to rely on the Bank to re-
view matters of common interest, to suggest appropriate action and to
act as coordinator in matters affecting the administration of the consor-
tium program. Periodic consultations between the lending agencies and
the Government on the administration and execution of the highwfay consor-
tium program and on the transportation investment program in general will
be handled through a Transportation Coordinating, Committee to be composed
of representatives of the Government and the lending agencies. Disburse-
ments by the Government for works carried out under the consortium program
will be facilitated by the creation of a Project Revolving Fund in the
Central Bank from which such payments would be made. This Fund would be
replenished by transfers from the National Highway Fund and by disburse-
ments from the lending agencies. The Ministry of Public Works, with the
assistance of its consulting engineers, is qualified to execute the high-
way program.
Economic Situation
22.       The economic situation was reviewed in the report on Recent
Zconomic Developments in Ecuador WIi,-133a, distributed to the Executive
Directors on January 24, 1964. (R 6h-6)
23.       The favorable economic trends apparent since the Military
Junta took over the Government in July 1963 continued during the first
quarter of 196h. The major economic development in 1963 was a 16% increase
in exports, which was reflected in an appreciation of the value of the
Suere on the free market and an increase in foreign exchange reserves.
The exports increase was mainly bananas, which rose by more than 20%.
Although Ecuador's traditional markets shared in this increase, the
greater part was accounted for by growing exports to Japan. Rapidly
rising exports are providing a stimulus to the private sector by increasing
the national income, and by making available additional foreign exchange
to finance imports of capital equipment and services required for the
development plan.  At the same time, the growth in banana exports in-
creases the reliance of the country on one crop, thereby making- it more
vulnerable to unfavorable developments in the world market for bananas.
24.       Ecuador's main administrative problem has been the limited
powers of the Central Government, especially in the fiscal field. There
are more than 800 autonomous agencies which, together with provincial and
municipal governments absorb some 2/3rds of public sector revenues. Crea-
tion of a unified banana export tax to help provide funds for the highwJay
program, previously mentioned, is an important step toward a more rational
fiscal system. Banana export taxes of 60 separate agencies have been re-
placed by a single tax on all banana exports which will be collected by



- 8 -
the National Government. Specific amounts are being allocated to various
agencies formerly levying separate taxes, and the remainder is being al-
located to various National Government functions, such as the National
Highway Fund. A second recent major fiscal reform has been revision of
the personal income tax which has been made more progressive. There is
also a new tax on the profits of corporations, Further steps have been
talcen in recent months to gain more control over the investment budgets
of autonomous agencies.
25.       The Ecuadorian Government has now adopted the General Plan of
Social and Economic Development worked out in 1963 for the period 1964
to 1973. This has as a major objective an average annual increase of 6%
in the gross domestic product and calls for a rapid expansion of public
and private investment. Within the Plan, top priority is being given to
transport investment and the road development program constitutes the
main part of the transport sector.
26.        A solid financial base for the development effort is provided
by Ecuador's traditional policy of monetary restraint. This policy is
reflected in the current standby agreement with the International Nlonetary
Fund, under which Ecuador has been fully complying wTith its various under-
takings, such as restricting Central Bank credit within agreed limits.
27.       The outstanding external public debt repayable in foreign cur-
rency totalled $116 million at the end of 1963.   Service on existing
debt totals $20 million in 1964, about ll1o of export earnings, and declines
to $6 million in 1970, about 4&: of prospective export earnings (see tables
1 and 2 attached). Ecuador has followed a cautious policy of balance of
payments and debt management and the proportion of medium term debt is
relatively small. The country's ability to service additional debt is
limited because of its reliance on foreign exchange earnings from a very
small range of tropical crops. Demand for the present exports in world
markets is not likely to rise rapidly over che longer period, and much
time and effort will be required to expand production and diversify-ex-
ports; the possibilities for diversification are available, however,
since Ecuador has substantial reserves of fertile soil and labor force
which can be utilized to produce a wide range of additional products and
also develop manufacturing and processing.
28.       Because of dependence of export ea-rnings on a limited number of
tropical crops, and the eRrly stage of development of its infrastructure,
the amount of additional external borrowing that Ecuador can prudently
contract on conventional terms falls far short of that required to finance
the investment needed for a satisfactory rate of growth. Ecuador is one
of the poorer countries of Latin America, with a per capita income of only
about $163. The management of monetery policy and the balance of payments
have been sound; on the whole external borrowing has been for high priority
projects; and, despite difficulty in concentrating domestic resources on
high priority projects in the public sector, public revenues and savings



- 9 -
have been high in relation to the national income, especially when measured
on a per capita basis.  Hence, while scuador can still assume some addi-
tional external debt on conventional terms, I consider that Ecuador meets
the tests of eligibility for IDA credits and that the present financing
should be a blend of Bank and IDA assistance0
PART IV - LEGAL INSiTRll.ENTS AND AUTHORITY
29.       Attached are a draft Loan Agreement (No. 2); a draft Credit
Agreement (No. 3); and a draft Memorandum of Understanding betwieen the
Bank, the Association, the Agency for Internauional Development and the
Inter-American Development Bank (No. 4).
30.       The draft Loan and Credit Agreements follow in substance the
normal pattern of agreements for projects of this kind.   The following
provisions are of special interest:
a)  Section 2.02(a) of the Loan Agreement provides that no
withdrawals shall be made on account of expenditures prior
to such date or dates as shall be agreed upon between the
Borrower and the Bank.   By supplemental letter, the Bank
would agree to permit withdrawals from the Loan Account for
certain payments made on or af'ter October 1, 1962 (relating
to construction and engineering costs on the previous Bank-
financed project).
b) Section 2.03 of the Credit A'greement provides for withdrawals
from the Credit Account equivalent to a percentage, established
from time to time by agreement between the Borrower and the
Association, of expenditures niade for Part D of the Project,
By supplemental agreement between the Borrower and the Associa-
tion a rate of 33% would be established.
c)  Section 2.02(b) of the Loan Agreement and Section 2.03(b) of
the Credit Agreement provide that no withdrawals shall be
made in respect of expenditures for Stage II of the Project
(Parts D,E and F) until satisfactory evidence shall have
been furnished to the Association that (i) Part A of the Pro-
ject and the highway from Quito via Aloag to Quevedo shall
have been substantially completed; (ii) the Borrower shall
have taken the measures necessary to implement a highway
maintenance program satisfactory to the Association; (iii)
the Borrower shall have taken all necessary action to imple-
ment within a period to be determined between the Borrower
and the Association the measures referred to under Section
5.09(c) of the Bank Loan Agreement (concerning limitation of
vehicle weights and dimensions); and (iv) the conditions pre-
cedent to disbursement for Part D of the Project under the
AID and Inter-American BDnk loan agreements shall have been
fulfilled.



- 10 -
d) Section 4.01 of the Credit Agreement incorporates by reference
certain pertinent covenants contained in the Loan Agreement,
the duration of which is limited to the term of the Bank loan.
e) As in previous Bank loans to Ecuador, the negative pledge (Section
5,04) has been modified to avoid problems arising out of the auto-
nomy of certain governmental agencies and political sub-divisions;
as previously, Banco Central will co-sign the Loan Agreement as
evidence of its acceptance of its obligations under this pledge.
f) Section 5.15 of the Loan Agreement provides that the Project
shall enjoy the highest priority, and that until it shall
have been executed, the Borrower willnot undertake any major
highway project which wzould adversely affect his ability to
fulfill any obligation under the Loan and Credit Agreements.
g) Section 5.16 of the Loan Agreement requires the Borrower to
complete three highuay sections not included in the Bank/IDA
Project, but forming part of the work to be financed by AID
and IDB under the consortium arrangements.
h)  The effectiveness of the Loan and Credit Agreements and the
agreements which the Borrower is entering into w:ith PID and
the Inter-American Bank ore all conditional on each other.
Section 5.18 provides that if the Borrower shall prepay any
part of the loans described in the Preamble to the Loan
Agreement, it shall simultaneously prepay a proportionate
amount of the loan. In addition, the Loan A.greement modified
Section 5.02 of the Loan Regulations in giving the Bank the
right to suspend, or in certain cases to prema-bure, the Loan
upon the occurence of certain events specified in any of the
other Agencies' agreements or documents which affect the Pro-
ject and also if the legislation or arrangements to be respec-
tively enacted or concluded by the Borrower shall have been
amended, suspended, terminated or repealed so as to adversely
affect the ability of the Borrower to carry out its obligations.
i)  The Borrower shall make arrangements, satisfactory to the Bank,
with the Central Bank for the setting aside, the transfer and,
if necessary, the conversions into foreign exchange of local
funds available for the Project (Section 5.14).
31.       The Memorandum of Understanding sets forth the basic principles
to be followed by the four lending agencies in the administration of the
consortium project, and includes, inter alia, a provision that no disburse-
ments will be made for Stage II of the cninsortium project until all lending
agencies are satisfied that all conditions precedent to such disbursements
have been fulfilled.  The Pleemorandum includes an agreed Financing Plan
(Annex A), and a statement of the principles and procedures to be apolied
for bidding and contracting (Annex B). The Government has been consulted
about the proposed collaboration between the agencies and approves the
principles set forth in the Memorandum and Annexes thereto.

32.       Satisfactory assurances have been received from Ecuadorian coun-
sel that the pronosed Loan and Credit Agreements and related documents
can be validly entered into by the present Government and,when authorized
and ratified, would constitute valid and binding obligations of the
Republic of Bcuador,
33.       The Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
(iii) of the Articles of Agreem7ent of the Bank and the Recommendations of
the Committee provided for in Article V7 Section l(d) of Uhe Ahrticles of
Agreement of the Association are attached (-os. 5 and 6).
PART V - CQIPLTUdCE ¾'TITH ARTICL7;S OF AGREEY,NT
34.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit would comply
respectively wiith the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Association.
PART VT - RZCMO!iEiNDA?TIONTS
35.       I recommend that:
a)   the Bank make a loan to the Republic of Ecuador in an amount
in various currencies equivalent to $9 million for a term of
25 years, at an interest rate of 5-At per annum (including
comhmission) and on such other terrns as are specified in the
attached draft Loan Agreement and that the Executive Directors
of the Bank adopt a Resolution to that effect in the form
attached (llo. 7).
b)   The Association make available to the Republic of Tcuador a
Development Credit in an amount in various currencies equiva-
lent to $8 million for a term of 50 years, with a 10 year
grace period, bearing a service charge of 3/l of 1% per annum
on the amount disbursed and outstanding and on such other
terms as are specified in the attached draft Development
