Roads and road transport in Ecuador\n            are the main means of communication. As a result, investment\n            in the road network is of the highest importance. It is\n            needed to supply adequate road transportation for the\n            various sectors of the economy, especially the agricultural\n            sector. The project will update the road network in two\n            stages. The first stage will entail: 1) completion of\n            highway construction financed under a previous Bank loan; 2)\n            implementation of a highway maintenance program; and 3)\n            consultation of engineering services. The second stage will:\n            1) complete the construction, reconstruction and improvement\n            of four paved all weather highways; 2) consult engineering\n            services in the construction of the highways; 3) produce\n            feasibility studies; and 4) complete the final engineering\n            of future highways. These improvements will modernize the\n            road network in order to promote economic development and\n            enhance the travel system in Ecuador."}, "docdt": "1964-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
