communities through the\n            replenishment of a social fund designed to support\n            demand-driven initiatives developed by such communities and,\n            in doing so, to create employment and improve access to\n            basic social services. The project builds on the very\n            successful social fund component of the on-going Population\n            and Human Resources Project. The Social Fund Project\n            components are: 1) rehabilitation/construction of communal\n            infrastructure for primary schools, health centers, feeder\n            roads, community water supply systems, markets, etc.; 2)\n            micro-credit activities, such as, subproject financing for\n            income generating activities and small loan programs for\n            individuals, as well as groups, particularly women; 3)\n            capacity building subprojects for training of Fonds\n            d'Appui au Developpement Communautaire (FADC)'s\n            partners to improve their effectiveness in identifying,\n            preparing, and implementing community development\n            activities; and 4) training and institution capacity\n            building technical assistance for FADC's investment and\n            operating costs, audits, and studies."}, "docdt": "1997-10-30T00:00:00Z"}
