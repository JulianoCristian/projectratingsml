process of land and natural\n            resource degradation in order to secure sustainable\n            agricultural production and growth, alleviate poverty and\n            improve the living conditions of Niger's rural\n            communities. In addition, the project has two specific\n            objectives: 1) to assist selected rural communities in\n            different agro-ecological zones in designing and\n            implementing management plans for their lands and provide\n            them with the necessary know-how, information, technical and\n            financial resources and the proper institutional and legal\n            framework to successfully carry out such an endeavor; and 2)\n            to assist the government in building up a national capacity\n            to promote, assist and coordinate the diverse natural\n            resource management (NRM) initiatives underway in Niger in\n            the framework of the National Natural Resources Management\n            Program (NNRMP), and help prepare NRM policies and\n            strategies, based on lessons learned from field experience.\n            The principal components of the project are: 1) direct\n            technical and financial assistance to communities for the\n            design and implementation of Community-Based Natural\n            Resource Management (CBNRM) plans involving about 280\n            selected communities in five districts, and assistance\n            through ongoing NRM projects to another 100 communities in\n            Niger; 2) provision of services to help achieve the\n            project's objectives, namely: human resource\n            development, national assessment of the state of natural\n            resources, natural resource information networking, research\n            and studies; and 3) assistance to decision-makers in\n            devising national NRM policies and strategies."}, "docdt": "1995-11-07T00:00:00Z"}
