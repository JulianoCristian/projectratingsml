The Pilot Private Irrigation Project (PPIP)\n            had a highly satisfactory outcome; risk to the development\n            outcome was significant; and both Bank and Borrower\n            performances were satisfactory. The Natural Resources\n            Management Project (NRMP) had a satisfactory outcome, risk\n            to the development outcome was moderate; and satisfactory\n            performances by both the Bank and Borrower.

Lessons learned from the projects included:\n            empowering communities to take control of the implementation\n            of their own development plans improves community ownership\n            and motivation to engage in sustainable development\n            practices. Export development needs to follow a well defined\n            strategy, and a commodity chain approach needs to emphasize\n            producer-exporter linkages. Similar agricultural development\n            projects in neighboring countries can have opposite outcomes\n            due to the quality of project preparation, the level of\n            engagement of the implementing agencies, and the prevailing\n            land tenure security situation."}, "docdt": "2008-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
