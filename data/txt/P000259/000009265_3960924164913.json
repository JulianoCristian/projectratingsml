The project is a semi-success in\n            terms of its forestry sector approach and in view of the\n            objectives assigned to it during appraisal. However,\n            experience acquired by the Bank over the 1980s has shown\n            that only a multisectoral and participatory approach can\n            generate solutions to the problem of natural resource\n            degradation in West Africa. From this perspective, the\n            project's conception was limited and its impact has\n            been slight. The project's implementation was hampered\n            by the reorganization and constant staff changes in the\n            Ministry of Environment, and most importantly by the\n            Government's delay in providing counterpart funds. Even\n            after the project was revised to reduce the\n            Government's share of operating expenses, ultimately a\n            significant portion of the IDA credit was undisbursed and\n            cancelled. The project did achieve a number of physical\n            accomplishments, including: (i) construction of offices;\n            (ii) maintenance and exploitation of existing plantations;\n            (iii) planting and maintenance of new plantations; (iv)\n            management of natural forests; and (v) production and\n            distribution of seedlings. While the project did succeed in\n            strengthening the Forestry Administration, the\n            sustainability of these results is questionable. Many of the\n            results were difficult to monitor and quantify. Still, the\n            project provided a building block for the definition of the\n            more comprehensive approach which, as of 1990, is being\n            developed in Burkina Faso."}, "docdt": "1990-02-06T00:00:00Z"}
