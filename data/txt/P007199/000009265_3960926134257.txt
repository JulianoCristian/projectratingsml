MEMORANDUM AND RECOMWENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUATEMALA
FOR A SECOND BASIC EDUCATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Guatemala for US$30.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be repaid over 20 years, including 5
years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate.
2.       Background.  The education system in Guatemala has grown rapidly
over the last 20 years, with public primary enrollment nearly trebling and
public secondary enrollment more than quadrupling. However, the Government
of Guatemala is still a long way from meeting the educational needs of its
people. The overall litera^y rate is only about 53 percent and does not
exceed 40 percent in rural areas. About 88 percent of the economically
active population has either no formal education or only a few years of
primary education. Although enrollment has recently expanded, primary
education still faces serious problems: (a) only 63 percent of school-age
children attend school, about half a million are not enrolled and children
in rural areas (where enrollment rates are only 53 percent) and females are
over-represented in the excluded group; (b) the flow of students through
the system is inefficient, so that, on average, 18 years' instruction-
-instead of six--are required to produce a graduate; and (c) financial
constraints and management deficiencies hamper the effective operation and
development of the system. Although the share of primary education in the
Ministry of Education's (MOE) budget is reasonably high (57.9 percent in
1985), the traditionally low level of public expenditures and comparatively
small allocation to education have kept resources severely constrained, and
the preponderance have been used to finance teachers' salaries, to the
substantial neglect of other critical inputs, e.g., school maintenance and
textbooks.
3.       The Government has assigned high priority to lower primary
education, and has stuted its goal of providing a minimum of four years of
education to at least 80 percent of all six to nine year olds by 1991. In
order to achieve this goal, the Government proposes to: (a) create
additional demand for early schooling; (b) promote more efficient use of
existing capacity through increased use of double shifts and multigrade
teaching; (c) split the first grade into two grades in order to address
problems of high repetition and low achievement at that level; (d)
implement measures (including emphasis on bilingual education) to improve
low achievement rates; and (e) improve the capacity of the MOE, at all
levels (including teachers), to adequately provide, manage and coordinate
educational opportunities in an efficient and equitable basis. The First
Basic Education project is assisting the Government in improving MOE
planning capabilities, developing institu-ional capacity of the National
Center of Textbooks (CENALTEX) and of ,.  School Construction Unit (UCEE)
of the Ministry of Communications, Transport and Public Works (MCPW), and



-2-
increasing school capacity, quality and efficiency in poor ateas of
Guatemala City. This project, which has suffered some delays during
implementation, is now progressing satisfactorily and is scheduled to be
completed in December 1988. Further efforts towards strengthening and
decentralizing MOE management, as well as an increased emphasis on
increasing system capacity, quality and efficiency in rural areas will be
required to achieve the Government's goals under this project.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project would
support the Bank's strategy to assist the Government in increasing
resources devoted to basic services such as education and strengthening
institutions so as to provide low-cost services and plan and execute
investment programs efficiently. It would build upon achievements of the
First Basic Education project and complement other external assistance to
the sector (school construction by IDB, bilingual education by USAID and
school nutrition by WFP) while redirecting priorities towards rural areas.
In view of the role of education and literacy in increasing productivity,
especially of farmers, the project would produce important benefits for
long-term development and economic and social integration in Guatemala.
Bank involvement in the sector has been important in guiding Government
priorities towards basic education and continued involvement would assist
the Government in improving sector planning and managements and in
developing and eventually implementing a strategy to address the needs of
higher levels of education.
5.       Proiect Obiectives.  The objectives of the proposed project would
be tot (a) increase net enrollment: (b) improve the quality and efficiency
of lower primary education; and (c) improve educational management. Major
emphasis would be on the lower levels of primary education in rural areas.
6.       Proiect Description.  The proposed project would support the above
objectives bys (a) expanding the existing school capacity at the lower
primary level and extending an existing adult distance education
program--PEAC--to the upper primary level on a pilot basis, and increasing
demand for education by groups whose children are not attending schools,
through public information campaigns and support for the school nutrition
program (US$43.5 million; 71.5 percent of project cost); (b) providing
learning supplies and materials, including textbooks, teacher training
programs (in multigrade teaching, bilingual education, student evaluation
and teaching for a new preparatory grade IA), and studies which would
identify areas in which further quality and efficiency improvements would
be needed (US$10.8 million; 18.5 percent of project cost); and (c)
strengthening the central management of the MOE by constructing centralized
facilities, improving the information system and management training,
decentralizing administration, and strengthening administration at the
regional and school levels through training programs on, inter alis, micro-
planning methodologies (US$6.5 million; 10.5 percent of project cost). A
minimum of 80 percent of investments in (a) and (b) above would be
targetted to rural areas. The total cost of the project (excluding taxes
and duties estimated at approximately US$1.5 million) is estimated at
US$60.8 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$14.1
million. A breakdown of the costs and the financing plan are shown n
Schedule A. The proposed loan would finance civil works, equipment,



-3-
furniture, supplies and materials, including textbooks, training, technical
assistance and incremental operating costs of the Project Implementation
Coordination Unit (PICU); and up to US$3.1 million of interest during
construction. The project would be implemented over six years. Project
implementation would be carried out by the HOE and the NCPW through UCEE.
UCEE would be responsible for classroom construction and for furniture and
¢quipment procurement. CENALTEX would be responsible for textbook
development, production and distribution. The training programs would be
implemented by a unit under the Planning Office of the MOE (USIPE).
Studies, teacher recruitment and support to the nutrition and distance
education programs would be carried out by the relevant units of the MOE
with assistance from the PICU, which would coordinate project activities.
The PICU would be responsible for centralized implementation functions such
as consolidating the yearly work plans of executing agencies, coordinating
activities among participating agencies, providing administrative back-up
services, and carrying out project financial management as well as direct
implementation of public information campaigns. Amounts and methods of
procurement, the disbursement forecast and the allocation of loan proceeds
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and
the status of Bank group operations in Guatemala are given in Schedules C
and D respectively. A map (IBRD-20316) is attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 7004-GU, dated November 4, 1988, is being distributed
separately.
7.       Actions Agreed.  The Government agreed to the following key
actions during negotiations: (a) the PICU would be established and the
staff and administrator appointed as a condition of effectiveness; (b) a
contract for carrying out the audit of first year project expenditures
wvould be signed as a condition of disbursement for the loan; (c) PICU would
furnish to the Bank by September 30 of each year (i) a list of classrooms
to be constructed andlor upgraded the following year, and (ii) evidence of
legal actions creating new teachers' positions: and (d) an acceptable plan
detailing actions to be carried out during the following fiscal year (and
proposed budgetary allocations) would be submitted by October 31 of each
year until project completion.
8.       Proiect Benefits and Risks.  The main benefits of the proposed
project would bet (a) reduced illiteracy rates through increased
participation in lower primary education from 60 percent at present to
about 80 percent in 1993 and a higher number of children completing grade
III from 126,000 at present to about 163,000 in 1993; (b) increased
efficiency of lower primary education (about 27 percent of students would
have completed grade III without having repeated against 17 percent at
present); (c) increased equity of educational opportunities for the rural
poor, including indigenous families; and (d) improved management and
operation of the education system which together with resource savings from
educational efficiency improvements would contribute to further system
expansion. Through the well documented role of education and literacy in
increasing productivity, the project would produce important benefits for
the long-term development and integration of rural Guatemala.



-4-
9.       Two implementation risks would be associated with the proposed
project. The first, the shortfall of counterpart funds would be mitigated
by close Bank monitoring of budgetary allocations through review of annual
work plans. The second risk, related to the overall implementation
capacity of the MOE, has been considerably reduced by the experience
acquired under the First Basic Education Project, by the establishment of
the PICU and through technical assistance. Also, intensified monitoring by
both the Department of Projects (DOP) and the Bank would permit early
detection and resolution of implementation problems. The project has been
designed to address the risk of not improving efficiency because of
resistance to change on the part of administrators, teachers, and parents
through efforts to mobilize support for project objectives, such as
training programs and public information campaigns.
10.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
