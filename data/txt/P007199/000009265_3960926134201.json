six to nine year\n            olds by 1991. This will be accomplished by : (i) expanding\n            the existing school capacity at the lower primary level and\n            extending an existing distance education program to the\n            upper primary level; (ii) increasing the demand for\n            education through programs such as public campaigns and\n            support for school nutrition programs; and (iii) providing\n            learning materials, and a program of studies to identify and\n            define areas for further quality and efficiency\n            improvements. Also financed will be the strengthening of\n            management at the Ministry of Education at the central\n            level, and decentralizing to, and strengthening of\n            administration at the regional and school levels."}, "docdt": "1988-11-04T00:00:00Z"}
