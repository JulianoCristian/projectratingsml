satisfactory. Even\n            through periodic political instability, and exceptional\n            challenges, the government's new administration took\n            ownership of the project, and timely disbursement was\n            accomplished. Key lessons suggest that the strong political\n            commitment of the Ministry of Education (MOE) was paramount\n            to the project success. This commitment assured MOE's\n            participation and that of its various units/offices, which\n            in turn achieved the necessary ownership for successful\n            execution practices. However, the lack of continuity\n            hindered project coordination, a factor which could have\n            been minimized through the decentralization of execution\n            mechanisms, and facilitate project activities. Furthermore,\n            project design should allow, flexibility for possible\n            modifications required during implementation, and, include a\n            baseline for sustained monitoring activities, to evaluate\n            interventions, redefine and/or develop strategies for\n            implementation, particularly under changing political\n            circumstances. Supervision should focus, specifically, in\n            the execution aspects, and technical assistance, to support\n            interventions, and, minimize misleading procedural aspects.\n            In the absence of a Special Account, UNDP may assist as a\n            purchasing agent, and establish simple\n            procurement/disbursement practices."}, "docdt": "1999-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
