Re.:  Guatemala/Second Basic Education Project/Netherlands'
      cofinancing
Dear Mr. Steckhan,
With reference to the above-mentioned project, I have the pleasure
to inform you that the Netherlands' authorities have decided to
contribute an amount of Dfl. 8.240.000,- (Eight million two hundred
and forty thousand Dutch guilders) equal to approximately 4 million
U.S. dollars, in joint cofinancing to the second Basic Education
Project.
You are kindly requested to administer this contribution under the
so-called 'Umbrella Agreement' on cofinancing between the World Bank
and The Netherlands.
The financial planning as far as the transfer of funds is concerned
is as follows: 2 million guilders in 1989, 2 million guilders in
1990, 2 million guilders in 1991, and the remainder, i.e. 2.240.000
guilders in 1992.
The Netherlands attach great importance to the possibility of
consultation as mentioned under article 4 of the Umbrella Agreement,
in the sense that the World Bank should be obliged to consult the
Netherlands' authorities if there are any deviations from tile
project execution as agreed upon.
I would highly appreciate receiving confirmation that this
contribution has been added to the list of jointly cofinanced
projects covered by the Umbrella Agreement, as well as an indication
of the bank Account number to which the funds should be transferred.
Thanking you for your kind cooperation and awaiting your soonest
confirmation of the above, I remain,
                                      Yours sincerely.,
                                   Mrs. R.V.M. Jones-Bos,
                                 Second Secretary (Economic)
