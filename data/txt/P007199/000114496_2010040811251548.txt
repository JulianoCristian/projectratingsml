Procurement and Consultants' Services
Section I.
Procurement of Goods and Works
Part A: International Competitive Bidding
 
Except as provided in Part C hereof, goods and works
shall be procured under contracts awarded in accordance
with procedures consistent with those set forth in
Sections I and II of the
"Guidelines for Procurement
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank
in May
1985
(the Guidelines).
 
Part B:
Preference for Domestic and Regional
Manufacturers
In the procurement of goods in accordance with the
procedures described in Part A hereof, a margin of
preference will be granted to bids offering goods
described in the accompanying specification which are
manufactured to a substantial extent in any country,
including Guatemala, which is a party to the Mercado
Comun Centroamericano, the common market created by the
General Treaty for Central American Economic Integration
signed at Managua, Nicaragua on December
13, 1960 by
Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa
Rica
(hereinafter called the CACM), in accordance with,
and subject to, the following provisions:
 
1.
For the purposes of Part B of this Schedule, the
following definitions shall apply:
 
(a)  (i)
the term
"Qualified CACM Bid" 
means a bid
submitted by a manufacturer established
in territories of member countries,
including Guatemala, of the CACM, for
goods manufactured or processed in such
territories and for which the bidder
shall have established to the
satisfaction of the entity or agency
inviting bids that manufacturing or
processing cost of such goods includes a
value added in such territories equal to
at least
20% the ex-factory bid price of
such goods;
(ii) the term "Non-Qualified CACM Bid" 
means a
bid submitted by a Manufacturer
established in territories of member
countries, including Guatemala, of the
CACM, for goods manufactured or processed
in such territories, other than any such
bid classified as a Qualified CACM Bid;
Page  16
and
(iii)
the term
"Foreign Bid" 
means any bid
which is neither a Qualified CACM
Bid nor a Non-Qualified CACM Bid.
 
2.
All bidding documents for the procurement of goods
shall clearly indicate any preference which would be
granted and shall set forth the information required to
establish the eligibility of a bid for such preference.
 
3.
Bidders are required to state in their bid the
c.i.f. (port of entry) price of imported goods and the
ex-factory price of locally manufactured goods.
 
4.
Except to the extent hereinafter provided, bids will
be compared on the basis of their ex-factory or c.i.f.
(port of entry) price adjusted in accordance with
paragraphs
2.49 through 2.54 of the Guidelines.
 
5.
After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified
in one of the following groups: Qualified CACM Bids,
Non-qualified CACM Bids or Foreign Bids.
 
6.
All bids in each group will be first compared among
themselves, to determine the lowest evaluated bid in each
such group.
The lowest evaluated bids of each group will
then be compared with each other and if, as a result of
this comparison, an evaluated Qualified CACM Bid or
Non-Qualified CACM Bid is the lowest it will be selected
for purpose of award.
 
7.
If the lowest bid in the comparison under paragraph
6
above is a Foreign Bid, such bid will be further
compared with the lowest evaluated Qualified CACM Bid as
determined under paragraph
6
above.
For the purposes of
this comparison only, each Foreign Bid will be compared
on the basis of the sum of its c.i.f. (port of entry)
price adjusted in accordance with the provisions of
paragraph
4
above, plus an amount equal to the smaller
of: (i) one half the amount of customs duties and other
import taxes which a non-exempt importer would have to
pay for the importation of goods offered in such Foreign
Bid; or
(ii) 15% of the c.i.f. bid price of such goods.
If the Qualified CACM Bid is the lowest evaluated bid in
such comparison, it shall be selected for the purpose of
award; otherwise, the lowest evaluated Foreign Bid as
determined under paragraph
6
above shall be so selected.
