P-ACK
Because of the similarity of both the Fifth and the Sixth Highway
Projects, a combined Project Completion Report has been prepared for them.
The Credit Agreement for the Fifth Highway Project (Credit 332-ET) was
signed on September 29, 1972, and that for the Sixth Highway Project
(Credit 552-ET) was signed on June 4, 1975. Since the highway authorities
responsible for the implementation of the projects (called Imperial Highway
Authority, IHA, for Highways V and Ethiopian Highway Authority, EHA, for
Highways VI) were semi-autonomous, project agreements with these
authorities were signed on October 19, 1972 and June 4, 1975 respectively.
The Credits became effective on July 24, 1973 and August 15, 1975
respectively.
The Bank Group's first four highway operations had focussed on
the improvement of the country's main highway system. In contrast, the
primary objective of Highways V and VI was to increase the country's
agricultural production and marketable surplusses through the constraction
of lower standard farm-to-highway roads in selected regions with promising
agricultural potential. Under Highways V four such roads were built
totalling 257 km. and under Highways VI another four roads totalling 450
km. The Government undertook to continue agricultural development schemes
In the regions where these had already started, and to start new
agricultural projects entitled Minimum Package Programs (MPP's) as soon as
the new roads had been completed.
The road construction under Highways V startetd with some nine
months delay due to delay in Parliament's ratification of Credit 332-ET;
delay in the start of Highways VI was only a few months. Bids for the six
roads initially intended to be financed from the US$17 million credit for
Highways V were up to 80% higher than the estimated costs. Therefore, two
of the six roads were transferred to Highways VI; the construction of the
remaining four roads did not meet major problems.
A major objective of both highway projects was to continue
institution building through technical assistance and training of the IHA
(later ERA), which had already started under previous highway projects, and
to provide financial and technical assistance to the domestic contracting
industry. In this regard, in both credits US$1.5 million and US$2.0
million, respectively, were made available to enable contractors to borrow
funds needed for the procurement of equipment on commercial terms through
the domestic Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank (AIDB). Because
of the Governments' positive approach to the need and desirability of
continuous technical assistance and training, the institution building part
of the project was generally successful, except for delays in recruiting



(ii)
when the 1974 revolution and later the hostilities in Ogaden made working
conditions in Ethiopia unattractive for expatriates. In any event, at
present all top functions in the ETCA (created in 1980 to succeed IHA and
ERA) are filled by able local executives and the role of expatriates is
limited to an advisory capacity only. The assistance to the domestic
private construction industry was not so successful, however, except for
the individual experience gained by Ethiopian professionals and technicians
working in these firms, and the equipment fleet financed under the Credits
and still available in the country. The four major civil works domestic
firms were placed under court administration in March 1982, after they
failed to service their financial obligations with the state-owned National
Bank of Ethiopia and its affiliates.
It was recogr4sed and accepted from the begining that it would be
hard to differentiate between the benefits resulting from the road
construction and those resulting from the HPP's and other agricultural
development schemes. Lack of sufficient and reliable data on existing
population, production areas, crops, yields, local consu-mption, losses,
etc., already a problem at the time of appraisal and even more so since
completion of the roads, make it very difficult to come up with a realistic
calculation of, and thus a meaninful comparison between, the estimated and
actual benefits. ETCA, with the assistance of the Ministry of Agriculture
maide an effort to recalculate the economic rates of return on the roads'
investment taking into acount relevant data of the agricultural development
schemes. Taking into account the above shortcomings, the recalculated
economic rates of return should be considered as indicative only.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Completion Report was read in the Operations Evaluation
Department but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion
Report was sent to the Borrower for comments; however, none were received.

HIGHLIGHTS
The implementation of the two projects took place after the 1974
revolution, which brought about extensive changes in Government and in the
statutory and administrative structure of the authorities responsible for
highway construction and maintenance. Notwithstanding these changes and
additional difficulties in Ogaden and Eritrea, the construction of the
eight roads included in the two projects was satisfactorily completed
without excessive delay.
As to technical assistance and training, two important components
of these projects, there were recruiting problems when working conditions
in Ethiopia became less attractive for expatriate experts; this was
particularly noticeable during the hostilities in Ogaden (para. 3.12).
Nevertheless, these components were implemented with reasonable succese,
despite delays which required extension of the closing dates of both
projects, the Fifth by four years and the Sixth by two years.
Because of already noticeable tensions in the country and changes
in taxation policies, the bids for the six roads initially included in the
Fifth Highway Project were up to 80% above appraisal estimates. Therefore
two of the six roads were eliminated from Highways V and later transfered
to Eighways VI. Thereafter, all the roads were completed within the
revised cost estimates and available funds (paras. 2.08 and 3.03).
The PCR highlights the following points relating to the
preparation and implementation of the two projects:
- In contrast to the four preceding highway projects financed by
the Bank Group which focussed on improvement of the main
highways, the Fifth and Sixth Highway Projects focussed on the
need to increase the country's agricultural production through
construction of low standard penetration roads in the regions
with promising agricultural potential.
- institutional performance, already improved through previous
highway projects, has improved further through technical
assistance and training.



- vii -
- Both projects provided for loans to successful domestic bidders
for procurement of equipment; however, the contractors who
participated have failed to repay these loans and other advances
ta time . The National Bank of Ethiopia ard the domestic
Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank have put a lien on
the assets of these contractors which have been placed under
court administration (para 3.16).
- Vehicle dimension and axle load controls, which were a covenant
in both (and previous) credit agreements, were not enforced as
expected because (a) the installation and operation of
weighbridges were delayed, and (b) once they were installed,
weight regulations (8 tons per axle) did not correspond to the
existing modern trucking fleet. This issue is being addressed
under the upcoming Second Road Sector Credit through proper
adjusting of existing regulations.
- The economic return calculations in the appraisal reports were
nearly exclusively based on market values of assumed increased
productivity through schemes for improved agricultural
production. Estimating the surpluses and their values was
already difficult at the time of appraisal; insufficient data
since the project completion made a quantitative re-evaluation of
the economic returns on each of the project roads very
difficult. Nevertheless, an attempt was made to recalculate
economic rates of return (ERRs) using a relatively simplified
cost/benefit analysis --not equal to the sophisticated analysis
taken at appraisal. The attained results should be considered as
indicative only.  For the Fifth Highway Project the rec'lculated
ERRs range from 12% - 28% (as compared to appraisal estimates of
16% - 43%) and for the Sixth Highway Project from 5% - 16% (as
compared to appraisal estimates of 12% - 18%).

PROJECT COPLETION REPORT
I.INTROJJIXTION
1.01      Road transport is the dominant mode of transport in Ethiopia.
The Bank Group has been active in Ethiopia's transport sector since 1950,
when it made its first loan, (Loan 35-ET, US$5.0 million), to help finance
a three-year program for reconstruction, repair and maintenance of the most
important roads. A condition was that the Government establish a
semi-autonomous agency, the Imperial Highway Authority, (IHA) I/
responsible for developing and maintaining the main road network. Since
then the Bank Group has helped finance six more highway projects, bringing
the total amount of highway lending to US$135.7 million by October 1977,
when the last project (Credit 708-ET) for a road sector program becaue
effective. At the date of this PCR an eighth project for the highway
sector has been negotiated.
1.02      The first four loan/credit operations largely focussed on
improving the country's main road network, Institution building and
training. While these two latter aspects have continued to be of major
importance in all subsequent projects, the Bank Group's and the
Government's strategy has shifted, beginning with the Fifth lighway Project
(approved in June 1972), to the construction of lower standard roads In
conjunction in agricultural projects such as the Miniminu Package Program,
the Coffee Processing Program, and the Amibara Irrigation Projects, also
supported by the Bank Group.
1.03      Since the objectives and components of both Highways V and VI are
virtually the same, namely, construction of gravel roads, strengthening of
the EHA, the RTA (Road Transport Authority) and the local contracting
industry through technical assistance and training, establishment of a
Rural Roads Organization, equipment financing, etc. (para 2.06) this PCR
covers both projects.
1.04      Other bilateral lending agencies have also participated in the
financing improvement of Ethiopia's highway network. The role played by
the US Bureau of Public Roads is particularly important. Not only had
USAID carried managerial responsibilities in the early years after IHA's
creation, but it also financed concurrently with the Fifth Highway Project

asphalting program, amounting to US$9.3 million. This project, which was
initially considered and appraised for IDA financing, has greatly
coutributed to the success of the Bank Group operations and to improvement
of Ethiopia's road system.
II. POJECT PIEPARATION, APPRAISAL AND NEGOT IONS
Identificatlon and Preparstion
2.01      The Fifth Highway Project (also referred to as Rwy.V in this
report) was identified and prepared during the implementation and
supervision of a previous highway project, Hwy.IV, and the pre-appraisal of
Hwy.VI started in April, 1973, even before credit 332-ET for Huy.V had
become effective.
2.02      With a road network in 1974 of 8,600 km of all-weather main roads
(of which only 2,900 km were asphalted) and about 14,500 km of dry-weather
trails, the need for improved maintenance and upgrading was obvious.
However, in view of the new strategy mentioned in para 1.02, the road
sections selected to be constructed under Hwy.V and VI were those needed to
open up and further develop agricultural areas. This selection was based
on feasibility studies prepared by the Planning and Programming Division of
IHA and its consultants. The continued need for the other components of
the projects, technical assistance and training, was also obvious.
Appralsal and Negotiatlons
2.03      Negotlations for both credits, which took place In May 1972 and
March 1975 respectively, did not raise any particular issues, and the
covenants in both Credit Agreements followed the usual pattern for highway
projects. An Important covenant already included in the Fourth Highway
Project (Ln 523/Cr lil-ET) was the Government's agreement to implement
legislation controlling vehicle weight and dimensions. Non-compliance with
this covenant has caused It to be repeated in subsequent credit agreements.
Credlt Dates and Effecetivemeus
2.04      Credit 332-ET (Hwy.V) was approved by the Board on June 27, 1972
and signed on September 29, 1972. However, the original date of
effectiveness, January 15, 1973, had to be postponed until July 24, 1973
because of delays in credit ratification by the country's parliament. For
Credit 552-ET (Hwy VI) the dates were: Board approval, April 29, 1975;
signing, June 4, 1975; original date of effectiveness, June 30, 1975, and
actual date of effectiveness, August 15, 1975.



- 3 -
2.05      Because IHA (later ETCA) was at the time a semi-autonomous
authority, project agreements were added to both Credit Agreements between
IDA and IHA; the signing of these Project Agreements was a condition of
effectiveness of both Credits. Another condition of effectiveness was the
signing of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between of the Government and the
Agricltural and Industrial Development Bank (AIDB) from which loans to
contractors for equipment purchases were to be financed (para 3.16).

2.07      The amount of the credit for Hwy.VI was equal to the foreign cost
of the project, US$32 million, whereas the credit amount for Hwy.V, US$17
million, included US$3 million for local costs. Moreover, the disbursement
percentages for Hwy.V shown in Schedule 1 of the Credit Agreement were
based on the assumptlon that IHA would remain exempt from taxes and
duties. When this exemption was eliminated in 1974, bills from contractors
increased by about 20%, and IDA disbursement percentages for construction
had to be adjusted accordingly from 75% to 57Z. However, the Hwy.V project
as implemented was not the same as that appraised and negotiated since two
of the six roads and the Rural Road Study were deleted from the project
(see paras. 1.03, 2.08 and 3.14). The project description in Schedule 2 of
Credit 332-ET was officially changed by an amendment (Section 5.05) of the
Credit Agreement 552-ET.
Di   brsamets
2.08      IDA's contribution to project costs including changes later
agreed changes (paras. 1.03 and 2.07) are shown in Tables 3 and 4. As to
the disbursements for Hwy.V, differences between actual disbursements and
the original allocations in the Credit Agreement seem small for the major
categories.  However, two of the six roads were deleted from this project;
this made it possible to use the resulting surplus in supervision and the
umallocated amount largely for technical assistance, training and training
equipment. The Rural Road Study was also eliminated from the project
financing since the UK's Overseas Development Ministry (OD) took over its
financing (para 3.14). The disbursements for Hwy.VI show that the
differences between actual disbursements and original allocations were
small, except for the disbursements for road construction which were much
higher than allocated.  This was because unallocated funds were used mainly
for extensions of two roads by 56 km (para. 3.03) and to a lesser extent
for changes in drainage design and higher roadbed levels, shown to be
needed after unusually heavy rains.
II. PROJECT IKPILTENIhION AND COST
Genera
e-'
3.01      Construction of three of the four roads of Hwy.V was completed by
mid-1976; construction of the fourth road was delayed until March 1978
because of (a) needed design changes; (b) unusually heavy rains; and (c) a
shortage of equipment experienced by the contractor who was awarded two
road sections (para. 3.07). The roads of Hwy.VI were completed by
September 1980, after an extension of one year because of extension of two
roads (para. 3.03). Disbursements after the above dates were largely for
such continuing components as contracts for technical assistance, training
and equipment for which disbursements could be made from either credit.



-5-
3.02      Even though the effectiveness date and thus selection of
consultants and awards of contracts for Hwy.V were delayed by some six
months (para. 2.04), with one exception, road construction contracts were
completed on schedule once contracts were awarded. The fact that the
closing date for Hwy.V had to be postponed for four years was largely due
to delays in recruiting expatriates for technical assistance and training.
Recruiting met with difficulties when working conditions in Ethiopia became
less attractive, first because of the revolution in 1974 and later because
of hostilities in Ogaden (para 3.12).
3.03      The need to postpone the closing date of Hwy. VI by two years was
largely due to the fact that construction bids were below estimates (after
the experience gained under Hwy.V). This allowed two of the four roads in
this project to be extended by 27 km and 29 km for which contractors were
given  extensions of construction time.
Chafges In the Projects
3.04      Bids for the original six roads in the Hwy.V project were called
in November 1973 and opened January 23, 1974 nearly two years after the
appraisal estimtes were prepared. In the meantime fuel prices had
increased by about 50%, IBA (later ETCA) was no longer tax and duty
free 3/, and the already noticeable political unrest caused uncertainties
whicEiresulted in sharp increases in prices, wages and salaries. From the
21 prequalified contractors, including four local firms, nine bids (six
foreign and three local) were received. Since all bids far exceeded the
appraisal estimates (up to 80Z including the unforeseen taxes) It was
agreed that IRA would be unable to finance the additional cost. Therefore,
it was decided to delete two roads from Hwy.V and to include them in
Hwy.VI. This project change was made official when Credit 552-ET for
Hwy.VI was approved by the Board in April 1975; Section 5.05 of that Credit
Agreement amends Schedules 1 and 2 of Credit Agreement 332-ET.
3.05     Another change was the deletion from Hwy.V of the funds for study
on Rural Roads for the Planning Commission Office (PCO), the financing of
which was taken over by ODM (UK) and carried out by a British consultant
(para. 3.14). No changes were made in the composition of the Hwy.VI
Project, other than the two road extensions mentioned in para. 3.03 and the
reconstruction to higher standards of a bridge across the Didessa River.
Award of Contracts
3.06      Award of construction contracts for both Hwy.V and VI and their
cost 'Ls shown in Table 5.
3/ At appraisal it was agreed that the civil works would be free of taxes
and duties; however, the new Government suspended these arrangements
and the project costs were to include taxes and duties.



-6-
3.07      Once contracts for Hwy.V were awarded in mid-1974, after a delay
of about nine months compared with the appraisal estimate, progress was
satisfactory and construction of three of the four roads was completed on
schedule. The exception was the Asela-Dodola road, the contract for which
was let with the Butajira-Ziway road to the same Ethiopian contractor; as a
result the contractor was short of equipment. He availed himself of an
Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank (AIDB) sub-loan for
contractor's equipment, but ordering and delivery of that equipment took
time. Moreover, rains in the region were unusually heavy, and some
redesign of drainage facilities and the raising of some sections of the
roadbed were necessary. Consequently, the contractor was granted a
postponment of completion date.
3.08      The contracts for three of the four roads in Hwy.VI were let with
a delay of about three months, largely due to a delay in credit
effectiveness. Opening of bids was in late 1975 and early 1976.
Commencement of work schedules was staggered so as to accommodate
contractors still working on the Hwy. V project roads. Progress on the
Hwy.VI roads was also satisfactory and the works were completed virtually
on schedule. Quality of the construction works was satisfactory, except
for the negotiated 27 km extension to Bedele on which the contractor failed
to carry out repairs; this gave EHA reason to call the performance bond and
to carry out the repairs by force account.
3.09      The fourth road of the Hwy.VI project was satisfactorily
constructed by force account. Start of the work was slow because of the
need to order additional equipment, delivery of which was delayed.
Management of these works was carried out by one of the partners in the
consultants' joint venture responsible for the supervision of construction
of the roads in both Rwy.V and VI.
Supervision of Construction
3.10      Supervision was carried out by a joint venture of two consulting
firms from the United States. Their task included review of design and
cost estimates prepared by IRA staff (later ERA and ETCA), and
pre-qualification of contractors. A condition of their contract was to use
and on-the-job train seconded domestic staff to a maximum extent.
Trtin±og of BICA's staff and of Ethiopian Contractors
3.11      The technical assistance to ETCA (former IHA and EHA) initially
intended to be financed under project Hwy.V included:
(a) an expert in technical auditing and costing;
(b) a design expert;
(c) an expert to assist in coordinating the activities of ETCA's
Equipment and Supply Division; and
(d) a computer programmer.



-7-
The computer programmer was eventually provided by _he computer supplier
and financed from Highway VII (Cr. 708-ET). When by November 1976
contracts for the experts (a)-(c) expired, a total of 96 man months had
already been provided. Since a substantial uncommitted balance in Hwy. V
became available after two of the six roads to be constructed were deleted,
the Government requested, and IDA agreed, to finance an additional 108
man-months of expatriate experts in the following fields:
man-month
(a) construction management specialist                    24
(b) construction project management trainer               12
(c) equipment operations specialist                       12
(d) rural roads training production unit
(TPU) instructor                                    24
(e) road performance monitoring expert                    18
(f) agricultural/transport economist                      18
108
3.12      Unfortunately, the recruitment of experts met with difficulties.
The revolution in 1974, the hostilities in Ogaden, and continuing
uncertainties thereafter made working conditions unattractive for
expatriates. A contract for additional technical assistance to both ETCA
and the contracting industry was finally awarded by ETCA in November 1979
to an affiliate of the United Nations in Geneva at a total cost of
US$993,000. This organization also encountered recruiting difficulties,
and commencement of its activities was delayed until mid 1980. As a
result, only US$193,000 of this contract could be used prior to the Hwy. V
closing date. Since this was enough only for the first six months of
activities, it was decided that the remainder of the contract would be
financed from Highways VI and VII. However, because of the delays in
recruitment of expatriate staff, ETCA became dissatisfied with this
organization's services in late 1980 and suspended their contract.
Subsequently, experts for most of the technical assistance positions were
hired from an American consulting firm, already retained for services under
Hwy.VII. For reasons of administrative convenience all services provided
by that firm were financed from Hwy. VII. As a result, only about
US$287,000 and US$110,000 were disbursed for technical assistance and
training under Hwy.V and VI, respectively, but both programs have been
continued under Highways VII.
Equipmert for Training
3.13      While the amounts spent on technical assistance and training
experts were modest, larger amounts have been spent on equipment needed for
training. From its foundation in 1956 until 1975, ETCA's Training Center
in Alemgena near Addis Ababa had turned out some 5,000 supervisors,
foremen, mechanics equipment operators, welders, carpenters, blacksmiths,
etc. This number had increased to about 8,000 by 1982 when some 600
employees were being trained. Training equipment as specified at appraisal



-8-
Training Center were later considerably increased when US$1.4 million was
made available from surplusses in the Hwy.V Credit. Moreover, an
additional amount of US$1.9 million was spent on training equipment for the
Transport Production Units (TPUs), the operations of which are being
financed as part of the First Road Sector Project (Hwy.VII). Finally,
US$200,000 was made available to the Road Transport Authority (RTA) for
training equipment, including driver and operator training aids,engineering
and testing equipment, etc. In general, the training component of both
Hwy.V and VI, continued under the Road Sector Project, has been successful.
Technical Assistance to PCO
3.14      Financing of two foreign experts for two years was included in
Hwy. V project to assist the Planning Commission Office (PCO, since
September 1978 the Central Planning Supreme Council) in completing a study
to identify the structure, staffing and policies of an organization capable
of administering, planning, constructing and maintaining low standard
farm-to-highway roads, and to assist in implementing the study's
recommendations. This component was deleted from IDA financing when ODM
(UK) offered to finance it. The study was carried out by British
consultants, and their report became available in early 1977. The aim of
creating a fully independent Rural Roads Organization within the Ministry
of the Interior proved too ambitious because of staffing constraints, and
overall administration of rural roads had to be left to ETCA. Within ETCA
the rather independent Rural Roads Construction and Maintenance Department
has been established in 1978 which is responsible for the administration,
construction and maintenance of rural roads. Other ministries
(Agriculture, Coffee and Tea Development, State Farms Development,
Industry, Mines and Energy) also build rural roads which are later on
handed over to the Rural Roads Organization to be maintained.
Aid to the Local Contracting Industry
3.15      The Hwy.V project included financing of a contracting expert for
two years to train local contractors in subjects such as costing,
organization and bidding procedures for road construction contracts. This
expert was later incorporated into the technical assistance to ETCA (para
3.11). Implementation of this training met with difficulties and was only
partly successful. Contractors proved to be very reluctant to make
available their scarce senior staff for training courses.
3.i6      The two projects also provided financing of construction
equipment to be used by local contractors who had been awarded contracts
for project roads. Arrangements were made through a Subsidiary Loan
Agreement which allowed contractors to borrow at commercial interest rates
funds from the AIDB for equipment purchases. Hwy.V included US$1.5
million, and Hwy.VI US$2 million to be relent by the Government to AIDB for
this purpose. The Funds were used by two local contractors. The
arrangement was administered by AIDB in a flexible manner. When
contractors encountered serious cash flow difficulties, AIDB agreed with
IDA to relax the repayment schedules from four years to periods more



-9-
closely matching the physical depreciation of equipment. Also the amounts
withheld for retention funds were reduced to relieve the contractors' cash
flow problems. However, the four major civil works domestic firms,
including the two benefitted by the sub-loans, have faced increasing
financial s trains and have accumulated large debts with the National Bank
of Ethiopia (NBE) and its affiliates. By March 1982, loans to the four
companies amounted to Br 91.4 million (US$44.1 million) while work-related
guarantees were Br 31.7 million (US$15.3 million). During the last few
years, the firms have not been able to service their financial obligations
because of the cumulative effects of diminishing works resulting in tough
competition and under-bidding, shortages of fuel and materials, war and
civil unrest, and serious management shortcomings. As a result, in April
1982, NBE took legal action to collect the debts. Pending court rulings,
all four companies have been placed under court administration whicb is
being carried out by senior officials of ETCA.
Procrnextent of Equipment for ETCA
3.17      Under Hwy.V research equipment and materials for the Alemgena
training center were included to develop new pavement design and
construction practices. ETCA was assisted in research work by a UK
organization under a contract financed by ODM (UK). Because of the high
cost of ETCA's traditional practice of using crushed stone for sub-base
material, tests were carried out during the construction works which have
led to a more extensive use of materials available on or near the
construction sites.
3.18      The Fifth Highway Project did not include road maintenance
equipment since USAID financed such equipment under its project, which was
implemented concurrently with Hwy.V (para. 1.05). Hwy.VI, however,
included US$4.5 million for the foreign cost of procurement of highway
maintenance equipment for ETCA (US$4.65 million were actually spent).
Contracts were let on the basis of international competitive bidding for
which bids were opened in November 1975. There appeared to be lively
interest from suppliers anxious to enter the Ethiopian market and prices
were in general below estimates. An additional US$0.25 million was
included in Hwy.VI for equipment and workshops for the maintenance of
rural roads. Additionally, at the time of the closing date of Hwy.VI,
construction of three regional workshops had been completed at a cost of
US$150,000.
Coats of the Two Projects and Disbursements
3.19      The actual, final cost of the two projects, compared with their
estimates at the time of appraisal and the revision of Hwy.V, are shown in
Tables 1 and 2. It must be pointed out, however, that the separation of
costs between Rwy.V and VI is not sharp with respect to technical
assistance to ETCA and to private contractors since a considerable part
thereof, originally intended to be financed from the Fifth Highway Project,
was shifted to Highways VI and VII after the closing date of December 31,
1980 of Hwy.V (para. 3.12).



- 10 -
Perforance of Consulting Firms
3.20 Besides the employment of a number of individual experts, consulting
firms were used for the following tasks:
(a) review of design and cost estimates, and supervision of
construction by contractors of the four roads in Hwy. V and
four roads in Hwys. VI;
(b) management of the construction by force account of the fourth
road in Bwy.VI; and
(c) a team of experts to train ETCA staff and the staff of
domestic contracting firms.
3.21      For the work under (a) the services of a joint venture of two
American consulting firms were retained (para. 3.10). The performance of
this joint venture was satisfactory. For the task under (b) the services
of one of these firms were retained; the performance of their team was also
satisfactory (para 3.09).
3.22      For the task under (c), initially a contract with an affiliate of
an international organization in Geneva, Switzerland was entered into in
November 1979 but suspended a year later after a long delay in commencement
and unsatisfactory performance in the judgment of ETCA. A new contract for
most of the services was then signed with an American firm but their
contract was financed from Highways VII rather than Highways V and VI
(para. 3.12). The services provided by this consultant within this
contract have also been satisfactory.
Performance of Contractors
3.23      Six contracts were let to five contractors for the construction
of seven project roads in Hwy.V and VI (see table 5). One was a combined
contract for two roads, and one road was constructed by force account. Of
the contractors, one was Italian but with domicile in Ethiopia, one was an
Italian/Ethiopian joint venture, and three were Ethiopian. Considering the
difficult circumstances under which the contractors had to work -lack of
order during the revolution and after the Government's Mobilization
Proclamation, temporary but frequent shortages of fuel, parts and
materials, requisitioning of equipment by the military authorities
cash-flow problems because of greatly increased wages and prices, etc.--
performance of the contractors was by and large satisfactory, as was the
quality of their work. Claims, resulting largely from some changes in
design, which caused delays, and from the usual escalation clauses, have
been settled without major difficulties.
Perfortance of ETCA
3.24      With a few exceptions the performance of the IHA and the
subsequent highway authorities responsible for the implementation of most
project components (EHA, ERA and finally ETCA) has been satisfactory
considering that the responsible authorities were faced with a number of
successive statutory reorganizations, in addition to similar difficulties



- 11 -
as those encountered by the contractors.  ETCA made serious efforts to
assist the contractors and the force account team in overcoming their
difficulties. At IDA's suggestion cash-flow problems of contractors were
reduced by paying for materials upon delivery on site, and repayment
schedules for equipment loans from AIDB were relaxed. Good staff and
workers were seconded to the force account team and the supervising
consultants. Simultaneously, maintenance operations were further improved
through the concurrently implemented USAID project (para. 1.05).
Performance was good also with respect to accepting and i-sing technical
assistance and training which were important components of both the Huy.V
and VI projects.
3.25      However, performance was not satisfactory with respect to
compliance with two credit conditions. Control of dimensions and axle
loads of vehicles (sections 3.03 and 3.05 of Credit Agreements 332-ET and
552-ET respectively) was seriously delayed and remained unsatisfactory at
the time of completion of the Hwy.VI project when five weighbridges were
finally installed but only three were operational. Since then, the five
weighbridges have become operational. However, a mitigating circumstance
is that the legislated 8 ton axle load is uneconomic and unrealistic in
view of the load per axle of the modern trucking fleet existing in the
country; new roads are now designed for 10 ton axle loads and some major
corridors up to 12 ton axle loads. Responsibility for the operation of the
weighbridges was transferred from EHA to RTA, making EHA/ETCA no longer
responsible for the axle load control. However, EHA/ETCA remains
responsible for construction and installation of the weighbridges, as an
agent for RTA. The agency relationship and division of responsibilities
were not clearly defined, thus hampering the completion of installation.
During negotiations of the Eighth Highway Project (Second Road Sector
Project), in April 1983, assurances were obtained that the Government will
modify the legislation for vehicle weight control as described above.
3.26      Performance was also unsatisfactory with respect to reporting.
Although ETCA's initially poor accounting procedures have greatly improved
through technical assistance and training as part of the Hwy.V and VI
projects, ETCA has been consistently lax in submitting audit reports and
other required documents to the Association (Section 4.02 of Credit
Agreement 332-ET), with delays of up to 18 months. The draft PCR for the
Hwy.V and VI projects prepared by ETCA was delayed and of little use for
the preparation of the Association's PCR, but a revised final version has
helped in the economic re-evaluation of the projects roads.

3.27      Of the US$17.0 million of Credit 332-ET, US$16.859 million were
disbursed; the remaining US$141,000 were cancelled. The US$32.0 million of
Credit 552-ET were fully disbursed. As may be seen from Tables 6 and 7,
actual disbursements lagged far behind the appraisal forecast. For Hwy.V
the Closing Date was postponed twice, from December 31, 1976 first to June
30, 1979 and again to December 31, 1980. For Hwy.VI the closing date was
postponed from December 31, 1979 to December 31, 1981.

IV. INSTI    ORTIONAL DEVEWRLENT
4.01      Institution building, through the strengthening of IHA (and its
successors EHA, ERA and ETCA), has been perhaps the most important aspect
of the Bank Group's operations in Ethiopia. Also, under Hwy.V and VI, and
again under the follow-on Credit 708-ET (the First Road Sector Project),
technical assistance and training have been, and continue to be, a major
component of the Bank Group financed projects. Moreover, institution-
building has not been restricted to what is now ETCA, but has also been
directed to RTA, to planning and administration of rural roads, and to the
private sector, namely the road contruction industry.
4.02      These institution-building efforts have been quite successful,
and Ethiopia now has one of the better highway administrations and
organizations of Sub-Saharan Africa. Programs carried out through the
Alemgena Training Center, created in 1956, have trained thousands of
workers at all levels, iacluding equipment operators, mechanics and
foremen. Whereas until the end of the Second Highway Project IHA was
managed by the US Bureau of PublUc Roads, a considerable number of senior
staff members were trained abroad and have returned to fill senior
positions in ETCA.
4.03      One of the main reasons that the Bank Group efforts with respect
to institut'on-building have been successful is the positive attitude of
the Government on this matter. The need for continuous technical
assistance and training has been and still is recognized.  Top staff have
been trained abroad allowing qualified Ethiopians to fill executive
positions. However, expatriate expertise is still being used in advisory
capacities.
V. TRE ROLE OF THE GOVERIaU
5.01      Since a considerable degree of autonomy has been vested in the
IHA and its successors (EEA, ERA and ETCA) which has Its independant Board
of Commissioners, the role of the Government has been largely overall
supervision. Of course, the various statutory changes in these highway
administrations, the changes in ministries involved, and later the
creation of a separate Road Transport Authority (RTA) did not always
facilitate the projects implementation.
5.02      By and large the Government has cooperated well with IDA. The
local funds needed for the execution of the projects were made available in
time to IHA/ETCA and the subsequent highway administrations. It has met
its obligation to develop agricultural schemes and programs in the regions
served by the IDA-financed project roads. The fact that results are mixed



- 13 -
is partly due to greatly changed and still changing approaches with respect
to land tenure and land use, putting much responsibility into agricultural
cooperatives. For its part IDA has endeavored to accommodate Government
requests on such matters as making uncommitted funds available for the
financing of equipment for the Rural Road Task Forces, which built roads
for agricultural schemes and projects.
VI. ECON(MIC RE-EVALUATION
6.01      The economic justification of the road construction components of
Hwys.V and VI were based at appraisal on benefits (90% - 95%) to be derived
from marketable agricultural production surpluses in the areas to be served
by the new roads, and for only 5 to 10% of total benefits, on savings in
transport costs. In view of the above, the Bank's Eastern Africa Northern
Agricultural D.Irision (EAPRA) has assisted in assessing the project-related
agricultural data and assumptions.
6.02      The agricultural benefits for the six roads initially included in
Hwy.V were calculated on the basis of a January 1972 report prepared by an
FAO agricultural consultant who analyzed and, to the extent needed,
corrected or amplified feasibility studies prepared by the Planning and
Programming Division of the IHA and an Italian consulting firm. Since the
existing 'without the project" conditions had to be based largely on
assumptions and estimates, it was even more difficult to make reasonably
reliable estimates of future developments and growth of the above basic
factors "with the project".  In the Hwy.V appraisal it is stated that 'it
is impossible to differentiate between the benefits of the road and those
of the MPP". Therefore, the estimated cost of the MPP's were added to
those of the roads, local consumption and losses were deducted from future
agricultural production, to arrive at marketable surpluses reflecting the
benefits of each road in the area it serves. For the two additional roads
included in Hwy.VI the same rathodology was applied. Because of lack of
reliable statisti-cal data most existing conditions had to be estimated,
such as     land use, cropping patterns and yields, cropping intensities,
population and family size, livestock numbers, human food consumption, seed
requirements, storage losses, etc. Although a rather sophisticated
equilibrium agricultural computer model was used at appraisal time as the
basic tool for the forecast of agricultural production surpluses, the
results had to be interpreted with a considerable degree of caution because
of the uncertainties of the inputs.
6.03      On the basis of the sophisticated calculations mentioned above
the average basic economic return for the roads in Hwy.V was estimated at
23%, ranging from 16X for the 120 km Asela-Dodola road to 43% for the 48 km
Butajira-Ziway road. For the roads in Hlwy.VI the estimated economic
returns ranged from 12.1% for the 105 km Nekempte-Bidele road to 17.7% for
the 80 km Bonga-Mizan Teferi road. The estimated economic returns for the
roads in Hwy.VI are considerably lower than for those in Hwy.V because when



- 14 -
Hwy.VI was appraised in late 1974, bids for the Hwy.V roads had already
been opened in January 1974, and showed that actual costs would be much
higher than estimated (para. 3.04). Therefore the cost estimates for the
Hwy.VI roads were higher but more accurate than those for Hwy.V, resulting
consequently in lower economic returns. This was proven by the fact that
for the two roads transferred from Hwy.V to Hwy.VI, the economic returns
were reduced from 21% to 15.6Z and from 22% to 17.7%.
6.04      The cost of the actual roads' investments is now known and the
cost of their maintenance may be estimated within an acceptable margin of
error. However, this is not the case for the cost of the inputs of the
MPP's and other development schemes over the years since 1972. It was
intended that as part of the First Road Sector Project (Cr. 708-ET), a
Project Monitoring and Evaluation Unit would be established to collect,
inter alia, data from MPP relevant to tLe project roads. However, creation
of the unit was delayed and was not established until October 1982; thus,
it was not possible to calculate retroactively the benefits of the lwy.V
and VI projects since data on cost of EPP inputs and on marketable
agricultural surplusses over past years in specific regions of the country
were not available.
6.05      The problem of recalculation of the economic rate of return of
each of the project roads is further aggravated by the fact that
many social and administrative changes have occurred since the appraisals
of both road projects. During the implementation of the Hwy.V and VI
projects, EAPNA supervised the implementation of its MPP I project (Credit
416-ET, PCR dated May 14, 1979) and appraised and supervised the MPP II
project (Credit 1088-ET). Although EAPNA considers that a meaningful,
qualified ex-post evaluation of the two highway projects is not feasible
(see para. 1 of Annex B), it does not imply that the roads were not
economically justified. Actually the first EPP project proceeded well,
but the relatively large number of MPP stations spread all over the country
made it impossible to relate the impact of each one specifically to any
penetration road included in Hwy.V and Hwy.VI. The MPP II is under
implementation and a third, similar project, is now being prepared.
6.06      The previous paragraphs lead to the conclusion that a reliable
quantitative re-evaluation of the economic returns of the Hwy.V and VI
projects is not feasible. However, that does not mean that the projects
were not economically viable and justified. To the contrary, the
inter-relation between penetration road projects and EPP and similar
agricultural development schemes has never been in doubt. The texts of the
appraisal and PCR reports for the MPP I project, and the appraisal report
for the MPP II project make it clear that MPP projects and rural roads of
various standards needed for their implementation, contribute to Ethiopia's
economic development. The Eastern Africa Northern Agricultural Division's
general view on this matter is presented in Annex B of which paragraph 3 is
in particular encouraging.



- 15 -
6.07      A brief report prepared by the Government (Annex A) includes some
information on agricu.ltural inputs and outputs in the roads" zones of
influence. It shows that in 1981/1982 NPP's have produced encouraging
results, at least in quantities. A subsequent report, prepared by ETCA in
1983 with assistance from the Ministry of Agriculture, provides an economic
re-evaluation of construction of all eight roads included in both
projects. The benefit/cost analysis applied in recalculation of ERRs does
not, however, follow the sophisticated model approach applied in the SAR.
Nevertheless, the analysis considers major agricultural inputs (cost of
fertilizers, extension, evacuation) including local consumption and losses,
as well as road construction and maintenance costs, while the benefits
include value of assessed road attributable agricultural surplus --growing
at 3% per annum in the first ten years and 2.5% p.a. thereafter. The
savings in road transport costs were not included in the calculation.
After analyzing the report, it could be concluded thar ERRs were not based
on specific agricultural conditions surrounding each of the project roads,
but rather on general agricultural practices and experience recorded in the
Ethiopian agricultural sector. If the agricultural benefits are assessed
to be somewhat overestimated, that could be possibly offset with absence of
savings in VOC which were not included in calculations of ERRs.
6.08      Notwithstanding the limitations of the analysis, the results
obtained could serve as an indicator of the success of the projects for the
time being --since the 20-year economic life of the project roads started
only recently and the economic re-evaluation may still be considered as
premature. The recalculated ERRs for both projects (presented below) show
that they are generally lower than in SARs with only two out of the eight
roads ERRs below 10.

6.09      Table 8 presents traffic data on six of the eight project roads
for the years 1977-1981. However, it must be recognized that for such
penetration roads traffic data, based on three one-week counts per year,
must be interpreted with great caution since seasonal variations in traffic
may substantially distort the results. The share of passenger cars in the
AADT varies from a low 25% on the Asela-Dodola road to a high 80X on the
Nekempti-Bedelle road. Thus, the data in Table 8 are too incomplete for a
meaningful analysis of annual savings in transport costs in an economic
rate of return re-evaluation.
6.10      In the appraisal report for Hwy.VI, the economic rate of return
on the investment for maintenance equipment was estimated at 24%. However,
the equipment was only a fraction of ETCA's total equipment fleet, the
larger part being financed under the USAID loan (para. 1.05) and by other
bilateral lending agencies. Moreover, not all IDA financed equipment was
used exclusively on road maintenance, e.g., part was used for force account
construction. In view of the above, it is no longer feasible to
re-evaluate the economic return on the Road Maintenance equipment.

VIM. T      ROLE OF ID&
7.01      From the beginning of its invulvement in the sector the Bank
Group has played an active role in the improvement and development of
Ethiopia's road system; this continued under the Ewy.V and VI projects.
Its important role with respect to institution building was already
mentioned in Chapter IV. In addition, the Association was instrumental in
the Government's policy to shift emphasis from main roads to the
construction of penetration roads in conjunction with agricultural
projects. Many IDA suggestions were incorporated into the projects, and
cooperation between IDA supervision missions and the staff of the highway
administrations bas been satisfactory, due in great part to the positive
attitude of the highway administration vis-a-vis outside opinions and
advise. ITDA tried to help strengthening the domestic contracting industry
through training and loans for equipment. Also IDA's suggestion to help
solve the contractors' cash flow problems (paras. 3.16, 3.24) were readily
accepted by ETCA and AIDB. However, serious difficulties arose in 1982,
after completion of both projects, when the contractors failed to repay
their debts to the AIDB, a problem which was outside the control of IDA
(para 3.16).
7.02      IDA was also instrumental in the creation of a Rural Roads
Organization, which will be responsible for the planning and construction
of low class roads. Although the financing of the study which has
eventually led to the creation of this organization was taken over by UK's
OK, IDA identified the need and instigated the study.
7.03      Another important role played by IDA was in assisting the
Government to secure a US$9.3 million loan from USAID for the foreign cost
of a project for asphalting three main roads and for procuring emergency
road maintenance equipment. This project was initially defined and
evaluated by an IDA appraisal mission (para. 1.04)
7.04      Supervision missions took place at regular intervals of about six
months, except in 1974 and the first half of 1975, because of the
disturbances which were taking place in Ethiopia. Another gap between May
1976 and April 1977 was too long. There was a great deal of consistency in
ID& supervision since the same engineer who appralsed the projects was
responsible for supervision of both Ewys. V and VI until early 1979 by
which time the construction works had been virtually completed. The same
engineer was also involved in the early preparation of the follow-on
project, the First Road Sector Project. However, after 1979 several other
Bank staff members became involved in supervision.

ymi. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEauM
8.01      Notwithstanding large changes in Government and statutory changes
in the authorities responsible for the implementation of the project, the
physical components were successfully completed without excessive delay.
The fact that the HBy.V project had to be scaled down because the bids
exceeded the estimates is due largely to the above changes because (a)
political tensions were already apparent at the time of bidding, leading to
sharply increased prices and wages; and (b) the semi-autonomous highway
authorities succeeding the IHA were no longer exempt from duties and
taxes which increased their financial burdens. These problems could not be
foreseen at the time of appraisal and negotiation of Hwy.V. The transfer
of two of the six roads initially included in the Fifth Highway Project to
the Sixth Highway Project was sound and practical.
8.02      Changed political conditions which became more and more
difficult, also hampered recruitment of expatriate experts, particularly
during the hostilities in Ogaden. The main cause for postponing the
closing dates of the two projects (by four years and two years) was the
delay in recruiting experts, rather than the construction of the roads.
Even so, institutional performance continued to improve during
implementation of the project.
8.03      In principle, including funds in both projects for AIDB loans to
successful domestic contractors for the procurement of equipment was sound.
The fact that it was as late as April 1982, well after completion of the
construction works, that the National Bank and AIDB decided to do something
about collecting the contractors" outstanding debts for the AIDB loans and
other advances seem to indicate that this matter was dealt with too
leniently for too long. This issue was, however, largely outside the
control of IDA, although stronger insistance on more promptly reporting and
on audits of both ETCA and AIDB could have identified earlier the lax
collecting procedures.
8.04      A quantitative and meaningful re-evaluation of the economic
returns on the investment in each road, plus those of the related
agricultural development schemes, and subsequent MPP's, is difficult to
carry out because of lack of road-specific reliable agricultural data.
However, in addition to the economic re-evaluation carried out by the
Government, it should be stated that IDA's re-evaluation of MPP I (for
which the projects' roads form the necessary infrastructure) indicates that
agricultural investments were sound and justified.
8.05      Problems encountered during the implementation of both highway
projects were not much different (except for the period of political unrest
and hostilities) from those encountered in most highway projects elsewhere
and have not resulted in any particular lessons to be learned.



- 19 -
8.06      However, one lesson may be learned from the implementation of
these two projects in view of the re-evaluation of their benefits. In
cases where almost 100 percent of the economic benefits of road projects
(rural roads) are to be derived from the agricultural sector, either the
construction of the roads should be a component of the agricultural
project, or a monitoring procedure for the collection of specific data and
statistics during project implementation should be agreed upon in advance
between the Agriculture and Transportation Divisions of the Regional
Projects Department.

A RICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES 1/
GE AL
It is now well established that the construction of a road in a
hitherto inaccessible area is 'not expected to stimulate agricultural
development by it-self unless complimentary activities such as extension
services, fertilizers, improved seeds, etc. are simultaneously forthcoming.
In view of the foregoing during negotiations for the Fifth and
Sixth highway Projects an assurance was given that the Government of
Ethiopia woud establish Minimum Package Programs (MPP's) comprising
e-tension services, credits for fertilizers, seeds and other inputs on the
completed roads. In this section of the report an attempt will be made to
briefly assess the efforts made to increase agricultural production.
In crudely evaluating the impact of the feeder roads some
relevant indicators obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture were used.
It should be emphasized that in the absence of Road Monitoring and
Evaluation System, currently at the initial stage of development, it has
not been possible to apply analytical methods.
In determining the impact of new feeder roads the most important
indicator used is related to Minimum Package plans realized in the zones of
influence or near enough to have an impact on agricultural development. We
do recognize, however, that the extent to which Minimum Package Programmes
have been operational along the completed roads is limited and that the
agricultural production has largely originated from non-adoptors area.
FIFEr HIGHWAY PROJECT
A) ASKL&-IKXDCL ROAD
The Asela Dodola feeder road falls within the influence area of
the Arsi Agricultural Development Unit.
In 1981/82 there were 14 service cooperatives and 25 development
centres along the Asela-Dodola road. The value of consumer goods
distributed in the Project area was 3.1 million Birr while fertilizers and
improved seeds provided to peasants were 172,020 and 42,100 quintals
respectively. In the same fiscal year the agriculural output and surpus
generated from the area was in the amount of 863,000 quintals and 333,000

quintals respectively and this compares favourably with the forecasts made
by SAUTI CONSULTING ENGINEERS (866,799 quintals of total output and 41'3,556
quint als of marketed surplus).
B) G.EHESO-HECN&R
In 1981/82 there were 5 each of service cooperatives and
development centres along the Geleiuso-Mechara feeder road. The value of
consumer goods distributed to peasants in the same fiscal year was 5.3
million Birr while 2998 quintals and 615 quintals of fertilizers and
improved seeds respectively plus 121 quintals and 736 litres of
insecticides were distributed to peasants.
The total agricultural production in the influence area of the
road in 1981/82 was 550,634 quintals of cereals and 1050 quintals of coffee
while the marketed surplus was higher than appraisal estimates by 15% and
22% respectively.
C) MAO
The area traversed by the Agaro-Ghera feeder road is
predominantly Coffe growing. In 1981/82 the formation and functioning of
12 service cooperatives was reported.  The value of consumer goods
distributed to peasants In the fiscal year was 1.7 million Birr while
inputs made available to peasants comprised 300 quintals of fertilizers, 74
quintals of improved seeds, 18,800 units of coffee seedlings, 100 quintals
of insecticieds and 790 of farm implements. Althouh data on total
production and surplus for Cereals was not available, the total coffee
output and surplus of the area in the same year was 23,125 quintals and
22,000 quintals respectively. A comparion of actual coffee production and
surplus with the feasibility study forecasts show that they were higher by
24 percent and 3 percent respectively.
D) ZIAY-3BUTLJIK
In 1981/82 there 4 were service cooperatives and one MPP
development centre established along the Zway-Butajira feeder road. The
value of consumer goods distributed to peasants in the area was 2.9 million
Birr. 1000 quintals of fertilizers, 450 quintals of improved seeds, 24
quintals of dust plus 1200 litres of insecticides were made available to
peasants in the area. Furthermore, 30 sprayers were also given to peasant
associations.
The actual total production and marketed surplus from the project
area was 132,000 quintals and 6,000 quintals respectively. A comparison of
the actual for 1981/82 with the feasibility study forecasts show that the
former was higher by 98% for total agricultural production but lower by 79%
for marketed agricultural surplus.

SITRIGW5&Y PROJECT
A) NEKEHPTI-BEDELLE
In 1981/82 there were 21 service cooperatives and 6 MPP
development centres along the Nekempti-Bedelle feeder road. The value of
consumer goods distributed to peasants in the area was about 479,000 Birr.
In the same fiscal year about 935 quintals of fertilizer, 17 quintals of
improved seeds and 300 litres plus 200 kilograms of insecticides were
distributed to peasants.
Since adequate data on total production and marketed surplus is
not available, it was not possible to evaluate the impact of the road
unlike the other roads. However, from on third of the road area, the
market surplus sold to Agricultural Marketing Corporation (AMC) was 3299
quintals.
B) DEJEN-IfOLA
In 1981/82 there were 18 service cooperatives and 6 MPP
development centres functioning along the Dejen-Mota road.  The value of
consumer goods distributed to peasants in the road influence area was 1.3
million Birr while inputs distributed to peasants consisted of 21,000
quintas of fertilizers, 39 quintas of improved seeds, 1500 kilograms and
665 litres of insecticides.
The total Marketed surplus that was sold to Agricultural
Marketing Corporation was 373,000 quintals which far exceeds the tenth year
forecast made by the feasibility study team.
C) BOGA-IZAN TEFMR
The number of service cooperatives and MPP development centres
established in the area by 1981/82 were 10 and 6 respectively. The value
of consumer goods distributed by the service cooperatives was about 276,000
Birr. Inputs distributed in the same year were 8 quintals of fertilizers,
3 quintals of improved seeds and 3 quintals of dust plus 14 litres of
liquid insecticides.
The actual total output and marketed surplus was 107,500 quintals
and 23,800 quintals respectively which significantly falls short of the
feasibility study estimates.
D) S___FE___G______
In 1981/82 there were 3 service cooperatives and 8 development
centres functioning in the area. The value of consumer goods distributed
by the service cooperatives in the same year was 70,000 Birr. Agricultural
inputs made available to peasants was 1120 quintals of fertilizers and 35
quintals of improved seeds.

OFFICE MEMORANDUM
TO: Mr. Peter Gyamfi, Chief,                                 DATE: December 10. 1982
WM: B.A. Nekby, Chief,
-T: ETHIOPIA: PCR for Fifth and S h ighway Projects
1.        With reference to your memo of December 1, 1982, I regret to state
that a meaningful ex-post evaluation along the lines of the SAR's in my view
is impossible. Some data is available for the MPP I Project (PCR enclosed)
but collection of such information has deteriorated drastically since.
Although MPP II is being supervised by RMEA and EAPXA contacts with Ethiopia
bave been limited due to the compensation issue, recent efforts to analyze
the agricultural sector as a whole (a draft sector report will be available
next week) have revealed grave questions about the inconsistencies in the
data base.  The MPP II monitoring and evaluation efforts have suffered much
from the exodus of staff a-nd is forcing us to make an impressionistic Mid-
Term Review (planned for March 1983) to give us some idea of what is going
on.
2.        The 70's have, as-you note, seen major changes in Ethiopian
agriculture. A major land reform was successfully implemented in 1975.
This was accompanied by a major redistribution of income and increase in
rural consumption and concurrently a drop ici marketed peasalt production.
On aggregate, agriculture grow-th does not appeaz to have kept pace with the
expanding population thereby further depressing marketed peasant production.
Our impression is that yield increases through MB? efforts or otherwise have
been minor, partly due to a deterioration of the grainffertilizer price ratio
leading to stagnation in fertilizer consumption and partly due to a switch
away from effective agricultural extension toward efforts in the fields of
cooperative organization. What has happened with respect to area expansion
is a bit of a puzzle (due to data inconsistencies) and would vary from one
area to another. I would guess that some expansion has taken place in the
areas served by your roads (certainly in the area of the Asalla-Dodola Road
which I have observed and for which a 47% increase in cultivated area is
reported between 1966-78). The Swedish supported ARDU Project (originallv
called CADU) has by far the best data and the best established monitoring/
evaluation system but also there I observed in 1981 a sharp deterioration
which made it impossible to derive any firm estimates of the benefits of the
project.   In that particular area, the indicaticns however are that a positive
rate of return has been achieved to the investments (including your road and
others built by ARDU).  A SIDA evaluation report is available but although
some data are quoted the above judgement is again mainly impressionistic. In
conclusion, I am not surprised that GOE is having difficulties coming up with
the requested infornation and I very much doubt that you will be able to
gather much useful data by sending a mission to Ethiopia.
3.        The absence of data and temporary 'suspension' of purposeful efforts
to improve agricultural production should however not be taken as a condemnation
of the road investments. GOE has created a very valuable basis for future

Annex B
Page 2 of 2
Mr. Peter Gyamfi                                             December 10, 1982
development work through its land reform and institution building achievements
(peasant associations and service cooperatives). Indications are that
Government is again becoming seriously concerned about agricultural growth
and a number of crucial studies and preparation efforts are being planned
(and agreed) for the next 6-9 months which hopefully will contribute to
putting the development work on the rails again. Construction of roads is
a precondition for an effective agricultural effort and very large parts of
Ethiopia can presently not be reached.
4.        This brings me to my last point.  You may be interested in the
attached Annex VIII from the SIDA evaluation report for ARDU (although it was
not prepared by a roads specialist). The Government is proposing (in my view
rightly) more regional decentralization of MPP activities. In this connection two
concerns emerge with respect to roads:
(a) The road construction and maintenance needs are massive.
Local financing establishing a link between the actual
investment and the funding would be preferable. It is unreasonable
to tax the local community at one point in time for the total
anunt of a durable investment and some form of credit financing
would be needed to spread the cost over time. The local taxation
powers and ability will be crucial for recovery;
(b) The ARDU experience points to a deterioration of maintenance
and construction when the responsibilities for these tasks were
handed over to the central agency ETCA,. Can we think along the
lines of more regional autonomy in the planning, financing,
construction and maintenance of rural roads? What would such
a regional unit look like? This together with other decentrali-
zation will be important issues in preparation of MPP III.
