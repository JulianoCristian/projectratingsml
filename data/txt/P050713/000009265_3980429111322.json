    Development Project in Argentina is to identify, establish,\n            and evaluate conditions supporting the realization of\n            judicial administrative reform and eventually forming part\n            of an overall legal reform program. The project's\n            components are three. The first, Court Management, reviews\n            the organization and court and case management of the\n            seventeen model courts. It has two subcomponents. The first\n            develops administration policies and strategies between the\n            different levels of the judiciary; finalizes the court\n            management plan and prepares studies; and designs case\n            management procedures incorporating operational standards\n            and statistics which verify and control changes being\n            implemented. The second subcomponent develops a permanent\n            solution to reduce the number of pending cases within the\n            selected courts. The second component improves the skill\n            levels within the court system for both judges and court\n            personnel in court administration and case management by\n            developing an education policy and training judges and court\n            personnel. The third component comprises outreach activities\n            and a number of reviews to evaluate the results of the model\n            courts by creating judicial information centers, conducting\n            user opinion surveys, disseminating information to the\n            public, and evaluating the project."}, "docdt": "1998-03-04T00:00:00Z"}
