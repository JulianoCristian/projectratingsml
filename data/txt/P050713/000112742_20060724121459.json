Bank performance and borrower performance are\n            unsatisfactory. Among the lessons cited were: (a) In such\n            difficult sector circumstances, the lack of an adequate risk\n            analysis with careful assessment of the borrower's\n            implementation capacity and commitment to reform was\n            particularly costly. (b) The Project should not have been\n            started when the judiciary's governance structure may\n            have been undergoing a substantial change. Neither should\n            the Bank have persisted in pushing a project when there was\n            lack of commitment from the authorities responsible for its\n            execution. (c) In the light of the two aforementioned\n            points, the key prerequisites for future Bank-supported\n            judicial activity in Argentina should include (1) a clear\n            project concept and design; (2) a strong understanding by\n            the judicial authorities of the project's concept and\n            objectives; (3) the assurance of adequate independence for\n            the judiciary for the task; (4) assurance of adequate\n            \"ownership\" of the proposed design and work plan;\n            (5) provisions for building project execution capabilities\n            in the courts; (6) a realistic time frame; and (7) selection\n            of a good lending instrument. (d) The design and supervision\n            of computerized systems intended for integrated management\n            improvements need to be closely monitored."}, "docdt": "2006-03-15T00:00:00Z"}
