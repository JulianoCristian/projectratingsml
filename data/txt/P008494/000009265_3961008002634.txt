HUNGARY                 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
BUDAPEST URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:          Municipality of Budapest
Beneficiaries:     Budapest Transport Company (BKV) and Municipality of Budapest
Amount:            US$38.0 million equivalent
Terms:             Fifteen years maturity including a grace period of five years at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate.
Poverty Category:  Not applicable
Objectives:        The overall objective is to support the urban transport reforms undertaken
by the City of Budapest and BKV. Specific objectives are to: (a)
modernize and increase the commercial orientation of BKV; (b) implement
a parking control policy; (c) decrease subsidies to BKV by reducing
operating costs, increasing tariffs and separating noncore activities, and
by introducing the private provision of public transport services; (d)
contribute to the improvement of air quality in Budapest; and (e) establish
a formal contractual relationship between BKV and the City of Budapest.
Description:       The project would consist of: (a) the replacement of 50 worn-out buses
with low-polluting and energy-efficient substitutes; (b) the rehabilitation
of about 47 km of wornout tramway tracks and the purchase of track
maintenance equipment; (c) the second phase of an automatic vehicle
monitoring system; and (d) technical assistance and training in financial
management, economic evaluation of projects, marketing, organization,
and technical issues.
Justification:     Car ownership, traffic congestion, and air pollution are increasing rapidly
in Budapest. Past subsidies, which Government can no longer afford,
contributed to an uneconomically high level of services, ridership, and
employment, while the financial constraints that followed contributed to
the physical deterioration of the system.  To address these issues,
Budapest is introducing a parking management scheme, improving the
coordination of urban transport services, introducing private transport
services on a trial basis, and improving investment selection. BKV is also
taking steps to increase its cost recovery, reduce fare evasion, improve
operational performance, separate noncore activities, and contract out
additional construction  activities.   The institutional improvements

official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.  I

supported by the project are expected to reduce the cost of public and
private transportation, and thereby increase real incomes.
Risks:             The greatest project risk is that BKV will fail to meet its cost recovery or
operating ratio targets, resulting in a further det;erioration of plant and
operations. Tnis could result from the failure of the Municipality to
approve timelv and sufficient tariff increases, or to provide an adequate
level of subsidy.  Experience in other countries demonstrates that
maintenance deteriorates when pujblic transport organizations have
insufficient funds. However, the Municipality and BKV have already
increased BKV's cost recovery from 19 percent in 1986 to 34 percent in
1994. They have provided assurances at all levels that they will take the
necessary steps to meet the 50 percent cost recovery target by 2000. In
addition, BEKV :is satisfactorily implementing their component of the
Second Transport Sector Proiect and the EBRD Urban Transport Project.
Financial risks are ttleefOre considered to be acceptable.
A second project risk is that the Municipality or BKV might proceed with
a major uneconomic investment, thereby undermining financial capacity
to pursue project and increase self financing. The project includes a
covenant requiring the Municipality or BKV to demonstrate that all major
new transport investmenis have an ERR of at least 10 percent.

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF
THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE MUNICIPALITY OF BUDAPEST
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF HUNGARY
FOR THE BUDAPEST URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Municipality of Budapest with the guarantee of the Republic of Hungary
for the equivalent of US$38 million to help finance the Budapest Urban Transport Project. The
loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of fifteen years,
including a five-year grace period.
2.    Country/Sector Background. The evolution of Budapest and its urban transport needs
mirrors the transition of the Hungarian economy. In terms of scale, Budapest accounts for about
20 percent of total Hungarian population and about 25 percent of all jobs, and therefore its
management and finances are important national features. With the 1990 Self-Government Act,
local governments now have clear jurisdiction over local infrastructure and services (including
urban roads and public transport), together with the requisite fiscal and spending powers.
Central government allocations to Budapest have been declining as a share of municipal
resources to about 50 percent in 1994, indicating increasing reliance on local revenue and
borrowing. Like the central government, Budapest is attempting to pursue policies which find
the balance between economic growth and social development, protect the environment, tailor
expenditures to fit available resources, and use public funds only when expected benefits exceed
costs.
3.    One of the most urgent short-term issues facing Budapest is the relative roles of mass
transport services and the automobile. While mass transport predominates (currently 70 percent
on a per trip basis), this is now changing as the result of economic restructuring, and the use
of autos has doubled in the last 10 years. Until recently, mass transport fares were quite low,
but now cover 34 percent of costs. Low fares and an extensive transit network explain why the
usage of mass transport in Budapest has been one of the highest in the world. Subsidies to mass
transport currently account for about 12 percent of the city's budget. Increased street congestion
negatively affects the services and costs of public transport modes, and generates strong
pressures for greater spending on road improvements.
4.    Budapest is now pursuing a comprehensive approach to the provision, pricing and
financing of mass transport. It is also Budapest's policy to slow down (and in some cases,
arrest) the shift toward private cars; on the other hand, recognizing the link between economic
growth and transport, it will also consider new road projects where justified. It is also the
Municipality's strategy to both increase cost recovery from passengers and increase the
efficiency of public transport modes. The Municipality is also committed to increasing the role
of the market in the urban transport system, including privatization.

5.    The Budapest Transport Company (BKV) operates all bus and rail-based public transport
operations serving the city. It is, by and large, an efficient and relatively well-managed
company, in the main stream of the European tradition, but burdened with the inheritances of
a command economy. Its fleet is inefficient and environmentally unsound. BKV is overstaffed
(particularly in nonoperating departments), and it relies on in-house capability for functions only
remotely related to public transport. Starting in 1991, BKV has been using outside assistance
to diagnose these issues and develop plans for future improvements. It is also the beneficiary
of a small component (US$4.0 million) of the Second Transport Project (Loan 3032-HU, 1989,
US$95 million) which has been effectively used to establish a traffic control system. Key
aspects of BKV's investment plans are determined by their strategy to replace all buses over 12
years old and to replace obsolete big panel track on the most heavily travelled tram routes. The
project will complement an ongoing EBRD Urban Transport Project which is financing
rehabilitation of a metro line, purchase of 260 buses and replacement of bus engines, and
installation of on street pay parking.
6.    Project Objectives. The overall objective of the Bank's Urban Transport Project is to
support the urban transport reforms undertaken by the City of Budapest and BKV. Specific
objectives are to: (a) modernize and increase the commercial orientation of BKV; (b) implement
a parking control policy; (c) decrease subsidies to BKV by reducing operating costs, increasing
tariffs and separating noncore activities, and by introducing the private provision of public
transport services; (d) contribute to the improvement of air quality in Budapest; and (e) establish
a formal contractual relationship between BKV and the City of Budapest.
7.    Project Description. The project would consist of: (a) the replacement of 50 worn-out
buses with low-polluting and energy-efficient models; (b) the rehabilitation of about 47 km of
tramway tracks and the purchase of track maintenance equipment; (c) implementation of the
second phase of an automatic vehicle monitoring system; and (d) technical assistance and training
in financial management, economic evaluation of projects, marketing, organization and technical
issues.
8.    Project Implementation. The project would be implemented during 1995-99 by BKV
and the Municipality of Budapest, with coordination from the Project Implementation Unit
(PIU), headed by the Mayor of Budapest, which has already been established. Buses and tram
track renewal would be procured under ICB, and track maintenance equipment and the automatic
vehicle monitoring system by LIB and international shopping.
9.    Lessons learned from Previous Bank Involvement. The First Transport Project (Loan
2557-HU, 1985, US$75 million), provided assistance to railways (MAV), to the road system
including the construction of a 15 km section of the Budapest Ring Road (MO), and to a
parastatal trucking company (Hungarocamion). It was completed satisfactorily, although the
railway's financial performance was less than projected due to substantial traffic losses resulting



- 3 -
from the economic restructuring. The Second Transport Project included follow-up assistance
in the same three sectors plus a US$4.0 million component for BKV for a traffic control system.
The latter was satisfactorily implemented and is now 100 percent committed and 90 percent
disbursed. The road component is close to completion. The financial performance of MAV and
to a lesser extent of Hungarocamion deteriorated further during implementation of the Second
Project for the same reasons listed above. In February 1994, an agreement was reached with
the Bank on a three-year Business Plan for MAV and an Action Plan for HC; but the situation
is still deteriorating because of a continuing sharp decease in traffic and a failed attempt to
reduce costs. The Roads Project (Loan 3549-HU, 1993, US$90 million) became effective on
December 5, 1993 and is about one-third disbursed. Physical implementation is satisfactory and
road safety has improved significantly under the project, but road maintenance has recently
slowed due to budgetary constraints.
10.   Project Completion Reports have been prepared Bank-wide for about 15 urban transport
projects or urban projects with significant transport components. Physical components were
generally completed as planned and cost estimates were generally of the right order. All public
transport companies made operational improvements. Institutional and policy initiatives were
partly successful. For example, bus fares were successfully increased in Kuala Lumpur and to
a lesser extent in Bombay and Madras, but not in Calcutta and Ivory Coast due to political
interference. Past urban transport projects also demonstrate the importance of ensuring that
there are sufficient funds for maintenance; this in turn depends on increasing cost recovery.
11.   The main lessons learned from past Hungarian transport projects are: (a) the impact of
economic transformation on public transport enterprises has been very large and has exceeded
earlier expectations -- it must therefore be addressed by a commensurate action plan; (b)
increased cost recovery is important, and related objectives and timing should be discussed and
agreed up front; (c) training can have a rapid positive impact if it is linked to specific
institutional objectives and related technical assistance; (d) technical specifications must be
prepared early, so as not to delay the procurement process. These lessons have been taken into
account in the design of this project.
12.   Project Sustainability. The Municipality and BKV have demonstrated their commitment
by undertaking reforms and by satisfactorily implementing the Second Transport Project. At all
levels they have provided assurances regarding the project's objectives. Increasing BKV's cost
recovery to 50 percent under the project will help ensure that assets are properly maintained and
alleviate pressure on Municipal and State budgets by allowing a significant reduction of subsidies
for public transport. Project reforms and benefits are therefore considered to be sustainable.
13.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed project is designed to pursue one of
the key objectives of our country assistance strategy--namely to help raise the efficiency of social
and economic infrastructure while opening sectors to private sector initiatives (to be discussed



- 4 -
by the Board on June 15, 1995). By increasing the commercial orientation of a major public
transport company and introducing the private provision of services, the project would contribute
to the larger aims of reducing the public role in the economy as well as to pursue economic
development in an environmentally sound way.
14.   Agreed Actions. During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following principal
matters:
(i)   The Municipality will not incur any debt if the estimated debt service for any
succeeding fiscal year would be more than 15 percent of its cash income for the
twelve-month period preceding the incurrence of the debt;
(ii)   BKV will implement an action plan, acceptable to the Bank, which includes
measures to reduce fare evasion to 7 percent of gross receipts during 1997 and
thereafter, improve its operational and financial productivity, and separate
noncore activities;
(iii)  By December 31, 1996, the Municipality will either award at least two transport
routes operated by BKV to privately owned operators or have regular passenger
services operated by BKV subcontracted through competitive tender so as to
reduce BKV's bus fleet requirement by at least 5 percent;
(iv)  BKV will achieve cost recovery rates not lower than 37 percent in 1995, 41
percent in 1996, 43 percent in 1997, 45 percent in 1998, 47 percent in 1999 and
50 percent in 2000 and thereafter;
(v)   The Municipality will initiate tariff increases at its General Assembly that are
necessary to enable BKV to achieve its cost-recovery objectives and also provide
sufficient funds to enable BKV to achieve an operating ratio of 100 percent in
1995 and thereafter;
(vi)  BKV's debt service coverage ratio will be no less than 1.5; and
(vii)  The Municipality and BKV will consult with the Bank on their transport
investment plans annually, and will only undertake transport investments greater
than US$5.0 million which have an ERR greater than 10 percent calculated in
accordance with a method acceptable to the Bank.
15.   During negotiations, the borrower presented the following documents they have adopted,
which are acceptable to the Bank:



(i)   The Urban Transport Policy Statement; and
(ii)   The Project Implementation Plan. It includes a Municipal Action Plan, which
defines the steps for improving parking management, establishing a Budapest
Transport Association, and preparing an annual performance plan for
implementating the performance agreement between the Municipality and BKV.
16.   The signature of an agreement between the Municipality and BKV (under which the
Municipality will make available part of the proceeds of the loan to BKV, and BKV will provide
sufficient funds to the Municipality to service the loan) will be a condition of loan effectiveness.
17.   Environmental Aspects. The project has been placed in Category B since all physical
components involve rehabilitation or the replacement of equipment. Compliance with Hungary's
environmental regulations will serve to mitigate any negative impacts, which are expected to be
minor.
18.   The project is expected to have environmental benefits. About 50 percent of Budapest's
air pollution, including 90 percent of its lead emissions, are attributable to the transport sector,
and 10 percent of the total is due to public transportation. Adoption of representative West
European standards for bus engines, which are required by Hungarian law, will reduce carbon
monoxide emissions by about 20 percent, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide emissions by 50
percent, and particulate emissions by 75 percent. The bus components of the combined EBRD
and Bank-financed projects, together with an ongoing program of engine conversions, are
expected to reduce harmful emissions in Budapest by about 2 percent. The Bank's Environment
Strategy Study also recommends that a "special effort should be taken to maintain and enhance
the viability of mass public transit," since the reduction of car use in the city center will
decrease congestion and improve air quality. During traffic jams, SO2 and NO measurements
were found to exceed safe limits 60 percent of the time. Tram track renewal and the AVM
system will improve the quality of public transport service and help to slow the expected
increase in automobile traffic, as will the new parking policy. Track renewal is expected to
reduce tram noise by about 50 percent and help reduce building damage caused by tram
vibration.
19.   Program Objective Categories: The project is expected to contribute to environmentally
sustainable development, together with a complementary EBRD project, by reducing air
pollution in Budapest by about two percent (para. 18). It is also expected to improve economic
management by increasing the commercial orientation of BKV, and contribute to the
development of the private sector by introducing the private provision of public transport
services. Although not rated as "Poverty Category: Program of Targeted Interventions" in
accordance with O.D. 4.15, a larger proportion of the poor use BKV than are in the population



as a whole, and will benefit from the improvements in public transport services supported by
the project.
20.   Project Benefits. The institutional improvements supported by the project are expected
to reduce the cost of public and private transportation, and thereby increase real incomes. The
project is estimated to have an ERR of 21 percent based on reductions in future capital and
operating costs resulting from the investments in buses, track renewal and the vehicle operating
system.  This understates the economic return for the project since it does not include
institutional or environmental benefits.
21.   Risks. The greatest risk is that BKV would fail to meet its cost recovery or operating
ratio targets, a major institutional objective.  This could result from the failure of the
Municipality to approve timely and sufficient tariff increases, or to provide an adequate level
of subsidy. This is a common problem in Central and Eastern Europe, where high levels of
inflation, recession, and unemployment sometimes make it difficult to increase tariffs or
implement other market reforms. However, the Municipality and BKV have already increased
BKV's cost recovery from 19 percent in 1986 to 34 percent in 1994. They have provided
assurances at all levels that they will take the necessary steps to meet the 50 percent cost
recovery target by 2000. In addition, BKV is satisfactorily implementing its component of the
Second Transport Project and an EBRD urban transport project. Financial risks are considered
to be acceptable.
22.   A second project risk is that the Municipality or BKV might proceed with a major
uneconomic investment, wasting scarce resources and overburdening Municipal and central
government finances. In order to reduce this risk, The Municipality and BKV agreed at
negotiations to consult with the Bank on their transport investment plans annually, and only to
undertake transport investments greater than US$5.0 million that have an ERR greater than 10
percent.
23.   Other risks include BKV's lack of experience in procuring buses under ICB, and in
implementing a track renewal program that is significantly larger than any previously attempted.
However, BKV, assisted by advisors, satisfactorily implemented its component of the Second
Transport Project, and is satisfactorily implementing an ongoing EBRD financed urban transport
project. The proposed project includes technical assistance to help with procurement and
contract administration, and the track renewal program will be carried out by contract(s) which
are packaged so as to assure a good competition from both local and foreign firms.

24.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that this loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
operation.
