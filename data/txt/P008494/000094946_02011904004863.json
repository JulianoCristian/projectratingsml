substantial,\n            Bank performance as satisfactory, and Borrower performance\n            as satisfactory. The Project has succeeded in its overall\n            objective to serve as a vehicle for the urban transport\n            reforms undertaken by the City of Budapest and the Budapest\n            Transport Company. Some key issues have been raised. Among\n            the key sectoral concerns in the Bank, in urban public\n            transport as well as other municipal services, is whether\n            this institution should work with public-owned enterprises\n            with a view to their improvement and development, or merely\n            assist in their move to the private sector or liquidation.\n            Another important lesson for Bank lending to public sector\n            entities is the need to garner Government commitment to key\n            policy reforms. It is important to focus on the basics,\n            including know-how in procurement, accounting, and other\n            project management skills. Another clear lesson is the\n            importance of adaptability shown by both the Borrower and\n            the Bank. The scope of the reform agenda raises an unclear\n            lesson. For physical investment, it is much easier to judge\n            what is doable and not given time and funds, whereas it is\n            not the case with reforms. Another issue in project design\n            where this Project provides mixed evidence is the usefulness\n            of undated covenants."}, "docdt": "2001-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
