Budapest\n            Transport Company (BKV). Specific objectives are to: 1)\n            modernize and increase the commercial orientation of BKV; 2)\n            implement a parking countrol policy; 3) decrease subsidies\n            to BKV by reducing operating costs, increasing tariffs and\n            separating noncore activities, and by introducing the\n            private provision of public transport services; 4)\n            contribute to the improvement of air quality in Budapest;\n            and 5) establish a formal contractual relationship between\n            BKV and the City of Budapest. The project will consist of:\n            1) the replacement of 50 worn-out buses with low-polluting\n            and energy-efficient substitutes; 2) the rehabilitation of\n            about 47 km of wornout tramway tracks and the purchase of\n            track maintenance equipment; 3) the second phase of an\n            automatic vehicle monitoring system; and 4) technical\n            assistance and training in financial management, economic\n            evaluation of projects, marketing, organization, and\n            technical issues."}, "docdt": "1995-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
