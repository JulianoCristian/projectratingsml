                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to support the vision of the Government of Lesotho to secure adequate, sustainable, and clean water supply and to
                         support adequate sanitation services for consumers living in the Lowlands areas. This objective will be accomplished through an APL in two phases. In the first
                         phase, this objective will be reached by: (a) supporting the implementation of the 1999 Water Resource Management Strategy and its related institutional sector
                         reforms; (b) providing for capacity building to ensure sector policy formulation is coordinated with proposed sector legal and regulatory utility reforms; (c)
                         providing for new management mechanisms that promote commercial incentives in the main sector utility - WASA; and (d) financing needed infrastructure for
                         augmenting urban water supply in Maseru with a particular emphasis on high growth peri-urban and industrial areas. A key outcome of this phase includes an
                         improved institutional framework that will support the implementation of reforms as outlined in the 1999 Policy, with the clarification of the roles of the main
                         institutions in the sector as to service provision, regulation and policy making. Utility performance will improve to provide better services through a
                         Performance Agreement (PFA) with specific audited and publicly available indicators as well as support to system expansion. These reforms will set the stage
                         for Phase II of the APL. This phase will be focused on augmenting the bulk supply for the Lowlands that will directly address current severe water scarcity.
                         Phase II is timed to take advantage of the current detailed studies supported by GOL and the EU that will determine the optimized long term solution. The
                         successful implementation of the project will create the sector-wide policy and regulatory framework needed to secure adequate, reliable and affordable water
                         supply and sanitation services, improve governance and autonomy for the provider of these services, and to provide for good water resources management
                         practices to empower the GOL to make choices that will result in adequate supplies over the long term.

                         This Implementation Status Report (ISR) has been completed in conjunction with an implementation support mission to Lesotho between March 28 and April 7, 2011 to provide
                         technical support in the closing phase of Phase I of the Water Sector Improvement Project (WSIP1). The mission reviewed the status of remaining aspects of project implementation,
                         with particular focus on the completion of the last remaining civil works under Component 2 (Augmentation and Extension of Maseru Water Supply). Project implementation is nearly
                         complete, and activities are scheduled to complete by the project closing date of June 30, 2011.
