reforms launched in 1995 to improve public\n            sector management, promote private sector growth, and\n            strengthen the social safety net; and to help Malawi\n            implement policy reforms, especially in the area of\n            financial management, supported by the Credit. The Credit\n            will also assist the Government in maintaining macroeconomic\n            stability by meeting financing requirements (gap) in the\n            balance of payments. In the fiscal accounts, the Credit will\n            enable the Government to maintain an overall non-interest\n            expenditure level at about 24 percent of GDP. This will\n            allow the Government to protect outlays in key social\n            sectors, while reducing domestic borrowing, thereby helping\n            to reduce inflation and interest rates."}, "docdt": "2000-11-27T00:00:00Z"}
