strengthen public school\n            management; improve the planning monitoring and management\n            capacity of central, departmental and local education\n            authorities; and improve educational infrastructure. The\n            project will also attempt to increase the educational\n            systems' equity by ensuring that priority is given in\n            all activities to poor urban and rural areas. The project is\n            comprised of three components. The first is an educational\n            quality component, which will support improvements in the\n            availability of textbooks and instructional materials,\n            competencies of primary school teachers, and curriculum\n            scope, sequence and adaptability. The second component is a\n            modernization of educational administration which will\n            strengthen the management capacity of the education sector\n            at all levels, implement and reform existing budgetary and\n            management functions, develop information management\n            capabilities, and establish a modern student assessment\n            system. The third is an infrastructure improvement component\n            to support the improvement of teaching and learning\n            conditions by rehabilitating and replacing primary school\n            infrastructure in rural and urban poor areas."}, "docdt": "1994-11-14T00:00:00Z"}
