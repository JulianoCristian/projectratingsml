Ultimately, the project\n            will contribute to poverty reduction in the city. The\n            project includes three components: 1) Social and economic\n            infrastructure works will improve the physical environment\n            in poor neighborhoods. Mainly, small infrastructure works\n            will improve streets and drainage on secondary and tertiary\n            networks. Construction/rehabilitation of commercial\n            infrastructure, such as markets and public places, will be\n            included, in addition to social infrastructure, i.e.,\n            standpipes, health posts, schools, and the like. 2) Support\n            to community development, complements the works of the first\n            component, and will specifically, increase community\n            participation in project implementation; and, social\n            services will be provided to poor communities, through the\n            Social Mobilization Program and the Community Subproject\n            Grants, supporting and financing community development\n            activities. 3) The third component, will strengthen the\n            institutional capacity of stakeholders involved with the\n            implementation of the previous two components, through\n            poverty monitoring and analysis, and, project management and implementation."}, "docdt": "1999-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
