“WHEREAS (A) by the Development Credit Agreement of even date herewith between 
the Republic of Djibouti (the Borrower) and the Association, the Association has agreed to make 
available to the Borrower an amount in various currencies equivalent to fourteen million seven 
hundred thousand Special Drawing Rights (SDR14,700,000), on the terms and conditions set 
forth in the Development Credit Agreement, but only on condition that ADETIP agree to 
undertake such obligations toward the Association as are set forth in this Agreement; ”
