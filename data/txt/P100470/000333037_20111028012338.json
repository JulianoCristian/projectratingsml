{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Avian Influenza Control\n            and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project for\n            Romania were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: it is important for the Bank\n            to be proactive and use its various tools (such as\n            suspension of disbursements, re-allocation to faster\n            disbursing sub-components, cancellation, and restructuring)\n            to give a project a chance to go forward more efficiently\n            and smoothly. For example, restructuring of the project\n            enabled it to achieve many positive results. Even though a\n            project such as an avian influenza project needs to be\n            prepared in a hurry and within a short period of time to\n            respond to an emergency situation, it is essential to see\n            that basics aspects for successful implementation are in\n            place. Purchasing equipment for health projects, especially\n            for an input-based project such as an avian influenza\n            project, is generally complicated and time consuming, and a\n            lot of efforts will be required to manage these types of\n            projects. For these reasons, sufficient time should be\n            allowed for completing the project activities, with\n            considerations for possible delays in procurement."}, "docdt": "2011-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
