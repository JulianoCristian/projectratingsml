Avian Influenza (GPAI) for Romania\n            were as follows: outcomes were unsatisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was significant, monitoring and\n            evaluation was negligible, Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: countries\n            that have already effectively controlled avian influenza\n            outbreaks in poultry many not need an emergency project, but\n            rather long term capacity building. The real emergency issue\n            was European Union (EU) accession, but after accession was\n            achieved the government lost interest in the project. The\n            evaluation also notes that following this project, avian\n            influenza is still a threat to Romania. Avian influenza\n            risks cannot be minimized without ensuring adequate capacity\n            in the animal health sector and adequate biosecurity in the\n            poultry sector. Project designs that do not improve\n            biosecurity on commercial farms or backyard systems will\n            miss an opportunity to reduce the likelihood of avian\n            influenza outbreaks."}, "docdt": "2013-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
