1. INTRODUCTION 
1.  This Environmental Management Plan is prepared for the project proposed to the 
Government of Romania by World Bank within its Global Program for Avian Influenza 
(GPAI) and Human Pandemic Preparedness.  The project would support and constitute an 
integral part of a national program to increase Romania's avian and human influenza 
preparedness, i.e. the country's capacity to prevent and control the spread of influenza 
among animals and humans.  
2.  The overall objective of the Project is to minimize the threat in Romania posed to 
humans by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and other zoonoses in domestic 
poultry, and to prepare for the control and response to an influenza pandemic and other 
infectious disease emergencies in humans.  To achieve these goals, three areas will be 
supported:  (i) prevention, (ii) preparedness and planning and (iii) response and 
containment.  Achieving these goals will contribute to diminishing the burden of disease 
and loss of productivity in Romania, limiting the regional spread of HPAI, and enhancing 
economic and social prospects at the national, regional, and global levels.  The proposed 
project would finance activities under four components: i) animal health; ii) human 
health; iii) public awareness and communications; and iv) implementation support, 
monitoring and evaluation. 
3.  Although project activities supporting Avian Influenza (AI) prevention, preparedness 
and planning, and response and containment are not expected to generate significant 
adverse environmental effects, they might present a moderate environmental and human 
health risk from inadvertent spread of the AI virus and waste management.  Overall the 
AI prevention and response-focused activities are expected to have a positive 
environmental impact, as the investments in facilities, equipment, and training for 
veterinary and public health service staff and laboratories will improve the effectiveness 
and safety over existing avian influenza handling and testing procedures by meeting 
international standards established by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) 
and the World Health Organization (WHO).  This would be reinforced by the 
mainstreaming of environmental safeguards into protocols and procedures for the culling 
and disposal of animals during AI outbreaks. 
4.  The Romanian Avian Influenza and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response 
Project (AIHP) has been assigned World Bank environmental category B. The potential 
adverse impacts could be prevented or mitigated by preparing country/project specific 
environmental management plans (EMP) only, with no separate EA report. 
5.  This EMP addresses the moderate adverse environmental effects of the Animal 
Health and Human Health Components.  For these components, the EMP addresses: 
waste management as pertain to disposal of special waste; emissions and materials at 
laboratories; training for veterinary services workers to include procedures for safe 
handling of AI materials; safe disposal of carcasses and infected materials; safe 
production of human influenza vaccine. The EMP provides mitigation plans and 
monitoring plans to ensure appropriate attention to environmental issues, and tracking 
progress or problems in their management.

2. PROJECT 
DESCRIPTION 
2.1 Project 
components 
6. The 
Animal Health Component
 would comprise the following four sub-
components: 
(a) 
Strengthening the Institutional Framework:
 
i. 
The project would provide technical assistance for the 
Evaluation of 
National Veterinary Services
 based on OIE's "Performance, Vision and 
Strategy for Veterinary Services" evaluation guidelines in order to 
establish the current level of performance, form a shared vision with 
service providers and clients in the private sector, establish priorities, and 
facilitate strategic planning. 
ii. 
Based on this evaluation (above), the project would provide support for 
Strengthening Veterinary and Food Safety Institution
 by realigning 
institutional structures and resources at national and local levels with 
priority objectives, mandates, and tasks. In particular, the project would 
support the establishment of animal disease control centers at the national 
and regional levels. 
iii. 
The project would also provide technical assistance to support the process 
of reviewing, integrating, and consolidating existing 
contingency plans
 
and to develop the necessary detailed implementation 
guidelines and 
manuals
 for all relevant agencies and services. 
(b) 
Strengthening Disease Surveillance, Diagnostic Capacity, and Research: 
 
i. 
In order to enhance the 
Surveillance Capacity of Veterinary Services, 
the 
project would provide technical assistance and training for staff of 
veterinary service institutions at national and local levels, focusing on 
collecting and analyzing epidemiological data and performing risk 
assessments. The project would also support transportation facilities and 
arrangements for surveillance field work as needed. The procurement of 
mobile laboratories is being discussed. The project would also provide 
technical assistance and training for 
epidemiological surveys
.
ii. 
In order to equip existing laboratories for the increased work load under 
active surveillance schemes and to minimize the high risk period, the 
project would upgrade the 
diagnostic capacity of national and regional 
laboratories
 by financing priority equipment and laboratory consumables 
including sampling kits, materials for transporting and conditioning of 
samples, reagents, and personal and laboratory protective equipment. The 
project would also enhance the capacity of the Institute for Control of 
Biological Products and Veterinary Drugs to fulfill its responsibility in 
providing 
quality control for vaccine imports and other veterinary 
medicinal products
 for which formal quality assurance has to be provided 
Page  6
3
by the state. 
iii. 
The design, establishment, and use of a comprehensive national 
animal 
disease information system
 would be supported in order to enable an 
effective and efficient flow of information among relevant agencies and 
individuals and providing the necessary support to decision-makers 
charged with the prevention and control of animal diseases at local and 
national levels. 
iv. 
Applied Veterinary Research
 would be supported by providing essential 
equipment, consumables, and technical assistance for ANSVSA's core 
research responsibilities and through a competitive research grant 
program. One veterinary laboratory would be upgraded to 
bio-safety level 
4
in order to build Romania's capacity to conduct vaccine tests on live 
animals for highly infectious animal diseases. 
(c) 
Strengthening HPAI Control Programs:
 The project would contribute to the 
enhancement of disease control capacities by providing 
mobile incinerators
 for 
the safe disposal of carcasses in small-holder systems, and it would provide 
technical assistance and training to develop Romania's 
vaccination policy and 
action plan
,
and train officials in the implementation of vaccination campaigns 
and post-vaccination monitoring. 
(d) 
Improving Bio-security in poultry production and trade:
 The project would 
support enhancements of bio-security on small-holder farms through 
knowledge 
transfers
 and demonstrations aimed at managerial and behavioral changes; as 
well as pilot projects for 
village-level enterprises
 (micro-farms). 
7. The 
Human Health Component
 would comprise the following three sub-
components: 
(a) 
Enhancing Coordination and Program Planning:
 The project would help 
further operationalize the national plan and enhance coordination with both other 
sectors and neighboring countries. More specifically the project would finance: 
i. 
Additional studies and 
research 
and,  
ii. 
Workshops, conferences and consensus meetings.
 
(b) 
Strengthening the National Public Surveillance System:
 The project would 
finance: 
i. 
The upgrading of the National Influenza Laboratory to 
BSL 3
 through the 
financing of minor civil works (partitioning and creation of 
decontamination rooms), the supply and installation of additional security 
devices, and the installation of a system for maintaining negative pressure 
in the rooms; 
ii. 
The strengthening of 
regional laboratories
,
in particular through the 
supply of real time PCR equipment and the training of staff; 
iii. 
The strengthening of the capacity of the regional and district public health 
teams to 
investigate
 and control outbreaks through the supply of 
Page  7
4
equipment and - when needed - the re-training of staff. 
(c) 
Strengthening the Health Care System Capacity:
 The project would finance:  
i. 
The strengthening of the isolation and case management capacity through 
the equipment of the two Bucharest infectious diseases hospitals and the 
establishment of isolation and 
intensive care units
 in 7 of the regional 
hospitals for infectious diseases (Brasov, Craiova, Constanta, Cluj, Iasi, 
Timisoara and Tg. Mures). According to the National Plan, during the 
inter-pandemic period, all suspected cases shall be transported to and 
isolated at the Institute of Infectious Diseases Prof Dr Matei Bals, where 
medical assistance can be provided by specialized dedicated personnel. 
The centralization of patient care is part of the MOH strategy to ensure 
high quality care to suspected or confirmed AI human cases. However, 
there is a need to develop isolation and intensive care capacities in 
regional infectious diseases hospitals. 
ii.  The upgrading of the 
influenza vaccine production
 unit at the 
Cantacuzino Institute including the rehabilitation and equipment of the 
influenza production department, and the completion and equipment of the 
filling and sealing unit. A significant part of the vaccines needed in 
Romania during the inter-pandemic and pandemic periods can be 
produced by the Cantacuzino Institute. Making the Institute able to 
significantly increase up to 2.5 million doses and its production in full 
compliance with GMP standards requires the upgrading of both the 
production unit and the filling and sealing station. This intervention will 
help both to increase the production capacity and to ensure that the 
production is at the required Good Manufacturing Practice standards. 
8. The 
Public Awareness and Communications Component
 would support the 
GOR
’s efforts in designing and implementing an integrated and comprehensive 
communications strategy and action plan for AI. The component will be jointly 
implemented by MPH and ANSVSA, and would comprise the following three sub-
components: 
(a) 
Strengthening institutional capacity for MPH and ANSVSA:
 the project 
would support assistance for and training of communications staff, and additional 
equipment and operating costs for the communications teams in the two agencies; 
(b) 
Development of an integrated strategy and action plan based on qualitative 
and quantitative research:
 the project would build on the experience gained 
from the information campaigns of UNDP, UNICEF, USAID, as well as on the 
sectorial communications strategies of WHO and UNICEF, and the 
communications needs assessment of ANSVSA. The strategy would define 
parameters of specific audiences in various generic target groups, the degree of 
social acceptance of proposed hygiene and bio-security measures, the associated 
messages which would need to be persuasive without creating panic, and the most 
efficient delivery tools and vehicles for a nation wide campaign. 
(c) 
Delivery of several information campaigns:
 these would aim to obtain the 
Page  8
5
public
’s support and participation in reporting and monitoring; to promote and 
induce a set of behavior changes which will diminish the possibility of AI 
outbreaks and contamination; and to educate different key audiences (farmers, 
people living in villages, traders, local authorities, media, children, teachers, 
health care workers, food inspectors, front line workers, consumers, other 
stakeholders). 
9. 
Implementation Support, Monitoring and Evaluation.
 The project would be 
implemented by the MPH and ANSVSA, and would build upon the already existing 
Project Management Units in the two respective agencies. The project would finance: 
(a) Incremental support to the two PMUs in terms of staff and operating costs; 
(b) Studies, technical services, manuals; and 
(c) Surveys for monitoring and evaluation. 
2.2 
Geographic areas of coverage 
10. The project will cover the whole territory of Romania. Some of project’s actions 
target to staff of veterinary service institutions at national, regional and local levels, 
others to well defined institutes or hospitals already mentioned above.

3. 
OVERVIEW OF APPLICABLE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL 
LEGAL PROVISIONS AND GUIDANCES 
11. A summary from international guidance on best practice in safety of research 
laboratories is attached in Annex 1 and Annex 2. Some environmental and safety 
considerations on mobile incinerators used in disposal of animal carcasses as presented in 
the World Bank Guidelines for GPAI projects are summarized in Annex 3.  
12. The national legislation is very comprehensive and fully transposes the EU directives. 
Considering the 
project’s overall objective as well as the specific actions of the project’s 
sub-components and sub-sub-components described in chapter 2 above only the main 
legal provisions related to EIA, activity permitting, sanitary-veterinary activity and 
laboratory practice, hazardous waste management and air pollution are briefly presented 
in the following 3.1 – 3.14 sections.  
3.1 EIA 
process 
13. Any development project involving a building process needs the “development 
consent” and the “construction permit”. Prior to these legal acts, the “
environmental 
agreement
”
as legal act is mandatory for projects with significant environmental impact; 
this is issued on the basis of EIA process, according to the procedure described in MO 
860/2002 of MoE, as subsequently modified by MO 1037/2005 of MoE. The projects 
with potential significant environmental impact due to their nature are subject first to a 
screening procedure that takes into account especially the project location. The competent 
authorities for conducting the EIA process are the local, regional and central 
environmental authorities. 
3.2 Operating 
permit 
14. 
Operating permits 
for existing activities or new activities prior to commissioning are 
issued by the involved authorities (Law 359/2004), for instance: Local representatives 
under ANSVSA for veterinary permit; Local Work Inspectorate (authorities under MoL) 
and Public Health Directorate for the health & safety permit; local representatives of 
ANAR for water permit. 
15. The environmental permit is issued by the local or regional environmental authorities 
for activities with significant and moderate environmental impact (OM 876/2004 of 
MoE). The present environmental legislation does not provide for 
permitting of 
temporary activities
 such as incineration of animal carcasses in case of avian influenza. 
16. The 
IPPC installations
 should obtain 
the integrated environmental permit; this is 
issued by the regional environmental authorities (EOG 152/2005 transposing the IPPC 
Directive 96/61/EC), on the basis of a very detailed application by whom the installation 
operators have to demonstrate that the activity is in compliance with requirements of best 
available techniques (BAT) both for technological processes and for management 
techniques; “technique” include both the technology used and the way in which the 
installation is designed, built, maintained, operated and decommissioned while “best” 
'best` means the most effective in achieving a high general level of protection of the 
environment as a whole. Considerations to be taken into account generally or in specific 
Page  10
7
cases when determining best available techniques, are the following:  
-
the use of low-waste technology;  
-
the use of less hazardous substances;  
-
the furthering of recovery and recycling of substances generated and used in the 
process and of waste, where appropriate;  
-
comparable processes, facilities or methods of operation which have been tried 
with success on an industrial scale;  
-
technological advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding;  
-
the nature, effects and volume of the emissions concerned;  
-
the commissioning dates for new or existing installations;  
-
the length of time needed to introduce the best available technique;  
-
the consumption and nature of raw materials (including water) used in the process 
and their energy efficiency;  
-
the need to prevent or reduce to a minimum the overall impact of the emissions on 
the environment and the risks to it;  
-
the need to prevent accidents and to minimize the consequences for the 
environment. 
Implementation of an EMS 
–
certified or not – is also encouraged. 
3.3 
Environmental Monitoring and Control 
17. Any social and economic activity is monitored and controlled with regard to its the 
effects on the physical and biological environment and on public health. Monitoring will 
be performed by means of two types of actions: 
·
Monitoring by the relevant authorities with control powers, such as: 
-
Authorities of the local administration – on municipality and county level 
-
Public authorities for environmental protection  
-
Environmental Guard 
-
National Administration Romanian Waters (ANAR) through its local 
subsidiaries 
-
General state inspectorate for safety of constructions (GSISC) 
-
Local public health and sanitary-veterinary authorities 
-
Other authorities (e.g. occupational safety, fire department and so on.) 
·
Self-monitoring carried out by the activity holder/operator who has the obligation 
to set up its own internal monitoring system according to the requirements 
provided by the environmental agreement and permit 
18. 
Environmental Monitoring
 is carried out both by the environmental authorities and 
by the activity holder/operator who has the obligation to set up its own internal 
monitoring system according to the requirements provided by the environmental 
agreement and permit (MO 541/2000 of MoE). 
19. 
Environmental Control
 of activities is performed by relevant authorities with control 
competencies (Environmental Guard and NARW) that have the power to apply penalties 
and fines.  
Page  11
8
3.4 Waste 
management 
20. Law 426/2001 establishes: the 
general principles of waste management activities
;
waste classification; categories of hazardous waste based on their generic types, 
constituents and properties; operations for waste recovery and disposal. 
21. GD 856/2002 covers the provisions for 
registration of waste management activities
 
and approves the 
list of wastes
 including hazardous wastes by transposing the European 
Waste Catalogue.   
22. According to the GD 162/2001 amended by GD 349/2005 on the landfill of wastes, 
the 
hazardous wastes from human or animal health care and/or related research
 are 
not accepted on landfills. These are infectious waste from hospitals or other sanitary or 
veterinary units (having property H9) defined as 
–
substances containing viable micro-
organisms or their toxins which are known as being able to induce diseases for humans or 
other live organisms. It results in specific requirements for management of such waste in 
order to prevent infection: 
-
each type of waste should be collected separately; 
-
the solid non-hazardous waste might be transported to the urban landfill; 
-
the liquid hazardous waste should be neutralized and then might be discharged to 
the sewerage system; 
-
the solid hazardous waste should be treated if possible and then transported to the 
urban landfill; 
-
the solid hazardous waste that can not be treated should be securely contained, 
transported and incinerated. 
 
23. Operation, surveillance and control of 
waste incineration and co-incineration 
process
 are regulated by the GD 128/2002 amended by GD 268/2005 which fully 
transposes the EU Waste Incineration Directive 2000/76/CE (WID). It provides norms 
for:  
-
waste reception 
-
work conditions 
-
maximum allowable limits for air and water pollutant emissions and rules to 
establish them  
-
residue control  
-
monitoring 
-
measurement techniques.  
Anyway, these norms are not applicable to the animal carcasses as regulated by the 
Directive 90/667/EEC. 
 
3.5 
Water pollution prevention 
24. The GD 188/2002 amended by GD 352/2005 comprises norms for 
liquid effluents 
discharged into natural receivers
 such as surface water courses, groundwater, valleys 
with natural runoff or permeable soils – NTPA 001 – as well as for 
industrial liquid 
effluent discharged into urban sewerage networks
 
connected to an urban WWTP 
soils 
–
NTPA 002 – . According to its provisions, the liquid hazardous waste originated from 
Page  12
9
the sanitary or veterinary health care facilities should be first decontaminated/sterilized 
and neutralized and only then discharged to the urban sewerage system. 
25. According to the Water Law (Law 107/1996), buffer zones of sanitary protection or 
hydro-geological protection perimeters have to be set up around sources and facilities for 
drinking water supply, mineral water sources and lakes with therapeutic waters; 
principles for dimensioning of these zones are established by GD 101/1997 which also 
provides some minimum dimensions of sanitary protections zones in case of water 
withdrawals from rivers and lakes as well as in case of aqueducts and any other 
constructions and facilities for drinking water supply. 
26. Animal farming should apply the Code of Best Agricultural Practice as regards the 
manure management for 
protection of surface and groundwater against pollution by 
nitrates
 (General Plan for implementing the 91/676/EEC Council Directive and GD 
964/2000). An internal ANAR decision dated 2005 requests all owners of animal farms to 
develop a manure management plan as part of the application for water permit. Such a 
plan should comprise:  
-
arrangements for temporary storage of manure on platforms, 
-
contracts with users of manure as natural fertilizer (agricultural land owners)  
-
registration of manure produced: quantity, buyer, date of selling.  
3.6 
Air pollution prevention 
27. General principles, policies, programs and legal, administrative, and technical 
requirements related to the 
protection of atmosphere quality
 are established by Law 
655/2001 for approving and amending the EGO 243/2000.  
28. General norms for limitation of 
air pollutants emissions
 are set up by the MO 
462/2003 of MoE. Other norms for limitation of emissions generated at industry sector 
level are set up for large combustion plants, incinerators, industries using organic 
solvents, oil terminals. 
29. 
Air quality in residential areas
 is regulated by two legal documents which comprise 
values of MAC in ambient air for certain pollutants: OM 592/2002 of MoE for SO
2
,
CO, 
NO
2
,
ozone, suspended particulates, lead and benzene and air quality standard STAS-
12574/1987 for other pollutants.     
3.7 
Sanitary veterinary activity 
30. The 
specific measures for the control of avian influenza
 are comprised in the OM 
no. 87 of April, 13
th
,
2006
of ANSVSA that fully transposes the EU Directive 
2005/94/EC (repealing the former 92/40/EEC Directive): (a) certain preventive measures 
relating to the surveillance and the early detection of avian influenza and increasing the 
level of the competent authorities' and the farming community's awareness of, and 
preparation for, the risks of that disease; (b) the minimum control measures to be applied 
in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza in poultry or other captive birds and the 
early detection of possible spread of avian influenza viruses to mammals; (c) other 
subsidiary measures to avoid the spread of influenza viruses of avian origin to other 
species. It establishes permanent bio-safety measures for surveillance and prevention of 
Page  13
10
virus spreading into bird holdings. The responsibilities are established for: ANSVSA, 
Institute for Diagnostic and Animal Health and the National Reference Laboratory for 
Avian Influenza and Newcastle Disease within the institute, Institute for Control of 
Veterinary Bio-products and Drugs, local sanitary-veterinary laboratories.  
3.8. 
Management of waste generated from veterinary activity 
31. Regulations for 
hazardous waste generated from sanitary-veterinary laboratories
,
including the research, diagnosis, treatment and disease prevention activity, are provided 
by MO 373/2001 as amended by 483/2001 of MoA: 
-
organizing and equipping of the sanitary-veterinary laboratories, 
-
regulation on sampling, conditioning, packaging and transport of samples; 
-
health & safety rules; handling of hazardous waste and contamination prevention; 
collection, containment, storage and disposal of solid, liquid and radioactive 
waste, testing of the hazardous waste management; 
-
waste incineration; 
-
staff training. 
32. These regulations stipulate that:  
-
liquid and solid waste resulting from sample processing should be i) sterilized, 
neutralized or only collected, ii) packaged in sterile and tight closed recipients,  
and iii) directed to one of the following compartments: a) sterilization and 
neutralization room; b) platform for waste temporary storage; c) incinerator;  
-
the Laboratory for hygiene and environmental protection within the Animal 
welfare department is responsible for the control of hazardous waste management 
(HWM) on the technological flow in all departments and laboratories;  
-
control of HWM is realized through inspection, quick tests or complex laboratory 
tests, periodical reporting of incidents to the department top management; 
-
testing is focused on inside surfaces, wastewater from sanitary-veterinary 
laboratory, air pollutant emission, soil samples, ash resulting from incinerator. 
-
incineration is recommended as the most efficient final disposal method for the 
solid hazardous waste; 
-
liquid hazardous waste should be first decontaminated/sterilized and neutralized 
and only then discharged to the urban sewerage system. 
3.9 
Management of animal by-products 
33. 
General provisions
 are comprised by MO 723/2003 of MoA that fully transposes the 
CE Regulation 1774/2002 laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not 
intended for human consumption. Animal by-
products named also „materials” are 
classified in three categories. Wild birds dead from avian influenza fall under category 1 
acc. to art. 4, point.1, while poultry killed due to avian influenza reasons fall under 
category 2 acc. to art. 5, point 1 (e). Anyway, in both cases, the incineration or co-
incineration is the disposal method recommended in the first place. Low-capacity 
incineration or co-incineration plants are those handling an animal by-product inflow less 
than
 50 kg / hour.
 
34. The incineration and co-incineration of animal by-products shall take place either in 
Page  14
11
incinerators falling under provisions of Directive 2000/76/EC or, when that Directive 
does not apply, in incineration or co-incineration plants approved by the competent 
authority if they comply with a number of requirements laid down in Annex IV of the 
Regulation, regarding: general and operating conditions, other conditions concerning 
water discharges and residues, temperature measurement requirements, abnormal 
operating conditions. These conditions are different for high-capacity incineration or co-
incineration plants and low-capacity incineration or co-incineration plants.  
35. The general strategy and provisions for 
neutralization of animal by-products
 by 
processing or incineration/ co-incineration are further developed in EOG 47/2005 
amended and approved by Law 73/2006. According to these regulations the 
neutralization facilities should be permitted by both sanitary-veterinary and 
environmental authorities. This act does not refer to the right of sanitary-veterinary 
authorities to permit the incineration and/or burial of animal by-products in case of an 
epizootic outbreak.  
36. The legislation is still rather unclear as regarding especially the low-capacity 
neutralization facilities
.
If the “installations for the disposal or recycling of animal 
carcasses and animal waste with a treatment capacity exceeding 10 tonnes per day” fall 
under IPPC Directive and should be issued an integrated environmental permit, the 
installations under this capacity are not specifically mentioned in the list of MO 876/2005 
(Annex1); they might be considered in the category “collection and treatment of other 
residues (than wastewater)” – position 281, NACE code -9002- or “Sanitation, de-
pollution and similar activities” – position 282, NACE code -9003-.  
37. Few or maybe none permitted incinerators for animal by-products are operated now 
since the existing installations are not complying with the requirements laid down in the 
MO 723/2003. Consequently there is little experience in this field. 
3.10 
Laboratory certification on GLP 
38. MO 370/2003 of MoE establishes rules on GLP certification of laboratories with 
activities related to environmental protection. The same kind of rules for veterinary 
laboratories are established by MO 146/2000 of MoA while the MO 117-56-248/2002 of 
MoI, MoH and MoA provides for inspection of compliance with GPL principles and 
requirements. The certification system is based on principles laid down in the following 
international standards and guidelines: OECD – Principles of Good Laboratory Practice 
and Compliance Monitoring, ISO 17025:2001, ISO 43-1,2:1997, ISO 45002:1994, ISO 
45003:1997, ISO 9000:2001, Guide ISO 58:1993, ISO 10011:1994. 
3.11 
Production of pharmaceutical products including vaccine  
39. EOG 152/1999 amended and approved by Law 336/2002 defines human drugs 
products including vaccines and provides conditions and norms for their production and 
trade as well as for quality-efficiency-safety assurance. According to this act: 
-
the National Medicines Agency sets up rules of GMP which have to be approved 
by the MoH and issues the GMP Certificate for national drugs producers. 
Page  15
12
-
MoH decides on permitting a national drugs producer on the basis of a favorable 
inspection report drafted by MoH accredited inspectors. 
 
40. From environmental point of view, the pharmaceutical industry is included on the list 
of IPPC instalations, Annex 1 of EU Directive 96/61/EC, in category 4. Chemical 
industry 
4.4.
Chemical installations for the production of basic plant health products and 
of biocides 
and 
4.5.
Installations using a chemical or biological process for the 
production of basic pharmaceutical products.
 This means that the production units 
should obtain the IEP regardless their production capacity.  
3.12 Dangerous 
chemicals 
41. Regime for production, trading and use of the dangerous chemical substances and 
products are regulated by UOG 200/2000 modified by L451/2001 and L 324/2005. This 
act provides for a classification, packaging and labeling of the dangerous chemical 
substances and products. Placing on market of the products containing the substances 
falling under this regulation (such as disinfectants) is permitted only with the 
corresponding label which include the instructions for use.   
3.13 
Population hygiene and living environment 
42. Some norms and recommendations for protection of population living environment 
are established by OM 536/1997 of MoH. Buffer zones of sanitary protection have to be 
provided between the so
 called “protected areas” - that include inhabited areas, parks, 
natural reservations, resorts, medical and social-cultural institutions human settlements - 
and the sites of activities producing discomfort and health risk. The buffer zones 
dimensions should be the results of environmental impact studies but the recommended 
minimum distances are already listed in the mentioned act.  
3.14 
Environmental Management System 
43. The international standards form the series ISO 14000 have been adopted in Romania 
as RN Standards series 14000 from last nineties and many organizations have already 
been certified ISO 14001. The Community Regulation on Environmental Management 
and Audit Scheme (EMAS) was also transposed into national legislation.

44. All sub-components are focused on public sector capacity building and improved 
readiness for dealing with outbreaks of avian influenza in domestic poultry and comprise 
mostly actions of support in terms of technical assistance and training/knowledge transfer 
with no environmental impact. They will improve the effectiveness and bio-safety of the 
existing avian influenza handling and testing procedures by meeting international 
standards established by the OIE.  
45. The activity conducted within the upgraded national/regional laboratories
 
and 
ICBPVD following the Project's investments in facilities, equipment, consumables and 
training for laboratory staff (sub-component 
b.iv
)
would be reinforced by the 
mainstreaming of environmental safeguards into protocols and procedures. The specific 
waste generated might hardly have any adverse impact as long as GLP are applied and all 
environmental regulation requirements described in chapter 3 are complied with.  
4.1.1 Mobile 
incinerators 
46. Under 
sub-component 
c.)
 the Project will support the purchase of 
mobile 
incinerators 
for the safe disposal of carcasses in small-holder systems. The main actions 
required are: 
-
select location; 
-
construction of an impermeable hardstand necessary for laying the incineration 
facility; additionally, this has to be provided with a catchment channel and a tank 
to collect and contain both the disinfectants used in the equipment cleaning and 
eventually wastewater from vehicle cleaning; 
-
operate the incinerator. 
4.1.1.1 Potential environmental impacts and mitigation measures 
 
Facility site  
47. An existing hardstand may be used if available. Otherwise a new one has to be 
constructed; in both cases the location should be:  
-
outside the sanitary protection zone for sources or facilities of drinking water 
supply;  
-
at minimum 200 m from protected areas. 
Hardstand Construction 
48. The minor building works required for construction or rehabilitation of the existing 
structures will not imply the use of any valuable resources. The fertile soil removed 
should be stored in a special place in order to be used later. Main adverse effects are 
those characteristic to any construction activity that implies digging works and eventually 
the use of heavy equipment and transport vehicles: 
-
dust from digging process; 
-
exhausted gas emission and noise & vibrations from construction equipment and 
vehicles; 
-
disturbance of small wild fauna and vegetation; 
-
soil pollution caused by oil and grease leakage and improper solid waste disposal.  
Page  19
16
49. Due to the small area used as well as to the short time period necessary for 
construction, the environmental impact is low and temporary. The construction company 
has full responsibility to take all necessary 
mitigation measures
:
strict delimitation of 
construction area by fence and/or warning belts; sound-absorbent panels around the 
construction area; use of dust-absorbing screens; compliance with construction work 
regulations; setting up of waste management system; maintenance of vehicles and 
construction equipment in special places only. Costs for these measures should be 
supported by the local administration.  
50. Such building works are usually considered with 
insignificant environmental 
impacts
 and should not require an environmental agreement. The MoPWTH should make 
the necessary arrangements for such works to obtain the construction permitting in 
emergency regime. 
 
Facility Operation 
51. The incineration facilities will be procured and the process will be operated in 
compliance with the provisions of the already mentioned MO 723/2003 of MoA that fully 
transposes the CE Regulation 1774/2002. The actions involved, potential impacts and 
mitigation measures are summarized in Annex 4. The 
key emissions to the air
 from 
operation of the incinerators are odor, particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, nitrogen 
oxides, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds (from methane to 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and dioxins and furans (PCDD/F). There will 
also be 
noise
 when the incinerator is operating. In addition, there is also risk from 
airborne release of virus
 as the dead poultry are loaded into the incinerator. The 
key 
actions of mitigation
 are to ensure that the formation of harmful substances is avoided 
through operation of the incinerator at the design temperatures and combustion air 
supply. The burning of materials e.g. polyvinyl chloride (PVC) materials that could lead 
to the formation of harmful substances when burnt will be avoided. 
52. The operator will be responsible for emission monitoring and the environmental 
authorities will be responsible for air quality monitoring, as required by national 
legislation.  
53. Since there is little experience if any in this field up to now, as regarding the proper 
incinerators for animal carcasses, the 
process will be operated and monitored within 
established guidelines drawn from published documents in other countries
.
For reference, 
the emission limits used in the UK for air pollutants are presented in Annex 5. 
54. The 
key emissions to water
 from the incineration process might arise from the water 
and disinfectants that are used in the cleaning of the incinerator and the vehicle used in 
transport as well as of the slaughter of poultry. There is also a risk from fuel spillage 
during transport and on site commissioning of the facility or overflow of fat from the 
incinerator. The 
key actions of mitigation
 are to provide training and working materials to 
the incinerator operators, drivers and other personnel, and to ensure that sites are 
prepared in advance with lined hardstands and catchment and containment facility for 
disinfectants. The contained wastewater should then be discharged in the nearest WWTP. 
Page  20
17
4.1.1.2 Institutional Mitigation Measures to be included in the Environmental 
Management Plan 
55. The mitigation measures described above are those related to the actual use of the 
mobile incinerators whose procurement is supported by the Project. In fact it is not 
possible to know in advance where and when an outbreak of avian influenza would 
appear and more than that those incinerators might hopefully not be used during the 
Project lifetime.  
56. Consequently, the proper EMP for the Project should comprise the following 
preventive measures for the better preparedness of the emergency response. 
General measures:  
-
make
 
the necessary arrangements to obtain the approval of type if required for 
incinerators; 
-
assign the potential operator of the incinerator depending on the property right 
(probably ANSVSA and the local sanitary-veterinary authorities); 
-
develop the handbook for incinerator installation and operation by taking into 
account the issued identified in Annex 4 and the appropriate provisions in EOG 
47/2007 (ANSVSA); take into account different alternatives of incinerator 
location (in the closest vicinity of infected holding or at longer distance since 
different conditions for the transport of infected load might apply).  
-
prepare and develop the training program for the potential incinerator operators 
and the other actors involved (truck drivers and other personnel, local 
administration, holding owners, local environmental authorities) at least at county 
level; (ANSVSA)  
Incinerator site location 
-
identify the existing structures available to be used as incinerator hardstands in 
all localities, in locality clusters or at county level; this measure might be 
included in the Emergency plan which should be amended for this purpose 
(Commandment for Emergencies)  
-
identify the appropriate locations for new incinerator sites (same as above). 
Construction 
-
MoPWTH should make the necessary arrangements for such works to obtain the 
construction permitting in emergency regime. 
Operation 
-
make
 
the necessary arrangements to issue the environmental permit for these 
operators since the present environmental legislation does not provide for 
permitting the temporary activities (see section 3.2).

4.1.2 Village-level-enterprises 
57. Under  sub-component 
d)
 the Project would eventually finance pilot projects for 
village-level enterprises
 (micro-farms). The discussed prospective is being to support the 
establishment of some micro-poultry farms at village level in which the poultry from 
village husbandries to be gathered. Such a farm should be provided with all bio-security 
means and measures whose efficiency and advantages might be demonstrated.  
58. This is a questionable action with respect to a number of issues out of which the 
following are of interest from the environmental point of view:  
-
site selection 
-
construction or rehabilitation of buildings  
-
farm size and layout 
-
poultry species, as long as all variety can be found in villages: chicken, layers, 
ducks, geese, guinea fowls, turkeys 
-
housing system 
-
feed composition, supply and store 
-
feeding regime 
-
water and energy supply 
-
heating and lighting system 
-
fuel store 
-
bedding procurement and storage 
-
medical care 
-
premises maintenance and cleaning 
-
wastewater catchment & containment and after use or discharge 
-
use of disinfectants 
-
manure and other waste management 
-
carcasses disposal 
-
bio-safety assurance and control. 
59. More than that, such a farm should have a legal status over property and operation 
and, will need all permits and contracts with services suppliers required by the national 
legislation for an economic activity, even if the products are intended for owner use. The 
actual environmental potential impact will depend on the answers to the issues mentioned 
above and the mitigation measures will be described in the form of conditions provided 
by the environmental permit. 
60. Usually neither pollutant emissions nor air quality are monitored in animal farms. 
Monitoring will be the focused on the usual aspects: poultry inputs and outputs, feed 
amounts, water, energy, disinfectants, costs, manure movement, and so on.

61. 
The Project’ s subcomponent again comprise mostly actions of financial support in 
terms of technical assistance and training/knowledge transfer with no environmental 
impact as well as of financing the necessary equipment for upgrading and refurbishment 
of laboratories and intensive care units in infectious disease hospitals. The specific waste 
generated by the activity performed in the upgraded units might hardly have any adverse 
impact as long as GLP are applied and all environmental regulation requirements 
described in chapter 3 are complied with. 
62. Some minor civil works are envisaged under sub-component 
b.i)
 since the 
laboratories have to comply with the requirements necessary for safety-level 3 (see 
Annex 1). These involve only inside modifications to existing buildings and have no 
significant environmental impacts but might require the construction permit if some walls 
were to be removed. Specific 
mitigation measures
 against dust particulates and noise 
emissions should be taken, particularly considering the sensitive human receptors. The 
general entrepreneur is responsible for that. Debris from building works shall be removed 
according to the local arrangements, specified in the construction permit.  
63. From the environmental point of view, the 
upgrading of the influenza vaccine 
production unit
 at the Cantacuzino Institute in order to increase the production capacity 
up to 2.5 million doses by supporting the rehabilitation and equipment of this department, 
and completion and equipment of the filling and sealing unit, proposed under sub-
component 
c.ii)
,
is not going to change the present status of the production unit, 
described below in para 64., from the reasons presented .  
64. The 
Production unit
 at the Cantacuzino Institute has presently the following status: 
-
it is GMP certified by the NMA, 
-
it is authorized by the MoH as a national medicine producer according to the 
national legislation presented in section 3.11 para 39;  
-
it is operating on the basis of the environmental permit; 
-
even at the present capacity for vaccine production, it is an IPPC installation from 
th ereasons mentioned in section 3.11 para 40; and 
-
it is being now under evaluation to obtain the IEP according to the environmental 
national legislation. 
 
65. From the environmental point of view, the 
upgrading of the influenza vaccine 
production unit
 in order to increase the production capacity up to 2.5 million doses by 
supporting the rehabilitation and equipment of this department, and completion and 
equipment of the filling and sealing unit, proposed under sub-component 
c.ii)
,
is not 
going to change the present status of the production unit as an IPPC installation.  
66. Prior to the commissioning of the new capacity, the change has to be notified to the 
Bucharest Environmental Protection Agency for the assessment of the eventual 
significant adverse environmental impacts; the necessary mitigation measures will be 
described as new conditions included in the revised IEP. 
5. MONITORING 
PLAN 
67. The monitoring requirements for operation stage of activities developed within 
Page  26
23
project components “incinerators” and “micro-farms” have been presented in chapter 4. 
68. Providing the compliance with GLP and GMP especially for the waste management, 
the have no significant or even moderate environmental impact and do not require 
specific environmental monitoring.  
69. The implementation of the institutional measures described in table 2 should be 
monitored and evaluated along the Project progress, according to the Bank operational 
procedures and on the basis of indicators identified in the same table. 
6. IMPLEMENTATION 
ARRANGEMENTS 
70. The Project Management Units established in the ANSVSA and MPH are responsible 
for coordination and communications between all other agencies involved.

Minimize waste’s hazards 
Determine options for management of hazards 
If appropriate, take steps to neutralize waste or render it non-hazardous 
When possible, select a single management option 
E
stablish procedures for dealing with unstable waste, or waste that requires special storage or 
handling 
Store safely: 
 
-
Designated room or facility modified to contain the waste (with ventilation and effluent 
trapping) 
-
Protect workers 
-
Minimize risk of fire or spill 
-
Minimize radiation levels outside of area 
-
Consider compatibility of materials being accumulated (e.g., aqueous and non-aqueous 
waste should be separated) 
 
Give particular attention to the handling or cleaning of radioactive laboratory ware, and to the 
proper disposal of sharps. 
 
-
Non-contaminated (non-infectious) waste can be reused or recycled or disposed of as 
general waste 
-
Contaminated (infectious) sharps – collect in puncture-proof containers fitted with covers 
and treated as infectious; autoclave if appropriate 
-
Contaminated material for decontamination by autoclaving and thereafter washing and 
reuse or recycling 
-
Contaminated material for direct incineration 
 
Disposal 
No activity should begin unless a plan for the disposal of hazardous waste has been formulated 
 
·
Use appropriate disposal method for each category of waste 
·
Use appropriate containers 
·
Label and securely close waste containers 
·
Separate wastes as appropriate  
 
For low level radioactive waste, options include
·
Storage time for decay and indefinite on site storage,  
·
Burial at a low-level radioactive waste site,  
·
Incineration, or 
·
Sanitary sewer disposal 
 
For biological waste, options include
·
Disinfection 
·
Autoclaving 
·
For liquidsdisposal in sanitary sewer putrescible waste disposed of by incineration 
needles and sharps require destructiontypically by incineration or grinding  
Page  33
30
Collection and storage of waste
·
At satellite area near lab:  
-
should be clearly identified, ventilated if necessary 
-
determine whether to recycle, reuse, or dispose 
-
hold here for less than one year; when containment volume limits reached, move 
to central accumulation area 
–
package appropriately 
 
·
At central accumulation area: 
-
separate according to compatibility, commingle solvents when appropriate 
-
label clearly, store in appropriate containers 
-
limit storage time to 90 days 
-
Ensure that employees are trained to handle waste materials as well as 
contingency planning for emergencies 
-
When transporting, make provisions for spill control in case of accident; have 
internal tracking system to follow movement of waste 
-
Ensure that all necessary records have been generated (Quantities and 
identification of waste generated and shipped; Documentation and analyses of 
unknown materials; Manifests for waste shipping as well as verification of waste 
disposal; Any other information required to ensure compliance and safety from 
long-term liability) 
 
·
Disposal options: 
-
Incineration – is method of choice for most wastes, but is most expensive 
-
Normal trash – only where appropriate, must be clearly identified and 
appropriately labeled 
-
Sanitary sewer – not commonly used; solutions must be aqueous and 
biodegradable, or low toxicity inorganics – make sure sewer doesn’t drain into 
water supply inappropriate for waste disposal, and make sure waste is highly 
diluted 
-
Release to the atmosphere – not acceptable; fume hoods must have trapping 
devices to prevent discharge to atmosphere 
 
·
If hazardous and non-hazardous wastes are mixed, entire waste volume must be treated as 
hazardous 
·
Preparation for transport to a treatment, storage, and disposal facility (TSDF) 
·
Waste generator must obtain assurance (in terms of documentation, permits, records) that 
provider is reliable 
 
For infectious material
·
Decontaminate, autoclave, or incinerate in lab 
·
Package appropriately (for incineration or for transfer to another facility for incineration) 
·
Protect against hazards to others to those who might contact discarded items

DESCRIPTION 
ENVIRONMENTAL 
CONSIDERATIONS 
SAFETY  
CONSIDERATIONS 
This method is based on thermal 
destruction of infective pathogens, 
animal carcasses and other wastes in 
an incinerator.  It involves: 
·
Transporting  the mobile 
incinerator to the culling site 
·
Incinerating carcasses and other 
wastes (using fuel and air) at a 
high temperature 
·
Transporting incineration 
residues (bottom ash/slag and 
flyash) to the disposal site and 
disposal at the sanitary landfill 
Technology Requirements
:
·
Incinerator at a minimum 
temperature of 850
o
C
and with a 
minimum residence time of 2 
seconds.  Temperature must be 
measured and recorded 
·
Incinerator equipped with an 
auxiliary burner that can be switched 
on when the temperature falls below 
850
o
C
·
Incinerator automatic feed system 
connected to temperature 
measurement 
·
Storage areas for animal carcasses 
and other wastes as well as 
incineration residues must be 
covered.  These areas must be 
ventilated, labeled, and designed and 
operated to prevent accidental 
releases of polluting substances to 
the environment. 
·
Transportation of bottom ash/slag 
and flyash in closed containers to 
prevent environmental releases 
·
Disposal of bottom ash/slag and 
flyash in a sanitary landfill 
 
Waste Pretreatment/Containment
:
To avoid emission of dioxins or furans 
during incineration, carcasses should not 
be pretreated with a chlorine-bearing 
disinfectant or should not be contained in 
PVC bags.  For the same reason, no other 
material destined for incineration should 
contain chlorine-bearing chemicals 
·
Use of PPE to ensure 
personnel hygiene of 
personnel working at the 
site (incinerator operators 
must change their PPE 
before handling animal 
carcasses and other wastes) 
·
Established and 
documented 
cleaning/disinfection 
procedures 
·
Established and 
documented emergency 
response procedures 
·
Availability of cleaning/ 
disinfection 
supplies/equipment 
·
Availability of emergency 
response equipment (e.g. 
first aid, fire fighting) 
Personnel training on personnel 
hygiene/cleaning, safety 
and emergency response 
measures

PUBLIC CONSULTATION  
FIRST MEETING 
October 16, 2006 
 
Minutes of the Meeting
1.
The Public Consultation Process for Environmental Management Plan (EMP) included 
two actions: i) making the EMP publicly available through the websites of both authorities 
involved, namely the ANSVA and Ministry of Public Health, ii) organizing a debate meeting 
with the interested stakeholders.   
 
2.
As long as no persons from the large public showed interest in attending the debate, the 
meeting was held at the headquarters of ANSVA in presence of the Consultant in charge with 
the preparation of EMP (Dr. Violeta Visan) with participants representing ANSVA and 
Ministry of Public Health as well as some Institutes involved:  
-
Dr. Razvan Taru, General Secretary, ANSVA 
-
Dr. Marcela Vladareanu, PMU-ANSVA 
-
Dr. Mircea Popa, Ministry of Public Health 
-
Dr. Virginia Ciocoiu, PMU-Ministry of Public Health 
-
Dr. Radu Dorel Lucian, General Manager, “Cantacuzino” Institute 
-
Dr. Dan Otelea, “Matei Bals” Institute for Infectious Disease 
-
Dr. Catalin Apostolescu, “Matei Bals” Institute for Infectious Disease 
 
3.
An opening statement was made by Dr. Taru explaining that the draft EMP had been 
prepared as a requisite for the Romania Avian Influenza (AIHP) Project according to the WB 
procedures. 
 
4.
The Consultant made a presentation to aquaint the participants with the EMP: overview 
of
the identified potential impacts of the Project components, detailed explanation of the 
mitigation measures and monitoring indicators. 
 
5.
The restricted number of participants made possible an an interactive discussion along 
the presentation. The prevailing questions related to the use of incinerators, this being actually 
the main component of the Project with a potential significant impact on environment. Although 
no
mitigation measures have been identified for the Human Health Component, the participants 
from Ministry of Health, Cantacuzino Institute and Matei Bals Institute have been active in 
discussions and made valuable comments. 
 
6.
It was pointed out that the use of incinerators is the prefered solution for the disposal of 
dead poultry. Dr.Taru was very much in favour with the idea of preparing a team of incinerator 
operators as soon as the type of the incinerators to be purchased is established and the operation 
Page  39
36
manual is available. Operating procedures for burial and incineration should be well 
documented and detailed within the Project Operation Manual. 
 
8.
The responsibilities of ANSVA representatives, their relation with the environmental 
authorities, and the role of the later in the monitoring of incineration process (particularly for air 
emissions), have been discussed also. 
 
9.
There were also comments regarding the necessity of identifying sites of incinerator 
settlement prior to outbreaks and the necessity of local administration in this respect.  
 
10.
No written comments were received. 
 
PUBLIC CONSULTATION  
SECOND MEETING 
November 02, 2006 
 
Minutes of the Meeting
1.
The Second Public Consultation Meeting for Environmental Management Plan (EMP) 
has been organized especially for Animal Health Component, at the headquarters of ANSVA. 
The ANSVA announced the date of the meeting on website and written invitations have been 
sent to the interested stakeholders, including the representatives of Ministry of Public Health.  
 
2.
The full list of participants is attached at the end of this minute.  
 
3.
An opening statement was made by 
Dr. Nicolae Manolescu, ANSVA president’s 
counsellor, who addressed some words about the importance of this WB project for Romania 
preparedness in case of avian influenza and human pandemic. 
 
4.
Dr. Taru presented also outlined the importance of the Project and also stressed on the 
fact that a PMU is needed to be organized within the ANSVA. He presented the Project 
components and explained that the EMP had been prepared as a requisite for the Romania 
Avian Influenza (AIHP) Project according to the WB procedures.  
 
5.
The Consultant made a presentation to aquaint the participants with the EMP: overview 
of
the identified potential impacts of the Project components, detailed explanation of the 
mitigation measures and monitoring indicators. 
 
Page  40
37
6.
Dan Hulea, president of the Romanian Ornithology Society made the comment that the 
Communication component, although not having an adverse environmental impact, is very 
important and should be addressed in such a way as to increase the benefits. He also mentioned 
that different research results - such as a map with the migration routes 
–
would be helpful in 
establishing the most vulnerable zones of the country territory; this way the preffered location 
for the mobile incinerators could be bestimated in advance. The map showing the migration 
corridors will be overlapped with the map provided by the Romanian Association of Poultry 
Producers, showing the locations of the poultry farms across Romania, and the resulted map 
will be extremely useful for the assessment of the most vulnerable areas in the country. He 
proposed a close collaboration between the Ornithology Society and ANSVA for the goal of 
avian influenza prevention and preparedness . 
 
7.
It was again pointed out that the use of incinerators is the prefered solution for the 
disposal of dead poultry. Gheorghe Barboi from the Institute of Diagnosys and Animal Health 
gave some details about the capacity of incinerators to be procured and their operation. He 
mentioned that the incineration is the most expensive method but the only one accepted by the 
environmental authorities.  
 
8.
Prof. Ilie Van, president of the Romanian Association of Poultry Producers appreciated 
the proposed actions of the project as very valuable and the EMP findings as right. The most 
appropriate methods for poultry culling in farms have been discussed.   
9.
The representatives of Ministry of Environment discussed the role of the environmental 
authorities in the monitoring of incineration process (particularly for air emissions). The 
monitoring is very expensive and less large incinerators instead of many small ones would be 
prefferable in this respect. Of course this would not be necessary providing that the incinerators 
will be operated properly.   
 
10.
There were also comments regarding the necessity of identifying sites of incinerator 
settlement prior to outbreaks and the necessity of local administration in this respect. 
11.
No written comments were received.
