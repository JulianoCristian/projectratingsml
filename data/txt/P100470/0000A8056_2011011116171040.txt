                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower in building its capacity to respond to potential future infections of humans by HPAI and other zoonoses,
                         and preparing for, controlling and responding to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Though no human cases of Avian Influenza have been reported to date, the project has been successful in building the necessary capacity for the country to respond to threats that
                         may arise. However, some activities will not be completed by project closing, including the rehabilitation works at the vaccine production unit of the Cantacuzino Institute (CI). Despite
                         this, the vaccine production capacity nevertheless increased more than two-fold after installation of part of the processing equipment (from an average of 30 doses of trivalent
                         influenza vaccine produced per week in 2007-2008 to 79 doses per week in 2008-2009).

                         The project has been successful in starting the upgrading of the National Influenza Laboratory (NIL) at the CI to a Bio-Safety Level (BSL 3) facility. All equipment for the Intensive
