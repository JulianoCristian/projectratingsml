The changes will be undertaken pursuant to a\n            request by the Borrower, received on March 31, 2009, for\n            reallocation and partial cancellation of the loan. Pursuant\n            to this request, the Bank cancelled EUR 7,317,233 of the\n            loan on April 3, 2009, leaving EUR 3.9 million available\n            from the National Sanitary, Veterinary, and Food Safety\n            Authority (ANSVSA), managed activities for reallocation to\n            the human health component as requested by the Borrower. The\n            cancellation has made project restructuring necessary on the\n            occasion of which the requested reallocation can be\n            undertaken. The request by the Borrower was made against the\n            following background: (a) the institution responsible for\n            the implementation of the animal health component has proven\n            unable to effectively manage the implementation of the\n            project in accordance with the provisions of the loan\n            agreement and the project implementation manual, resulting\n            in significant implementation delays that made the\n            achievement of the Project Development Objective (PDO)\n            unlikely. ANSVSA-managed parts of the project have been\n            under suspension since November 13, 2008, and the requested\n            corrective action required for the Bank to consider the\n            lifting of the suspension was not taken by the set deadline\n            of March 31, 2009; and (b) the Ministry of Public Health\n            (MPH) - responsible for the implementation of part two of\n            the project, has requested additional resources to cover a\n            cost overrun in actual bids and to cover expenditures for\n            additional items, not foreseen at appraisal, which are\n            needed to complete the agreed activities under that component."}, "docdt": "2009-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
