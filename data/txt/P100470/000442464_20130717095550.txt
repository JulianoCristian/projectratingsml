      IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to ad apt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Romania Avian
Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project (IBRD-
48390) under the Global Program for Avian Influenza (GPAI).

The project was approved on September 8, 2006 and became effective on March 19,
2007. A total of EUR 29.6 million was originally committed for the project. At project
closure EUR 17.9 million was disbursed. The project closed on December 31, 2010, one
year behind schedule.

The report presents findings based on a review of the project‘s implementation
completion report, program paper, legal documents, sector reports, and other relevant
material. In addition, an IEG mission to Romania in September 2011 held discussions in
Bucharest with World Bank country office staff, government officials and agencies,
project staff, parliamentarians, beneficiaries, key donors, hospital staff, doctors and
academia, and visited the Cantacuzino Institute, the Victor Babes Clinic, and the Bals
Institute. The mission also visited organizations such as the Poultry Breeder‘s
Association to get stakeholder views on poultry rearing conditions in Romania.

The mission also made a field visit to Brasov County, where it visited the Clinic Hospital
for Infectious Diseases and held discussions with doctors and other hospital staff. A
second field visit was to Tulcea County where the mission visited the local veterinary
laboratory and held discussions with veterinary staff. The mission also visited the village
and backyard poultry farm where the first case of the H5N1 virus in Romania was
detected in early October 2005 and held discussions with village officials and the village
vet. In Brasov and Tulcea counties the IEG mission carried out an informal survey of
about 50 people to assess the awareness amongst the general population about avian
influenza and the Bank project. The contributions of all stakeholders, including World
Bank staff in Tirana, are gratefully acknowledged.

Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to the
Government of Romania for comments. All comments received are included as Annex D.

Summary
Romania‘s transition from communism was difficult and the country faced economic and
financial instability that led to a major financial crisis in 1998-99. The crisis, pressure from
international organizations, and prospects of European Union (EU) accession all generated
momentum for structural reforms in the country. As a consequence, good progress was made
on stabilization and private sector development, and the Romanian economy grew rapidly
between the years 2003-08.

Over time, Romania‘s national development policies have become increasingly connected to
the EU, although in areas such as consumer health protection, food safety, veterinary and
phyto-sanitary standards, the country still has to undertake major reforms to comply with EU
standards. EU membership, which came in January 2007, has put considerable pressure for
application of EU standards in implementation of laws and strategies as well as in responding
to or demonstrating preparedness for emergencies. One such emergency arose in 2005 in the
form of avian influenza.

The first case of the H5N1 virus in Romania was detected on a poultry farm in the Danube
Delta in early October 2005. Additional outbreaks occurred across much of the country, for a
total of of 183 outbreaks identified by June 2006. The Romanian government adopted
national legislation for implementing EU directives on measures for prophylaxis,
surveillance, and control of avian influenza and took immediate steps to contain the
outbreaks. It put in place a Contingency Plan for both animals and humans, established
emergency response structures at the central and local levels, and established a National
Center for the Coordination of the Fight against Avian Influenza as an advisory body.
Romania also received support from the United States Agency for International Development
(USAID), Sweden, the Netherlands, and Germany to tackle the infection. In March 2006, the
Government requested support from the World Bank and an emergency project under the
Global Program for Avian Influenza Control (GPAI) was approved in the same year. The
Romania project was part of a horizontal Adaptable Program Loan to help countries around
the world prepare for and contribute to prevention of a global avian influenza pandemic.

With a loan of EUR 29.6 million, the project development objective was ―to assist the
Borrower in reducing the threat posed to humans and the poultry sector by HPAI [Highly
Pathogenic Avian Influenza] and other zoonoses, and preparing for, controlling and
responding to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies.‖

The original objective had two distinct parts, one related to upgrading capacity to manage
avian influenza and other zoonoses, and a second related to preparedness for influenza
pandemics and infectious disease emergencies in humans. There was already substantial
capacity in Romania to respond to avian influenza emergencies, as demonstrated in the 2005-
2006 outbreaks, but there was some scope to improve capacity in the animal health
surveillance, diagnostic, and other systems. Another motivation for the project was to
demonstrate to the EU that Romania, which was about to become an EU member, was giving
importance to responding to future emergencies. Other zoonotic diseases were included in
the objectives to ensure consistency with the overall GPAI program goal and to help the
                                               ii


country cope with diseases such as swine flu and bovine tuberculosis, in compliance with EU
standards for trade in animals and animal origin products.

The emergency project was approved by the Bank‘s Board in September 2006 and did not
become effective until March 2007 because the Romanian parliament was not in session.
During the six month gap between project approval and effectiveness, in January 2007,
Romania acceded to the European Union. The pace and interest in reforms in the country,
including on demonstrating preparedness for dealing with emergencies, slowed considerably
after EU accession. The Animal Health and Food Safety Agency also became reluctant to
implement the project as originally designed and wanted to use the project resources for the
construction of a new building. Ultimately, the lack of performance on the part of the agency
forced project restructuring and on July 7, 2009 the animal health component was eliminated
from the objectives in a formal restructuring. The project‘s objective was changed: ―to assist
the Borrower in building its capacity to respond to potential future infections of humans by
HPAI and other zoonoses, and preparing for, controlling and responding to influenza
pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans.‖ While this made the project
less ambitious, it also made it less relevant for reducing the threat posed from avian
influenza, since controlling infections in poultry and improving biosecurity are critical for
reducing conditions conducive to the mutation of the H5N1 virus and its spread to and
among humans.

The project ultimately contributed to building intensive care capacity in seven regional and
two central infectious disease hospitals, although inadequate trained staff for running the
facilities remains an issue in several hospitals. It helped increase vaccine production capacity
at the Cantacuzino Institute, a national institute for research and development in
microbiology, and provided support for upgrading of the National Influenza Laboratory.
However, critical rehabilitation work at the Institute was not completed and the biosecurity
level 3 (BSL3) laboratory was not operational as of project closure. The project did not make
any contribution to improving biosecurity in backyard poultry farms, which remains low
because of traditional animal management practices. Project efficiency suffered from serious
implementation delays, partially completed activities, and facilities that were not operational.
Overall, taking into account both original and revised project objectives, project outcome is
rated unsatisfactory.

The difficult financial conditions in Europe have made budgets and resources tighter in
Romania. Under these circumstances, resources for hiring staff, training, and operation and
maintenance remain limited. The intensive care units were constructed and equipped but
most of the hospitals are finding it difficult to effectively utilize them because of lack of
adequate trained personnel and doctors. Vaccine production at the Cantacuzino Institute shut
down in early 2012, and has not yet been restored. Overall, the assessment rates the risk to
development outcome as significant.

Bank performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory and Borrower performance is rated
moderately unsatisfactory. The Bank did not take the tremendous ongoing changes in
Romania into account when agreeing to the project design. Had it done so, it would have
become clear that Romania did not actually need support to tackle the immediate outbreaks
                                               iii


of avian influenza. The Government asked for support for building capacity for the future;
the appropriateness of an emergency loan as a part of a horizontal adaptable program loan for
this purpose is questionable. The Borrower used the project to help its EU accession process
and did not actually need it to tackle the avian influenza emergency. Ultimately the project
that was designed was very ambitious and had too many sub-components for an emergency
operation. Inadequate attention was given to the quality of monitoring and evaluation and its
use for decision-making. On the Government side, once the accession was achieved there
was significant waning of interest in project activities. There were also severe weaknesses in
planning, programming, budgeting, and execution of project activities. The performance of
the Animal Health and Food Safety Agency was a serious constraint on implementation,
leading to the animal health component being dropped.

The main lesson identified by this project is that countries that have already effectively
controlled avian influenza outbreaks in poultry may not need an emergency project, but
rather long-term capacity building. Following this project, avian influenza is still a threat in
Romania, as gaps in animal health sector capacity remain and biosecurity on backyard farms
is still weak.

1. Country and Project Context
Country Background
1.1      Romania, situated in the Balkan Peninsula in South-Eastern Europe, faced a difficult
transition from communism that began in 1989. Market distortions and structural problems
were issues in all transition countries. In addition, Romania was saddled with the legacy of
former president Ceausescu‘s highly personalized rule that left the country with a
bureaucracy that was insecure, politicized, and prone to corruption (IEG 2005). The
Romanian economy was also plagued by economic and financial instability that led to a
major financial crisis in 1998-99 (ibid). That crisis, the pressure from international financial
institutions, and prospects of European Union (EU) accession generated a momentum for
structural reforms in the country. As a consequence good progress was made on stabilization
and private sector development. The economy grew rapidly, at more than 6 percent a year
between 2003-08, and absolute poverty declined from 35.9 percent in 2000 to 13.8 percent in
2006 (Figure 1).

1.2    Romania joined the EU on January 1, 2007. The reform momentum slowed after the
accession. Political differences escalated and reform fatigue set in, affecting the consistency
and coherence of public policies, and complicating the adoption and implementation of
longer-term policies and programs (World Bank 2009c).

1.3    In late 2008 the global economic and financial crisis hit the country and real gross
domestic product (GDP) plummeted, dropping by 13 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008
(IMF 2010). In early 2009 the authorities put together a comprehensive policy reform
package supported by an International Monetary Fund (IMF) Stand-by Agreement and funds
from the EU and other multilateral institutions (IMF 2010). This contributed to stabilizing the
                                                        2


economy, although economic activity remained weak throughout 2009. Since then, growth
has returned to Romania although the recovery remains fragile (IMF 2012).

The World Bank and Romania
1.4    The World Bank has been supporting the government of Romania in its efforts to
promote growth and development since 1991. The Bank‘s portfolio in the post 2004 period
was closely connected to Romania‘s EU accession and integration priorities (Joint Portfolio
Review 2008). However, the Bank‘s financial involvement and leverage declined when
Romania acceded to the EU in 2007. The financial crisis led to re-engagement of the World
Bank, with demand for technical advice in particular.1

1.5     The agriculture sector, which accounts for 7 percent of the country‘s gross value
added, is critical to Romania‘s European integration and social cohesion goals (World Bank
2010a).2 Romania is the second largest agricultural producer in Central and Eastern Europe
after Poland, with an agricultural area of about 14.8 million hectares (Ilie and Zaharia 2007).
In the period prior to the accession, the World Bank provided considerable support for
reform of the agriculture sector, including livestock. In addition to providing loans, the Bank
also undertook analytical work (see for example, World Bank 2005b) to help the country‘s
policymakers identify the key challenges in agriculture and options to prepare Romania for
the accession.

1.6     Over time, Romania‘s national development policies, including in agriculture, have
become increasingly connected to the European Community policies and the acquis.3 In
several areas, such as consumer health protection, food safety, veterinary, and phyto-sanitary
standards, however, the country has yet to undertake major reforms to meet EU standards.



1
  For example, the Bank signed contracts for EUR 3.2 million with the government for a Fee-based Service for
the functional reviews of selected ministries and government agencies. The government asked for these reviews
to support the structural changes required by the EC under its Memorandum of Understanding with the
government for EUR 5 billion in financial support (World Bank 2011c). The functional review for the Ministry
of Public Health (World Bank 2011b) has been quoted in this report.
2
  About 45 percent of Romania‘s population lives in the rural areas and animal products represented about 33
percent of the value of agricultural production in 2009. As an EU member state, Romania implements the
European Union‘s Common Agricultural Policy. Despite the substantial support from donors, including the EU,
in the past decade there remains considerable discrepancy between Romania‘s agriculture sector and the
Common Agricultural Policy‘s reform principles. Romania and other countries that joined the EU later were
given time to catch up with EU laws. For example, EU legislation granted Romania the right to defer meeting
certain sanitary requirements for raw milk and certain structural requirements for dairy establishments until
December 2011 (EC 2011b).

  ―The acquis is the body of common rights and obligations that is binding on all the Member States of the
European Union. It is constantly evolving and comprises: the content, principles and political objectives of the
Treaties; legislation adopted pursuant to the Treaties and the case law of the Court of Justice; declarations and
resolutions adopted by the Union; instruments under the Common Foreign and Security Policy; instruments
under Justice and Home Affairs; international agreements concluded by the Community and those entered into
by the Member States among themselves within the sphere of the Union's activities. Adoption and
implementation of the acquis are the basis of the accession negotiations.‖

Public health indicators also lag behind those of other EU member countries.4 Accession to
EU membership was a strong motivation for Romania to adopt EU standards in
implementation of laws and strategies and in responding to or demonstrating preparedness
for emergencies.5 One such emergency arose in 2005 in the form of avian influenza, a couple
of years before Romania became an EU member.

Disease and Project Context
1.7     Between 2003 and 2011, the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus that causes avian
influenza affected 61 countries, including Romania, mainly in poultry, although several
countries also reported human infections with the virus. The first case of the H5N1 virus in
Romania was detected on a backyard poultry farm6 in Tulcea County in the Danube Delta in
early October 2005. Subsequently, cases were identified in backyard poultry systems in 52
towns across nine other counties in the Danube Delta and Black Sea area. This was the first
wave of avian influenza in Romania that lasted until late April 2006. Three weeks later a
second wave of infections started in Brasov County, a considerable distance from the Danube
Delta and on a commercial farm. On May 21, 2006, the presence of avian influenza was
confirmed in Bucharest and as of June 2006 the second wave had led to 121 confirmed cases
in 19 of Romania‘s 42 counties. In the second wave of outbreaks about one million birds
either died or were culled and the total cost of disease control and economic losses was
estimated to exceed EUR 90 million (Table 1).

1.8     Avian influenza, as the name suggests, is generally a disease of birds. However, it can
also infect humans if they come in contact with infected birds. The H5N1 virus is deadly and
has led to very high mortality in poultry and to 371 recorded deaths in humans worldwide.7
To date, no cases of avian influenza have been identified among humans in Romania. Avian
influenza virus types generally do not readily replicate and transmit between humans; the
H5N1 virus has so far largely ravaged the poultry industry. But avian influenza viruses,
including H5N1, could mutate to a form that is able to replicate and spread easily among
humans. If this happens a pandemic can occur and lead to massive death tolls as happened in
the 1918-19 ―Spanish Flu‖ pandemic.8

4
  The World Bank‘s 2011 functional review of the health sector in Romania compared health outcomes for the
initial 15 members of the EU (EU15), those of the twelve more recent accession countries (EU12), and those of
Romania (World Bank 2011b). The study showed Romania lagging behind both groups. In terms of life
expectancy, infant mortality, maternal mortality, ischemic heart disease, and cancer of the cervix, the EU15
countries rank higher, the EU12 countries rank second, and Romania lags behind.
5
  For example, the government had to submit an Avian Influenza Contingency Plan for Romania to the EU as a
requirement for accession on January 1, 2007.
6
 In these poultry production systems that are common in developing countries around the world, farmers rear
several animals such as chickens, ducks, pigs, cows in their backyards, and in close proximity with human
populations.
7
 The case-fatality ratio globally among reported human cases of the disease through contact with infected
poultry has been high (60 percent), but many non-fatal cases have probably not been reported.
8
  Influenza in humans can be caused by type A, B, or C viruses, with the former two causing most human
infections. Influenza outbreaks in humans occur annually with changes in surface proteins of the virus and the
severity of the disease varies from year to year. The changes in the viruses are occurring continuously hence the

1.9     While it is not possible to anticipate the timing of an avian influenza pandemic, the
risk remains.9 One of the biggest worries for the international community and for countries


need to continuously update influenza vaccines. By contrast influenza pandemics occur infrequently when
viruses such as those that cause AI to which humans have not been exposed, mutate and acquire the ability to
transmit from person to person. On average, three pandemics per century have been documented since the 16th
century, occurring at intervals of 10-50 years. Details on the disease and different virus types and their
characteristics, including information on past pandemics, are in Annex B.
9
  Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses continue to circulate in poultry and cause disease, and
remain a threat to human and animal health (FAO-OIE-WHO 2011a). From January to March 2011, 826 H5N1
outbreaks in poultry were reported from 12 countries around the world (FAO 2011).
                                                        5


such as Romania is that the conditions for mutation of the virus abound among birds living in
close contact with humans in backyard poultry production systems common throughout the
developing world.10 About 40 percent of Romania‘s poultry production is carried out by
smallholders, for which prevention and control measures are difficult to enforce.11 Increased
globalization and trade and the natural reservoirs for the virus in migratory birds have
increased the risk that the H5N1 virus could spread rapidly from wild birds to poultry and
from infected poultry to humans. The outbreak in Tulcea County in the Danube delta in 2005
is thought to have occurred because of the contact between poultry and wild birds.

1.10 Following the outbreaks, Romania adopted legislation for implementing European
Council Directive 92/40/EC on measures for prophylaxis, surveillance, and control of avian
influenza into national legislation and took immediate measures to contain the disease. It also
put in place a Contingency Plan for avian influenza for both animals and humans and
established emergency response structures both at the central and local levels. In May 2006
the Government established a National Center for the Coordination of the Fight against
Avian Influenza as an advisory body. After the first confirmed outbreak, Romania received
immediate support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID),
Sweden, the Netherlands, and Germany to tackle the infection. EU grants through the Phare
program12 and the Special pre-Accession Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development
were already available for upgrading of diagnostic and institutional capacities. In March
2006 the Government also requested support from the World Bank under the Global Program
for Avian Influenza (GPAI) (Box 1).
1.11 Building on the disease context discussed above, the potential threats from avian
influenza to Romania arise from four scenarios:
        An outbreak among poultry, with economic costs for the agriculture sector.
       Human contact with infected animals, leading to human avian influenza cases, but not
of a form that could be easily transmitted between humans. This would lead to a modest
number of influenza cases and possibly deaths.
    A strain of avian influenza transmissible between humans that develops within
Romania and leads to an influenza epidemic or pandemic if not contained.



10
  The virus could change either through mutation or re-assortment. Mutation occurs when a virus changes its
genetic makeup, whereas re-assortment occurs when two different viruses exchange genetic material. The re-
assortment could happen if animals that are susceptible to both human and avian flu, such as pigs, which are
also found in backyard systems, become concurrently infected with both kinds of flu. Either mutation or re-
assortment could lead to a strain that is transmissible between humans.
11
  Backyard poultry declined in importance from 72 percent to about 61 percent of total production in 2010,
according to the Press Release dated June 30, 2011, on Preliminary Results of the General Agricultural Census
2010 in Romania. The national veterinary agency reported that as of 2013, the proportion of birds reared on
backyard farms had declined to 40 percent.
12
   The Phare program is one of three pre-accession instruments financed by the EU to assist the applicant
countries of Central and Eastern Europe in their preparations efforts for joining the EU. It was originally created
in 1989 to assist Poland and Hungary, but later covered other countries such as Bulgaria and Romania.

      A strain of avian influenza transmissible between humans that develops abroad,
causing a pandemic that spreads to Romania.
1.12 Both poultry outbreaks and cases of transmission from poultry to humans have
already happened in several countries. However, Romania has had only outbreaks among
poultry to date. A strain that is transmissible between humans has not yet been documented
anywhere in the world but the risk remains, both within countries and as transmitted from
other countries.



Box 1. The Global Program for Avian Influenza (GPAI) control
The threat of a severe global human pandemic arising from mutation of the H5N1 virus has caused great concern to
the international community. Billions of dollars have been pledged for efforts to control avian influenza. The Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the World Health
Organization (WHO) have committed to work together. The international technical agencies realize that both human
and animal health sectors have a stake in tackling pathogens that can threaten animal and human health and that
responding to these diseases requires a multi-sectoral and multi-institutional response. The World Bank agreed to
provide financial support to the effort being undertaken through these international organizations and has helped
more than 50 countries deal with AI.
The Bank has two main mechanisms to support client countries in this area: the Global Program for Avian Influenza
(GPAI) and the multi-donor Avian and Human Influenza Facility . The Bank's Board of Executive
Directors endorsed the GPAI in January 2006, and extended it in June 2009. The Avian and Human Influenza
Facility was also created in 2006 to assist developing countries in meeting financing gaps in their integrated country
programs to minimize the risk and socioeconomic impact of avian and possible human pandemic influenza. In many
cases, the facility co-finances projects under GPAI.
GPAI is a global horizontal Adaptable Program Loan that allows for the use of up to US$ 1 billion (an increase from
the original amount of US$500 million) under which individual countries can obtain separate loans/credits/grants
(depending on country case) to finance their own national projects. The overall program development objective for
the GPAI is "to minimize the threat posed to humans by HPAI infection and other zoonoses and to prepare for,
control, and respond to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans." (World Bank
2005, p. 16).
The GPAI draws on an integrated approach developed in conjunction with FAO, OIE, and WHO. Countries can
access funding to strengthen their veterinary and health services to deal with avian influenza outbreaks among
animals, minimize the threat to people, and prepare for and respond to any potential human influenza pandemic.
GPAI operations are processed using emergency procedures, which allow quick preparation and approval. A country
qualifies for support for an emergency project under the Program when it demonstrates its commitment and readiness
to implement early detection and rapid response measures appropriate to the specific country conditions. Different
criteria were established for country participation on the basis of the gravity of the avian influenza situation in the
country. Romania was considered a ―newly infected country‖, with active avian influenza among poultry but no
human infection, and the existence of an appropriate program of rapid response, detection and containment measures.

Note: OIE is an independent intergovernmental organization founded in 1924 with 178 members. OIE‘s mandate is to improve
animal health worldwide. OIE‘s headquarters are in Paris and there are 11 regional offices. In 2004 OIE member countries
approved the creation of a single list of diseases to be notified to OIE within 24 hours.

2. Objectives, Design, and their Relevance
Objectives
2.1     The project development objective as noted in the Technical Annex (World Bank
2006a) and the Loan Agreement was ―to assist the Borrower in reducing the threat posed to
humans and the poultry sector by HPAI [Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza] and other
zoonoses, and preparing for, controlling and responding to influenza pandemics and other
infectious disease emergencies.‖13 The project was restructured on July 7, 2009 and the
objective was changed: ―to assist the Borrower in building its capacity to respond to potential
future infections of humans by HPAI and other zoonoses, and preparing for, controlling and
responding to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans.‖
Essentially, the poultry sector was removed from the objectives and the emphasis was put on
infections in humans. In addition, ―reducing the threat posed by HPAI and other zoonoses‖
was replaced by building the ―capacity to respond.‖

2.2      Two main reasons were given for the restructuring. First, the government agency
responsible for the animal health component had not effectively managed the project making
the achievement of the related part of the objective unlikely. That part of the project had been
under suspension since November 18, 2008; corrective action that would allow the Bank to
lift the suspension had not been taken by the March 31, 2009 deadline. Second, the Ministry
responsible for the implementation of the human health component had requested additional
resources for a cost overrun and for expenditures not foreseen at appraisal to complete agreed
activities.

Relevance of the Objectives
RELEVANCE OF THE ORIGINAL OBJECTIVES

2.3     There were two distinct parts to the original objectives—one related to avian
influenza and the second to other zoonoses and infectious disease emergencies. The objective
of reducing the threat posed to humans and the poultry sector from avian influenza and
preparing for the influenza pandemic was relevant to the country context. There had been
several outbreaks in poultry in Romania in backyard systems and in commercial farms.
Romania was the first European country to confirm an avian influenza outbreak with the
H5N1 virus in 2005 and spread of the virus among poultry significantly affected the
country‘s agriculture sector and economy. It also presented a risk for spread of infection to
poultry in other countries of the region. The Romanian Danube Delta is on the path of
migratory birds from Europe and Asia to Africa. Further, conditions for the mutation of the
virus were also present in the backyard systems where about 60 percent of poultry in
13
  Zoonoses are infectious diseases in animals that can be transmitted to people. The natural reservoir for the
infectious pathogen is the animal. Rabies and anthrax are examples of zoonoses. Infection via zoonoses can be
acquired either by direct contact with infected animals, or by consuming contaminated food products. Zoonotic
agents could be viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites or other biological entities.
                                                        8


Romania are reared. Resources and technical support for control of avian influenza were
available from other donors. The Bank‘s resources, in keeping with the GPAI goals, were to
complement these efforts. The global public good nature of the project was also recognized
by the 2006 Country Partnership Strategy (World Bank 2006b). The project was broadly in
keeping with the approach in the 2009 Country Partnership Strategy (World Bank 2009b)
that emphasized flexibility and responsiveness to evolving circumstances and Government
priorities, but was not specifically mentioned in any of the pillars of the strategy.

2.4     By the time of the project concept review in June 2006, the Government of Romania
had already controlled two waves of avian influenza outbreaks among poultry in October
2005 and April 2006, demonstrating substantial capacity to respond to outbreaks.14 Romania
already had disease monitoring in high risk districts, a passive surveillance system, and
significant diagnostic capacity at a central biosecurity level 3 (BSL 3) animal health
laboratory. 15 However, the Bank reported that there were still a number of weaknesses in
capacity in the veterinary services agency: monitoring was not done at a national level, there
was no active surveillance program, there was limited diagnostic capacity in county
laboratories, there was an insufficient level of epidemiological analysis, there was no
integrated animal disease information system, and carcass disposal was still done through
open burning (World Bank 2006a).

2.5     Avian influenza remained a relevant threat to humans and the poultry sector as of
project closure, with a continued threat of outbreaks from infection by wild birds. An
outbreak occurred among backyard poultry in Tulcea County in March 2010, and was
controlled successfully though culling operations, without support from the project.

2.6     An important factor in the client demand for the project was to demonstrate to the EU
that the country was prioritizing capacity building for emergency response. IEG mission
conversations with government officials revealed that adequately dealing with outbreaks and
being ready for future emergencies were ‗tests‘ for Romania as it prepared for accession to
the EU. In fact, the Government had to submit an avian influenza contingency plan to the EU
as a requirement for accession on January 1, 2007. The 2009 Country Partnership Strategy
clearly recognized that the EU and related institutions had become Romania‘s main external
partner (World Bank 2009b). Hence, supporting the Government in its accession priorities
was clearly in keeping with the Bank‘s strategic approach.

2.7     With respect to other zoonoses and infectious disease emergencies, IEG discussions
with government officials and project staff reveal that there was another reason which is not
explicitly mentioned in project documents. Unless Romania could demonstrate that it had
eliminated (or at least was able to control) several zoonotic diseases, such as swine flu and
bovine tuberculosis, it could not comply with EU market standards for trade in animals and
animal-origin products. Part of the motivation to include other zoonoses in the objectives was

14
  The government undertook a set of specific measures to contain the outbreaks. These included among others:
culling of poultry, specific laboratory exams on a large number of samples, expenditure on disinfectants and
drugs, distribution of diagnosis kits, incineration and euthanasia of thousands of poultry, compensations to
owners of deaf and destroyed poultry.
15
     For differences in levels of BSL-2, BSL-3, and BSL-4 laboratories, see Annex B
                                                         9


coming from the goal to increase the country‘s capacity to monitor and track diseases of
animal origin so that they could be eliminated. However, these other zoonotic diseases were
not an emergency in the same sense as avian influenza. Bovine tuberculosis, swine fever,
and rabies are prevalent in Romania, but they do not have the potential capacity to mutate in
ways that would allow sustained human-to-human transmission, as is the case for avian
influenza. Unlike other zoonoses, influenza pandemics can kill millions of people once
launched.

2.8        On balance relevance of the original objectives is assessed as substantial.

RELEVANCE OF THE REVISED OBJECTIVES

2.9     After the restructuring, reducing the threat to the poultry sector was removed from the
objectives, narrowing the focus and reducing the ambition of the project. However,
preventing avian influenza in poultry is critical to preventing infections in humans. The
revised objectives were only designed to build capacity to respond to the possibility of
human infections through contact with infected animals, and to respond to an influenza
pandemic emerging within Romania or from abroad. Thus, the base of the pyramid was
missing. As long as the virus continues its circulation in birds, the danger of a mutation that
can spread between humans remains. The Joint United States Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC)/World Health Organization (WHO) mission to Romania, in response
to a request from the Ministry of Public Health in the context of increasing infections in wild
birds and poultry in the Danube area noted:

           ―Overall, the prevention of human cases in Romania requires the control of avian influenza in poultry,
           particularly backyard poultry, and a proactive social mobilization targeted to households and children
           in rural setting.‖ 16 (Joint CDC/WHO Mission to Romania 13-17 February 2006).

It is no wonder that the three technical organizations—WHO, the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO), and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE)—have
emphasized containment at the source and considered reducing the load and circulation of the
virus in poultry a critical part of the strategy to reduce the risk of human infections or the
development of a pandemic (FAO 2007b).

2.10       The relevance of the revised objectives is rated as modest.

Design
COMPONENTS

2.11 The project had three components—Animal Health, Human Health and Public
Awareness, and Communications and Implementation Support. Each of the components had
several sub-components, summarized below:

2.12 Component I: Animal Health (Appraisal estimate EUR 14.25 million, Actual
EUR 0.22 million) This was by far the largest component, with four sub-components: (a)
16
     As the mission document noted, backyard poultry and children coexist in poor rural areas.
                                              10


Strengthening the Institutional Framework, through technical assistance for evaluation of
national veterinary services, technical support for realigning the structures and resources of
veterinary and food safety institutions with identified priorities and tasks, and technical
assistance for HPAI prevention and control contingency planning. (b) Strengthening Disease
Surveillance, Diagnostic Capacity, and Research, through technical assistance and training
for the staff of veterinary service institutions at national and local levels and for
epidemiological studies and surveillance programs; technical assistance and finance of
priority laboratory equipment and consumables and increasing the diagnostic capacity of the
Institute for Control of Biological Products and Veterinary Drugs; setup of a comprehensive
integrated national animal disease information system, and preparatory support for zoonotic
disease research and improved facilities for live animal research. (c) Strengthening HPAI
Control Programs, through purchase of equipment for animal culling and disposal, and
technical assistance for planning and implementation of poultry vaccination campaigns. (d)
Improving Bio-security in poultry production and trade, on small-scale poultry farms through
awareness campaigns, knowledge assessment and transfer, and investment incentives for
infrastructure upgrades.

2.13 Component II: Human Health (Appraisal estimate EUR 19.73 million, Actual
EUR 17.1 million) This component had three subcomponents: (a) Enhancing Public Health
Program Planning and Coordination, through financial and technical support for research,
conferences, and workshops. (b) Strengthening of National Public Health Surveillance
Systems, through upgrading the National Influenza Laboratory to BSL 3 and strengthening
regional laboratories by providing equipment and training.(c) Strengthening Health System
Response Capacity, through strengthening isolation and case management capacity in
national and regional hospitals, and upgrading an influenza vaccine production unit at the
Cantacuzino Institute.

2.14 .Component III: Public Awareness, Communications, and Implementation
Support (Appraisal estimate EUR 3.47 million Actual EUR 0.7 million) (a) Public
Awareness and Communication, through strengthened institutional capacity for the National
Sanitary, Veterinary, and Food Safety Authority (henceforth the national veterinary agency),
support for development an integrated communications strategy and action plan for both
human and animal health based on research, and implementation of that plan. (b)
Implementation Support, Monitoring, and Evaluation, through financing staff and operating
costs of the existing project management unit in the Ministry of Public Health and the unit to
be established in the national veterinary agency, and studies and surveys for monitoring and
evaluation (M&E).

INSTRUMENT AND FINANCING

2.15 The Romania project was part of a horizontal multi-country adaptable program loan
and, similar to avian influenza projects in other countries, was processed as an emergency
investment operation using procedures under Operational Policy 8.50 on Emergency
Recovery Assistance (see also Box 1). Total project cost at approval was EUR 37.5 million,
financed by a loan of EUR 29.6 million. The Borrower was to provide EUR 7.9 million. The
project was not co-financed. However, the Borrower sought parallel financing from the EU
for upgrading 16 country laboratories in all of Romania‘s eight regions. The European
                                              11


Union‘s Phare project also allocated EUR 500,000 for consumables to upgrade diagnostic
capacity at the regional and national levels, as well as culling and disposal equipment and
disinfectant points on roads.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION DESIGN

2.16 As originally designed, monitoring and evaluation was the responsibility of both the
public health ministry and the national veterinary agency. At design three outcome indicators
were identified (Annex B, Table 6). While they were relevant they were not specific enough
to appropriately capture project outcomes. For example, it was not clear what would be
considered an ―appropriate‖ contingency plan with respect to the first indicator. Further, the
indicator related to risk of human infections was too broad and it is difficult to see how gains
in it could be attributed to the project as several factors, including improved nutrition, can
lead to decline in the risk of human infections.

2.17 There were also intermediate results and corresponding indicators identified for each
component. It would have been helpful if the task team had also linked the 33 intermediate
result indicators to the three outcome indicators instead of just the components.

IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS

2.18 With animal and human health components, both the Ministry of Public Health and
the National Agency for Sanitary, Veterinary and Food Safety were project implementation
agencies. A Project Management Unit was responsible for project management in each
implementing agency. A Steering Committee consisting of representatives from the Prime
Minister‘s Office, the Ministry of Economy and Finance, Ministry of Public Health, the
national veterinary agency, and the two project management units was responsible for project
coordination.

Relevance of Design
RELEVANCE OF DESIGN TO THE ORIGINAL OBJECTIVES

2.19 In keeping with the GPAI Program, the Romania project had separate animal and
human health components and the causal framework emphasized the strengthening of
institutional capacity, including capacity in surveillance, diagnostic, and response systems as
a means of increasing the country‘s preparedness for avian influenza. The inclusion of an
animal health component was important not only for achieving the objective of reducing the
threat to the poultry sector, but also for reducing the threat posed by avian influenza in the
poultry sector to human health. The initial design was largely appropriate to the original
objectives.

2.20 The use of an emergency instrument was less relevant. Unlike many other countries
supported under the GPAI, Romania already had significant capacity to control avian
influenza outbreaks in the short term, and its main gaps in capacity were for longer term
issues that could potentially be addressed using a standard investment instrument. Activities
such as support for strengthening applied veterinary research capacity did not justify an
                                                       12


emergency intervention. Further, civil works were included as part of the project and could
not begin without government permits. Increasing vaccine production capacity relies on a
licensing process that takes time. These factors made for a complex and complicated project
design, unlikely to be completed in a three-year emergency intervention.

2.21 Financing through the horizontal Adaptable Program Loan set up for the GPAI
contributed to this shortcoming, because it meant that operations in all countries facing a
threat from avian influenza would be processed as an emergency, even in cases like Romania
where effective emergency response capacity had already been demonstrated.17

2.22 On balance, however, relevance of design to the original objectives is rated as
substantial.

RELEVANCE OF DESIGN TO THE REVISED OBJECTIVES

2.23 Because all activities related to the animal health component were eliminated from
the project, it led to a major disconnect with the revised objective to build capacity to prepare
for, control and respond to future infections of HPAI and other zoonoses. Neither of these
could be tackled without some specific activities on the animal health side. Further, the
change from ―reducing the threat posed …‖ to “building capacity to respond …..‖ on the
human health side made the objective even more focused on longer-term capacity building
and less appropriate for an emergency operation. Operational Policy 8.50 notes the
importance of considering urgency when deciding on support with an emergency project.
The ‗building of capacity‘ does not happen immediately and was not in keeping with an
emergency project with a focus on rapid preparation and appraisal.

2.24     Relevance of revised design to the revised objectives is rated as modest.

3. Implementation
3.1    The project was appraised in July 2006 and approved within two months on
September 8. However, project effectiveness was delayed until March 19, 2007 because the
Romanian Parliament was not in session.18 Even though it was an emergency operation, it
was affected by the overall delayed effectiveness that characterized the rest of the Bank




17
  The GPAI document noted: ―Since this Program is designed to provide emergency finance to participating
countries to contain an outbreak of avian flu through early detection and rapid response measures, the
operations under the Program would be processed under the Banks‘ emergency policy, OP/BP 8.50. The
Program would treat specific emergency response projects in each country as ―phases‖ of a horizontal APL
[adaptable program loan]….‖ (World Bank 2005 p..13)
18
  The loan was approved by the Bank‘s Board on September 8, 2006, signed on October 5 and passed by
Romania‘s Chamber of Deputies on December 13, 2006. Since the Romanian Parliament was not in session
during the entire month of January the project effectiveness was delayed. The original deadline for effectiveness
was February 2, 2007. The Government of Romania sent a request for a 45 day extension of the effectiveness
deadline on January 12 which was granted and the new deadline of March 19, 2007 was established.

portfolio in Romania.19 The government and the World Bank office in Bucharest organized a
workshop to launch the project in May 2007. Significantly, the project did not become
effective until after Romania‘s accession to the EU in January 2007.

3.2     Project restructuring was approved by the Board on July 28, 2009 and primarily
consisted of canceling the animal health component which was not performing and
reallocation of EUR 3.9 million to human health to support the upgrading of the vaccine
production capacity at the Cantacuzino Institute. The reason for the restructuring was the
poor performance of the national veterinary agency in implementing the project according to
the original objectives and design. At the time of restructuring, animal health-related
management and communication activities were also canceled from the public awareness,
communication and implementation support component.

3.3     The project closing date was extended by a year to December 2010. In September
2010, the Government requested a second extension to allow for the completion of the civil
works at the Cantacuzino Institute, which was denied. Actual total project cost was EUR 20.5
million with the Bank loan being for EUR 17.9 million and the Borrower providing EUR 2.6
million. EUR 11.6 million of the Bank loan was canceled. The human health component was
nearly completely financed, however only a fifth of the public awareness component was
ultimately financed and virtually none of the component on animal health (Table 2.)

IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE

3.4     Disbursement initially was very slow. IEG mission discussions with government
officials revealed that project implementation started at a time when Romania was dealing
with a range of issues associated with the EU accession and capacity in general was
stretched. This was partly responsible for slow implementation. The pace and interest in
reforms in the country had also slowed considerably after the January 2007 accession.

3.5    On the animal health side changes in the top management of the national veterinary
agency after the accession led to changes in priorities from preparedness for avian influenza

19
  According to a World Bank portfolio review (World Bank 2007b) the average time lag between Board
approval and effectiveness for Bank projects in Romania was six months, significantly more than the Bank
average of 90 days.
                                                      14


to supporting the construction and equipment of a new animal disease control center. This
had an adverse impact on project implementation. As late as March 31, 2009, when 70
percent of the implementation period since effectiveness had elapsed, only EUR 1.7 million –
less than 6 percent of the original loan – had been disbursed. With the national veterinary
agency‘s continued reluctance to implement the project as designed and ineffective decision
making in the agency, the Bank threatened partial suspension of the loan in July 2008.20 On
March 31, 2009, the Borrower requested that Bank reallocate and partially cancel the loan,
which made the restructuring necessary.

3.6     The human health component, to which part of the resources were reallocated at
restructuring, also had its share of problems both before and after the restructuring that led to
delays in implementation. Several challenges arose: the contract with the company for the
consultancy services for designing the BSL 3 laboratory within the Cantacuzino Institute was
delayed; in August 2008 the Cantacuzino Institute had to shut down its vaccine production
because its Good Manufacturing Practice certificate expired; the design of the vaccine
production line was not completed for a while due to an unresolved issue with the design
firm; and in December 2009 civil works for the upgrading of the National Influenza
Laboratory at the Cantacuzino Institute were suspended because no building permit had been
issued by the Government. The situation was finally rectified with the efforts of the project
management unit, but valuable time was lost; Cantacuzino Institute‘s accreditation for
vaccine production was suspended by the National Drug Agency in April 2010 further
delaying the planned civil works.21 Unforeseen expenditures also emerged—for example
additional equipment for the filling line had to be procured. The existing equipment could
only wash the ampoules but not the vials for the vaccines and had to be upgraded.

3.7      Serious budget constraints at the Ministry of Public Health also impacted project
activities. Finally, some of the activities that could not be completed by project closing—the
rehabilitation of the vaccine production unit and rehabilitation of the vaccine filling station –
were transferred to the ongoing Bank-financed Health Sector Reform (Adaptable Program
Loan 2) project. At the time of the IEG mission in September 2011, 9 months after closing,
these activities remained incomplete.




20
  Several operational and institutional noncompliance issues justified the threat of suspension: the Steering
Committee did not provide effective guidance and oversight, the National Agency for Sanitary, Veterinary, and
Food Safety project management unit was not maintained in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, the Agency‘s
Project Coordinator had not effectively managed the implementation of the Project and had not prepared annual
work programs and budgets, and the Agency had not implemented the project in accordance with the provisions
of the Project Implementation Manual. The implementation of most of the agreed activities had not started. In
addition, against the background of these significant delays, the needed and requested update of the
procurement plan for activities under the animal health component had not been provided to the Bank.
21
  An inspection of the Cantacuzino Institute by the National Drug Agency in February 2010 found some
conditions necessary for the production of BCG and influenza vaccines lacking. To get temporary permits for
vaccine production the Cantacuzino Institute was required to rectify this situation, in particular through the
installation of water purification equipment. Following the inspection carried out by the National Drug Agency
on May 12, 2010 the accreditation was renewed and vaccine production resumed.
                                               15


SAFEGUARDS COMPLIANCE

3.8     The project was an Environment safeguard category B. Project activities were not
expected to have significant adverse environmental effects, though a moderate risk from
inadvertent spread of the avian influenza virus and improper waste management were
identified. The investments in facilities, equipment, and training for veterinary and public
health staff and laboratories were expected to improve the effectiveness and safety of
existing procedures and bring them in line with World Organization for Animal Health (OIE)
and WHO standards. Overall, the national legislation in Romania was found by the project‘s
Environmental Management Plan to be comprehensive and in line with EU directives (World
Bank 2006b). As an EU member state, Romania implements and manages the European
Union‘s Common Agricultural Policy that puts considerable emphasis on environmental
standards and good agricultural practices, including animal welfare standards (Otiman and
others 2010). The Joint Portfolio Review in 2008 also found that the local capacity in
environment management had increased considerably in the last few years and noted that this
could be one factor why two Romanian projects out of eight Bank-wide were chosen in 2006
for piloting the use of national environmental systems.

FIDUCIARY

3.9     Given the low level of disbursement by December 31, 2007, the Bank agreed to a
temporary audit waiver and allowed for a combined first audit for fiscal years 2007 and 2008.
There was some delay in submitting the audit report from the independent auditors. Overall
the report was clean, although one internal control issue was mentioned for the National
veterinary agency arising primarily because of the lack of adequate financial management
staff.

In May 2010, the Bank‘s financial management specialist carried out a comprehensive
assessment of project accounting and reporting arrangements, staffing, internal control
procedures, planning, and budgeting, counterpart funding, financial manual and external
audits. The assessment found that the Ministry of Public Health project management unit had
addressed all the recommendation from the 2009 financial management supervision mission
and its financial management arrangements were satisfactory. However, the arrangements at
the national veterinary agency project management unit remained unsatisfactory, mainly
because of insufficient financial management capacity but also because of the several layers
of control for the approval of each contract. Both these factors led to heavy delays in
approval of contracts and payments and in reconciliation of accounting records with bank
account statements.

IMPLEMENTATION OF MONITORING AND EVALUATION

3.10 As late as July 2007, work on an appropriate monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
system had not started and the relevant Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs)
rated M&E as unsatisfactory. Progress continued to be rated moderately or fully
unsatisfactory for a large part of the project period, rising to moderately satisfactory only in
December 2009 and then declining again.
                                                       16


3.11 With the restructuring, the first two outcome indicators were dropped (Annex B,
Table 2). All intermediate indicators related to Animal Health and Strategic Communication
were also dropped. The reporting in the ISRs on intermediate results and indicators is
problematic. First, the ISRs mix up the intermediate results and their indicators as laid out in
the Technical Annex and report on a mixture of ten without indicating why the specific ones
were picked. Second, M&E reporting was focused mainly on activity completion or initiation
and inputs rather than results. The opportunity to make the M&E framework more useful for
capturing project achievements was missed at the restructuring.

4. Achievement of the Objectives
4.1     Over the life of the project there were four objectives, of which two were original
objectives that were later dropped, one objective was introduced at restructuring, and one
objective was maintained throughout the project (Table 3). The evidence of achievement of
each of the four objectives is discussed below.

Table 3: Original and Revised Project Objectives
                     Objective                                    Original                     Revised

and other zoonoses

Reduce the threat posed to humans by HPAI and other zoonoses (Original
objective)
4.2     Animal products management practices: Since the animal health component was
canceled with minimal disbursement, the project did not make any contribution to improving
the biosecurity in backyard poultry farms, where traditional animal management practices
prevail.22 The commercial poultry houses generally have good levels of biosecurity, have
their own slaughterhouses and have made investments to get in line with EU requirements
(Moldovan 2010). Investments in machinery and equipment for slaughterhouses and in
buildings and means of transport for the pork and beef meat industry have increased,
reflecting the priority to bring technology in line with EU norms and standards in the country
22
  Biosecurity refers to measures taken to prevent incursion and spread of disease. It includes hygiene and
management measures to minimize the risk of introducing pathogens on farms or poultry establishments (―bio-
exclusion‖) and measures to minimize the risk of transmission of infection to other farms in case a disease
outbreak occurs (―bio-containment.‖) These two sets of measures would require among other things,
appropriate construction of poultry houses to prevent entry of wild birds and rodents, proper ventilation,
limiting entry of non-essential visitors, use of appropriate disinfectants in foot and wheel dips, hand hygiene,
aerial and litter disinfection, protective clothing. These measures are often supplemented with vaccination.
                                                        17


(ibid). A recent European Commission audit found that while progress has been made, there
are still major deficiencies in compliance with European Commission regulations in the
disposal of unprocessed animal by–products originating in backyard farms and in hygiene
conditions in some animal by-product processing plants (EC2011a). The audit also found
weaknesses in official controls at such plants. An OIE assessment in 2008 noted that the
existence of a large number of small farms makes it difficult to maintain quality standards
(OIE 2008).

4.3     Capacity to test for zoonotic bacteria and viruses to a quality standard: The
capacity to test for bacteria and viruses in both animals and humans exists in Romania. Each
county has a state veterinary laboratory and private laboratories and commercial farms often
have their own laboratories. The project, as designed, was to help strengthen diagnostic
capacity in Romania‘s national reference laboratory. However, as the animal health
component was canceled, the project did not make a contribution in this area. On the human
health side, however, the project supported upgrading the National Influenza Laboratory at
the Cantacuzino Institute. The civil works at the biosecurity level 3 (BSL3) laboratory were
completed, but the laboratory was not operational as of September 2011, as it lacked some
equipment and had not received certification.

4.4      Surveillance and monitoring for zoonoses: The 2008 OIE evaluation found that
border security and quarantine followed EU norms and were generally good (OIE 2008). The
project was to provide technical assistance and training for staff of veterinary service
institutions at national and local levels on routine collection of samples and intensive follow-
up around outbreak areas. It was to also provide technical assistance and training for
epidemiological studies and surveillance programs. However, none of these activities were
carried out.

4.5     Farmers’ incentives to report incidence of diseases: Romania has a system that
pre-dates the project to compensate famers for culled birds. Compensation payments are
subject to provisions of the national ―Compensation for Animal Diseases‖23 allocation under
the Ministry of Agriculture budget (World Bank 2006c). A framework and procedures were
effectively utilized during the 2005 and 2006 outbreaks for backyard poultry farmers.
Compensation was made at locally determined market prices. The project did not make any
contribution to the establishment of the compensation strategy, which was updated in 2009.

4.6     Measures such as culling taken in time to prevent infection from spreading
among birds and other animals: Romania was able to effectively deal with the avian
influenza outbreaks in poultry in 2005 and 2006. However, project documents at appraisal
identified weaknesses in disinfection stations, in the culling practices for infected and at-risk
poultry, and the safe disposal of poultry carcasses. The project did not contribute to
improvements in these areas because animal sector related activities, including the planned
procurement of CO2 containers and incinerators, were not implemented. The actions that
were undertaken by the Government to prevent spread of infection in 2005 and 2006, before
the project became effective, included quarantine of villages and restriction of movement of
humans, mass culling of poultry, removal of poultry meat from the supermarket, and

23
     Examples of animal diseases for which the fund can be used are avian influenza and swine fever.
                                                          18


restricting movement of poultry. These measures created panic and caused a huge loss to the
poultry industry.24 Data obtained from the Union of Poultry Breeders of Romania show a
decline in poultry meat prices after the 2005 outbreak. The enforcement of restrictions by the
authorities also led to resentment against the government (Matei and others 2007). This
hostility was clearly visible in the reaction that was seen amongst respondents to an IEG
quick survey of about 50 people undertaken in two counties.

4.7     Overall the project made a negligible contribution to the achievement of this
objective.

Reduce the threat to the poultry sector by HPAI (Original objective)
4.8     The project contribution to this objective was also minimal, as the animal health
component barely disbursed before it was canceled. The threat to poultry, particularly in
backyard systems, remains. In fact, further outbreaks in backyard poultry in Romania were
reported in 2007 and 2010. However, the population is aware of avian influenza. The IEG
mission carried out an informal survey of about 50 people in two counties, Brasov and
Tulcea. More than 95 percent of respondents knew about avian influenza, although several
did not see it as a real danger and thought that the events in 2005 and 2006 were a scare
spread by the government. It is not possible, however, to attribute the awareness created to
the Bank project. The government took active measures to communicate information on the
disease and communications campaigns in the country were supported through UNICEF and
donors such as USAID.

4.9     Overall the project made a negligible contribution to the achievement of this
objective.

Prepare for, control, and respond to influenza pandemics and other
infectious disease emergencies (Original and revised objective)
4.10 A human influenza pandemic arising from a mutation of the H5N1 virus did not
materialize over the life of the project or since it closed, so it isn‘t possible to assess the
ability to control an infectious disease epidemic. The government was successful in
controlling the outbreak of H5N1 in birds in 2005 and 2006, before the project was launched,
by enforcing quarantine of infected villages, school closure, and mass culling of birds to
prevent spread of infection. A national program for surveillance, prevention, and eradication
of animal diseases is in place in conformity with EU legislation. The project, however, did
not contribute to the surveillance activities. A 2008 OIE evaluation found that border security
and quarantine follow EU norms and are generally good (OIE 2008).

4.11 Biosecurity continues to be weak in backyard poultry systems. Over the years there
have been recurrent outbreaks among poultry in Romania—the most recent in March 2010.25

24
     It was estimated that avian influenza led to a decrease by 85 percent in poultry sales (Matei and others 2007).
25
   ―An outbreak of avian influenza or bird flu has been confirmed in Romania, the European Union website said
in a media statement on March 16, 2010. The European Commission will assess risk areas declared by the
Romanian authorities in relation to the highly pathogenic avian influenza in a backyard poultry farm in the
                                                        19


Data from OIE show that countries around the world continue reporting occasional outbreaks
of H5N1 in poultry and birds, and the risk of spread through migratory birds, remains.26
Because of the cancelation of the animal health component, the project did not make a
contribution in helping reduce the risk of recurrent avian influenza outbreaks in birds. The
risk of a human pandemic remains as long as conditions for the multiplication of the virus
remain in poultry.

4.12 The project did help contribute towards building capacity in the country to prepare
for and respond to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans,
however, by contributing to building intensive care capacity in seven regional and two
central infectious disease hospitals. Equipment provided through the project included
ventilation machines, monitors, furniture, intensive therapy accessories, clinical examination
and treatment equipment, and laboratory and mobile examination equipment. IEG mission
discussions with the Ministry of Public Health and hospital staff revealed that there were
technical problems with some of the hospital beds that were imported and that considerable
time and resources were lost in attempting to get them fixed by the supplier. The IEG
mission visited the two central hospitals in Bucharest and one of the regional hospitals. The
facility at the Matei Bals central hospital appeared to be effectively utilized. The other
central hospital had not begun utilizing the intensive care facility established under the
project, reportedly due to inadequate trained staff resources for running the facilities. The
fully equipped intensive care unit at the regional hospital was not being used.

4.13 Annex C presents broad criteria for determining the level of preparedness and
responsiveness, as gleaned from various WHO/FAO/OIE documents and discussions with
FAO and OIE staff. The extent to which the project helped Romania prepare for, control and
respond to influenza pandemics is assessed in the last column of the table against the broad
criteria. Preparing for, controlling, and responding to influenza pandemics requires actions
both on the human and animal health sides. It also requires recognizing and responding to the
two different diseases that the virus can cause in birds and in humans. The initial project
design had put emphasis on combining upgrading of the urgently needed capacities in the
country for controlling avian influenza in poultry and preventing human infections with an
increase in Romania‘s preparedness for a potential influenza pandemic. The project actually
only supported actions on the human health side with minimal contributions on the animal
health front.

4.14     Overall, achievement of this objective is assessed as modest.



commune of Letea, in Tulcea county, at the Danube's delta near the border with Ukraine. Authorities said it was
the H5N1 strain of avian influenza. To thwart the spread of the virus, all poultry has been culled in the infected
farm and a protection zone set up within a three-km radius and a surveillance zone within a 10-km radius
around the farm. According to the report, anywhere inside the 10km zone around the outbreak will be a critical
or "high risk area", surrounded by a low risk area in the periphery. Authorities also said that certain restrictions
on movements and additional bio-safety measures for poultry farms will apply.‖ The Sofia Echo March 16,
2010.

Build capacity to respond to potential future infections of humans by HPAI
and other zoonoses (Revised objective)
4.15 Through building increased capacity for vaccine production, which could be used
effectively during times of greater need (as it was during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009), the
project helped build the capacity to respond to potential future infections in humans. The
staff at the Cantacuzino Institute also received training on good manufacturing practice
standards in vaccine production. Contingency plans for pandemic influenza were prepared
and tested during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak.

4.16 The vaccine production unit at the Cantacuzino Institute was upgraded and the
trivalent influenza vaccine production capacity is reported to have increased from 30 doses
per week in 2008 to 79 doses per week in 2009. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the
Institute was able to significantly increase pandemic vaccine production (Figure 2).27 As of
September 2011 the Institute could produce 8,000 vaccine doses per month. However, some
rehabilitation work for the bulk vaccine production area and the ampoule sealing and filling
station could not be completed during the project and was transferred to the then ongoing
Health Sector Reform 2 project.

4.17 The project also helped build a BSL-3 laboratory at the Cantacuzino Institute. The
IEG mission visited the laboratory and found that most of the equipment had been installed.
However, some pieces of equipment, such as the glove box (a specialized bio-safety cabinet)
and the decontamination system, were still to be procured and the laboratory had to be
certified before it could be effectively utilized.

4.18 The equipping of intensive care facilities in seven regional and two central infectious
disease hospitals has also helped build capacity in the country to deal with infections of
humans by HPAI and other zoonoses, although being able to utilize the facilities effectively
with adequate medical personnel remains a concern.

4.19    Overall, achievement of this objective is assessed as substantial.

  The first case with the H1N1 virus in Romania was detected on 27 May 2009 and the Cantacuzino Institute
was able to undertake such diagnosis. Reagents for molecular detection of pandemic H1N1 virus from the
United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta arrived at Cantacuzino Institute on May 5,
2009. Pandemic vaccine preparation activities commenced soon thereafter at the Institute.

5. Efficiency
5.1     Assessment of efficiency involves considering the benefits in relation to the costs,
cost-effectiveness, and efficient use of resources. It is very difficult to conduct a meaningful
economic analysis of avian influenza control projects, because the likelihood and severity of
avian influenza outbreaks among poultry, the likelihood of pandemics among humans, and
the quantitative efficacy of mitigation efforts are largely unobservable and unknown. An
economic analysis at project closure (World Bank 2011d) estimated an economic rate of
return of 28-86 percent in a base case scenario, but this is based on a methodology with a
number of weaknesses. The analysis uses real historic data on the costs of 2005-6 avian
influenza outbreaks among poultry, but then relies on arbitrary and arguably implausible
assumptions about the probability of further outbreaks (severe outbreaks occurring every 5
years) and the degree to which the project investments would reduce the risk of outbreak
among birds or would reduce the impacts of an influenza pandemic (halving the infection
rate among humans).28 The assumed impacts on infection rates among poultry (from 3 or 5
percent to 2 percent are particularly implausible, given the cancellation of the animal health
component; no project activities were completed that could plausibly reduce the probability
or severity of poultry sector outbreaks.



28
  It is not clear why the ex post analysis used a 3 percent gross attack rate for the without project scenario when
the Technical Annex (World Bank 2006a, page 86) confirms that the actual gross attack rate was 1.41 percent in
2005-2006. There is also a problem with the assumption of a severe outbreak with a mutated virus occurring
every five years. In the 20th century there were three human influenza pandemics (1918, 1957, 1968) and there
has been one so far in the 21st century (H1N1 in 2009) (see Annex B of this report, Table 1).
                                               22


5.2     While the project implemented far less than was planned, it also expended only 55
percent of planned resources. Yet there is ample evidence that, as implemented, it was
inefficient in design and was not implemented at least cost. In terms of design, both before
and after the restructuring the project addressed only coping with the spread of avian
influenza among humans once it occurred and preparation for future human outbreaks; it
neglected to address preventing transmission to humans in the first place by reducing
infections among poultry. In terms of least-cost implementation, there were serious delays in
procurement, disbursement, and implementation of the ―emergency‖ operation, due in part to
limited coordination between the human and animal health sides of the project (not facilitated
by the Coordination Committee), frequent changes in the national veterinary agency‘s
management and support for the project, frequent turnover of staff in the implementing
agencies and their project management units. This left a lot of investments unfinished or not
yet operational as of the end of the project, among them the rehabilitation of vaccine
production at the Cantacuzino Institute, the procurement of the remaining equipment to make
the BSL3 laboratory functional, the certification of the laboratory, and adequate technical and
other staff capacity to actually effectively utilize the intensive care units at the communicable
disease hospitals, among others. There is also the issue of quality of some of the beds
procured for the regional hospitals and the two central hospitals, which has implications for
efficiency of resource use.

5.3    Overall efficiency is assessed as modest.

6. Ratings
Outcome
6.1     According to the harmonized evaluation criteria used by the World Bank and IEG,
when a project‘s objectives are formally revised by a restructuring with the Board, the project
outcome is assessed under the original objectives and the revised objectives, and the two
outcome ratings are weighted by the share of the operation disbursed at the time of
restructuring. The restructuring of this project took place in July 2009, at which time about 9
percent of the actual project cost had been disbursed the remainder being disbursed after the
restructuring.

6.2     The original objectives and project design were substantially relevant to Romania, but
achievement of two of the objectives – reducing the threat posed to humans by HPAI and
other zoonoses and reducing the threat to the poultry sector – was negligible and of the third
objective – to prepare for, control, and respond to influenza pandemics and other infectious
disease emergencies – was modest. Efficiency of the project as implemented was modest.
Under the original objectives, the project‘s outcome was unsatisfactory.

6.3     The restructuring that revised the objectives and components introduced weaknesses
in the relevance of the objectives and design, reducing the relevance of both to modest.
Achievement of the objective of building capacity to respond to potential future infections of
humans by HPAI and other zoonoses was substantial, but modest for the other objective, to
prepare for, control, and respond to influenza pandemics and other disease emergencies.
                                              23


Efficiency was also modest. Thus, also under the revised objectives, the project‘s outcome is
assessed as unsatisfactory.

6.4     As the outcome rating under both the original and revised objectives is the same,
when weighted by the share of the operation that had been disbursed, the overall outcome
rating is also unsatisfactory, denoting major shortcomings in relevance, efficacy, or
efficiency.

Risk to Development Outcome
6.5     The difficult economic conditions in Europe have tightened budget and resource
constraints in Romania. Project documents show that the share of the Ministry of Public
Health budget earmarked for projects funded by international organizations was already
lower in 2010, the last year of project implementation, than the amount initially requested by
the Ministry‘s project management unit. The government has begun a comprehensive but
difficult medium-term reform program for the public sector to balance revenue and spending
and enhance efficiency of service delivery but the fiscal situation remains tight (World Bank
2010a). Under these circumstances, resources for hiring staff, training, and operation and
maintenance remain very limited, with consequences for the sustainability of services from
the project‘s investments.

6.6      The intensive care units were constructed and equipped in the seven regional and two
central communicable disease hospitals. However, the hospitals are finding it difficult to
utilize them because of lack of adequate trained personnel and doctors. There has been a
recruitment freeze in public sector employment and cuts in personnel costs as part of the
measures to contain the financial crisis (World Bank 2010b). Following the recent
decentralization of hospitals, managers of the regional hospitals, including those on
communicable diseases, report to the district councils and city halls and this has introduced a
new complexity that would influence the overall contingency plan for dealing with
emergencies and pandemics.

6.7     Several budget-related challenges are also being faced by the Cantacuzino Institute.
The institute does not receive any budget transfer from the Ministry of Public Health. It is
dependent on its own income primarily from sale of vaccines and payments for tests
performed in its laboratories, but also to a lesser extent research and graduate and
postgraduate teaching in microbiology. While the project contributed to the building and
equipping of the BSL3 laboratory at the institute, the laboratory was not completed, as the
decontamination system and the glove box (a specialized bio-safety cabinet) had not been
built. The World Bank reported that the laboratory was completed and certified in late 2011
and that the facility is fully capable, but has not been used, as there have been no further
outbreaks of avian influenza. However, the BSL-3 laboratory provides additional capacity to
undertake molecular diagnosis should avian influenza or other serious infectious diseases
arise. It is unclear whether there are sufficient resources to sustain the facility. BSL3
laboratories are more expensive to operate and maintain (among other things the need for
maintaining negative pressure, generators to ensure continuous electricity supply, and regular
decontamination). Resources for kits, reagents, and other basic consumables will be an
additional requirement. In addition, there is need for continuous training for taking adequate
                                                        24


precautions when dealing with highly dangerous pathogens in high containment biological
research laboratories (BSL3 laboratories for example).29

6.8    As regards vaccine production, IEG mission conversations with technical staff at the
Cantacuzino Institute revealed that the work related to the building of the shell and the
upgrading of the machine at the filling line was essential, as without it future vaccine
production at the Institute would be jeopardized. While this was not completed by project
closure, it was transferred to the Health Sector Reform (Adaptable Program Loan 2) project.
This work had not been completed by the time of the IEG mission in September 2011, but the
World Bank reports that this work was completed in 2012. As of June 2013 final tests and
assessments for certification of good manufacturing practice were still in progress, so vaccine
production had not yet restarted.

6.9      Overall risk to development outcome is assessed as significant.

Monitoring and Evaluation
6.10 Design and implementation. As noted in earlier sections, the M&E design before
the restructuring incorporated three appropriate outcome indicators, though not specific
enough to distinguish the contribution of the project. After restructuring, the outcome
indicator of reduced ―risk‖ of human infections remained, though difficult to quantify.
Implementation of the M&E system was delayed and rated in the unsatisfactory range for
most of the project‘s life. Most of what was collected was in terms of outputs.

6.11 Utilization of the data. Overall the usefulness of the project M&E system to project
management was limited. First, because of the restructuring, the project objectives and most
of the outcome indicators changed mid-stream and therefore there were only limited areas
where results could be monitored from start to finish. Second, there was limited reporting on
M&E in the early project years. Finally, the opportunity to make the M&E more relevant to
the project was missed at the restructuring.

6.12     Overall, project M&E is rated negligible.




29
  ―At the workshop, participants discussed similarities and differences in infrastructure, oversight and
personnel training between bio-safety level 3 (BSL-3) and bio-safety level 4 (BSL-4) laboratories. There was
clear consensus among the participants that hands-on proficiency training, mentorship, and didactic training are
critical for establishing and evaluating the researcher‘s ability to work in a high-containment laboratory; a
variety of individuals, from researchers to administrators and support staff to equipment service personnel,
require some level of training before gaining access to high-containment laboratories; bio-safety training
programs have to be flexible to account for the research (one size does not fit all), model systems, facilities, and
job function; and the average cost of personnel training varies from $4000-$7000 for researchers to hundreds of
dollars to $4000 for training non-scientists, like administrators.‖ (AAAS 2009). For differences in levels of
BSL2, BSL3 and BSL4 laboratories see Annex B.

Bank Performance
QUALITY AT ENTRY

6.13 To meet the challenges of containing avian influenza and the threat of a pandemic,
the project as originally designed had three features that promised a coordinated response:

      First, it provided for the animal health and food safety agency and the human health
ministry to come together in one intervention and allowed for a holistic approach;

       Second, recognizing the difficulty in getting staff from different sectors to work
together, it realistically provided for a multi-sector, multi-agency Steering Committee that
also included the Ministry of Economy and Finance;

      Finally, through a horizontal adaptable program loan, the country-level effort was to
be coordinated with the global effort to control avian influenza and involved cooperation
between several donors and the World Bank.

6.14 The Bank responded with alacrity to the Borrower‘s request for support, moving from
concept review to approval in 10 weeks. However, effectiveness took another 6 months (a
significant delay beyond the World Bank standard for an emergency operation) because the
Romanian Parliament was not in session.30

6.15 The Bank did not take the tremendous ongoing accession-related changes in Romania
into account when advocating the emergency intervention. Such consideration would have
made it clear that Romania did not actually need support to tackle the immediate outbreaks of
avian influenza, which had already been addressed. What the government asked for was
support for building capacity for the future. An emergency loan – even if related to the
themes of the HPAI horizontal adaptable program loan – was not an appropriate instrument
for building long-term capacity.31 Further, the project as designed included civil works that
needed special permits, vaccine production that needed licensing, and purchase of equipment
for hospitals that is generally time-consuming; the amount of time needed for these approvals
and clearances made it unsuitable for an emergency operation. Ultimately, the project that
was designed was complex and ambitious, with a longer time horizon and too many sub-
components for an emergency operation.

6.16 The implementing arrangement for the project with two separate implementing
agencies, two project management units, and a Steering Committee did not work effectively.
The Bank reports that it had strong commitment from the national veterinary agency at entry,
30
  In Romania a World Bank loan can only become effective after the passage by the Parliament of the
ratification law, the promulgation by the President, and the publication in the Official Gazette. Endorsements by
the Ministry of Public Finance, the Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are a prerequisite for
submission to the Parliament (Joint Portfolio Review 2005). The Romanian government did not choose to use
emergency parliamentary procedures to approve the project loan and hasten project effectiveness, suggesting
they may also have recognized that the project was not addressing an emergency.
31
  In fact, project files reveal that the Ministry of Economy and Finance had actually approached the Bank
informally for a ―research‖ project.
                                                     26


and that commitment declined only after approval with a change of management and staff in
the agency. But this risk was not entirely unforeseeable: Romania has historically had a
highly politicized bureaucracy, and this contributed to several changes in top leadership at
the national veterinary agency, which then led to waning interest and lack of implementation.

6.17 Preparation paid too little attention to coordination of project activities with other
sector interventions. For example, the World Bank was supporting the Modernization of
Agricultural Knowledge and Information System project, approved in FY05, whose objective
was to improve the competitiveness of farmers and agro-processors while helping them meet
EU standards. Similarly, in the health sector the Bank was supporting the second phase of a
health adaptable program loan, also approved in FY05, which, among other things, provided
for purchase of medical equipment in hospital emergency health rooms.

6.18 It is also not clear whether the project design was well coordinated with other
government and donor programs on zoonotic diseases or food safety improvements, such as
those supported by the European Union Phare program.32 Other serious shortcomings at
entry included weak design of monitoring and evaluation.

6.19    Overall quality at entry is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

QUALITY OF SUPERVISION

6.20 Project implementation experienced significant delays because of serious problems in
institutional decision-making in the implementing agencies. The project became effective on
March 19, 2007 and as of November 30, 2007, EUR 0.27 million of the Bank loan (i.e. 0.9
percent) had been disbursed. Early supervision missions spent considerable time discussing
with project counterparts, measures to increase efficiency of decision-making in
implementing agencies and speed of project implementation. However, they were not very
successful in increasing the disbursement rate until after the restructuring. The IEG mission
found that there was concern in the national veterinary agency that the Bank was too rigid in
not agreeing to changing priorities. Project files reveal that the task team tried to be flexible
but also had to keep the emergency intervention on track. The Bank tried to use suspension
of disbursements to encourage the veterinary agency to act, but this was unsuccessful. The
Bank was proactive in helping restructure the project and cancel the animal health
component that was not performing. However, inadequate attention was given to the quality
of monitoring and evaluation and its use for decision-making during project implementation.

6.21 As initially designed, the project involved Bank staff from both the agriculture and
health sectors, with the task management being with agriculture. After the restructuring, with
the elimination of the animal health component, task management was transferred to health.
Interviews with task team members suggest that task management of the project with the
agriculture sector during the initial project period posed a challenge in terms of incentives for
32
  The functional review of the health sector in Romania (World Bank 2011a) found that special health
programs have grown much faster than any other item in the health budget and now account for about one-fifth
of the total health expenditures and 2.3 times larger than the total budget for primary care. The program for
communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis accounts for about 10 percent of the budget for
national programs.
                                                     27


the Bank health sector staff and there was learning in getting the two sectors to work
together.

6.22    Quality of supervision is rated moderately satisfactory.

6.23    Overall Bank performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Borrower Performance
GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE

6.24 The Government, with the support of the international community, mounted a rapid
response to contain the outbreaks and, among other things, requested Bank support to
increase Romania‘s avian influenza preparedness and the response capacity in its human and
animal health institutions. Part of the motivation came from Romania‘s aspirations to be part
of the EU; following accession in January 2007, interest in the project and in undertaking
other reforms waned. In fact, in the national veterinary agency‘s priorities changed
completely with a new President after the accession.

6.25 Interviews with government officials and other stakeholders in the field reveal that as
it approached accession, Romania also went through a process of tremendous policy change
and reform that stretched the capacity of government agencies and significantly affected the
country‘s capacity to absorb resources and implement development projects. The Joint
Portfolio Review in 2008 found that the performance of development projects, deteriorated
after 2005. The Bank also gradually declined in importance as a player; with the accession
Romania acquired access to a wide array of financial resources.33 To some extent the project
was caught in these changing times.

6.26 There were some country-specific factors that existed across the lending portfolio that
adversely influenced the performance of the project. One of these was the weakness in the
planning, programming, budgeting, and execution of project activities arising from
inadequate public financial management, slow approval of projects and high turn-over of
staff in the country (Joint Portfolio Review 2008). Another generic issue was related to the
implementation arrangements for World Bank projects in Romania. Bank-supported projects
have been implemented through project management units because of in-country capacity
constraints. There are salary differences between management unit and Ministry/agency staff.
The project management units are generally staffed by experts who move from one project to
the other and typically do not belong to a particular implementation agency. Hence, if project
implementation is not proceeding well, the project management unit Director and staff may
move on to a management unit for another project. The 2005 Joint Portfolio Review had
already noted the need for streamlining project management unit implementation
arrangements. In the avian influenza project, particularly on the animal health side, the

of financial resources either through the financial market—domestic and international thanks to the investment
grade status achieved in 2004, through potentially significant fiscal transfers from the European Union in the
form of structural and cohesion funds as well as from the Common Agricultural Policy, or through international
financial institutions of which the World Bank is only one.‖ Joint Portfolio Review 2008.

management unit staff found it difficult to work in the highly centralized decision making
structure that characterized the national veterinary agency and consequently staff turnover
was a major constraint.

6.27 There was limited coordination between the human and animal health project
management units and the fact that the Steering Committee did not actively support
coordination of project activities was also a serious concern. In fact, the first meeting of the
Steering Committee did not happen until December 2007, more than a year after the project
became effective.

6.28 IEG mission discussions with government officials revealed that relations between
the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the national veterinary agency were also difficult
and communication between them was weak. Project files and discussion with staff revealed
that the national veterinary agency did not move ahead with implementation of the original
project design for a while because it was expecting the Ministry of Economy and Finance to
agree to their changed priorities. However, this did not happen.

6.29    Government performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

IMPLEMENTING AGENCY PERFORMANCE

6.30 The national veterinary agency was a serious constraint to project implementation. It
had been established in 2004 as the main body in charge of food safety and animal health in
the country. It reported directly to the Prime Minister‘s office, yet the precise distribution of
responsibilities and the chain of command within the Agency were not clear. There were also
uncertainties about its ministerial affiliation, as its responsibilities were covered partly by the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and partly by the Ministry of Public health.
These organizational issues contributed to a lack of clarity in decision making processes and
chains of command that reduced project performance.

6.31 Several other aspects of the National veterinary agency‘s performance severely
constrained project implementation and made restructuring essential: there were frequent
changes in the top management at the agency that led to shifts in priorities and lack of
support for the project as designed; the highly centralized decision-making process,
hierarchical structure and managerial weaknesses within the agency made it difficult for the
project management unit to get contracts approved; there was limited connectivity of the
project management unit to the national veterinary agency institution; disagreements
between the agency‘s legal and technical departments and the Bank made it difficult for
procurement packages to be prepared; relations between the agency and the Ministry of
Economy and Finance were difficult and the agency could not get support from the latter for
its changed priorities. The frequent turn-over of staff in the management unit made things
worse. In fact, the implementation of both the Modernization of Agriculture and Rural
Development and the avian influenza projects were affected by the Agency‘s institutional
weaknesses and lack of familiarity with Bank projects.34 Staff turnover was also an issue at

34
 Implementation of activities related to the National Agency were discontinued in the Modernization of
Agricultural Knowledge project as well (World Bank 2010a)

the Ministry of Public Health and its project management unit, adversely affecting
implementation.

6.32 Ministry of Public Health commitment and performance was overall strong, although
the frequent change in leadership in the Ministry negatively affected implementation. There
were also budget-related challenges that arose because of the financial crisis that made it
difficult for the government to provide counterpart funding in time. The ministry‘s project
management unit carried out regular reconciliation of accounts and used internal control
procedures in accordance with Romanian legislation. However, procurement activities were
significantly behind schedule and delays had led to several unfinished tasks in the
Cantacuzino Institute before project closure.

6.33   Implementing agency performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

6.34   Borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

7. Lessons
7.1    Building on the project experience this assessment identifies the following lesson:

7.2      Countries that have already effectively controlled avian influenza outbreaks in
poultry many not need an emergency project, but rather long term capacity building.
In this case, Romania controlled avian influenza outbreaks in 2005, 2006, and 2010, and
already had a passive surveillance system, centralized diagnostic capacity, and a functioning
veterinary service agency. The real emergency issue was EU accession, but after accession
was achieved the government lost interest in the project.

7.3     The evaluation also notes that following this project, avian influenza is still a threat to
Romania. Avian influenza risks cannot be minimized without ensuring adequate capacity in
the animal health sector and adequate biosecurity in the poultry sector. Interventions that
target only the human health sector will miss the most effective way of reducing the risk to
humans – by controlling the disease among poultry. Project designs that do not improve
biosecurity on commercial farms or backyard systems will miss an opportunity to reduce the
likelihood of avian influenza outbreaks.

Annex B. Additional Documentation
Annex B1: Influenza and Avian Influenza (AI).35

Influenza viruses: Influenza in humans can be caused by type A, B or C viruses, with the
former two causing most human infections. Influenza A viruses naturally infect humans, as
well as such animals as birds, pigs, and horses, and they generally cause yearly epidemics
and, potentially, pandemics. Infections with influenza B virus are generally restricted to
humans and cause epidemics more rarely.

Avian Influenza in birds: Avian influenza is caused by A type viruses that occur naturally
among wild birds that usually do not exhibit symptoms. It is very contagious among birds.
Infected birds shed the virus in their saliva, nasal secretions, and feces. Domestic birds such
as chickens, ducks and turkeys can become infected through contact with infected wild birds,
from other infected domestic birds, or through contact with dirt in cages, water or feed that
has been contaminated. Infection in domestic birds can result in either a low pathogenic
form of the disease which may go undetected because of mild, not very obvious symptoms
(such as ruffled feathers or a drop in egg production) or a highly pathogenic form (where
multiple organs get affected) that spread rapidly with mortality rates that can reach 90 - 100
percent within 48 hours. An example of the latter is infection with the H5N1 virus. The
subtypes differ based on differences in two main proteins on the surface of the virus
(hemagglutinin [HA] and neuraminidase [NA]). There are 16 known HA subtypes and 9
known NA subtypes of influenza A viruses. Many different combinations of HA and NA
proteins are possible. Each combination represents a different subtype.

Human infections with avian influenza viruses: The virus does not normally infect humans
but can infect them if they come in contact with infected poultry or contaminated surfaces.
Symptoms in humans range from usual human influenza-like symptoms (example, fever,
cough, sore throat, and muscle aches) to eye infections, pneumonia, severe respiratory
diseases (such as acute respiratory distress), and other life-threatening complications. The
symptoms and severity vary depending on the virus type. The highly pathogenic H5N1 virus
that has recently been circulating in poultry does not as yet readily circulate in humans.
However, where human infections have occurred in contact with infected poultry the virus
has been deadly. As of March 16, 2013, the laboratory-confirmed human toll stood at 622
cases including 371 fatalities, but the reported human instances of the disease from contact
with infected birds understate the true number of infected people. Although disease
awareness has increased, cases are still likely to be underreported.

Pandemic in humans with the avian influenza virus: Annual or seasonal influenza
epidemics are caused by the previous seasons‘ viruses or by ones with slight antigenic
changes. By contrast a pandemic is caused by an A virus that contains hemagglutinin (HA)
for which there is no preexisting immunity, facilitating the virus‘s rapid spread throughout
the world. Through re-assortment or mutation the virus could become capable of replicating

  in humans and spreading easily among them. Mutation occurs when a virus changes its
  genetic makeup allowing it to transmit from person to person, whereas re-assortment occurs
  when two different viruses exchange genetic material. The re-assortment could happen if
  animals that are susceptible to both human and avian flu, such as pigs, become concurrently
  infected with both kinds of flu. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic was caused by a virus that
  emerged from pigs. H3N2, H1N1, and H2N2 are examples of avian influenza virus types
  that have, in the past, circulated among humans. Studies confirm that the 1918-19 Spanish flu
  likely originated from the re-assortment of avian and human viruses. Since the 1918
  pandemic, the population of the world has grown 3-fold; therefore, if a new influenza A virus
  is as lethal as the 1918 virus, as many as 180–360 million people could die. The 1957 H2N2
  and 1968 H3N2 pandemics also involved new influenza viruses generated by re-assortment
  events, and, although they were less virulent than the 1918 H1N1 virus, they still caused
  significant morbidity and mortality. Both of these viruses resulted from re-assortment of a
  Eurasian wild waterfowl virus with a previously circulating human H1N1 virus.

  For a pandemic to occur from an avian influenza virus, three conditions would need to be
  met: (i) a new subtype would have to emerge for which there is little human immunity; (ii) it
  would have to infect humans and cause illness; (iii) it would have to spread easily and
  sustainably among humans. To date the third condition has not been met because the virus
  has not improved its transmissibility among humans. The concern is that, with some re-
  assortment of genes (through co-infection with two viruses) or adaptive mutation (that could

increase the capability of the virus to bind to human cells), this could occur. Resistance in
current virus strains to one of the two classes of available antiviral drugs as demonstrated in
                                                     vitro has added to anxiety about

Around the World
                                                    Between 2003 and 2008, 47 countries
                                                    reported the highly pathogenic H5N1 form
                                                    of avian influenza in their domestic
                                                    poultry (IFPRI 2008). H5N1 was first seen
                                                    in a farmed goose in China in 1996
                                                    (IMCAPI Hanoi 2010). The first outbreak
                                                    was recorded in Korea in December 2003
                                                    (World Bank 2008). By 2004 the virus had
                                                    spread to several East Asian countries and
                                                    by 2006 had reached several Asian,
                                                    European and Middle Eastern and African
                                                    countries. Unchecked trade and movement
                                                    of infected poultry was one of the main

Annex B2: High Containment Laboratories

There are four levels of bio-safety laboratories (AAAS 2009 and Petric and others 2006). The
lowest level, bio-safety level 1 (BSL-1), includes research ―involving well-characterized
agents not known to consistently cause disease in immune competent adult humans, and
present minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment.‖ Bio-safety
level 2 (BSL-2) includes ―work involving agents that pose moderate hazards to personnel and
the environment.‖ Bio-safety level 3 (BSL-3) ―is applicable to clinical, diagnostic, teaching,
research, or production facilities where work is performed with indigenous or exotic agents
that may cause serious or potentially lethal disease through inhalation route exposure,‖ and
requires that laboratory personnel receive specific training in handling pathogenic and
potentially lethal agents, and be supervised by scientists competent in handling infectious
agents and associated procedures. Bio-safety level 4 (BSL-4), the highest level, ―is required
for work with dangerous and exotic agents that pose a high individual risk of life-threatening
disease, aerosol transmission, or related agent with unknown risk of transmission.‖

responsible for the surveillance of infectious diseases in the EU and maintains databases for epidemiological surveillance.
