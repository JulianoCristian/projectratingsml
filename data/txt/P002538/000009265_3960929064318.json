The thrust of\n            this phase is: (a) to consolidate progress in exchange rate,\n            fiscal, and monetary policy; (b) to stimulate economic\n            growth through appropriate trade and pricing policies, and\n            land redistribution; (c) to rationalize the public\n            investment program; (d) to improve the administrative\n            capacity of the public sector through public enterprise and\n            civil service reform; (e) to improve the functioning of the\n            financial system; and (f) to manage the exernal debt burden\n            with the view to freeing up resources for economic growth.\n            The program will continue to focus on improved incentives\n            for production of traded goods within a stable macroeconmic\n            framework. It also includes a technical assistance component\n            primarily geared to support institutional reform."}, "docdt": "1990-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
