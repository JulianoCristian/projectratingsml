Northern Thailand. The\n            Government's objective is to strengthen PTT (Petroleum\n            Authority of Thailand) with a view to enabling it to become\n            an effective joint venture partner. PTT's participation\n            in this venture is important as it is the first significant\n            exploration/production joint venture for Thailand. The\n            firsthand experience gained will help Thailand ensure that\n            its overall framework for hydrocarbon exploration &\n            development is appropriate, & is supportive of its\n            policy of encouraging private sector involvement in oil/gas\n            exploration. The project would comprise the establishment of\n            the joint venture & its investment program up to 1988;\n            the project would also include a technical assistance &\n            training program which is directed both at enhancing\n            PTT's role in relation to other joint venture options.\n            The major benefits of the project, therefore, are\n            strengthening Thailand's hydrocarbon exploration &\n            development strategy, enhancing the role of the private\n            sector, strengthening the institutional capability of PTT\n            & resource mobilization. It will also provide an\n            established framework for other such ventures including the\n            basis for expeditious negotiations."}, "docdt": "1985-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
