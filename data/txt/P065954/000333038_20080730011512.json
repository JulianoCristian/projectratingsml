Adjustment Loan (SECAL)\n            Project for Slovak Republic were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: strong monitoring and evaluation\n            frameworks should be adopted for all project development\n            objectives (PDOs). This was not the case for the\n            access/equity PDO in the SECAL Project, a significant\n            oversight given the institutional mandate. This leaves a\n            void in evaluating the impact of the reforms on this issue.\n            In addition, health projects that aim to improve quality of\n            care should be modest about what can be measured.\n            Multi-tranche, multi-year policy-based development policy\n            lending is fraught with risk in an environment of political\n            uncertainty and implementation challenges. In these\n            circumstances, a programmatic series of single-tranche\n            operations should be given serious consideration as a means\n            to enhance flexibility. Policy-based lending in the health\n            sector is an important (and arguably under-utilized) Bank\n            instrument for promoting development objectives in the\n            common case where the political capital to undertake\n            difficult reforms, and not a lack of financial resources per\n            se, is the key binding constraint to strengthening sectoral\n            outcomes. Ministry of finance engagement is a critical\n            ingredient to successful health sector reform."}, "docdt": "2008-05-19T00:00:00Z"}
