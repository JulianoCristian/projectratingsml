The overarching objectives\n            are to: (a) improve fiscal discipline through structural\n            changes in the health sector, that will alleviate the\n            chronic problem of arrears in the sector, encourage greater\n            technical, and allocation efficiency, and institute a system\n            that will promote fiscal sustainability; (b) improve the\n            quality and cost-effectiveness of the health sector; and,\n            (c) mitigate any possible negative impacts on health care\n            access, especially for vulnerable populations.\n            Implementation of the reforms supported by HSMS SECAL would\n            contribute significantly to expenditure control in the short\n            term, and reductions in the medium term. However, risks\n            include weak expenditure management by health insurance\n            companies and hospitals, and excess hospital capacity. While\n            it is imperative that key legislation is passed, so that the\n            reform implementation have the appropriate legal support,\n            there is the likelihood of adverse outcomes due to reform\n            itself. Nevertheless, in the current context of already high\n            expenditures for health care, there is little realistic\n            opportunity to mobilize significant additional resources, to\n            balance expenditures and revenues. For the government\n            strategy to succeed, measures to mitigate risks include a\n            careful sequencing and phasing of the reforms, supported by\n            laws and regulations, including prudent financial\n            supervision, where regulations, and incentive structures\n            should be technically designed. Monitoring capacity of\n            access to health care, and private expenditures should be\n            established, including capacity building for key health\n            sector staff."}, "docdt": "2003-08-18T00:00:00Z"}
