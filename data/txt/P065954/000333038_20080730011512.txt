F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overall goal of HSMS SECAL is to support comprehensive health sector reforms
that promote fiscal sustainability while continuing to provide quality health care services
and financial protection for the population. The overarching objectives are to: (i) improve
fiscal discipline through structural changes in the health sector that will alleviate the
chronic problem of arrears in the health sector, encourage greater technical and allocative
efficiency and institute a system that will promote fiscal sustainability; (ii) improve the
quality and cost-effectiveness of the health sector; and (iii) mitigate any possible negative
impacts on health care access, specially for vulnerable populations.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., Program Document/ISR,
not evaluative):

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country macroeconomic and structural/sector background, rationale
for Bank assistance)

During the five years preceding project approval, Slovakia had recovered from the
financial crisis that occurred in the late 1990s, undertaken extensive structural reforms in
the banking and corporate sectors, labor markets and public enterprises, and by 2002 had
achieved robust GDP growth of 4.4%. It had also begun fiscal consolidation with an eye
toward EU accession in 2004. It was in this context, and following the ruling coalition's
re-election in 2002, that focus was shifted to fiscal challenges in the health sector. Public
spending on health was quite high at 7% of GDP (compared to about 5% in other new EU
member states), but most importantly it was characterized by large and rising arrears
among hospitals and insurance companies. Bank support was part of the government's
larger reform effort to modernize the health sector in Slovakia, as reflected in a then-
recent Government Manifesto approved by the Parliament in November 2002. The
program aimed at providing stable conditions for the health sector, including stopping the
growth of health sector indebtedness and strengthening regulatory functions, especially
with respect to quality. The rationale for WB assistance was to play the role of a strategic,
technical, and financial partner in what was anticipated to be a challenging and ambitious
health reform program. The HSMS SECAL was part of twin support provided by the
Bank to Slovakia's health reform program, together with an accompanying technical
assistance loan (TAL). These projects were inter-dependent: while the SECAL addressed
the policy objectives of the reform, the TAL provided the necessary technical and
capacity support for the implementation of the reform strategy. The TAL project is
ongoing until mid-2009.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The overall goal of HSMS SECAL was to support comprehensive health sector reforms
that promote fiscal sustainability while continuing to provide quality health care services
and financial protection for the population. The overarching objectives, as articulated in
the Program Document, were to: "(i) improve fiscal discipline through structural changes
in the health sector that will alleviate the chronic problem of arrears in the health sector,
encourage greater technical and allocative efficiency and institute a system that will
promote fiscal sustainability; (ii) improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of the health
sector; and (iii) mitigate any possible negative impacts on health care access, specially for
vulnerable populations".

As was normal for projects approved at that time, the Program Document and other
supporting documentation (e.g., Loan Agreement) do not include a formal results
framework. However, there is a discussion of performance indicators (pp.22-23) that
noted the importance of indicators on social impact, debts in the health sector, and the


                                               1

following: (i) development and passage of enabling legislation; (ii) ratio of general
budget deficit to GDP and a measure that would allow for the calculation of the
contribution of the health sector to the deficit; (iii) drugs prescription patterns; (iv)
clinical guidelines for primary and secondary health services; (v) measure of ambulatory
surgeries; (vi) number of hospitals granted autonomy; (vii) bed occupancy rates in
hospitals; (viii) baseline data on allocative and technical efficiency indicators; (ix)
baseline data on allocation of health expenditures for preventive and primary health care;
(x) baseline data on allocation of health expenditures for secondary and tertiary health
care; (xi) administrative costs of health insurance companies; and (xii) number of
functioning hospitals and hospital beds. Most, although not all, of these issues were
monitored as in the Data Sheet (and ISRs #4 to #8).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

The Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators remained unchanged for the
duration of the program.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

The health sector reforms were implemented in two phases. The first was a set of
stabilization measures aimed at controlling the growing indebtedness of the health system
(including the introduction of nominal copayments for patients, changes in the process
and procedures related to procurement and reimbursement of pharmaceuticals, and
selective hospital restructuring in the districts of Bratislava, Kosice and Banska Bystrica).
The second was a set of systemic measures intended to maintain the stability and increase
the efficiency of the system. Both phases were accompanied by efforts at capacity-
building and improving the institutional underpinnings of the sectoral reforms.

The measures supported by SECAL were clustered into the following six policy areas:

(i) Health care financing

The five health insurance companies (HICs) were to be given the necessary autonomy
and capacity-building to enable them to become active purchasers of health services,
including contracting selectively with providers and implementing new provider payment
systems to address cost-containment, efficiency and quality issues. In terms of their status,
they were to be converted from public entities to joint-stock companies which could
make and retain profits. The HICs would remain subject to government regulation,
designed to promote access to care. Specifically, all HICs would be required to provide
the revised state-guaranteed basic benefit package to all the insured; the HICs would
collect contributions, but only be permitted to retain 10 percent of their collections,
depositing the rest in an equalization pool to dilute incentives for risk selection; and, the
MOH would regulate the HICs to the extent deemed necessary to lessen market failure.

(ii) Scope of state-guaranteed healthcare



                                               2

The objective of this policy area was to move from a benefits package that was
exceptionally generous with virtually all mainstream services included and no official
cost-sharing to a package with full coverage for catastrophic care, partial coverage for
other essential care and no coverage for non-essential services. In addition, the
Government reform strategy had already implemented a proposal to introduce
copayments for primary health care and outpatient visits, inpatient care, and drug
purchases. These reforms were intended to counter excessive consumption of health
services (e.g., nearly the highest out-patient contact rate in the region), and generate some
revenue.

(iii) Hospital autonomy

The MOH proposed to rationalize the number of hospitals and hospital beds by
consolidating a number of hospitals and reconfiguring the mix of hospital beds, starting
in the large cities of Bratislava, Banska Bystrica and Kosice, and followed by other areas.
Attention was to be paid to maintaining access to hospitals for vulnerable populations and
those in less-populated areas. It also proposed to grant administrative and managerial
autonomy to hospitals and implement policies that would generate market-like conditions
aimed at enhancing efficiency. On the one hand, autonomous hospitals would face hard
budget constraints, there would be no government guarantee to their suppliers, and
hospitals that continued to build arrears would face the prospect of bankruptcy or closure.
On the other hand, autonomous hospitals would be allowed to retain savings and keep
revenues for re-investment.

(iv) Quality of care

Reform plans had a particular focus on quality of care, as it was assessed that clinical
protocols were out-dated and not compatible with evidence-based medicine and cost-
effectiveness analysis; that there was no functioning quality of care system using
evidence-based medicine; and that there were no institutional mechanisms to review the
quality of care. The main objectives were to establish a quality assurance system and to
introduce evidence-based medicine as well as institutional mechanisms in the MOH,
HICs and hospitals for continuous quality improvement. A Health Care Surveillance
Authority (HCSA) was to be established which would provide accreditation of health
services, and carry out financial surveillance, reviews of health services, licensing of
professional and institutions, as well as the development of standard therapeutic
procedures and clinical guidelines.

(v) Financing of social and long-term care

Acute care hospitals had provided inappropriate and inefficient long-term nursing care
and social care for patients who could potentially be cared for with home support or
lower cost nursing home care. The main objective of reform measures with respect to
social and long-term care was to create financing mechanisms that would ensure that
groups using these institutions would not be affected as hospitals close wards that are
allocated to long-term and chronic patient care. These financing mechanisms were



                                               3

expected to stimulate a supply-side response in terms of the growth of private social care
services. It was also expected that, as hospitals were exposed to the incentives associated
with the reforms, geriatric wards and wards for the chronically ill would be closed down.

(vi) Improving management and regulatory capacity

In order to improve hospital management systems, a comprehensive HMIS was to be
implemented with HSMS SECAL resources. Its design was to be financed under the
companion HSMS TAL project. In addition, the HSMS SECAL was to support the
strengthening of the regulatory capacity of MOH to oversee the functioning of the HICs
and HCSA.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

No changes were made to the original policy areas supported by the program.

1.6 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

The closing date was extended by three months, from December 31, 2006 to March 31,
2007. This was due to uncertainty about the status of reforms following the change in
government in mid-2006.

The financial allocation to the project in US$ increased from an original commitment of
US$ 62.9 million to a final disbursed amount of US$ 69.6 million due to the depreciation
of the US dollar against the Euro over the period of the loan.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance (supported by a table derived from a policy matrix)

Program performance with respect to fulfilling actions identified in the policy matrix was
very good. All tranche release conditions were met, as the table shows below. However,
the second-tranche release date was delayed due to some implementation delays in 2004-
05 related to the passage of key legislation. The third tranche-release date was also
delayed due to uncertainty about the status of the reform agenda after the change in
government in mid-2006.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

This section summarizes key factors throughout the operational cycle that were
significant contributors to both the project's achievements and its shortcomings,
beginning with preparation and then addressing appraisal.

It should be noted that the project was consistent with Bank strategy at entry. The
Country Partnership Strategy in effect at the time of SECAL preparation was approved in
2001. It acknowledged the threat posed by health sector deficits to fiscal stability (p.12:
"Serious problems have emerged in health finance...arrears are rapidly mounting"). It
also identified the prospect of a lending program to help address this (p.iv: "A second
social sector operation would build on preparatory activities in health and the currently
on-going sector analyses"). The SECAL was also consistent with many aspects of OD
8.60 (the adjustment lending operational policy in effect at approval, replaced in 2004 by
OP/BP 8.60) with respect to both the rationale and criteria for policy-based lending.

Many of the project's significant achievements can be traced back to two key elements
that were in place from the outset: (i) soundness of background analysis; and (ii)
ownership.

Soundness of background analysis: A strong feature of the project was the quality of the
analytical underpinnings and coherence of the policy reform strategy. Both the Bank and
the Borrower deserve credit for this. Key analytical components included a
comprehensive seminar on health reform conducted in Bratislava in February 2001 with
World Bank and Slovak reform team participation, and a major piece of economic and
sector work in June 2002 entitled "Slovak Republic: Review of Social Policy and
Expenditures".1 With regard to the coherence of the health sector reforms, the strategy in
essence drew heavily from the "managed competition" model featuring insurance
competition subject to government regulation, of which variants can be found in a
number of OECD countries (e.g., Germany, Netherlands). The major objective to tackle
efficiency through market-oriented reforms was appropriate in a system suffering from
severe debt problems, but the strategy was mindful of pitfalls related to quality and equity

                                                       6

and so there were attempts to address these issues as well. For example, the Health Care
Surveillance Authority was created to oversee quality (and modeled on similar agencies
in Ireland and the Netherlands), a minimum provider network was established to
safeguard access, and fee exemptions for the poor were adopted for equity. Sharply
different models of health reform could have been (and were) espoused to address
Slovakia's problems and such models have also been successfully implemented
elsewhere in the OECD. However, the chosen policy design option was coherent, highly
relevant to the reform imperatives prevailing at the time, and was itself also consistent
with viable health system approaches already existing in other successful Western
European models. Indeed, elements of the reform strategy were also adopted by the
Czech Republic in April 2008, suggesting Slovakia was several years "ahead of the
curve".2 In short, ex-ante policy design architecture supported by SECAL was strong.

Ownership: Country ownership of the SECAL-supported policy reforms was strong at
the time of project approval. Several indicators that could be used to assess country
ownership were evident in Slovakia at the time of approval.3 First, the Parliament had
already signaled its commitment by passing the Government Manifesto on Health
Reforms in November 2002 and this was consistent with subsequent SECAL design.
Second, the fundamentals of the reform strategy had largely been identified by the
Borrower, not the Bank, and key architects of the reforms were in key positions (e.g., the
Minister of Health and his advisors). Third, important steps in the strategy had already
been implemented before project approval (e.g., the introduction of user fees). Fourth,
the government had a strong track record of reform in other sectors. However, the
applicability of these indications of ownership had been considerably diminished by the
time of the third tranche release (as discussed in a later section).

Ownership at approval also extended beyond the MoH, as the Ministry of Finance (MoF)
played a critical role in the launch of SECAL. Mindful of the fiscal drain posed by the
health sector and the need for fundamental reforms, the MoF agreed to provide additional
financing for the health sector ­ by agreeing to borrow and pass on SECAL financing to
the MoH, and by creating the Veritel credit vehicle to erase past hospitals debts ­ in
exchange for the implementation of reforms to ensure sector sustainability going forward.
Officials at the MoF during that time cited the important third-party role of the Bank as a
strategic and technical partner in securing this "deal". The support of the MoF, despite
the availability of cheaper financing from the markets (Slovakia issued Eurobonds with a
coupon of 4.5% in early 2004), ensured broader government ownership of the project's
objectives. The nature of this domestic consensus for policy reform also underlines why
a policy-based lending operation was the appropriate instrument for Bank engagement.




2Although the Czech Republic was planning to take eight years undertaking an agenda that Slovakia attempted to do in
three years, this reflects in large part the different scale of the sectoral debt problems in the two countries.

However, there were also project design features that subtracted from quality at entry, as
follows:

Timing, tranches, and political risk: In hindsight, it is clear that there were tensions
between the timing of the project and the political calendar. Both the 2001 CPS and a
2003 EIU country report noted the political risks associated with the fractious incumbent
coalition government. However the project, which was built on a very challenging
reform agenda ("shock therapy" for the health system), was scheduled to continue well
into an electioneering period and indeed to straddle the electoral cycle (elections were
originally scheduled for September 2006, while project closure was due in December
2006). Moreover the SECAL project was designed as a multiple tranche release
operation, with three tranches. Prior to approval, one reviewer suggested a programmatic
approach and another suggested only two tranches and `frontloading'. The rigidities of
multi-tranche settings had become increasingly recognized within the World Bank at the
time of approval.4 Bank operational guidelines for policy lending written a year after
SECAL approval stated that "a programmatic approach is especially useful if
implementation capacity is uncertain or if political support for certain elements of the
program might shift".5 This seems particularly germane to Slovakia, where
implementation delays and a loss of ownership due to the change in government proved
to be the most significant risks to fully achieving PDOs. A more flexible design that
would have allowed for a recalibration of reform plans in response to political
developments might have been more appropriate when embarking on a potentially
controversial health reform agenda. In sum, the SECAL experience is a possible case
study of why single-project, multi-year, multi-tranche designs may not be desirable in
policy contexts similar to the one prevailing in Slovakia at the time.6

With regard to the project's lifespan, the major factor influencing implementation was the
steady decline in popular support for, and eventual replacement of, the government in
office at the time of project approval in 2003. Key dates are indicated in the table below.

    January 2005 Departure of several key members of reform team in MoH
    August 2005 Second SECAL tranche release
       June 2006 Center-left coalition led by Smer party and PM Fico takes over
                       following legislative elections (3 months early)
     March 2007 Third and final tranche release of SECAL; project closes

While the project got off to a good start, over time these events had a significant impact
on implementation. In particular, the following points emerged from discussions with
key stakeholders and observers:

· Passage of key reform legislation (e.g, pertaining to health insurance companies and
   providers) was delayed in 2004 following a veto by the new president. Although
   subsequently overridden (a major victory for the reform effort), valuable time was
   lost. More generally, drafting legislation was a more arduous process than most
   stakeholders had originally appreciated.
· The political management style of the leadership within the Ministry of Health at the
   time was widely acknowledged to have had a negative impact on prospects for
   consensus-building.
· The departure of key members of the reform team in the Ministry of Health (although
   not the Minister) undermined implementation capacity for a complex set of reforms at
   a critical juncture.
· The approaching election weakened coalition resolve to take on entrenched
   opposition to reform in 2005-06.
· Opinion polls conducted in March 2005 suggest that the unpopularity of the health
   reforms (especially the introduction of co-payments which were immediately
   repealed by the new government) contributed to the 2006 election outcome.7
· Slovakia had been undergoing extensive reforms in numerous sectors since 1998
   (trade, commerce, public enterprises, pensions, health, etc.) and this may have
   contributed to "reform fatigue" among the population.
· Following the election, a Bank supervision mission noted that the incoming
   government's proposals "will potentially have serious fiscal implications" and "will
   reverse the far-reaching sectoral reforms introduced by the previous government".
   There were extensive internal discussions in the Bank about the impact of the change
   in government on the project and whether to proceed with the third tranche release.
· Ownership of SECAL-supported reforms declined significantly under the new
   government, as the population had arguably given it a mandate to take health reform
   in a new direction. By mid-2006, many of the key elements of the SECAL agenda
   were on the way to being reversed (e.g., institutional arrangements to enforce a hard
   budget constraint for hospitals and insurance companies).
· Nevertheless, a booming economy and plans to adopt the Euro in 2009 (which
   mandates fiscal discipline) have helped sustain the sector.

In sum, political uncertainty during project implementation was significant and
complicated the achievement of project objectives. To the extent that the political
challenges were exogenous (e.g., reform fatigue following years of upheaval in other
sectors), the project's significant achievements are to be lauded. However, to the extent
that they were endogenous (e.g., a lack of attention to consensus-building), they suggest
an important lesson: namely, that a coherent, analytically sound reform plan can
nevertheless encounter significant obstacles in large part due to shortcomings in
management, implementation and communication. Furthermore, these aspects of the
reform process were ex-ante under-appreciated.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

The Program Document includes a discussion of performance indicators (pp.22-23) and
the closely-related conditionalities of the policy matrix on which subsequent tranche
releases were made. However, there were no baselines for these indicators, and the
Supplemental letter to the Loan Agreement reproduces the policy matrix but does not
identify specific indicators. The discussion of M&E here is based on the PDOs and the
underlying results indicators listed in the regular implementation status reports (ISRs) by
the Bank team.

The PDO statement on page i of the Program Document included a reference to virtually
every possible goal of a health sector: efficiency, sustainability, access, quality, financial
protection, and equity. The Slovak government's reform plan was indeed systemic in
both design and implication, and the interrelationships between these objectives
warranted that due attention should be given to each one. However, there was a certain
disconnect between the ambition of the objectives and the scope of the M&E framework.
M&E for each PDO is discussed in turn.

The first PDO relates to ensuring the fiscal sustainability of the health sector. The main
corresponding indicators were the contribution of the health system to the overall budget
deficit, and the number of hospitals incurring debts. The program document raises the
problematic issue of defining debt ("Measurement of debt poses many problems" ­ p.22),
and states the need for "a measure that would allow for the calculation of the contribution
of the health sector to the deficit" (p.23), but does not fully resolve the issue. Indeed, the
second and third tranche release documents evaluate different indicators (debt vs. deficit)
which, although clearly related, highlight a certain lack of clarity. In general, however,
the project regularly collected and reported data on health sector debts, and thus was able
to consistently monitor progress towards improved performance. Broader issues of
efficiency, such as hospital closures, average length of stay (ALOS), and occupancy rates
were also regularly monitored. Overall, with the minor exception of a certain lack of
definitional clarity, M&E design and implementation for this PDO was sound.

With respect to the indicators for the second PDO related to improving health sector
quality, the policy matrix identified and reported on the creation of the Health Care
Surveillance Authority (whose core mandate was to focus on quality), the adoption of
clinical guidelines, and the development of information systems. These are simple binary


                                              10

indicators and they focus on the inputs rather than outputs of a quality health system
("necessary but not sufficient conditions"), and as such do not allow for conclusive
statements about improvements in quality outcomes. In addition, data was regularly
collected on other quality-related performance indicators (e.g., post-operative infections,
etc.) and reported in ISRs, but attributing these to the project is difficult given the array of
potentially confounding factors. Monitoring quality in the health sector is notoriously
difficult, and improvements may only be achievable over longer time horizons. The
project does an adequate job of tracking inputs to better quality.

The weakest link in the M&E framework relates to the third PDO addressing access and
equity. No related PDO indicator was identified or monitored. In the policy matrix, only
the third tranche condition to draft a report examining equity issues explicitly addressed
this. By its own admission, this report had insufficient data to draw clear conclusions:
"the data analyzed in this study are only averages, and so do not reflect the extremes. To
monitor the impact of changes on specific social classes it is necessary...to appraise
specialized data." (Social Impact Assessment report, p.44) Otherwise there are no other
performance indicators directly relevant to equity and access. No use was made of
household surveys, although this was regretted by peer reviewers both prior to approval
and in the context of a retrospective analytical report. The regular household survey in
Slovakia is plagued with comparability issues, but subsequent studies have attempted to
overcome this, and a specialized survey might have helped. While the overall reform
design took access and equity into account (e.g., fee exemptions for the poor, minimum
provider network), the M&E framework did not. There was reportedly reluctance on the
part of the Borrower to emphasize this component. Since the issue was central to the
political debates about the health reforms, this shortcoming was important.

In sum, the strength of the project's M&E framework varied widely across PDOs. M&E
for fiscal sustainability was strong, M&E for quality was adequate, and M&E for
equity/access was inadequate.


2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

No follow-up project is anticipated as the Slovak Republic approaches IBRD graduation.
The technical assistance loan that was approved together with the SECAL is ongoing, and
will close on June 30, 2009.




3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The project development objectives (PDOs) were and remain relevant to Slovakia's
reforms. Fiscal sustainability in particular remains high on the agenda in view of the
planned adoption of the Euro in 2009. The attention to quality and equity also remain


                                                11

relevant. Indeed, despite the change in government, it is notable that all three of the
PDOs were identified by the new administration in the Manifesto released in August
2006 shortly after it took office, as reflected in the following quotes:

· "The Government sets for itself the following program objectives... to fulfill the
    criteria for the transition to the Euro currency in 2009." (p.5);
· "The fundamental framework of enforcement of the policies and objectives of the
    Government contained in this Manifesto will be prudent budget policy, as well as
    fiscal policy, and the gradual strengthening of the stability of the public finances. This
    will be done at the same time as strictly observing the Maastricht criteria and
    obligations of the Slovak Republic ensuing from the revised Growth and Stability
    Pact." (p.6);
· "The government considers health, equality in health care provision, and health care
    availability as the fundamental right of every citizen." (p.33);
· "The government will ensure availability and quality of health care for all citizens
    and it will prevent uncontrolled and inefficient extension of the network of health
    care facilities." (p.34).

Indeed, balancing efficiency, equity and quality of the health sector is a constant theme in
health reform in OECD countries, and in many ways Slovakia received a very rapid
introduction into that reality during the SECAL project's lifetime. (The Slovak reform
experience has also generated much interest elsewhere in the region). Thus, the
continued relevance of the project's objectives to Slovakia is clear.

However, the continued relevance of the project with respect to design (and therefore
implementation) has become much less clear. This is largely due to the contrasting views
of the new government with its predecessor on key tenets of health reform, especially the
appropriate public/private mix in financing and provision. Key elements of the original
reform program have been eroded, as discussed further in Section 4. Alternative
institutional arrangements are possible for achieving the same overall objectives noted
above, and as the new government has revealed its preference to opt for one of these
alternatives, the original design of reforms is becoming increasingly defunct.8 However,
the relevance of certain other design components, such as the creation of the HCSA
regulatory agency, is likely to be more robust to the test of time.

The project's objectives remain relevant to the Bank's assistance strategy for Slovakia
(e.g., the prevailing CPS (2004) also notes the importance of fiscal sustainability as an
objective in terms of a lower deficit to comply with Maastricht criteria). The project
design is still relevant for improving quality (e.g., ongoing TAL activities), but less so
with respect to achieving fiscal stability through market incentives in view of the new
reform direction.




8This does not, however, imply that the relevance of design at the time of project approval was inappropriate, for the
reasons noted in Section 2.2.




                                                         12

Lastly, it is noteworthy that from the perspective of the Bank, the operation remains very
relevant from a global standpoint. The new 2007 Health, Nutrition, and Population
(HNP) strategy identifies contributing to fiscal sustainability as Strategic Objective #3,
and the Slovakia project is arguably one of the best examples of Bank engagement on this
issue in an operational and lending context. The quality and equity objectives of the
SECAL are both closely related to Strategic Objective #1 of the HNP strategy. The
choice of policy-based lending also remains very relevant to this kind of operation and
similar middle-income clients. The increased use of policy-based instruments, whether
multi-sectoral or sector-specific, the challenge of tailoring these to the health sector, and
the need to remain relevant in middle-income countries for whom traditional lending
products may not be appropriate, suggest many potential lessons learned from the
Slovakia SECAL experience.


3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between policy actions supported by operations and
outcomes)

This section discusses in turn each of the three PDOs and their associated performance
indicators. As noted above in Section 2.1, all tranche release conditions identified in the
Program Document policy matrix were met. It should also be noted that Slovakia
maintained a stable macroeconomic policy stance during the life of the project, a key
prerequisite for policy lending that was monitored and reported throughout project
activity in key documents. Real GDP growth has accelerated, inflation has moderated,
the fiscal deficit has remained manageable, and the external deficit has been financed in
part through strong foreign direct investment inflows.

Improve fiscal sustainability through structural changes

This was the most important objective of the SECAL operation. SECAL-supported
reforms to pass legislation transforming the administrative and managerial arrangements
faced by hospitals and insurance companies, and the resulting creation of hard budget
constraints, were central to the progress that was achieved. Debts fell furthest where
those reforms went deepest. The table below shows the evolution of arrears within the
health system. During the life of the project, total health sector arrears declined by over
70% in nominal terms and by over 80% when measured as a share of GDP. This sharp
decline in the level of indebtedness corresponds to the achievement of the policy matrix
condition for the reduction of health sector deficits.

The following points elaborate on the trends in the table:

· With regard to overall sector-wide debt levels, the sharp decline in debt stocks in
    2003-05 can be broadly attributed to the role of Veritel (an entity created by the MoF
    to buy out approximately SKK 20bn of hospital debt in 2003-04). Whether or not a
    new debt problem has re-emerged in subsequent years largely reflects the relative
    success of SECAL reforms to impose hard budget constraints.
· The gains have proved most durable on the balance sheets of insurance companies,
    where the improved incentives for efficiency through reforms (conversion to joint
    stock companies, selective contracting) went furthest.
· While there has been little improvement among municipal hospitals, these are outside
    implementing agency (MoH) control.
· In the key category of MoH hospitals, early and substantial progress towards reduced
    debt stalled after 2006. In 2007 arrears rose by over 28%. This is in large part
    because initial measures to grant autonomy to key faculty hospitals have not been
    followed up with conversion to joint stock companies after the change in
    government.9 This process has instead been stopped. Without an explicit repudiation
    of a state guarantee for hospital liabilities, incentives to further reduce debt have been
    blunted. The importance of joint-stock status is highlighted by the fact that among
    hospitals that were transformed, debt levels stood at only SKK 6m at end-2007.
· The sustainability of these trends will be addressed in Section 4.

Performance indicators for the fiscal sustainability PDO were interpreted as indicative
rather than rigid targets. As noted in Section 2.3, there was a lack of clarity in the project
documentation (program document and tranche release documents) regarding the precise
meaning of "the contribution of the health system to general budget deficit". There was
also broad interpretation of the policy matrix requirements for the reduction in the
number of hospitals incurring debts by 25% (second tranche) and 50% (third tranche). In
2003, 46 of 51 MoH hospitals were in arrears; by 2007, 27 of 38 were (the total number
declined as some hospitals were merged or transferred to municipalities). However, in
most hospitals the stock of arrears was not increasing, or was below a low threshold of

SKK 1m. Overall, the health sector debt situation improved substantially during the
project life, although significant uncertainties remain.

Other performance indicators also point to slow but steady progress towards greater
health sector efficiency. Common to most transition countries, Slovakia's health system
has struggled with rationalizing excessive hospital infrastructure. Progress in this regard
can also be traced to the structural reforms intended to create the right incentives for the
efficient delivery of health care, and the rationalization plans referred to in the policy
matrix. The table shows trends in several efficiency indicators. The total number of beds
fell by 11% nationwide between 2002 and 2006, but with uneven progress across the
three major cities. Other indicators also improved.

stay (ALOS)

Despite these gains, there is a widely held view that further progress in reducing bed
capacity (from about 36,000 to 30,000 nationwide) is necessary. The slow progress
towards further hospital closures, and the potential return of soft budget constraints, could
have worrying consequences for sectoral efficiency and indebtedness.

Overall, progress achieved towards the PDO is rated Satisfactory.

Improve the quality of health care services

Several indicators of quality enhancement within Slovakia's health system have been
achieved as part of the project. A quality assurance system is in place, legal criteria have
been established for the inclusion of new drugs and procedures in the essential package,
clinical guidelines have been adopted, a health information system has been developed
and adopted, and perhaps most importantly, the Health Care Surveillance Authority
(HCSA) with its strong quality oversight functions has become operational. For example,
HCSA has established an increasingly active channel for citizen complaints about care
provided, and a pathology department to inquire into cause of death where necessary.
Previously, accountability mechanisms for service providers had been very weak. These
achievements correspond with several conditions outlined in the policy matrix as well as
regularly monitored performance indicators.

While these are important steps for improving the quality of health care services in
Slovakia, they might be characterized as necessary but not sufficient conditions for



                                              15

quality improvement, since they are all inputs to quality enhancement rather than proof of
outcomes. Some proxy indicators of health system quality outcomes were also monitored,
as shown in the table below. However, the link between project reforms and these
specific outcomes is entangled with many other potentially confounding factors.

It should also be noted that in recent years, a number of new oncology drugs have been
added to the list covered by the state benefit package (owing in part to savings generated
by the introduction of a more transparent pharmaceutical procurement system), and new
advanced facilities specializing in cardiovascular diseases have been opened with the
help of the extra funds generated by SECAL budget support. Both of these developments
are strongly suggestive of improved quality, but they also capture inputs rather than
outcomes.

In reality we cannot say a lot about the impact of the project on the quality of health care
outcomes in Slovakia. As noted earlier, quality is one of the most difficult health sector
objectives to measure. Moreover, trends in health outcome indicators can take years to
emerge. Indeed the HCSA, which is itself tasked with quality oversight in the health
system, acknowledges in its 2007 annual report that the measurement of quality is still in
its infancy and conclusive results are not yet forthcoming.10 Instead, we may conclude
that SECAL played a valuable role in institutional reform that has brought the issue of
quality to the forefront of health reform in Slovakia, and helped lay the groundwork for
significant improvements in the years to come. Therefore, the rating for the achievement
of this PDO is Satisfactory.


Mitigate negative impacts on access, especially for vulnerable populations

Access and equity were prominent issues in the debates about the reforms. Perhaps the
most controversial aspect of the agenda was the introduction of co-payments, intended to
reduce the very high rates of health care utilization. This was done prior to project
approval and was not explicitly covered in the results framework, although it was an
important demand-side complement to the various supply-side measures supported by the
project to promote greater efficiency. In addition to co-payments, the transition towards

greater competition among insurers raised the possibility of risk selection. Thus,
attention to the issues of access and equity was appropriate.

The design of the reform strategy did take these issues into account. The co-payments
were not large (generally SKK 20 or US$0.60 per visit and per prescription), and means-
tested exemptions were put in place to protect the poor, covering about 7% of the
population. A minimum network of providers with whom insurers were required to
contract was intended to help protect access. Also, substantial equalization payments
across insurers according to the age and gender profile of their policy-holders were aimed
at deterring risk selection. While the presence of these design features does suggest that
efforts were made up front to "mitigate" access and equity problems (as worded in the
PDO), a more demanding interpretation of the objective would require some empirical
analysis to determine what actually happened from an equity perspective.

Unfortunately, evaluating the achievement of this PDO is problematic, as there were no
related quantifiable indicators. One of the criteria for first tranche release entailed
baseline data collection to monitor health system performance including equity, but the
only follow-up was the third tranche requirement to draft a social impact assessment. By
its own admission this report has a number of shortcomings, leaving the impact on access
and equity an open question.11 In particular, it uses only aggregate data, and thus does
not provide any insights into the impact on specific socially vulnerable groups such as the
poor. It draws on administrative data to show that on average utilization fell (by about
11% for primary care and 3% for specialized care between 2002-04); this may be
desirable due to prior over-utilization, but disaggregated data would be preferable for
equity analysis. For financial accessibility the report uses only household survey data up
to the end of 2003, before the reforms took root. Despite the decline in utilization, there
is some evidence in the form of opinion polls conducted in 2004 suggesting that co-
payments did not have a strong adverse effect on decisions to seek care.12 There was also
evidence that informal payments fell. In any event, the user fees were unpopular, and
were removed soon after the election of the new government in 2006.

On the other hand there are also indications of deterioration in access and equity. There
is some evidence of risk selection by insurers despite the equalization formula.13 More
concretely, a recent academic paper provides the only comprehensive analysis of equity
in health finance in Slovakia during the reform period.14 It uses household survey data to
analyze the impact of the increase in user fees for outpatient and inpatient care, and the

impact of the prescription fees and an increase in value-added tax on drug accessibility.
Several adjustments to household survey data were required to make the pre- and post-
reform eras comparable, and this may cast doubt on the validity of the findings.
Nevertheless, it finds that the regressivity of out-of-pocket payments and the proportion
of households facing catastrophic payments for health care both increased following the
2004 reforms.15 If true, this could reflect either the health reforms or broader
developments in income trends.

Lastly, another important vulnerable group is the Roma. This population is mentioned as
a priority in the 2001 Country Partnership Strategy (p.4), and their plight is noted in the
program document (p.13, paragraph 47). However, the social impact report (p.38) states
that collection of information based on ethnicity is not allowed under Slovak law, and
thus specifically monitoring health indicators of this group was a challenge beyond the
project's control.

In sum, there is very mixed and incomplete evidence on achievement of the PDO related
to access and equity. No clear conclusions can be drawn as to whether there was an
improvement or deterioration. As the program document noted (page ii), the operation
did not have direct poverty reduction interventions. The major focus was appropriately
placed on improving fiscal sustainability of the health sector, but several features of the
reform design took access and equity into account, and the inclusion of a PDO underlined
its importance. However, the lack of an M&E framework on this issue makes drawing
conclusions difficult. Therefore, the achievement of this PDO is Not Rated.

Summary on achievement of PDOs

The project was generally successful in achieving its primary objective to improve the
fiscal sustainability of Slovakia's health sector through reductions in insurance company
and hospital arrears. However, results for 2007 suggest a renewed upward trend and
certain reforms are being reversed, which are both cause for concern. The project also
helped establish the foundations for improvements in health care quality in the future.
Lastly, there is weak and mixed evidence on its success with regard to mitigating impacts
on access and equity. It should be noted that there are likely to be trade-offs between
objectives of efficiency, quality, and equity, although these were not acknowledged in the
PDO statement or project documentation. Given the nature of comprehensive health
reform anywhere in the world, it may take many more years to reach a clear verdict on
how the reforms affected these objectives. At present, however, there is a broad
consensus among stakeholders in Slovakia that the ambitious health reforms supported by
SECAL have yielded mixed results.




15Specifically, the paper finds that the Kakwani index (measuring the regressivity of out-of-pocket payments) rose
from -0.19 to -0.25 (on a scale of -2 to 1) between 2003 and 2004. The share of households spending more than 10%
of their budgets on health care rose from 1% to 4.5% in the same period.

To the extent that the PDOs were achieved during the project's lifespan, to what extent
can this be attributed to the project itself? Identifying a counterfactual scenario is
difficult in general, and even more so in the context of policy-based lending. Reforms
were rolled out nationwide. As noted, ownership over the reforms was very strong at the
outset and they had already been initiated prior to project approval, and as such they are
likely to have gone forward in some form in the absence of Bank involvement. However,
Bank expertise helped shape the reform architecture and the accompanying technical
assistance loan provided valuable technical input. Perhaps most importantly, as noted
earlier, the presence of the Bank as a "third party" played a crucial role in forging a
consensus between the Ministries of Finance and Health to strike a deal whereby
additional financing was provided in exchange for far-reaching reforms to improve fiscal
sustainability of the health sector. Finally, the causality between the transformation of
insurers and some hospitals into joint-stock companies and decreased indebtedness is
strongly suggested by the fact that arrears fell to almost zero among those institutions that
were transformed, while they remained high for those that were not.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The overall outcome rating for the SECAL project is moderately satisfactory. This is
based on a judgment that there are moderate shortcomings in the project's relevance at
the time of the ICR and minor shortcomings in its achievement of objectives. (Project
efficiency is not evaluated in a development policy operation).

With respect to relevance, the objectives to balance fiscal sustainability with quality and
access/equity have withstood the change in government in Slovakia as shown by their
endorsement by the incoming coalition in its manifesto of August 2006, and they are an
enduring characteristic of virtually all OECD health systems. The shortcoming in
relevance pertains to the design of project-supported reforms, as a number of the key
elements have been systematically dismantled in 2007 in accordance with the new
government's alternative view of the appropriate public/private mix in the finance and
provision of health care. Other key design elements (e.g., the establishment of HCSA
and other quality measures) remain in tact.

With respect to the achievement of objectives, there have been gains in the fiscal
sustainability of the health sector during project effectiveness, and important strides have
been made in terms of establishing an institutional foundation for improvements in the
quality of care. It is difficult and arguably too early to say whether quality outcomes
have improved. However, some shortcomings are also apparent, as the gains in sectoral
debt levels have begun to erode and face an uncertain future as efficiency incentives
weaken and hospital over-capacity lingers. In addition, there is an absence of robust
evidence (either positive or negative) on the project's third objective regarding the impact
of reforms on access for vulnerable populations.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
As noted in the program document and consistent with the operational policy effective at
approval (OD 8.60), the project did not contain any direct poverty reduction interventions.
The third PDO aimed to mitigate any negative impact on access and equity, but there is
insufficient evidence to draw conclusions, as discussed above in Section 3.2.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

While the institutional reforms aimed at promoting long-term fiscal sustainability (e.g.,
transformation of insurance companies and hospitals into joint-stock companies) are
currently being revised, the creation of the HCSA as a regulator with a significant quality
oversight mandate is likely to remain more durable and represent an important advance in
the institutional landscape of Slovakia's health system.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

A significant byproduct of the SECAL-supported reforms is the quantum leap in the level
of awareness of systemic health reform issues in advanced economies among key policy-
makers and stakeholders in Slovakia. Although difficult to quantify or establish
attribution for this "intangible" factor, it is nonetheless evident to longtime observers.
Regardless of the future course of reform, the quality of dialogue has improved
dramatically in a short period of time. In addition, the Slovak health reform experience
has generated considerable interest within the EU, and has thus offered valuable lessons
that are applicable elsewhere in the region.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
    Rating: Significant

The risk to development outcomes achieved through the SECAL operation is rated as
significant. This is based in large part on the status of the PDO related to fiscal
sustainability. As noted, key market-oriented reform measures designed to stabilize the
finances of the health sector have been fundamentally altered during the past 12 months,
as follows:

· The profit motive of health insurance companies has been severely curtailed by the
    passage of legislation in late 2007 that prohibits insurers from paying out dividends,
    and instead obliging them to re-invest all profits in the sector. Private insurers (some




                                                20

     foreign-owned) have demanded compensation and the case is expected to be heard
     before an international court of arbitration.
· A plan to merge the two state-owned insurance companies was postponed in mid-
     2007 until after Euro adoption, but the government has stated its goal to have a single
     health insurance company.
· An amendment was passed by Cabinet in September 2007 to halt the transformation
     of hospitals into joint stock companies.
· The minimum provider network (with which all insurance companies must contract)
     as defined in October 2007 includes only state-owned institutions, and thus represents
     a potential disadvantage to private facilities.
· Co-payments intended as a demand-side tool to rein in high utilization rates were
     abolished in mid-2006.

These events represent a risk that the increase in health sector arrears in 2007 after
several years of decline will become a trend, particularly at those MoH-operated hospitals
in the main cities that were not transformed into joint-stock companies. While the fiscal
discipline required by the planned adoption of the Euro in 2009 may help decrease this
risk, the absence of a mechanism to do so from within the sector is a source of concern.

With regard to the second PDO, the project established a strong institutional foundation
for improved quality in the Slovak health system, and this is likely to be a more
sustainable achievement since there has been much broader consensus in this arena.
However, some of the measures noted above also pose risks to quality improvement,
especially if debt problems squeeze financing for investment, if closures of out-dated
hospitals do not materialize, or if providers do not face incentives to attract patients by
offering high-quality care.

As noted, there is incomplete information on the project's achievement of the third PDO
related to access and equity, making it difficult to prognosticate on the sustainability of
those outcomes. In principle, a decreased focus on the efficiency of health care provision
could have a positive impact on equity, but this is very uncertain.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
    Rating: Satisfactory

Bank performance is assessed through an evaluation along two dimensions, quality at
entry and supervision.

Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated Satisfactory. The project was
particularly strong with respect to the quality of background analysis and the coherence



                                               21

of the reform strategy, as well as ensuring the existence of strong government ownership
at both the Ministries of Health and Finance. Both of these strengths are key ingredients
for successful policy-based lending. There were also shortcomings. The tranche design
suggested an apparent under-appreciation of the implementation challenges and political
risks associated with comprehensive health sector reform that was scheduled to trespass
onto the electoral calendar. The seeds of a difficult choice regarding the 3rd tranche
release were basically sown by the original decision to opt for a non-programmatic,
multi-tranche DPL design. However, the Bank-wide shift toward programmatic
approaches was not as clear in 2003 as it is today. A second issue was the lack of an
M&E framework or indicators for the third PDO related to access and equity, as this
theme became the central issue in political debates about the reforms. There was
reportedly reluctance from the Borrower at the time to strengthen this component. Its
absence from the original framework makes it difficult to draw any clear conclusion
about achievement of this PDO.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)
    Rating: Satisfactory

Bank performance in ensuring quality of supervision is rated Satisfactory. The project
did a good job of supervising certain key project components (e.g., debt data, macro
situation). There were multiple supervision missions, including several by management,
throughout project life. The key supervision challenge related to the release of the third
tranche after the election of a new government (arguably with a mandate to take health
reform in a new direction). An independent observer (a former senior official retired
from the World Bank) was sent to evaluate the situation. As noted, the absence of a
programmatic framework made this decision even more difficult. The election result
entailed a significant erosion of the key ingredients for successful policy-based lending
that were present at the time of original project approval: strong background analysis
(since the proposed new policy directions had not been fully elaborated or evaluated) and
strong ownership (since the applicability of the criteria noted in Section 2.2 had been
significantly diminished). Although initially it was noted that the incoming coalition's
proposals "will potentially have serious fiscal implications" and "will reverse the far-
reaching sectoral reforms introduced by the previous government", this note of caution
was later eclipsed by a view that "some of the policy changes supported by this program
have become irreversible and/or are anchored in prevailing law, which guarantees the
long-term sustainability of the results achieved". With the benefit of hindsight this
confidence was premature, as key legislation has been amended and the sustainability of
certain results remains very much in doubt.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

Based on the ratings for quality at entry and quality of supervision, overall Bank
performance is rated Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
    Rating:

Following ICR guidelines (p.38), only an overall rating is provided here (see below) due
to the difficulty in distinguishing between government and implementing agency roles in
this development policy lending operation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
    Rating:

Following ICR guidelines (p.38), only an overall rating is provided here (see below) due
to the difficulty in distinguishing between government and implementing agency roles in
this development policy lending operation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The Borrower deserves equal
credit with the Bank for the strength of the background analysis and the coherence of the
reforms noted above. There was also strong ownership at the outset. However, the lack
of a rigorous M&E framework to track the impact of reforms on access and equity was a
notable shortcoming on the part of the government responsible for project design. It also
fell short with regard to stakeholder consultations and consensus-building in the context
of difficult decisions in 2004-05 (e.g., related to hospital re-organization). As noted
earlier, the outgoing former Minister of Health regretted a lack of further progress on
hospital transformation. While project ownership has weakened under the new
government and several measures have been repealed, it was arguably given a mandate
by the population to set a new course for health system reform.


6. Lessons Learned
(both operation-specific and of wide general application)

Several lessons emerge from the SECAL project in Slovakia which are relevant to future
World Bank operations.

· Strong monitoring and evaluation frameworks should be adopted for all PDOs. This
    was not the case for the access/equity PDO in the SECAL project, a significant
    oversight given the institutional mandate. This leaves a void in evaluating the impact
    of the reforms on this issue. In addition, health projects that aim to improve quality
    of care should be modest about what can be measured (e.g., inputs vs. outputs vs.
    outcomes).

· While the focus tends to be on the analytics and design of systemic health reform, due
    attention should also be given to the management of reform and in particular to
    consensus-building. Health reform can be very political, especially when a "shock


                                              23

    therapy" approach is taken to a system that has been in place for many years. The
    reform agenda supported by SECAL encountered several challenges (e.g., hospital re-
    organization) because the difficulties of implementing a good blueprint in the face of
    opposition were under-appreciated.

· Multi-tranche, multi-year policy-based development policy lending is fraught with
    risk in an environment of political uncertainty and implementation challenges. In
    these circumstances, a programmatic series of single-tranche operations should be
    given serious consideration as a means to enhance flexibility.

· Policy-based lending in the health sector is an important (and arguably under-utilized)
    Bank instrument for promoting development objectives in the common case where
    the political capital to undertake difficult reforms, and not a lack of financial
    resources per se, is the key binding constraint to strengthening sectoral outcomes.

· Ministry of Finance engagement is a critical ingredient to successful health sector
    reform.

· The project offers a potential case study for the evolving MIC agenda. Despite its
    shortcomings, it suggests that the Bank does have the potential to be a valuable
    partner in the fiscal stabilization of, and systemic reforms to, the health sector of a
    middle-income country. Although less costly financing was available in private
    markets, the Client saw value in engaging the Bank in order to access its technical
    expertise in helping to shape reforms and its third-party role in supporting domestic
    consensus between the MoF and MoH.

· Solid analytical work related to a far-reaching policy-based lending operation should
    be better documented and disseminated for learning purposes. Neither the 2002
    Social Sector Expenditure Review nor the 2006 retrospective study ("Slovak
    Republic: Reforming the Health Sector for Greater Fiscal Sustainability") appear to
    be readily available to interested audiences (e.g., through ImageBank or the internet).


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

The Borrower report (see Annex 4) identifies several important issues discussed in this
ICR. These include (i) the positive strides made with respect to strengthening the quality
framework in the health sector during the project; (ii) the lack of emphasis placed on
equity issues in the SECAL operation, particularly with respect to M&E; and (iii) the
common goals of the new government with respect to maintaining fiscal sustainability
while improving quality and protecting access and equity.

 Slovak Republic: Health Sector Modernization Support Sectoral Adjustment Loan
                    Implementation Completion and Results Report

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This loan supported comprehensive health sector reforms
that promote fiscal sustainability while continuing to provide quality health care services
and financial protection for the population. One of the overall goals of the project was to
improve fiscal discipline through structural changes in the health sector that would ease
its chronic problem of debts. The project also encouraged greater technical and
distribution efficiency and created a system that would promote fiscal sustainability,
improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of the health sector; and mitigate any possible
negative impacts on health care access, especially for vulnerable populations.

Health Care Sector Country Assistance Strategy Goals:

    A. TRANSFORMATION REFORMS to restore and sustain high growth and
        stability
    B. GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONS STRENGTHENING to promote, inter
        alia, convergence with EU Acquis Communitaries and European practice
    C. SOCIAL SECURITY improvement, HUMAN DEVELOPMENT enhancement,
        ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS alignment

AD A) The goal was achieved exhaustively on macro level; new legal framework was
established, serving the sector towards accelerated growth and sustainable stability of
selected sub sectors. However, the negative impact of limited skills, capabilities and
capacities to implement the reform agenda downstream in more effective vs. efficient
way was observed ("doing the things right" vs. "doing the right things").

AD B) With respect to the context of Slovakian accession into EU Community, the
reform agenda has created / empowered the governance principles and institution /
capacity development and building accordingly.

AD C) Last, unfortunately, with respect to the Goals listed above, the least effort and
progress was achieved in improving social security system and its ability to serve /
support the health care related services. Moreover, challenging the goal with respect to
marginalized, more vulnerable populations, we have observed significant gaps; which
could affect overall perception of the reform effort and create unexpected and
unproductive social tensions. In addition to that human development (especially health
management and health economy experts and professionals) was not challenged at all.
The break-even towards positive perception in assessing the goal outcomes comes with
the environmental standards alignment.

Area and Objective specifically:

Systemic reform of HC financing



                                            30

   -  new, progressive legislative framework was established accordingly (the Health
      Insurance Act, the Health Care Surveillance Authority Act, The Treatment Act,
      etc.)
   -  provider payment mechanism (hospital financing) and key hospitals in selected,
      the most critical disease segments in terms of cost burden and health status
      indicators (cardiology, oncology) has been improved; network of "centers of
      excellence" was established for oncology as well as cardiology, in terms of
      institutionalization and capacity building (human and technical)
   -  new treatment procedures and pharmaceuticals availability and access has been
      institutionalized and transparent inclusion criteria, based on evidence-based
      outcomes and pharmacoeconomic / health needs assessment studies, were
      introduced into the essential package of health services (new formularies and
      procedures for purchasing, pricing and reimbursement, utilizing the most
      advanced, transparent tools and techniques)
   -  needs of the health management information systems have been monitored and
      evaluated, legal framework for IT standards in terms of communication cross-
      sector was established, capacity and infrastructure building set-up (HCSA/UDZS,
      NCHI/NCZI)
   -  majority of hospitals were transformed into commercial and/or non-profit legal
      entities and systemic tool for debts "clean-up" was exercised (Veritel, a.s.) in
      order to persuade them towards at least "break-even" economic entities

Clinical and patient-perceived quality of HC
   -  CME and licensing procedures were adjusted towards EU/international standards,
      respecting quality as key driver for better clinical outcomes; compulsory
      implementation scheme for TQM (total quality management, e.g. ISO, etc.) was
      implemented (legal framework)
   -  Professional chambers and HCSA were included into the process of quality
      outcomes assessment, monitoring and evaluation

Health delivery reform
   -  restructuring plan framework for major hospitals was developed, pilot
      restructuring and optimization outcomes (e.g. region Trencin, working group
      paper for Faculty Hospital Bratislava), based on "national hospital network
      assessment" was developed
   -  more then 75% of regional hospitals have been transformed and operate as
      autonomous entities with self-governing boards

Implement reforms in the financing of social care
   -  one of the areas, where further evaluation is needed, lack of MRP (mutually
      recognized procedures) between health care and social care sectors, lack of
      capacities in terms of legal as well as "mental" framework
   -  KPI (key performance indicators) for implementation, M&E (monitoring &
      evaluation)is still missing

Strengthening stewardship function


                                            31

   -   public information campaign roll-out was managed accordingly, excellent impact
       on public awareness was achieved


SWOT Analysis of objectives achieved ­ the most critical issues

S: Strengths
   -   excellent support in terms of politics, leadership and technical assistance
       (knowledge transfer, expert opinion utilization, etc.)
   -   in line with overall national reform strategy framework (the Government
       Manifesto, macro ­ legal framework, tax reform, social system reform, etc.)
   -   health needs assessment concept introduced, exercised and challenged, speed-up
       of access to new health care products (NCE ­ new chemical entities, drugs and
       medical devices) and services (one-day surgery, home care agencies, occupational
       health care, etc.) has been observed
   -   higher responsibility / contribution on patient / public level (co-payment)
   -   introduction of fiscal policies towards responsible allocation of resources
   -   the most critical segments have been "rationalized" and optimized in terms of
       capacity building, transformation towards better outcomes and provider payment
       mechanisms (cardiology institutes, oncology institutes, mobile emergency
       services, health insurance surveillance, health insurance public funds
       redistribution formula)

W: Weaknesses
   -   lack of compliance on micro level (on the level of health care providers, health
       care professionals, payers ­ health insurance companies as well as patients and
       surrounding environment of each affected individual stakeholder)
   -   lack of monitoring and evaluation of feedback and impact on marginalized, most
       vulnerable groups of population
   -   risk of health care reform continuum, declared interruption in terms of changed
       political situation announced (elections)
   -   lack of sufficient capacities in terms of human capital for execution and
       implementation of all relevant outcomes, especially professional health care
       facilities management, health economists, pharmacoeconomist, occupational
       health services experts, etc.
   -   mixed transformation models ("experimentally designed and executed") of health
       care providers (non-profit, join stock companies, state controlled / subsidized
       institutions) with extreme variability and vulnerability of outcomes in terms of
       economics, quality, patient awareness and satisfaction
   -   extreme "market driven" environment, ignoring cultural and historically inherited
       context, in which health care providers and professionals operate
   -   uncontrolled "privatization" / spin-offs of selected, well-financed and already
       consolidated health care services (e.g. MRIs, CTs, laboratories, dialysis centers),
       draining the operational cash out of the institutionalized health care providers
       (hospitals, specialized institutes)



                                            32

O: Opportunities
    -   complementary health care services (fee-for service, complementary health
        insurance vs. basic package definition, etc.)
    -   human resources development (knowledge and "know-how" sharing, operational
        ­ project execution management)
    -   capacity building on the level of regulator institutions (Ministry of Health, Health
        Care Surveillance Authority, National Center for Health care Informatics)

T: Threats
    -   "guinea pig" culture during the roll-out of the reforming processes, "learning by
        doing" methodology (lack of benchmarking)
    -   "cash-based" and free market principles introduced, ignoring social impact and
        professional as well public awareness and willingness to anticipate the change
        accordingly
    -   too many short-term goals, lack of mid-term / long-term strategic goals
        formulation


The new Government of Slovakia established in July 2006 continues to lay emphasis on
fiscal sustainability of the health care system, but is committed to do so in a manner that
is equitable and ensures access to all segments of the population. The Ministry of Health
believes that medical care is not really a market in the classical sense in which
economists define markets, even though there are buyers and sellers and goods and
services are exchanged for money, and should not be treated purely as a market. The
Ministry believes that health care markets are characterized by uncertainty, with patients
having much less technical knowledge about medicine relative to the providers who
possess asymmetrically more information about the need for and consequences of
medical treatment. Further, freedom of entry of new providers into the health care
markets is restricted because of the high initial costs and by the system of licensing. Price
competition tends to be minimal, and in the near-absence of price sensitivity, the market
is unable to allocate in an efficient and effective manner. The Ministry believes that the
discipline of the market and the choices and instincts of informed buyers cannot be relied
upon to protect the interests of the patients, which is perhaps best done by non-market
mechanisms.

The Ministry further believes that medical entrepreneurialism is not desirable in the
health sector, and that the proliferation of profit-driven activities in the health sector,
including for-profit insurance, would encourage behavior in response to financial
incentives rather than to service ethics as providers start jostling in the limited economic
space for greater market shares and larger incomes. Besides, it would also compromise
the values of medical professionalism and social service governing the production and
delivery of health services. In such a situation, both the quality of medical care would
suffer and health costs would increase as the economic agents in the health care market
stimulate greater production and work for larger profits. This would defeat the central
purpose of the systemic reforms of ensuring fiscal sustainability in the health sector while
providing quality health services to all citizens of the country.



                                              33

In addition to the above, the Ministry would like to invest significantly in the
restructuring and modernization of optimized outpatient and inpatient healthcare
networks. This would entail elimination of old capacities and construction of new ones,
reconstruction and modernization of healthcare infrastructure of operational units and
hospital buildings and securing of the newest technical, healthcare, diagnostic, surgical,
technological and instrumental equipment, (including the corresponding software and
hardware). Investments are also needed for the reconstruction and modernization of
buildings connected with the assurance of diagnostic and instrumental equipment needed
for the improvement of health condition of marginalized Roma communities. The
investment works and deliveries include also providing of professional trainings for
employees.

Health Care Reform Agenda Continuum

Reforming the health sector is a priority for this government, and the manifesto approved
in August 2006 enunciates these objectives of the health reform and outlines a course of
action for achieving those objectives. Modernizing the provider network and improving
conditions for health care delivery, and assuring equity in health care provision and
access to health facilities are listed as the primary goals of the reform. The Manifesto
supports the development of supplemental optional health insurance and recognizes the
role of private provision of health services.


                          THE NEW GOVERNMENT MANIFESTO (2006)
 The priorities of the new Slovak government in the health care sector are defined in the Government's
 Manifesto approved by in August 2006. It focuses on the following main areas:

         Supporting of providers network restructuring concerning to pushing as much health services
         as possible to outpatient care (preferable to one-day surgery) aimed to health care providers
         specialization;
         Assuring equity in health care provision and access to health care facilities for all;
         Due to contradiction between citizens expectations and remaining lack of financial resources in
         health care sector the government is keeping economic and social sustainable level of financial
         co-payments in selected types of health services;
         Supporting of optional health care insurance (including tax advantage) ;
         Assuring of legal environment in which every HIC will exist in the same conditions, regardless
         to judicial form (public or commercial)
         Accepting of all legal forms of health care providers (public and private) and establishing of
         environment for more ways of their financing;
         Strengthening the role of GPs ("first contact" providers) as the gatekeepers;
         Creating incentives for purchasers (health insurance companies) to become more efficient (e.g.
         to set prices, implement selective contracting with health providers and implement changes in
         the provider payment systems);
         Introducing of new more objective provider payment mechanisms;
         Orientation of health system in Slovakia to prevention and early diagnostic of diseases and
         supporting the prevention programs.


The central objectives of the reform are to ensure fiscal sustainability of the health system
but in a manner that is equitable and ensures access to all segments of the population.



                                                   34
