were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the performance of the project\n            would have been highly satisfactory if lending targets had\n            been removed. The desire to increase the project\u2019s\n            development impact impeded swift project implementation,\n            because of the disconnection between eligibility criteria\n            and disbursement targets in underserved regions. An\n            on-lending design increases the project\u2019s overall impact.\n            First, a wider range of financial intermediaries increases\n            the number and diversity of potential project beneficiaries\n            and may ultimately lead to funding of underserved firms.\n            Second, the on-lending design enables new financial\n            intermediaries to gain experience in working with\n            international organizations, which will help them develop\n            other sources of funding. Third, on-lending encourages\n            healthy competition and causes less market distortion than\n            direct lending, as the benefits are spread over a large\n            share of the financial sector. Development banks are unable\n            to reach out to smaller beneficiaries due to their business\n            model and are most effective in an on-lending model. In the\n            SME II project, a leasing company was introduced for the\n            first time through Kalkinma Bank\u2019s credit line, which led to\n            a higher share of investment financing compared to working\n            capital financing. Kalkinma Bank was also able to accelerate\n            project implementation with the inclusion on a new PFI.\n            However, given the intermediation costs, interest rates were\n            slightly higher than that of other borrowers. On the other\n            hand, direct lending will provide distinct advantages in\n            crisis times (quick disbursement and counter-cyclical\n            funding) and when lending in niche markets with targeted\n            operations (where the private sector is absent or not able\n            to fulfill the demand)."}, "docdt": "2015-08-05T09:13:03Z"}
