Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 By March 30, 2015 loan is fully disbursed (US $ 500 million). Kalkinma Bank (TKB) has fully disbursed its US$ 100 million portion in 2012 and TKB
  Loan Agreement was closed in January 2015 after the end of the grace period. Ziraat Bank and Vakif Bank have fully disbursed their portions (US $
 200 million each) in March 2015.
 The project has been implemented satisfactorily in terms of development impact and the fiduciary and safeguards perspectives. All the PDO target
 indicators are met based on available data at the closing date. All the borrowers succeeded in exceeding the regional disbursement ratios. TKB, Vakif
 Bank and Ziraat Bank has extended 26.2, 20.5 and 16.5 percent of their loan portfolios respectively in the underserved regions against their respective
 requirements of 25, 15 and 15 percent. In addition, project has provided medium to long-term finance to the beneficiary SMEs. Weighted average
 maturity is 55 months which is significantly above at least 24 months maturity requirement set in the project. Banks extended loans up to 10 years.
 Medium to long term maturities is considerably scarce in Turkish financial sector - especially for SMEs. Around 35 percent of all loans has less than 1
 year total maturity. 55 months is significantly higher than average loan maturities in Turkish banking sector. Furthermore banks provided both fixed rate
 and TL, Euro and USD denominated loans in line with SMEs need. Banks managed the interest rate and exchange rate risks in their balance sheets
 and benefited from swap arrangements (interest rate and currency) provided by the World Bank . Around 27 percent of the loan is extended in Turkish
 Lira. According to end 2014 progress reports from the borrowers, project has created an estimated 7126 jobs while preserving around 5000 estimated
 jobs. Similarly sales data of all firms has increased in total.
 Implementation pace has increased significantly in the recent months after the restructuring in late 2014. 722 SMEs have been financed under the
 project, with most companies coming from the manufacturing sector. Maturities vary from 24 to 120 months, with an average of 50 months. Sub-
 loans have been extended both in foreign currency and Turkish Lira (27 percent TL, 18 percent Euro and 55 percent US$). The proceeds for a large
 proportion of the sub-loans (around 68 percent) are being used for working capital purposes. Disbursements to underserved areas have reached to 20
 percent as compared to the project requirement of 17 percent (25 percent for TKB, and 15 percent for Ziraat and Vakif Bank each). All the banks
 exceeded their respective regional disbursement targets.
 The project exceeded expectations as measured by the PDO indicator on; (i) number of SMEs financed under the project (722 actual vesus 200 target),
 (ii) increased or preservation of employment and sales in the beneficiary SMEs, (iii) share of finance provided to underserved regions (20 percent), (iv)
 quality of portfolio (0.53 % NPL) and (v) number of financial institutions participating in the project (6).

 A loan restructuring was completed in September 2014 to improve the slow implementation progress, and to give additional time for successful
 completion of the project. A level 2 loan restructuring was agreed with the borrowers, Ziraat Bank (Loan No 7030-TU) and Vakif Bank (Loan No 7040-
 TU) to address the slow disbursements mainly due to the issues in disbursing to the underserved regions. By the restructuring following
 modifications were made to the Loan No 7030-TU and Loan No 7040-TU:
 (i) Extension of the closing date of both loans by six months from September 30, 2014 to March 31, 2015;
 (ii) Revision of legal covenants related to the disbursement requirement in priority regions, reducing it from 25 percent of total disbursements to 15
 percent;
 (iii) Cancelation of legal covenants regarding financial requirements for priority regions (debt to equity (D/E) and the debt service coverage ratio
 (DSCR)), relying instead on the banks’ own financial evaluation and scoring systems.
 (iv) Revision of the target value of the project development objective level indicator “Share of finance provided to priority regions” in accordance with
 point (ii) above; and
 (v) Modification of the disbursement estimates due to extension of the closing date.

         Comments
         Share of finance provided to underserved regions was 25 percent for all borrowers originally. A project restructuring in 2014 reduced it to 15
         percent for Ziraat Bank and Vakif Bank. TKB has already disbursed around 26 percent of its portfolio in underserved regions and met the
         target in 2012, therefore no changes made for TKB during the restructuring. On average underserved region disbursement requirement was
         reduced to 17 percent after the restructuring.
