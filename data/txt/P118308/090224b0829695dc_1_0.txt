Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Implementation pace has started to recover slowly by Ziraat Bank’s disbursements in normal regions. Overall disbursements have reached
 82.2 percent of the total Loan compared to 76.7 in June 2013 and 78.4 in June 2014. A total of US$ 89.1 million remains undisbursed to final
 beneficiaries , of which US$55.7 million remains with Ziraat Bank and US$33.4 million with Vakif Bank. Kalkinma Bank has fully disbursed its US$ 100
 million portion and Kalkinma Bank Loan Agreement was closed on September 30, 2014. 554 SMEs have been financed under the project, with most
 companies coming from the manufacturing sector. Maturities vary from 24 to 120 months, with an average of 51 months. Sub-loans are being extended
 both in foreign currency and Turkish Lira. The proceeds for a large proportion of the sub-loans (68 percent) are being used for working capital purposes.
 Disbursements to underserved areas are still relatively low, with about 10.8 percent of total sub-loans going to those areas (compared to a project
 requirement of 15 percent)

 A loan restructuring is completed to improve the implementation progress, and to give additional time for successful completion of the project. A level 2
 loan restructuring was agreed with the borrowers, Ziraat Bank (Loan No 7030-TU) and Vakif Bank (Loan No 7040-TU ) to address the slow
 disbursements mainly due to the issues in disbursing to the priority regions. Loan amendments was prepared based on Undersecretariat of Treasury’s
 Letter dated September 1st, 2014 which was requesting certain amendments to the loan agreements. By the restructuring following modifications are
 made to the Loan No 7030-TU and Loan No 7040-TU:

 (i) extension of the closing date of both loans by six months from September 30, 2014 to March 31, 2015;
 (ii) revision of legal covenants related to the disbursement requirement in priority regions, reducing it from 25 percent of total disbursements to 15
 percent;
 (iii) cancelation of legal covenants regarding financial requirements for priority regions (debt to equity (D/E) and the debt service coverage ratio
 (DSCR)), relying instead on the banks’ own financial evaluation and scoring systems.
 (iv) revision of the target value of the project development objective level indicator “Share of finance provided to priority regions” in accordance with
 point (ii) above; and
 (v) modification of the disbursement estimates due to extension of the closing date.
