project for the optimum modifications required for the\n            INDENI Petroleum Refinery, within the context of\n            Zambia's national energy conservation and inter-fuel\n            substitution program and the potential for petroleum fuels\n            export from Zambia to similarly land-locked neighboring\n            countries with no operating refineries. The study will\n            include: (a) projections of petroleum fuel requirements to\n            year 2000; (b) determination of an appropriate pricing\n            structure for refined petroleum fuels in the context of the\n            country's overall energy pricing policy; (c)\n            determination of the extent and optimum process modification\n            required by the refinery to meet the petroleum fuels\n            projections; and (d) preparation of a detailed feasibility\n            report and basic engineering on the refinery modification\n            option selected for implementation."}, "docdt": "1982-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
