INDENI REFINERY MODIFICATION ENGINEERING PROJECT
(LOAN 2151-ZA)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Indeni Refinery
Modification Engineering Project in Zambia for which Loan 2151-ZA in the
amount of US$5.1 million was arproved on June 14, 1982. After two extensions
the loan was closed on September 30, 1987, and the undisbursed amount of
US$2,584,788.72 was cancelled on April 4, 1988.
This PCR (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Part I and III) was prepared by
the Africa Technical Department, Industry and Energy Division in
collaboration with the Southern Africa Department, Africa Regional Office,
with Part II contributed by the Borrower.
This  PCR was  prepared  at  Headquarters  and  has  benefitted  from
information that was made available by the Borrower during a field mission,
aud is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan, Guarantee,
and Project Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence between Bank and
Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

INDENI REFINERY MODIFICATION ENGINEERING PROJECT
(LOAN 2151-ZA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Background
1.        The Republic of Zambia has a 25,000 barrels per day refinery
located in Ndola. The refinery (Indeni Refinery Company) is jointly owned
by the Zambia Industrial and Mining Corporation (2IMCO), a state owned
company and AGIP of Italy. The refinery has no secondary processing units
and has to process the equivalent of about a 402 by weight spiked Arabian
Light crude to meet market demand. Concerned about the increasing cost of
petroleum, the Government of Zambia (GRZ) proposed a detailed engineering
study to determine whether changes in taxation and pricing policies,
together with possib'e process modifications to the refinery could improve
the operating efficiency and result in net economic gains to the country.
2.        The project was identified in June, 1981 during a Bank sector
reconnaissance mission. Subsequently, the Government formally requested
the Bank for assistance to carry out the project. The project was
appraised in September, 1981 and negotiated in Washington in April, 1982.
Obiectives
3.        The objective of the project was to carry out a detailed techno-
economic study and prepare an optimum modificatIon plan for the INDENI
Petroleum Refinery. This was to be carried out within the context of
Zambia's national energy conservation and inter-fuel substitution program,
taking into account the potential for petroleum fuels exports. The project
was to be carried out in two phases, with Phase I covering projections of
petroleum fuel requirements to year 2000; determination of an appropriate
prcling structure ror refined petiuiewu LU'Cib lu Llhtc .uuLxc&L uf thc
country's overall energy pricing policy; and determination of the extent
and optimum process modification required by the refinery to meet the
petroleum fuel projections. After review and approval, Phase II was to
cover preparation of a detailed feasibility report and basic engineering on
the refinery modification option selected for implementation.
Implementation Experience
4.        Both Phases I and II of the study were conducted by a consulting
firm. The qualifications, experience, selection and conditions of
employment of the specialized consultants for the study were evaluated in
accordance with the Bank guidelines, and their employment was a condition
of effectiveness of the credit agreement. As noted below, in this instance
the Bank did not seek to prevent use of the same consultants in follow on
project implementation.

Results
S.        Overall, the project was successful in meeting the principal
objective of determining the most appropriate modification option to the
refinery. The Indeni refinery has an engineering design for a mild
hydrocracker, ready for implementation w.hen international price
relationships between crile and refined products change to a level where
this type of investment can be justified on a sustained basis. Even though
the design work was done in Chicago, Zambian engineers were exposed to the
project work by participating in the progress of the design work as well as
attendance at courses.
Findings and Lessons Learned
e.        The terms of reference for the study did not require the
consultants to produce a computer model or a format that could be updated
by Zambians. In its absence, the Zambian authorities are not in a position
to calculate for themselves the economics of refinery modification at
different cost and price levels, and in this sense there is no project
sustainability.
7.        The Project demonstrated that international price relationships
between crude and refined products play a significant role in the economic
attractiveness of refinery modification investments. By carrying out the
economic analysis and evaluating the study results it was determined that
major investments in the refinery would not be warranted under prevailing
price conditions.
8.        There were already signs of the deteriorating condition oi
Zambia's economy at the time Phase II was started, and this should have led
to questioning of priorities, affordability and financibility. In
retrospent we should question the wisdom of undertaking costly and detailed
studies on a possible US$20-103 million (depending on the options
considered) investment, which would upgrade a mini-refinery lacking a
significant export market. Construction of refineries of this size is
uneconomic in most situations. The same observation applies to expensive
upgrading investments. In the context of Zambia, it is to be noted that
the 1988 Energy Strategy prepared by World Bank and GRZ accepted the
economic viability of continued operation of the refinery.
9.        A further lesson is the importance of separating the conceptual
work from the engineering studies. It is normal World Bank practice to
forbid consultants conducting feasibility studies from also undertaking
subsequent design, construction, or supervision and it is not clear why
this was not done in this case. it may have been more appropriate for the
options stage to be undertaken by a separate consultant, so that there
would be less risk of vested interests in the recommendations.

Background
l 11      Zambia Is well-endowed with diverse energy resources. The
country's energy resource base consists of hydroelectricity, coal,
renewable energy resources (such as woodfuel, bagasse, and molasses for
ethanol), and uranium. Favorable geophysical indications of hydrocarbons
also exist. Woodfuel is considered to be the largest of the domestic energy
resources, supplying the cooking, heating and lighting needs of about 85
percent of the populati_n. The potential for hydroelectric energy, of which
Zambia is alrea.y a net exporter, is also substattial. Kaowa .cal rc^zcrvec,
are estimated at about 70 million tons, or the equivalent of 30 years of
supply at the current rate of consumption.
2.02      The Republic of Zambia has a 25,000 barrels per day refinery
located in Ndola. The refinery (Indeni Refinery Company) is jointly owned
by the Zambia Industrial and Mining Corporation (ZIMCO), a state owned
company and AGIP of Italy. The refinery has been designed to process light
Arabian crude spiked with naphtha, kerosene and gasoil in a 3:1 ratio by
weight. The main process units at the refinery are (i) a crude unit, (ii)
distillate hydrotreater, (iii) a product fractionator, (iv) a catalytic
reformer, and (v) an asphalt unit. The refinery has no secondary processing
units and has to process the equivalent of about a 40Z by weight spiked
Arabian Light crude to meet market demand. Consumption in the late 70's
and early 80's shifted to the middle distillates; the shift is believed to
have been influenced by varying tax rates among different products and by
the declining economy, as well as the extensive use of coal and hydro.
2.03      Zambia's commercial envargy demand depends largely on the needs
of the copper mining sector, wh'Lch has been going into decline due to



- 2 -
declining ore grades and increasing production costs. Liquid fuels are
important to both mining and non mining activities.
2.04      Zambia is not a petroleum intensive economy.  In 1981, the
petroleum import bill was estimated at US $240 million, equivalent to 17.92
of total imports and 19.42 of merchandise exports, and the cost had been
increasing fairly rapidly.
2.05      Concerned about the increasing cost of petroleum, the Government
of Zambia (GRZ) proposed a detailed engineering study to determine whether
changea in taxation and pricing policies, together with possible process
modifications to the refinery, could improve the op'rating efficiency and
result in net economic gains to the country. The st'.4y was to be carried
out withir. the framework of the Government's overall energy program.
2.06      The project was identified in June, 1981 during a Bank sector
reconnaissance mission. Subsequently, the Government formally requested
the Bank for assistance to carry out the project. The project was
apprbised in September, 1981 and negotiated in Washington in April, 1982.
Project ObJectives and Description
3.01      ProJect Objectivess  The objective of the project was to
--,.ermine the most appropriate modification to the refinery that would
nvide an optimum configuration. This configuration was to allow for
`-,^-ibility in meeting the changing market requirements in light of the
energy conservation and inter-fuel substitution efforts of the country, the
export potential and changing crude oil types likely to be easily available
to Zambia.
3.02      Project Description:  The project consisted of a detailed
techno-economic study by consultants. The study included:
Phase I:
(i)   establishing Zambia's petroleum fuel requirements to the year
2000 taking into account the availability of indigenous fuels.
The projections were to be made under two scenarios: (i) using
existing policies of taxation and pricing of petroleum
products and (ii) using assumptions which eliminate price
distortions among products;
(ii)   determining the export potential of refined petroleum fuels to
neighboring countries;
(iii)   determining an appropriate pricing structure for refined
petroleum products and a more rational taxation structure for
these products;
(iv)   identifying all relevant options for modifying the refinery
and determining the extent to which the existing refinery
facility could be modified. The determination was to include
comparative economic analysis of various options;



-3-
(v)   recommending improvements in plant operations by streamlining
the maintenance system, expanding the training program,
debottlenecking existing units, adopting better operating
practices and modernization of instrumentation to detect and
help reduce energy and material losses, and improve process
control and product quality;
(vi)   providing a comprehensive dossier on the recommended option,
including the capital and operating costs, and identifying
sources of financing and terms; and
(vii)   identify. g the optimum refinety modification based on the
foregoing analysis and reaching agreement among all parties
before proceeding;
Phase II:
(viii)   preparing basic engineering, and presenting an expeditious and
economical plan for implementation including project
management, procurement, construction and supervision, cost
control, plant start-up, etc; and
(ix)   preparing invitation-to-bid documents.
Project Concept, Design and Oraanization
4.01      .here are reasons to question the soundness of the original
project concept. The refinery is of a size appropriate for Zambia's needs
but of a size regarded as uneconomic in most situations.  Now it is built
its continued operation is generally viable provided that no major
rehabilitation is required. The Bank questions the economic merit of
upgrading this size of refinery, and in the joint 1988 Energy Strategy
(WB/GRZ) it was found that the hydrocracker would be uneconomic. The cost
of the refinery modifications was large in relation to the Zambian economy
and of questionable priority in Zambia's overall public investment program.
Moveover, there were already signs of Zambia's economic deterioration
before Part II was commenced and greater attention should have been given
to project financibility.
4.02      The range of output from a hydrocracker would more flexibly meet
Zambia's needs, and could be particularly useful should demand for middle
distillates grow. A project of this nature had already been recommended by
Snamprojetti. Zimco showed due flexibility in requiring the consultant to
look further at lower cost options and at phased options. The original
scbeme costing $103 million (apparently the most economic option at that
time) was rejected, and after review cf various alternatives the
Government, Bank, Zimco and Agip agreed to proceed to Phase is based on a
mild hydrocracker costing $21 million. Zimco regarded the m.u.ld
hydrocracker as a pows;!le intermediate stage in building a full
hydrocracker, but maintained their preference for the full hydrocracker.
4.03      The Final Report of the Phase II engineering study was presented
by the consultants in November 1985. The cost of the modification including



price escalation, contingencies and interest during construction was
estimated at US$43.5 million and annual savings on refinery feedstock cost
was estimated to be in the order of US$10 million.
4.04      At the time the consultant's report on Phase II was belng
prepared international crude and products prices changed frequently and
refinery margins narrowed and at times were eliminated. In this pricing
scenario, investment in residue upgrading facilities became uneconomic.
Hence it was decided to delay project implementation. In the meantime
Zambia would purchase commingled products that would be separated at the
refinery.
Project Implementation
5.61      Procurement and Audit: Proposals were received from fot'r of the
five consulting firms that were invited to submit proposals. The Bank
reviewed the Project Unit's evaluation report prepared by ZIHCO's
management, as well as the proposals themselves. The Project Unit complied
with the Bank's procurement guidelines and adhered completely to the
selection criteria for evaluation and recruitment of consultants. Subject
to the appropriateness of the possible longer term involvement of the
consultant in the project construction (not objected to by the Bank), the
procurement action followed Bank guidelines. The project has a clean audit
report and records indicate ZIMCO's compliance with IDA's financial
covenants.
5.02      Project Cost: The foreign cost of the preject was financed
entirely by the Bank Loan with local costs borne bv ZIMCO. The estimated
cost of Phase I was US$ 725,000 in foreign and US$ 23,000 in local costs.
5.03      The cost for Phase II, the engineering design, was more
difficult to estimate as it depended on the extent of refinery
modification. The base cost estimate assuming the maximum modification was
US$3.35 million in foreign exchange, excluding contingencies. The
estimated foreign cost of Phase I and Phase II including physical and price
contingencies was US$5.1 million.
5.04      Following negotiations with the selected consultants, the agreed
fee for Phase I was US$ 396,000 and K 20,000. A further US$15,000 was
disbursed to the consultants for expenses related to a pipeline
consultancy. Since the selected low cost option on which the engineering
design package was based was the mild hydrocracker, it was possible to
negotiate the fee for Phase II at US$ 1.65 million, well within the
estimated cost. An additional US$ 454,000 was disbursed for technical
assistance. Hence in the final analysis, the foreign cost of the project
was US$ 2,515,211.28.
5.05      Disbursement:  Disbursement information is presented in Table 3
in Part III. The original closing date was September 30, 1984, but the
loan was closed on September 30, 1987, after the closing date was extended
twice. Disbursements against commitments were made till April 4, 1988 and
an outstanding balance of US$2,584,788.72 was cancelled. Delays in project



completion resulted from the number of options eventually analyzed in Phase
I.
Project Results
6.01      From a technical point of view, the project was successful in
meeting principa. objectives of determining the most appropriate
modification option for the refinery. The Indeni refinery has an
engineering design for a mild hydrocracker and is ready for implemeitation.
The consultants made sound recommendations for improving efficiency and
reducing costs and most of these have been implemented. One Zambian was
sent for process design engineering course organized by the consultants at
the headquarters of Universal Oil Products, in Des Plaines, Illinois. A
few new capital investments originally part of the project scope had to be
deferred.
Proiect SustainatXility
7.01      The terms of ref -ence for the study did not require the
consultants to produce a     . uter model or a format that could be updated
by Zambians. Such a model is quite complex and would have added to the
cost. However, in its absence, the Zambian authorities are not in a
position to calculate for themselves the economics of refinery modification
at different costs and price levels, and in this sense there is no project
sustainability.
7.02      The bid doetiments should be valid if Indeni eventually goes
ahead with the project.
Bank Performance and Lessons Learned
8.01      The Bank monitored the study phase of the project suggesting
changes in assumptions to be studied by the consultant, in order to ensure
that all options for supply of the country's petroleum fuel requirements
were thoroughly investigated. The project was well supervised. Staff and
consultant resources were deployed as required without any delays. Bank
staff devoted sufficient time to the supervision to offset substantially
the inbuilt bias of the same consultants undertaking both stages of the
work.
8.02      The major lessons learned by this project ares (1) the
importance of clarifying the place oft the proposed investment it the
priority public investment program: (2) the need for reviewing implications
of price sensitivity before undertaking detailed studies; (3) the possible
benefit of separating chosing among options from detailed design, and in
turn separating this frem implementation; and (4) the need to address
sustainability at the outset.



-6-
Borrower Performance
9.01      All data required by the consultant in carrying out the study
was made available promptly. The Government particicated actively in the
conduct of the study and suggested other options to be considered by the
consultants.
Project Relationsnips
10.01     Relations between Borrower and Bank were close and effective
throughout. Similarly, relationships between Government and Borrower and
between Government and Bank were fully satisfactory and effective.
Consulting Services
11.01        In general, given the terms o'. reference, the quality of the
consultant's report was satisfactory. The consultant carried out a
comprehensive analysis of the options following the collection of data in
Zambia. Afte,: identifying the most economic option in Phase I, further work
was done to analyze other lower capital cost options at no extra fee.
Additional analyses were carried out under other scenarios suggested by
ZIMCO and by the World Bank.
11.02        Following the decision to proceed to Phase II, after
establishing the design basis with ZIMCO and Indeni, the consultants
provided information for review on a regular basis . Phase II also
proceeded smoothly. In view of the very specialized nature of the
assignment there wero no opportunities for local consultants to be
associated in th; project.
Project Documentation and Data
12.01        Tha loan agreement and appraisal report of the project
provided a useful framework for both the Bank and ZIMCO for review of
project implementation. Data that were relevant to the preparation of the
project completion report were readily available. The central files appear
to be complete. Supervision of the project appears to be sufficient.

INDENI REFINERY MODIFICATION ENGINEERING PROJECT
(LOAN 2151-ZA)
PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
A. Adequacy and Accuracy of .actual Information in Part III
The statistical information in Part II of the PCR is accurate and
adequate.   As changes in the international oil market at the time of
completion of Phase II of the project made installation of residue upgrading
facilities uneconomic, the full benefits of the project have not been
realized. In the longer term, the pricing scenario is bound to make project
implementation attractive and Phase II work already completed would cut short
the lead time in installation of the refinery modification facilities
identified.
B.  Comments on the Analysis Contained in Part I of the PCR
Part I of the PCR is concise but adequately covers all aspects of the
project.
C. Bank Performance
The Bank closely monitored the progress of the study phase suggesting
additional cases to be studied by the consultant, in order to ensure that all
options for supply of the country's fuel requirements were thoroughly
investigated.  Although the enaineering design for ref        moner, mdification was
concluded, changes in oil prices reduced benefits of implementation and hence
the project was shelved till price changes would improve the possible savings
in feedstock cost.
D. Borrower's Performance
The project was a high priority project in view of the increasing
burden of the high cost of petroleum imports on the country's declining
foreign exchange earnings. All data required by the consultant in carrying
out the study was made available promptly to avoid delays. The Borrower too
suggested other options to be investigated by the consultant.
E. Relationship Between the Bank and the Borrower
Close cooperation between the Bank and Borrower enabled the project to
progress witnhivt undue delays.  The relationship between the Bank and the
Borrower was good.
