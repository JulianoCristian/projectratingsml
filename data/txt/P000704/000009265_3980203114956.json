follows: Bank performance was satisfactory; and Borrower\n            performance was generally satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: while it is recognized that decentralization\n            promotes project ownership and effective management,\n            sufficient capacity building should precede the transfer of\n            project activities. Having a strong, well-staffed and\n            motivated coordination unit with authority within the\n            regional administration is essential for effective\n            monitoring and implementation of project activities.\n            Preference of providing training to top cadres instead of\n            those responsible for project implementation at the lower\n            levels does not provide the necessary know-how and stability\n            during the life of the project. Training of financial and\n            procurement management staff at all levels is critical to\n            the success and smooth operation of the project.\n            Strengthening of the rural savings and credit institutions\n            is essential for sustainability of providing credits to the\n            farmers to buy the required inputs in time, resulting in\n            increase in production and productivity. Policy reforms,\n            such as liberalizing grain marketing and removing\n            restrictions on inter-regional grain trade allowing farmers\n            to sell their surplus grain on the open market stimulated\n            farmers to produce more. Such initiatives should be\n            encouraged by the Bank."}, "docdt": "1997-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
