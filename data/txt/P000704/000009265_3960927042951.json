  and increasing agricultural output. THe primary objectives\n            are to increase the foodgrain production, productivity, and\n            incomes of the peasant sector in Ethiopia. Specifically, the\n            project comprises five main components : (i) strengthening\n            the Ministry of Agriculture's (MOA) management of\n            sectoral services; (ii) expanding and strengthening the\n            sectoral capacity to develop and test technological\n            improvements; (iii) strengthening the delivery of extension\n            services, cooperative development, and watershed management\n            services in the Northwestern Zone; (iv) improving the supply\n            and distribution of inputs, especially fertilizer; and (v)\n            supporting the continuous analysis of pricing policy and the\n            management of grain reserves. About 70 percent of the\n            project financing is dedicated to the purchase of fertilizer\n            and the rest to strengthening agricultural support services."}, "docdt": "1988-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
