"Ratings for the Health System Project\n            for Croatia were as follows: the outcome was satisfactory,\n            the sustainability was highly likely, the institutional\n            development impact was modest, and the Bank and borrower\n            performance were both satisfactory. Lessons learned from the\n            project: Extensive pilot projects can be difficult to\n            sustain politically and to receive the necessary enabling\n            environment. Disposal of expired pharmaceutical and other\n            medical products following post-conflict can be dealt with\n            efficiency, effectively and with appropriate attention to\n            safeguards. Technical assistance when it is an exchange\n            between high-level professionals is extremely valued by the\n            direct beneficiaries and the value of this exchange needs to\n            be shared with policy makers. Restructuring of health\n            services, including the necessary involvement of local\n            officials and stakeholders, takes time. When implementation\n            difficulties and delays arise, project monitoring and\n            evaluation is often neglected. A more flexible instrument\n            may have achieved similar or better outcomes in a shorter\n            period of time."}, "docdt": "2006-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
