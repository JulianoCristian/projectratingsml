The first component\n            funds health services delivery. The first of its two\n            sub-components finance primary health care by developing\n            group practice pilots for medical group practices and\n            providing medical equipment, training, and technical\n            assistance in financial management. The second sub-component\n            strengthens hospitals and secondary services by providing 1)\n            technical assistance to develop a strategy for restructuring\n            and rationalization of an acute care unit; 2) developing\n            demonstration programs for alternative levels of medical\n            care including day surgery, hospice, respite, and home and\n            ambulatory care; and 3) provides resuscitation/monitoring\n            equipment for county emergency rooms and equipment for\n            cardiac diagnostic centers. The second component provides\n            public health monitoring and program evaluation; and\n            supports national health promotion. The third component\n            funds disposal of pharmaceutical waste. The fourth component\n            strengthens systems in ways that support the first three\n            components, and that also provide essential building blocks\n            for regulatory, governance, and management initiatives.\n            Initiatives include a management information system; and\n            developing clinical protocols, facilities standards and\n            guidelines for care, as well as a department to coordinate\n            these activities."}, "docdt": "1999-07-02T00:00:00Z"}
