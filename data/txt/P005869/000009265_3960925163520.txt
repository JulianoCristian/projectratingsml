PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
HEALTH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1377-YDR)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Health Development
Project in the Republic of Yemen (formeriy the People's Democratic Republic of
Yemen) for which Credit 1377-YDR in the amount of SDR 7.0 million was approved
on May 31, 1983.  The Credit was closed on December 31, 1989, delayed by 18
months but completely disbursed.
The PCR was prepared jointly by the Population and Human Resources Division
(Country Department III) of the Europe, Middle East and North Africa Regional
Office (Preface, Evaluation summary, Part I and Part III) and the Borrower (Part
II).
This PCR was prepared during the IDA project completion mission of April-
May 1991, and is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), the
Credit Agreement, supervision reports, the draft Borrower's Completion Report,
correspondence between IDA and the Borrower, and internal IDA memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
HEALTH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1377-YDR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectives
1.    The general objective of the Health Development Project was to improve the
health status of the population Ln the southern governorates of Lahej, Abyan and
Hadramawt through the concentration of health interventions on the ten priority
disease groups identified ,ia the NaLional Health Program of the Republic of Yemen
(formerly the People's Democrati_ Republic of Yemen).  The specific objectives
of the project were: (a) to extend the coverage of basic health care services
through construction, repair, equipping and furnishing of health care facilities;
(b) to improve health services through health manpower development; (c) to
promote health education and community participation in health-related activities
through seminars, development of materials and provision of technical assistance;
and (d) to support the management of the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) through
the provision of technical assistance and the construction and equipping of the
PIU and the national and regional health directorate offices.
2.    The project included the following four components: (a) development of
basic health services; (b) manpower development; (c) promotion of community
health education and participation; and (d) strengthening of MOPH management
capacity. These components constituted the original core project estimated to
cost US$10.4 million at aplzaisal (actual cost was US$11.3 million at Credit
closing), with IDA financing of US$7.6 million (actual financing was US$8.2
million, owing to SDR-US$ tluctuation). Additional, complementary components
consisting of storage facilities and health manpower training institutes for the
three regional health directorates, appraised at US$7.0 million, were added to
the project four years into implementation, and financed from uncommitted funds
of the Credit reallocated in 1988 for that purpose, as well as from cofinancing
from the Kingdom of Norway (NORAD) and parallel financing from the Islamic
Development Bank (IDB).
Implementation Experience
3.    All of the physical targets of the project were achieved and some were
exceeded, generally within their original timeframes and appraised costs. The
extensions of the Credit closing date were the result of a Government decision
to expand the scope of the project. The following experiences are worth noting.
4.    Proiect Design and Preparation.  Because the project had been organized
into a set of core components for which financing was available, implementation
was able to proceed in those critically needed components, even as financing for
the other, complementary components was being sought. This design approach also



- iv -
had the effect of rationalizing the use of donor resources for the sector: some
agencies provided financial assistance (IDA, NORAD, IDB), while other agencies
provided technical assistance (WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, Radda Bernen and others).
Another factor which contributed to effective implementation was the thoroug'hnn3ss
of project preparation. Both the Goverument and IDA invested considerable time
in sector analysis, policy development and technical preparation. This led to
an adequate understand:Jng of the nature and extent of project interventions.
5.    Seniitivity to Cultural Concerns.  Although the evidence is more anecdotal
than empirical, implementation showed that the mobilization of female health
guides was successful in that village families more readily accepted them into
their homes to deal with personal health and hygiene than they did male health
guides. Female health personnel can, for example, get more involved in dealing
with maternal and child health and infant and child nutrition issues.
6.    Furthermore, the type It health units, which aside from being larger than
the type I units, also featured a treatment room for females separate from that
for males, proved to be an effective innovation which should have been more
broadly applied. The project had planned to build or repair more of the costlier
type II units (40) than type I units (15); however, to increase the absolute
number of health units and thereby extend accessibility of health care to more
people, the project built and repaired proportionally less type II units (35
units, or 12 percent less than targeted) and more of the cheaper type I units (21
units, or 40 percent more than targeted).
7.    Management.    That  this  initial  project  in  the  health  sector was
successfully implemented demonstrates the management capability of MOPH. The
experience gained benefitted preparation of the follow-up project currently being
implemented, and will benefit its implementation as well. Management capacity
could have been further enhanced had s8 lcient attention been given to data
collection, processing and interpretation.
Results
8.    Basic Health Services.  The 223 health facilities constructed or renovated
(56 and 167, respectively) and provided with equipment, furniture and essential
drugs under the project are currently operational, constituting 70 percent of the
318 health facilities in the primary health care system (PHC) in the three
project governorates.
9.    Manpower Development.   Local health care personnel trained under the
project (some 1,431 primary health care workers, health guides, traditional birth
attendants, practical nurses) now staff the PHC system.  There appears to be
little to moderate turnover.
10.   Health Education.  The Health Education Division established at central
MOPH in Aden, with regional branches, has produced eight documentary films,
television programs and a health periodical. Staff also conduct health seminars
at the health facilities.
11.   In the three project governorates, which are the most populous in southern
Yemen, access to basic health care services has improved significantly, and
information at local health facilities indicates increased coverage of disease
prevention programs and decreased incidence of maior diseases.



- v -
12.   MOPH Management.  The PIU is fully operational as are the central avd
regional directorates of health. The same institutions now manage the second-
phase Health Development Project covering the other three southern governorates
of Aden (Socotra Island), Al-Mahra and Shabwa (Credit 1972-YDR).
Sustainability
13.   The project, which essentially provided assistance in the improvement and
extension of an already existing health care system, is sustainable. Provided
incremental recurrent funds continue to be made available, the level of 2ccess
to health facilities and the rate of improvement of the health status of the
people--the two most evident benefits of project interventions--can be
maintained.
Findings and Lessons Learned
14.   Proiect Design.  In this project, the configuration of project components
into two types, the basic (or core) project and complementary components,
conveniently packaged the project for financing by various sources, and
sufficient preparation enabled implementation to proceed smoothly. For similar
operations, however, a word of caution must be made ia that orchestrating the
participation of many donors can be risky and could result in complicated
management and financial arrangements.
15.   Information.   The importance of empirical data,  to guide plans and
operations and to provide bases for future policymaking in the health sector,
cannot be overemphasized. With appropriate data carefully analyzed, projects
such as this with the general objective of improving the health status of the
population, should be able to gauge with greater precision and discrimination
than is possible at present to what extent a project such as this is ach4eving
its objectives.
16.   SensitivitY to Culture.  Projects which directly address themselves to the
eradication of illiteracy and disease must take into account the optimum means
by which project interventions may produce the desired result. Prior knowledge
of what the intended beneficiaries would readily embrace, or at least initially
accept, should be a feature of operations in the PHR sector.
17.   Sustainability.  Even when a project is located in permanent institutions,
such as MOPH  in the case of this project,  sustai ability hinges  on the
Government's commitment to support the new activities initiated by the project.
The provision of health staff salaries and operating funds for su'pervision
visits, medicines, health promotional materials, as well as for building and
equipment mainterance, must be assured and covenan.ad for the project to be truly
sustainable.

Sector            : Health
Subsector         : Primary Health Care
B.      Proiect Background
1.      At independence in 1967, health services in southern Yemen Nthe former
People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, PDRY) were practically limited to the
principal port city of Aden. The region as a whole was in the first stage of
epidemiological transition in which the health status of the population was
primarily affected by underlying malnutrition and by communicable, infectious,
and parasitic diseases.  Owing to the lack of basic health care, preventable
minor ailments developed complications, resulting in morbidity and mortality
greater than those of other countries in the region.  Further, infcjmation on
population and health, based for the most part on estimates, was unreliable.
2.      Sector Development Obiectives.  In accordance with the constitutional
guarantee to provide free health services, the Government in its first two
development plans for 1971-74 and 1974-78 set general health policy and allocated
resources for raising the standards of health services, expansion of health
facilities especially in remote sites, training of local-level health personnel,
measures to fight infectious diseases, and intensive care for wor-hers and
children. The Government also availed itself of assistance from multilateral and
bilateral sources for the construction of hospitals and basic health units. By
1978, the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) had prepared a national health program
and a strategy for primary health care (PHC), with a view to providing universal
health care coverage by the year 2000.
3.      Policy Context.  With support from the World Health Organization (WHO),
the Government completed preparations for the development of health policies, the
establishment of health priorities, and physical and manpower planning for the
PHC system. However, the lack of financial and human resources, especially of
appropriate managerial and administrative staff in the central MOPH and in



-  2  -
the peripheral health stations, impeded large-scale implementation. Recognizing
the above con!,traints, the Government decided to give priority to improving the
quality and effective coverage of exist4ng health facilities and services.
4.      Linkazes to Macro Policv ObjectiveF.  Within the context of a reduced
PHC focus, the Health Development Project Aas conceived as providing low-cost
health interventions at the local level, concentrated on reducing the incidence
of morbidity and mortality of 10 priority disease groups, in three of the six
southern governorates. IDA would provide financial assistance, while bilateral
and other multilatera] agencies would provide technical assistance. This first
project in the health sector of southern Yemen provided a basis for the
development of a subsequent operation in the same region (Table 1).
C.      Proiect Objectives and Components
5.      Proiect Objectives.   The general objective of the project was the
improvement of the health status of the population in the three governorates of
Lahej, Abyan, and Hadramawt by reducing the incidence of major diseases. The
specific objectives of the project were the following:
(a) Extension of the coverage of basic health care services through
construction, repair, equipping, and furnishing of health care
facilities;
(b) Improvement of health services by developing health manpower;
(c)  Promotion of health education and community participation through
seminars, development of materials, and provision of technical
assistance in health education; and
(d) Support of MOPH management through the provision of technical
assistance In health sector management and the construction and
equipping of the PIU and the national and regional health
directorate offices.
6.      Project Componeitts.  The project included the following:
(a) For basic health services: civil works (upgrading and repair of
139 existing health units, reconstruction and replacement of 39
health units, construction of 16 additional health units) and
equipment and furnLiture (for 186 health units, equipment for 15
health centers);
(b) For manpower development: organization and provision of vehicles
to four training and supervision teams, training of 480 health
guides and 120 traditional birth attendants, in-service training
of 580 medical assistants, practical nurses, and community midwives;
(c) For health education: provision of materials, audio-visual
equipment, vehicles, and technical assistance; and
(d) For MOPH management: civil works (renovation of the offices of the
Project Implementation Unit, the Health Education Directorate in
Aden, and three regional Health Directorates), equipment and



-3-
furniture (including vehicles for the PIU, the Health Directorate
and the regional Health Directorates), and technical assistance
(expert services and overseas training in areas not provided
assistance by other donor organizations).
D.      Project Design.and Organization
7.      The  project  design was  iniiovaLive  and flexible.    The  coacept of
preventive and curative health service delivery at the local (primary) level
was novel, departing from the concept of hospital-based curative care in the
principal city    The project design was flexible in that it included the
appraisal of basic components (financed with IDA assistance) and of other,
complementary but self-standing components (medical storage facilities, health
manpower training institutes) for cofinancing by other donors.   This design
flexibility enabled the Government to expand the scope of the project later.
8.      The key design concepts underlying each project component were as
follows:
(a)  Basic Health Services.   For maximum outreach and impact,  the
locations of health facilities were carefully selected on the basis
of population density (the combined population of the three
governorates of Abyan, Lahej, and Hadramawt constituted the majority
in souethbrn Yemen). The development of the existing primary health
care  system was  therefore  the main activity ratner  thaiiLL he
establishment of new facilities.
(b)  Manpower Development.  To introduce concepts of disease prevention,
in addition to curative concepts, the training of locally based
personnel was necessary.   To minimize overtaxing governmental
resources, some local, community-based mass organizations were
tapped to provide voluntary services.
(c) Health Education. Similarly, the rationale for health information
campaigns was that the community would share the responsibility for
health care.
(d)  MOPH Management.  Central MOPH would play the role of planner and
coordinating agency of the primary health care system. It would
gather and process information for timely feedback, through the
health directorates at governorate level, to the locally based
system. The PIU would undertake the tasks requiring liaison with
IDA and, later, those with other international a .d bilateral donors.
9.      The main strengths of the project design were the simplicity of the
content of each component (activities were well-defined and implementable), and
the flexibility of organization of the components (para. 7). In retrospect, the
main weakness of the project design lay in underestimation of the provision for
maintenance funds for buildings, equipment and health promotional materials
(para. 26).



4
E.      Project Implementation
10.     The project was processed generally in accordance with the project
timetable (Table 2). The project was appraised in October 1982, negotiated in
April 1983, approved by IDA's Board in May 1983, and declared effective in
October 1983.  The implementation period was about two years longer than the
originally planned four years because the project was expanded in scope during
the course of implementation.
11.     Proiect Costs and Financing.   By September 30, 1987, the originally
scheduled completion after a four-year implementation period, the project had
been 98 percent completed (Table 3). However, a strong SDR during the project
period had the effect of increasing the US$ value of the Credit, such that only
79 percent of IDA funds had been disbursed (Table 4). To utilize uncommitted
funds, the Government requested in late 1937 that the funds ie reallocated for
the implementation of an expanded project (including civil works, equipment and
furniture, mobile units for immunization, and additional training courses).
Consequently, the closing date was extended twice from the original date of June
30, 1988, to December 31, 1988, and finally to December 31, 1989.
12.     The actual cost of the project, including cofinancing contributions from
WHO and UNICEF, was US$11.3 million, or 11 percent more than the appraisal cost
of US$10.4 million (Table 5).
13.     The Government obtained additional cofinancing of US$1.0 million from
the Kingdom of Norway (NORAD) for the construction of three medical storage
facilities and the provision of corresponding equipment and furniture.   The
Government also obtained parallel financing of US$5.3 million from the Islamic
Development Bank (IDB) for the construction of three health manpower institutes,
including teachers' accommodations, and for the provision of equipment and
furniture for the new construction (Table 6).
14.     The IDA Credit vias completely disbursed and was closed on December 31,
1989 (Table 7).
15.     Basic Health Services.  The target renovation of 139 health units was
exceeded by 21 percent, as 168 health units were actually renovated; while in
the construction of new health units, the target of 55 health units was exceeded
by one (details in Annex I: Civil Works). Renovation went generally according
to schedule, while the program of new construction was completed with a moderate
delay of 15 months overall.
16.     The overall cost of civil works was 14 percent more than originally
estimated at project appraisal.  However, new buildings cost 11 percent less
(although square footages were increased 10 percent) and renovations cost only
10 percent more (although square footages were increased 37 percent). The cost
of equipment. furniture. materials, and vehicles was 79 percent higher than
anticipated, owing to underestimation at appraisal and price fluctuations in the
region during the Iran-Iraq war. For the health units, drugs and medicines were
provided as planned, but at 14 percent less than appraised cost.
17.     Manpower Development.  The training targets in this first project were
initial approximations of health manpower needs for the primary health care
system.    As  needs  were  reassessed  during  implementation,  the  actual
accomplishments varied by governorate and by type of personnel trained (Table



8). In Lahej, a total of 578 were trained, exceeding by 39 percent the target
of 414; however, not enough Primary Health Care Workers were trained (while more
Health Guides and Traditional Birth Attendants were trained, using the
Government's own funds). The accomplishment in Abyan was 24 percent over target
(456 actually trained, 366 planned); more of each type of personnel were trained
than originally planned. In Hadramawt, only about one-third the target number
of Primary Health Care Workers were trained (the shortfall in numbers of
Traditional Birth Attendants trained was rectified by similar training, using
non-project funds), and the overall accomplishment was 85 percent (397 trained,
464 planned). The training of health personnel cost 43 percent less overall,
although the nunber of staff trained exceeded the appraisal target by 15 percent.
18.     Health  Education.    The  production  of health  education materials,
including field manuals, bulletins, and those for the National Health Education
Seminar held in 1983, were completed according to schedule. The production of
the eight educational films, ho;e-ver, was delayed 15 months owing to difficulties
encountered in selecting the appropriate film-making group, in location shooting,
and in post-production.
19.     MOPH Management.  The PIU effectively played its role as liaison between
MOPH and IDA.   Central MOPH in Aden prepared annual plans and targets, and
supported the regional health directorates in project implementation. At local
levels, implementation was vigorous. The training and supervision teams made
their required visits to the health facilities; local health care personnel
dispensed services to increasing numbers of clients; and health records were in
evidence  (details in Annex II:  Epidemiological Progress).   Although data-
gathering on the ten priority diseases identified in the National Health Program
improved during project implementation, the compilation of data for possible
analysis was not always up to date, making periodic assessments for adjustment
plans or interventions difficult. (Project impact evaluation would similarly
encounter difficulty.)
20.     In  terms  of  cost,  the  Project  Preparation  Facility  (PPF)  was
overestimated, as only about 30 percent of the original allocation was actually
used. The cost of technical assistance was 86 percent lower because the proposed
45 staff-months of consulting services for strengthening MOPH management were
provided by WO4 and UNICEF from their respective country programs and were not
charged to IDA financing; corresponding funds were reallocated to other project
categories. In addition, personnel expenditures, including PTU salaries, travel
and subsistence, office supplies, and salaries for additional nurses for the new
health units, increased 50 percent, in proportion to the extended implementation
period (estimated four years; actual six years).
F.      Project Results
21.     Basic Health Services.  With existing health facilities renovated and
new ones built and provided with equipment, furniture, and essential drugs and
medicines, access to health facilities was greatly improved. Where, prior to
the project in 1983, only 160 health units or health centers served 1.4 million
people in the three project governorates (11 facilities per 100,000 people),
there were 263 facilities in 1986 (17 facilities per 100,000), and 318 in 1990
by the end of the project (19 facilities per 100,000).  The increase in the
number of health facilities represented a 54 percent improvement in access from
1983 to 1986, and a 72 percent improvement in access from 1983 to 1990.  The



change in access was most evident in populous Hadramawt, where the number of
health facilities nearly doubled (Table 9).   The total 223 facilities that
directly benefitted from project interventions (56 new construction, 167
renovations) constitutes 70 percent of the 318 health facilities in service in
the three governorates in 1990.
22.     Manpower DeveloDment.  With trained health personnel, certain primary
health care programs were maintained. Immunization coverage against the most
common diseases of childhood (DPT: diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus) increased from
about 10 percent of children at the start of the project in 1983 to about 77
percent by the time of project completion in 1990. Immunization coverage against
measles improved from 5 percent in 1983 to 54 percent in 1990 (Table 10). It
must be noted, however, that in addition to project efforts, UNICEF's vigorously
implemented Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI), also active in the project
area at about the same time, and in many cases implemented from project
facilities, contributed to the increase in coverage.
23.     Health Education.   By the end of the project,  the project-financed
instructional films as well as the demonstration materials on basic health topics
for community health education and participation were still being used by the
volunteer Health Guides and Traditional Birth Attendants.
24.     MOPH Management.   The offices of the Health Education Directorate in
Aden, those of the regional directorates in Abyan, Lahej and Hadramawt, and that
of the PIU are in full operation, using the equipment, furniture and some of the
original vehicles provided by the project.
25.     Overall, the impression obtained from visits to selected project sites
in 1991 was positive: health facilities were in operation, medicines and health
promotional materials were available, and staff trained under the project were
still in service.   All covenanted agreements were complied with (Table 11).
However, maintenance is now an issue: deterioration was already apparent in some
project facilities visited by the project completion mission, and some vehicles
used for training and supervision were out of service.
G.      Proiect Sustainability
26.     The project is highly sustainable. However, the provision of incremental
recurrent funds to support salaries, periodic staff retraining, maintenance and
repair of buildings and equipment, and materials (medicines, health promotion
materials) must continue if project gains are to be sustained.
H.      IDA Performance
27.     During project  preparation,  IDA devoted considerable  resources  to
identify and prepare the project. Over a two-year period, one reconnaissance,
one identification, two preparation, three preappraisal, and one appraisal
mission (of seven members) worked a total of 47 staff-weeks in the field.    It
was clear that both IDA's and the Government's intention was to prepare a
realistic first health project, which came to a successful conclusion. IDA was
flexible in reallocating unused funds at the midpoint of project implementation,
and in extending the closing date twice to facilitate the implementation of



-7 -
additional components. Supervision of the project was efficient and well-timed:
one mission per year, two in 1985, totalling 26 staff-weeks (Tables 12 and 13).
28.     During project implementation, IDA could be faulted for not placing
sufficient emphasis on the need for up-to-date information processing and
monitoring of health indicators, as provided for in the project. Although the
Borrower eventually availed itself of expert technical assistance from other
sources, central project management of non-hardware components, especially
information processing, could have been strengthened by technical assistance
engaged for the purpose (para. 19).
I.      Borrower Performance
29.     The PIU was well-organized.  Procurement and supervision of works were
carried out according to schedule; force account was resorted to for works
situated in areas with difficult access to conventional contractors.   MOPH
management at central, regional and local levels evidenced strong commitment to
project activities.    Information gathering improved,  but  compilation and
processing of the data in Aden received less attention than expected.
J.      Borrower-IDA Relationship
30.     The relationship between the Borrower and IDA was excellent during
project preparation and implementation.
K.      Consulting Services
31.     Consulting services provided under the IDA Credit were not utilized.
Instead, the engagement of experts was financed outside of the project by WHO
and UNICEF (details in Annex III: Technical Assistance Summary).
L.      Project Documentation and Data
32.     The project was well and clearly documented from IDA's side.  The SAR,
progress reports, and supervision reports provided essential information to gauge
project progress. On the Government's side, however, annual audit reports were
submitted late, and annual progress reports became regular only after the midterm
evaluation in 1986 (details in Annex IV: Audit and Progress Reports).

HEALTH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1377-YDR)
PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWEP.'S PERSPECTIVE
A.      Adequacy and Accuracy of Factual Information in Part !II
33.     Prior to the project completion mission, the Government conducted a
survey to investigate to what extent the project fulfilled its objectives.  A
copy of the draft report was given to the mission during their presence in
Sana'a; the final version will be sent to IDA later on.
34.     Information collected and analyzed by the Government covered all the
project components related to the project objectives. The findings showed that
this project is one of the most successful projects ever implemented in the
health sector. Its success convinced the Ministry of Planning to replicate it
and extend it to cover another three governorates with the same objectives and
components, i.e, Shabwa, Al-Mahra, and Socotra Island in Aden Governorate, under
the title "iHDP Second Phase" (Credit No. 1972).
35.    The information included in Part III of the Project Completion Report was
compatible with data and information collected and analyzed by the Government,
and it is adequate and accurate and endorsed by the Ministry of Public Health.
B.      Evaluation of IDA's Performance and Lessons Learned
36.     The IDA approach to project development is identical to that for health
services included in the Second Five-Year Health Plan (1981-1985) in the southern
part of the Republic of Yemen. The project preparation mission from the IDA side
worked jointly with nationals in the data collection, tabulation, analysis, and
presentation  processes.    This  led to a common understanding  of project
objectives, components, and outcomes expected.  Thus the project was a joint
project between the Ministry of Public Healt;a and IDA all throughout the
implementation phase, which makes it difficult to judge each part independently.
37.     However, as far as IDA is concerned, its performance with respect to the
project could be summarized as follows:
1.   The quality of the experts who developed the Project and supervised
its implementation was a great help to make the project operational
and understandable.
2.   The procedures and methodologies used in project development were
practical; they facilitated project implementation by nationals.



- 10 -
3.   Annual IDA missions analyzed problems encountered and solutions for
tackling them and reflected these in aides-memoire. This helped to
correct by consensus any deviations.
4.   The quick opening of the IDA bank account and its replenishment on
a regular basis were effective ways that ensured project
commencement and implementation.
5.   The auditing system followed by IDA was useful to all, to ensure
proper and better ways of project resources utilization and
control.
6.   Progress reports (quarterly, mid-term, and annual) were a great
help to assess project implementation according to the timetable
and indicated weaknesses which needed to be strengthened.
7.   Response  to  Project  Implementation  Unit  (PIU)  proposals  and
suggestions was effective and efficient; this in turn expedited
project implementation.
8.   Flexibility during project implementation from the IDA side, with
mutual understanding of the changes needed during implementation,
was appreciated by the Ministry of Public Health.
9.   Sometimes there was unnecessary delay in some withdrawals, which
had slightly negative consequences on project commitment.
10.  Good coordination is required between IDA departments to facilitate
quick implementation of changes agreed upon between IDA and the
Government, as reflected in the aides-memoire.
11.  Overall technical assistance provided by IDA staff was satisfactory
to the Ministry of Public Health.
12.  IDA's role as coordinator or mediator in seeking or implementing
third party cofinancing was effective; this in turn facilitated
achieving all project objectives which were impossible in the early
stages due to insufficient financial resources.
C.      Evaluation of Borrower's Own Performance and Lessons Learned
38.     There were many things which we benefited from, starting from the project
preparation process through project implementation, supervision, and evaluation.
Some of the lessons !earned are the following:
1.   Primary health care (PHC) as a concept and an approach is not
cheap.   Therefore, scarce resources should be used in ways to
maximize benefits.  The project proved this fact, alerting the
Government to think in terms of PHC for the country as one that
should be cost-beneficial, bearing in mind the possibility of
increasing the accessibility to and coverage by PHC through small
health units and personnel training.



- 11 -
2.   There is a difference between wants and demand; the latter should
be supported by money due to the fact that resources are finite
while demand is infinite. This project convinced the Government to
overcome its health problems within the context of prioritization,
trade-offs, and step-by-step implementation, using project phases
or stages.
3.   Standardization is important to ease maintenance, sustainability,
and staffing pattern. The project established this criterion with
respect to building health units based on population needs.
4.   Learning  by  doing  is  the  outcome  of  project  preparation,
supervision implementation, and evaluation. Exposure of nationals
to IDA procedures in project formation made it easy for them to
conduct the Second Health Development Project which has been
approved and now supported by IDA.
5.   Linkage between buildings, equipment, staffing, and operational
cost  is  important  to  any  health  facility.    They  should  be
considered in parallel as a package to ensure optimal utilization.
6.   The project showed that poor implementation is not due to national
ability and capacity; rather it is related to government
bureaucracy.
7.   Decentralization is only effective when local communities and local
health authorities are involved. The project proved that bottom-up
planning is best because all parties were convinced that the
project is not to work for them but to work with them.
8.   A serious problem that could jeopardize achievements at the end of
the project is lack of resources provided by the Government.
Therefore to avoid total collapse, it is crucial to work out a
gradual  IDA withdrawal  and  gradual  Government  take-over  and
replacement, with necessary budgets based on agreed-upon plans.
9.   All project components were implemented successfully due to a
combination of factors.  One of these factors was the reasonable
reward system used and secured for the implementors during the
project life span.  God knows how things will go later on.

Comments:  By the original project completion date of September 30, 1987,
the project had been 98 percent implemented, at substantial savings owing to a
favorable SDR-US$ exchange rate.  As the Government in 1986 acquired additional
funds from the Kingdom of Norway (NORAD) and from the Islamic Development Bank
(IDB) to finance an expanded project, the savings from the original IDA Credit
were reallocated in 1988 to cover the costs of additional civil works, equipment
and furniture (including mobile units for maintenance), and training courses
which were  completed  in  1989.    Implementation  of  the  expanded  project
necessitated two extensions of the Credit closing date, to December 31, 1988, and
finally to December 31, 1989.

Comments: (a) By March 1985, about 95 percent of the target 139 health
units had been renovated and provided with equipment and furniture, in accordance
with the original schedule. Unutilized Credit funds were reallocated in 1988
(Table 2), and 28 more health units were included in the project for renovation.
These were completed and provided with equipment and furniture in December 1989.
(b) An additional grant in 1986, from the Kingdom of Norway (NORAD),
provided financing for the construction of 3 medical stores, completed in
December 1987. A separate agreement, also in 1986, with the Islamic Development
Bank (IDB) provided financing for the construction of 3 regional health
institutes, completed in December 1988. The construction of teachers' housing
for the health institutes was ongoing as of May 1991.
(c) Expert services (3 staff-months in health education and 45 staff-months
in health sector management) were not utilized under the project, but were
instead provided by WHO and UNICEF from their respective country programs. Data
on actual utilization were not available from project records.

from the original US$7.6 million at the time of negotiations in April 1983 to
about US$8.2 million at Credit completion in April 1990.  Uncommitted funds were
reallocated in 1988 to finance an expanded project and were completely disbursed
by 1990.

Note: Immunization against DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus) which, in
addition to measles, are the most common diseases of childhood is administered in
two doses (DPT I and DPT II), during infancy (from birth to 18 months) and during
the toddler stage (age 2-5). The increase in coverage may also be attributable to
UNICEF's Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI), vigorously implemented during the
project period.

Comments: As the project was designed to develop the existing primary health
care system, civil works were concentrated on repair or rehabilitation.   New
construction was undertaken only in areas where the existing health care facility
was assessed as uninhabitable or where significant numbers of people had difficult
or no access to a health care facility.

Comments: The Type I health unit was a small facility (average floor area: 70
m2) where typically a health assistant dispensed curative care to about 3,000
people in nearby villages.  The Type II was larger (100 M2 average floor area) and,
when staffed with a medical assistant and a community midwife, serviced a catchment
area of about 5,000 people.

PROJECT CONPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF YXEEN
HALTH DEVELOPHENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1377-YDR)
ERidemioloaical Progress
A.    Background
1.          At  the  start  of  the  project  (during  the  period,  1980-82),
epidemiological data were fragmented and incomplete. The Ministry of Public Health
(MOPH) did not have the necessary human and financial resources at that time to
organize a comprehensive baseline survey.   Consequently, information regarding
morbidity and mortality rates were neither documented accurately nor available in
a retrievable statistical format.
2.          The health planning exercise conducted by the World Health Organization
(WHO) and MOPH in 1979 served as the basis for categorizing health problems in
Yemen.   The findings of that exercise helped determine  the weights of and
prioritize ten health problems for assistance. The project helped to follow up the
effectiveness of PHC systems in addressing the 10 top priority health problem
areas. It also provided for a progressive means of gathering epidemiological
statistical data on mortality and morbidity rates in all the governorates.
B.    SuPRortive Training and Supervision in the Primary Health Care System
3.          Communicable Diseases of Childhood. During project identification and
appraisal, it was observed that the communicable diseases of childhood such as
measles and whooping cough were the two leading causes of death among children.
During the last supervision mission to the health units and the PHC directorates
in Aden, Abyan, Lahej, and Shabwa (Ataq)', it was found that mass and community
level immunization process was progressing well as planned. There were accurate
documentation of immunization for meas'les, DPT, polio and tuberculosis (BCG).
Epidemiological data relating to morbidity and mortality rates for the population
was also being accurately documented at the district, subdistrict and village
levels.
4.          At the start of the project, information regarding the prevention of
communicable diseases was provided only in the hospitals and health centers. The
project has helped the Government to extend its preventive care coverage to the
densely populated rural areas in the three governorates Abyan, Hadramawt and Lahej.
This coverage is now available at the subdistrict and village levels through the
PHC system.  The establishment of 10 mobile units (including 2 in Abyan, 2 in
Hadramawt and 3 in Lahej) for the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) has helped
in expansion of preventive care, but there still seems to be a great need to
develop this process on an ongoing basis.
.J/ Shabwa governorate as well as Al-Mahra and Socotra Island (Aden
governorate) are covered in the second-phase Health Development Project
(Credit 1972-YDR).

5.          Malaria.   At the commencement of the project, the appraisal report
indicated that it was feasible to control and prevent a high incidence of this
disease in all the governorates. The overall epidemiological situation for malaria
was identified in 1982 to be widespread hypo-endemic areas with seasonal
transmission. This was due to existing environmental conditions. The prevalence
rate was about 31 percent and 5,000 children die each year from malaria.
6.          During the supervision and PCR missions to Abyan, Hadramawt, Lahej,
Shabwa and the PHC center in Aden Governorate, it was observed that the malaria
control program seemed to have been in progress from 1983 to 1989.  With WHO's
assistance the MOPH has carried out the epidemiological survey to establish the
different patterns of malaria transmission.
7.          As stated by the PHC Director-General of the Aden directorate, MOPH
with the help of WHO has established several measures to carry out a variety of
interventions as suggested in the appraisal report.  These include treatment of
cases, chemoprophylaxis, spraying, larviciding, utilization of biological control
methods and drainage, etc.   During the visits it was evident that many more
preventive measures were being taken to control this disease. The determination
of these visits is that this health problem could be controlled in a technical
sense when environmental hygiene, sanitation and living conditions in the highly
populated areas as well as at the village level improve considerably.
8.          Diarrheal Diseases.   In 1981-82 this health problem was the third
priority. It was the leading cause of death among children under five years of age
(responsible for 24 percent of all reported infant deaths and 17 percent of child
mortality). There was no systematic approach to this health problem at the time
the project was initiated. Awareness of oral rehydration techniques did not go
beyond major health centers.
9.          The project has helped MOPH to extend the coverage of care to infants
and children through the Primary Health Care system. It has helped to control and
prevent this health problem. The establishrient of the primary health care system,
the mobile health system, TST ataff and the development of manpower in the health
units at the peripheral level have contributed significantly towards controlling
this health problem. The project has provided direction to the PHC network and
enlarged its outreach capacity to control gradually diarrhea-related infant
mo-tality in the three governorates of Abyan, Hadramawt, and Lahej.
10.         During the visits to the PHC directorate in Aden, Abyan, and Lahej, as
well as to the health units  in those governorates,  there wa   evidence  of
progressive control ot diarrheal diseases. The documentation seen in the health
units showed the decrease in infant and child mortality due to diarrheal diseases.
Also the availability of manuals and demonstration materials used for health
education by PHCWs in the PHC directorates and health units served to indicate the
gradual progress made to control this health problem.
11.         Acute Respiratory Infections (ART). At the start of the project, this
health problem was considered fourth priority. Approximately 2,300 children died
annually of acute respiratory infections. In 1983 according to plan a new program



- 32 -
Annex II
Page 3 of 5
of interventions was developed through international research and consultation
provided under WHO sponsorship. The ARI interventions were implemented as per WHO
program throughout all six governorates and Aden.
12.         The PHC directorate showed the supervision mission the structurpd
health education programs planned by the PHCWs in the three governorates of Ada .
Hadramawt, and Lahej. These were implemented at all levels by staff whose training
and placement were funded by the project. There were documents and records which
showed a decline in the data regarding occurrence of acute respiratory infections
as well as in the mortality and morbidity rates due to this health problem.
13.         Tuberculosis.  At the beginning of the project, this health problem was
the fifth priority disease.  Its rate of occurrence was on the order of 50 per
100,000 population, roughly corresponding to 1000 deaths per year (approximately
7.7 percent morbidity rate). It was generally understood that overcrowded housing,
malnutrition and frequent early pregnancies were important contributing factors.
14.         The project has helped MOPH to accomplish its design consisting  of a
4-step strategy.   These are: (a) BCG administration to all newborn in all the
health facilities and then to all non-vaccinated school children; (b) providing
treatment at the district, subdistrict and village level free of charge; (c)
ensuring systematic case findings among all high risk persons and groups in the
community; (d) developing structured health education programs emphasizing
tuberculosis treatment and prevention by BCG and other measures. The project also
helped MOPH to establish manpower training. Many PHCWs, health guides and the PHC,
TST, and health unit staff were placed during implementation process to provide for
preventive care for this health problem.
15.         The  supervision  and  PCR  preparation  missions  found  that  BCG
vaccinations to infants and children were very effective (about 90 Psrcent) and
that preventive health care for this disease had a coverage of 73 to 90 percent in
all three governorates. There were no documents available to develop a table or
graph for this report in order to support the observation.
16.         Malnutrition and Anemia.  During the 1970s and early 1980s, these were
very  important health problems.    Often these problems  resulted  from other
communicable  diseases  and  led to more  complicated medical health problems,
emergency situatiors and death due to lack of detection and care.
17.         Although the project was not designed to have a significant impact on
this health problem. in 1986 funding for correctional action began as a result of
the increased training and development of PHCWs, TBAs, health guides, TBAs and
community midwives.   Judging by the estimated number of cases treated, health
education programs presented, and the number of attendees at these programs as well
as the progress in breast feeding there appears to be a decline in the severity of
this health problem.   This was particularly true in Abyan and Hadramawt where
records and documentation were checked to confirm the decline.
18.         Eve Diseases. At the beginning of the project, this health problem was
identified as the eighth priority health problem, with an extremely high incidence
rate of 22 percent. Trachoma represented about half of the cases. The project
identified the problem and helped the Government to involve MOPH in planning a



- 33 -
Annex II
Page 4 of 5
strategy to combat the problem. The resultant "Red Eye Strategy" helps to treat
and prevent the problem. The health facilities' manpower training took note of the
MOPH's strategy.   The preveittive and tberapeutic approach to eye diseases is
emphasized:  through  administration  of  antibiotic  ointment;  by  preventing
complicatione; and by requiring TST and mobile health units to provide coverage for
eye diseases.
19.         Hepatitis.  As identified in the various supportive studies by WHO and
UNIEF (encompassing the PHC system of all the governorates) this health problem
is attributable to poor socioeconomic conditions and environmental factors such as
poor housing, water supply and sanitation or a total lack of these factors.
20.         The documentation observed in the PHC directorates regarding the status
of this disease in the various areas of YAmen indicated the following:
Abyan:      There appears to be a decline in the percentage of incidence.
However, no accurate record is available to support this
statement.
Lahej:      There was a slight increase of incidence in 1989 as compared to
1986.
Hadramawt:  Data were inaccurate and not specific.
Aden:       There was some increAse in incidence during 1989-90 due to
return migration from the Gulf War.
21.         Perinatal Morbidity.    At  project  inception,    this  problem was
identified as the burden and suffering stemming from complications of pregnancy
and delivery.   Other contributing factors were poor maternal health before and
during the pregnancy process. Though numerous factors were involved, the project
has helped the Government of Yemen to accord high priority to prenatal, perinatal
and maternal child health care.   The project helped the Government to set up
policies and programs to improve maternal health.
22.         Perinatal Mortality (including abortion).   This refers to deaths
occurring after thr 28th week of gestation and before the 28th day of life.  This
health problem v4s identified as a high priority project. At the time of project
appraisal period an estimate of neonatal death (infant mortality) was 30 percent.
The available data permitted an assessment of the magnitude of the problem.
23.         The project has helped MOPH to include MCH/FP care in the manpower
development process. In civil works it has helped provide extra area to furnish
and equip rooms devoted to family oriented care in type II and type III2 health
units.
2/ The type III health unit, larger than the type II, was introduced under
the second-phase project (Credit 1972-YDR).

Page 5 of 5
24.         The project has aided the expansion of health  are from Aden to all the
other governorate extending from district to subdistrict to village and peripheral
levels. The health care was geared not only toward the adult population but also
maternal child health and perinatal care.  The project funde' for training and
supervision of PHCWs, TBAs, health assistants and community midwives to include
prenatal, perinatal and postnatal care through the PHC system and outreach program.
Other related socioeconomic, political, cultural, religious , topographical,
biological and public health accessibility factors seem to still influence the care
for this health problem. There was some evidence to suggest problem awareness in
the community and an improved ability of them to handle this problem. Statistical
estimates show a decline in the mortality rate.
25.         In summary, for all areas of above mentioned health problems include
training, supervision, accurate data collection regarding disease incidences,
statistical analysis and studies, maintenance of valuable epidemiological data,
periodic surveys and progress reports.
