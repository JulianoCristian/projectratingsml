By increasing the\n            number of trained community midwives and by developing\n            popular awareness of family planning issues, the project\n            also aims to help address the shortage of female\n            paramedicals and encourage development of family planning\n            services. The project includes upgrading and repairs of 139\n            health units, the construction of 55 health units along with\n            furniture and equipment for these facilities; (ii) health\n            education materials; (iii) training of medical personnel as\n            well as technical and support staff; and (iv) technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1983-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
