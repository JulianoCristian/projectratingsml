The project\n            would support expansion of Brazil's manufactured\n            exports by liberalizing imports and increasing the\n            availability of foreign exchange under the duty drawback\n            system. Eligible exporters would be given automatic access\n            to imports of raw materials, intermediate products and\n            components, to be used in the production of their exports.\n            As such, the purpose of the project is to establish a de\n            facto free trade regime for export production. Drawback\n            imports within the allocations of foreign exchange would be\n            made according to previously established criteria agreed\n            upon with the Bank and made public in the country."}, "docdt": "1983-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
