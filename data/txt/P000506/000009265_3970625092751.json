emergency phase of a program aiming to reestablish\n            Cotontchad on a sound financial basis and avoid the collapse\n            of Chad's dominant cotton sector as a result of\n            exceptionally low world prices.  This first phase consists\n            of a set of remedial measures that would permit Cotontchad\n            to continue operations pending the preparation of a\n            comprehensive rehabilitation program, to be based on an\n            indepth UNDP-financed study currently being undertaken, with\n            IDA.  The proposed program would cover two years, beginning\n            July 1, 1986, and would finance:  (i) Cotontchad's\n            inputs program; (ii) the improvement of Cotontchad's\n            management and financial control through the provision of an\n            external audit and technical assistance services, training,\n            and studies; and (iii) support for continued operations and\n            reorganization of key institutions in the cotton sector,\n            particularly extension services (ONDR) and research\n            activities (IRCT)."}, "docdt": "1986-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
