economic growth, and strengthening governance in the public\n            sector. This Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) Project\n            is designed to support the implementation of Sri\n            Lanka's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). This\n            operation, PRSC I, would be the first of a series of annual\n            PRSCs within a rolling four-year horizon, overlapping with\n            Sri Lanka's PRS period. Consistent with the Government\n            objectives and priorities, the PRSCs would support reforms\n            in two major areas: 1 ) accelerating economic growth and\n            supporting private sector development; and, (2)\n            strengthening governance in the public sector and improving\n            the welfare system. This PRSC will help the Government in\n            moving forward with the structural reforms, create\n            conditions for accelerating economic growth, and send a\n            strong signal to the private sector. Furthermore, it will\n            foster a continued fiscal consolidation, improve public\n            sector governance, and, strengthen institutional framework\n            and capacity in the management of public resources. These\n            developments would also lead to improvements in the\n            poverty-focus of public expenditures. Nevertheless, there\n            are several risks: (a) the derailment of the peace process;\n            (b) a substantial deterioration of external environment; (c)\n            potential for domestic political instability, since Sri\n            Lanka is going through a period of political\n            \"cohabitation\"--a President from one party, and a\n            Government from another; and, (d) resistance by labor unions\n            to some economic reforms. Risks however, are mitigated by\n            the design of the credit, and by the Country Assistance\n            Strategy (CAS) triggers."}, "docdt": "2003-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
