I 
PROGRAM 
SUMMARY 
Borrower: 
Democratic 
Socialist Republic 
of 
Sri 
Lanka 
Amount: 
US$125 
million 
equivalent; 
on 
standard 
IDA 
terms and 
conditions. 
Description: 
Background: 
The 
principal 
objectives 
of 
the Government’s  development and 
poverty reduction 
strategy 
include 
securing 
lasting 
peace, 
accelerating 
economic growth, 
and strengthening governance 
in 
the 
public 
sector. 
The 
Government 
has 
already embarked 
on 
a 
strong 
program 
of 
peace and 
reconciliation 
and 
a comprehensive 
set 
of 
structural 
reforms 
to 
promote 
private 
sector-led 
growth. 
Significant 
progress 
has 
been achieved 
in 
the 
peace 
front 
and 
in 
creating 
the 
conditions 
for 
accelerating 
economic 
growth 
on 
a 
sustainable basis. 
The 
Proposed 
Operation: 
The 
proposed 
Poverty Reduction 
Support 
Credit 
(PRSC) 
is 
designed 
to 
support the 
implementation 
of 
Sri 
Lanka’s 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy 
(PRS) 
as 
articulated 
in 
Regaining 
Sri 
Lanka: 
Vision 
and 
Strategy 
for 
Accelerated Development 
(which 
was 
discussed 
by 
the 
Board 
on 
April 
1,2003). 
This 
operation, 
PRSC 
I, 
would 
be 
the 
first 
of 
a 
series 
of 
annual 
PRSCs 
within 
a 
rolling 
four-year 
horizon, overlapping 
with 
Sri 
Lanka’s 
PRS period. 
Consistent 
with 
the 
objectives 
and 
priorities 
of 
Sri 
Lanka’s 
PRS, 
the PRSCs 
would 
support 
reforms 
in 
two 
major 
areas: 
(i) 
accelerating 
economic 
growth 
and 
supporting 
private 
sector 
development; 
and 
(ii) 
strengthening governance 
in 
the 
public 
sector 
and improving 
the 
welfare 
system. 
Benefits: 
The 
proposed 
PRSC 
will 
help 
the 
Government 
to: 
(i) 
move forward 
with 
the 
structural 
reforms, create 
conditions 
for 
accelerating economic growth, 
and 
send 
a 
strong 
signal 
to 
the 
private 
sector; 
(ii) 
continue 
fiscal 
consolidation 
and 
also 
have 
some 
fiscal 
space 
for 
the 
priority 
PRS 
programs; 
and 
(iii) 
improve 
public 
sector 
governance, 
and strengthen 
institutional framework 
and capacity 
in 
the management 
of 
public 
resources. These developments 
would 
also 
lead 
to 
improvements 
in 
the 
poverty-focus 
of 
public 
expenditures. 
Risks: 
There 
are 
several 
risks: 
(i) 
the 
derailment 
of 
the 
peace 
process; 
(ii) 
a 
substantial 
deterioration 
of 
external 
environment; 
(iii) 
potential 
for 
domestic 
political 
instability 
since 
Sri 
Lanka 
is 
going through 
a 
period 
of 
political 
“cohabitation”--a 
President 
from 
one 
party 
and 
a 
Government 
from 
another; 
and 
(iv) 
resistance 
by 
labor 
unions 
to 
some 
economic reforms. 
Risks 
are 
mitigated 
by 
the 
design 
of 
the 
credit and 
by 
the 
CAS 
triggers. 
The 
proposed 
credit 
would 
be 
disbursed 
in 
July 
2003.

INTRODUCTION 
1. 
recapturing missed 
opportunities,  and 
for 
faster expansion 
in 
economic 
opportunities. 
The prolonged 
civil 
conflict 
of 
the 
last 
two 
decades 
and the postponement 
of 
the 
badly 
needed 
economic 
policy/institutional 
reforms 
had 
kept 
Sri 
Lanka 
in 
a 
state 
of 
continuous 
sociallpolitical 
crisis and economic 
difficulties. 
The 
country had 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
consequences 
of 
enormous 
human 
suffering 
from 
the 
20 
year 
civil 
conflict, 
depletion 
of 
infrastructure, and 
below 
potential 
economic performance.  Persistent 
and 
very 
large 
budget 
deficits 
have 
led 
to 
a 
huge 
public 
debt 
burden--now 
exceeding 100 percent 
of 
GDP--and 
a 
fragile fiscal 
situation. 
Sri 
Lanka 
entered 2003 
with 
significantly improved 
prospects 
for 
establishing 
a 
lasting 
peace, 
2. 
Today, 
Sri 
Lanka 
has 
a great 
window 
of 
opportunity. 
The 
United 
National Front 
(UNF) 
Government that 
came 
to 
power 
in 
December 
2001 
with 
a mandate 
to 
secure peace 
and 
accelerate 
economic 
growth 
has 
already embarked 
on 
a 
bold 
program 
of 
peace/reconciliation and 
a comprehensive 
set 
of 
economic 
policy/institutional 
reforms 
to 
promote private 
sector-led 
growth. 
Since 
the 
beginning 
of 
2002, 
significant 
progress 
has 
been achieved 
in 
the 
peace 
front 
with 
successive 
rounds 
of 
peace 
talks, 
creating 
a 
real 
sense 
of 
optimism for 
the 
first 
time. 
An 
initial 
program 
of 
relief, 
rehabilitation, 
and 
reconstruction 
in 
the 
conflict-affected 
North 
and East 
has 
already been 
launched 
with 
donor 
support 
to 
address 
priority 
needs. 
This 
is 
to 
be 
followed 
by 
more 
comprehensive 
programs 
of 
reconstruction 
based 
on 
the 
ongoing 
needs assessment. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
with 
the 2002 
Budget implementation 
and 
the 
2003 
Budget 
announcement, the 
new 
Government 
has 
clearly 
demonstrated 
its 
commitment 
to moving 
forward 
with 
the 
growth 
agenda 
and 
tackling 
the 
fiscal 
deficitldebt 
issue. 
The 
Bank 
and 
the 
International 
Monetary 
Fund’s 
(IMF) 
assessment 
is 
that 
the 
fiscal 
adjustment 
measures 
and comprehensive structural 
reforms 
that have been announced 
and 
being 
implemented 
are 
credible and 
substantial, 
and 
will 
continue 
in 
the 
medium-term 
in 
line 
with 
the 
Government’s 
vision 
for 
the 
country. 
This 
vision 
is 
articulated 
in 
“Regaining 
Sri 
Lanka: Vision and 
Strategy 
for 
Accelerated Development”, 
which 
maps the 
way 
forward 
in 
economic 
policy 
strategy 
and formulates 
Sri 
Lanka 
’s 
Poverty Reduction 
Strategy 
(PRS). 
3. 
Indeed, at the 
beginning 
of 
a 
new 
millennium, 
Sri 
Lanka 
is 
poised 
to 
compensate 
for 
the 
past 
underperformance and 
regain 
its 
place among 
its 
East 
Asian 
neighbors, 
its 
peers 
of 
the 
1960s. 
These 
developments 
are 
already 
affecting 
the 
Bank’s 
level 
of 
engagement 
in 
Sri 
Lanka, 
and 
the 
new 
Country 
Assistance Strategy 
(CAS) 
has 
developed 
an 
appropriately 
formulated 
program 
of 
support. 
In 
support 
of 
its 
program 
of 
accelerated 
development 
and poverty 
reduction, 
the 
Government 
of 
Sri 
Lanka 
has 
requested a combined, three-year 
Poverty 
Reduction 
and 
Growth 
Facility 
(PRGF) 
and 
Extended 
Fund 
Facility 
(EFF) 
Arrangement 
from 
the 
IMF, 
and 
a 
four-year Poverty 
Reduction 
Support 
Credit 
(PRSC) 
from 
the 
Bank. The Joint 
Staff 
Assessment presented 
to 
the 
Board 
on 
April 
1,2003 concluded 
that 
Sri 
Lanka’s PRS 
provides 
a sound basis 
for 
Bank 
and 
Fund 
concessional 
assistance. 
The 
proposed 
SDR 
90.7 
million 
(US$125 
million 
equivalent) 
First 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Support 
Credit 
(PRSC 
I) 
would 
assist 
the 
Government 
implement 
policies 
and structural reforms that 
are 
consistent 
with 
and supportive 
of 
Sri 
Lanka’s 
PRS. 
While 
the 
amount 
of 
the 
proposed 
credit 
is 
US$15 
million 
larger 
than 
the 
amount 
stated 
in 
the 
recent 
CAS, 
this 
is 
to 
help 
the Government respond 
to 
the 
immediate 
needs 
resulting 
from 
the 
devastating 
floods 
that 
were experienced 
in 
May 
2003 
and 
to 
ensure 
that 
efforts 
aimed 
at 
keeping 
the 
structural 
reform 
program 
on 
track 
are 
maintained 
in 
the 
aftermath 
of 
the 
floods.’ The PRSC 
would 
also 
’ 
These 
floods 
are the worst experienced 
by 
Sri 
Lanka 
in 
the 
47 
years 
since Independence. 
The 
fiscal 
effects 
of 
this 
disaster have 
not 
been yet 
determined.  Based 
on 
recent 
Bank 
data, 
the 
total 
cost 
of 
flood 
related 
damage 
may 
be 
in 
excess 
of 
US$50 
million.

2003.

This 
Program Document 
discusses 
Sri 
Lanka’s social context and recent economic 
performance. 
It 
then 
gives details 
of 
the objectives, the 
key 
thrusts, 
and 
policy 
measures 
included 
in 
the Government’s 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy. 
Medium-term 
prospects under a 
satisfactory 
implementation 
of 
the 
PRS 
are 
discussed. 
Finally, 
the 
Document 
elaborates the rationale, actions expected 
to 
be 
supported 
by 
the 
PRSC, 
and 
benefits 
and 
risks 
of 
the proposed operation.

human

promoting 
gender 
equality, and social 
mobilization. 
It 
was 
one 
of 
the 
first 
developing countries 
to 
understand the 
importance 
of 
investing 
in 
human 
resources 
by 
providing 
universal health 
and 
education 
coverage 
and 
promoting 
gender 
equality 
and social 
mobilization. 
As 
a 
result, 
Sri 
Lanka 
achieved 
human 
development 
outcomes 
as 
great 
as 
those 
of 
high 
income 
countries and 
surpassed 
almost 
all 
of 
the 
Millennium 
Development Goals 
(MDGs) 
at an 
early 
stage 
of 
its 
development 
process 
(see 
Box 
1). 
The poor 
in 
Sri 
Lanka 
are 
relatively 
well-protected due 
to 
free and 
universal 
access 
to 
health 
and 
education 
services, 
large 
income 
transfer programs-i.e., 
Samurdhi--and 
substantial subsidy 
schemes. 
The 
early 
successes 
in 
human 
development outcomes 
undoubtedly result 
from 
these 
long- 
standing 
policies. 
But, 
there are 
weaknesses. 
While 
access 
to 
health and 
education 
services 
is 
well- 
distributed, 
quality--especially 
in 
poor 
areas--remains 
inadequate. 
Poor 
households also face 
shortfalls 
in 
access 
to 
other 
basic 
services--e.g., 
among 
the poorest households, 
only 
38 
percent 
have 
electricity, 
55 
percent 
safe 
sanitation and 
61 
percent 
safe 
drinking 
water. 
Access 
to 
English 
language and 
technical 
education--both 
in 
great demand--is also 
low 
in 
poor 
regions. 
Moreover, social protection 
programs have 
become 
highly 
politicized 
and 
poorly 
targeted--Samurdhi 
is 
presently available 
to 
over 
50 
percent 
of 
the 
population.

These

that

and the

and,

some

5 
percent (about

terms) 
in

appears 
respectable, 
especially 
against the 
backdrop 
of 
the 
civil 
conflict.  The liberalization 
of

10. 
Recent 
political 
developments. 
Sri 
Lanka 
has 
had 
numerous 
elections 
recently--including 
Provincial 
Councils 
(April 
1999), 
Presidential 
(December 
1999), 
Parliamentary (October 2000 
and 
December 
2001) 
and 
local 
(March 
2002). 
The 
United 
National 
Party 
(UNP)--traditionally 
supportive 
of 
economic 
liberalization--won 
a 
near 
majority 
in 
the 225-member 
legislature 
in 
the 
most 
recent 
parliamentary 
elections. 
With 
the 
support 
of 
allied 
parties, the 
UNP 
formed 
a Government 
with 
a 
two 
seat 
majority, returning 
to 
power 
after 
seven years 
in 
the 
opposition. 
Mr. 
Rani1 Wickremasinghe--Prime 
Minister 
from 
1993-1994 
and a cabinet 
minister 
from 
1977-1993--was 
sworn 
in 
as 
Prime 
Minister 
on 
December 
9, 
2001. 
Following 
this, 
in 
the 
March 
2002 
local 
elections the 
UNP 
won 
all 
but 
one 
of 
the over 
200 
seats, 
hence, 
strengthening 
its 
mandate 
to 
pursue 
a 
lasting 
peace 
and economic 
reform 
agenda 
to 
accelerate 
economic growth. 
11. 
Economic 
Developments. 
Large 
and 
sustained budget 
deficits--of 
around 
7.5 
to 
11 
percent 
of 
GDP-since 
the 
early 
1990s 
have 
resulted 
in 
a 
fragilefiscal 
situation, facing 
the 
Government 
with 
a 
sign@cant 
deficit 
and 
debt 
reduction challenge 
(see 
Table 
2). 
Even 
when 
grants treated 
as 
revenue, 
the 
budget 
deficit 
still 
remained 
at 
very 
high 
levels 
in 
the 
1990s. 
Rising 
defense spending, 
significant 
increases 
in 
interest payments, 
large 
losses 
of 
state-owned enterprises 
(SOEs), 
and 
the 
sharp 
decline 
in 
budget 
revenues 
contributed 
to 
the 
growing 
budget 
deficits. 
The 
revenue 
performance 
has 
weakened 
by 
about 
4 
percentage 
points 
of 
GDP 
since 1995. 
The 
loss 
of 
tariff 
revenues 
from 
tariff 
exemptions 
and 
the 
tax 
concessions awarded 
to 
investors under 
the 
Board 
of 
Investment 
(BOI) 
regime 
have

Heavy

the

Sri 
Lanka 
suffered 
significant 
economic 
setbacks 
in 
2001. 
The 
switch to 
a 
floating 
exchange 
rate 
regime 
on 
January 23 
was 
an 
important 
step 
to 
stem the loss 
of 
external 
reserves that 
had 
started 
in 
2000. 
Still, 
given 
the 
import 
demand 
pressures 
and 
high 
oil 
prices, 
by 
March 
31,2001, 
gross 
official 
reserves 
fell 
to 
under 2 months’ 
import 
financing 
needs. 
To 
improve fiscal 
balances, 
stabilize 
the 
exchange 
rate, 
and reverse reserve 
losses, 
the 
Government 
entered 
into 
a Stand-By Arrangement 
(SBA) 
with 
the 
IMF 
in 
April. 
However, 
adverse 
political 
and economic 
developments 
in 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the year 
derailed 
the 
program. 
The July 
24th 
attack 
by 
the 
LTTE 
on 
the 
Colombo 
Airport 
and 
the 
events 
of 
September 
1 
lth, 
a 
sluggish 
external 
demand 
for 
Sri 
Lanka’s 
exports, 
a 
prolonged 
drought, 
and the heightened 
political 
uncertainty produced a negative 
growth 
rate 
of 
1.4 
percent--the 
first 
contraction 
since independence 
in 
1948. 
The 
rate 
of 
inflation 
rose 
by 
8 
percentage 
points to 
over 
14 percent due 
to 
drought related 
price 
increases 
and the 
impact 
of 
the depreciation 
of 
Rupee. 
Defense 
spending 
overruns and 
fiscal 
laxity 
intensified 
in 
the 
run 
up 
to 
the 
December 
2001 
elections. 
14. 
Understanding 
(MOU) 
between 
the 
Government 
and the 
Liberation 
Tigers 
of 
Tamil 
Eelam 
(LTTE) 
on 
February 
23,2002,  the 
Government 
presented 
a 
strong 
Budget 
in 
March 
2002 
which 
demonstrated 
a 
clear 
commitment 
to 
fiscal 
consolidation, structural 
reforms, 
and economic 
growth. 
On 
the 
fiscal 
front, a 
two- 
rate 
VAT 
system 
replaced the 
GST 
and 
the 
NSL; 
selective 
expenditure 
cuts were 
introduced (including 
a 
credible 
public 
sector 
hiring 
freeze); 
restrictions 
on 
FDI 
were 
further 
relaxed, and the 
deficit 
target 
was 
set 
at 
8.5 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
The 
higher 
budget 
deficit 
outcome 
of 
8.9 
percent 
is 
mainly 
due 
to 
the 
transitional 
revenue 
losses 
associated 
with 
the 
introduction 
of 
the 
VAT, 
the 
subsequent 
VAT 
exemptions 
granted 
to 
contain 
the 
VAT-related 
upward 
pressures 
on 
the cost 
of 
living, 
and a 
lower 
than projected 
GDP 
growth. 
These measures 
fostered 
investor 
confidence, 
boosted 
the 
stock market, and doubled 
capital 
inflows 
on 
a 
cumulative 
basis. 
The 
IMF 
released the 
last 
tranche under 
the 
SBA 
in 
September, and the 
gross 
official 
foreign 
reserve 
position improved 
to 
well 
over 
2 months 
of 
imports. 
The 
Rupee remained 
broadly 
stable at 
around 
Rs.96 
per 
US 
dollar. 
With 
the 
return 
of 
normal 
rains 
and the cessation 
of 
hostilities, 
GDP 
growth 
turned 
positive 
in 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2002, reached 
5.3 
percent 
in 
the 
third 
quarter, 
and 
appears 
to 
have 
exceeded 
3 
percent 
for 
the 
year, 
reflecting 
largely 
domestic-oriented 
activity 
(particularly 
in 
services), 
since 
external 
demand 
remained 
sluggish. 
And 
the 
average 
rate 
of 
inflation 
appears 
to 
have 
fallen below 
10 
percent. 
The 
2003 
Budget 
presented 
on 
November 
6,2002 
reflects a 
continuity 
from 
the 2002 
March 
initiatives.

SRI 
LANKA’S 
POVERTY 
REDUCTION 
STRATEGY 
(PRS) 
A. 
Sri 
Lanka’s Poverty 
Reduction Strategy 
(PRS) 
and 
Development 
Agenda 
15. 
Background. 
During 
the 
past 
four 
years, 
successive 
Governments have 
engaged 
in 
broad 
stakeholder 
consultations 
to 
reach 
consensus 
on 
a 
medium- 
to 
long-term 
strategy 
for 
faster and sustained 
economic development and 
poverty 
reduction.  The incidence 
and 
depth 
of 
poverty 
were 
widely 
discussed 
and 
the 
country’s 
approach 
to 
the 
problem 
was 
first 
elaborated 
in 
Connecting 
to Growth: 
Sri 
Lanka’s 
Poverty Reduction Strategy. 
The 
island-wide 
consultative 
process 
also 
mobilized 
views 
of 
key 
stakeholders 
on 
how 
to 
work 
together 
on 
relief 
and 
rehabilitation 
in 
the 
conflict-affected 
areas 
through 
the 
Framework 
for 
Reliej 
Rehabilitation, 
and 
Reconciliation 
(RRR). 
The 
results 
of 
these 
consensus-building 
consultations 
together 
with 
background 
assessments 
resulted 
in 
a well-developed 
draft 
of 
Sri 
Lanka’s 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy 
(PRS), 
which 
development partners 
strongly 
endorsed at the 
June 
2002 
Development 
Forum 
(DF). 
16. 
After 
its 
election 
in 
December 
2001, 
the 
Government 
set 
about the task 
of 
defining 
its 
own 
economic 
program 
more 
precisely. 
This 
has 
resulted 
in 
the 
publication 
of 
The 
Future: 
Regaining Sri 
Lanka 
(RSL), 
which 
is 
a strong 
and aggressive 
proposal 
to 
remove 
the 
existing policy-induced 
and 
structural constraints 
that 
inhibit 
private 
sector 
activity, and 
change the 
role 
of 
the 
state. 
It 
is 
to 
be 
emphasized that 
RSL 
is 
fully 
consistent 
with 
the 
thrust 
of 
the 
earlier 
draft 
of 
the 
PRS, 
but 
with 
a 
much 
more 
accelerated 
and 
deeper 
implementation 
framework, and 
an elaborated 
monitoring 
and 
implementation 
mechanism. 
The 
PRS, 
which 
incorporates 
the 
policy 
framework 
elaborated 
in 
the 
RSL, 
was 
finalized 
in 
early 
January 2003 under the 
title 
Regaining 
Sri 
Lanka: 
Vision 
and 
Strategy 
for 
Accelerated Development. 
(The details 
of 
the 
consultative 
process, 
which 
started 
in 
May 
1998, 
are 
elaborated 
in 
Part 
11, 
Chapter 
1 
of 
the 
main 
text 
of 
the 
PRS and summarized 
in 
Annex 
1 
of 
Part 
11). 
The 
final 
document 
defines the 
priorities 
for 
the 
country’s 
medium- 
and 
long-term 
term 
economic 
and 
social 
development 
agenda 
and charts 
a 
program 
of 
action 
for 
the country. 
This 
is 
also 
serving 
as 
the 
main 
framework 
for 
the 
formulation 
of 
the 
Bank‘s 
new Country 
Assistance Strategy 
for 
Sri 
Lanka 
(discussed 
at 
the 
Board 
on 
April 
1,2003), 
for 
concessional 
assistance 
from 
the 
IMF 
as 
well, 
and 
for 
support 
from 
the 
bilateral 
donors.

state 
with 
a 
clear 
departure 
away 
from 
the 
unsustainable 
policies 
of 
“redistributiodtransfers 
” 
to 
creating an 
enabling environment 
for 
faster economic 
growth 
and poverty reduction. 
Accordingly, 
the 
principal 
thrusts/objectives 
of 
PRS 
are 
already 
well-identified. 
In 
broad 
terms, 
these 
include: 
Principal 
thrusts 
of 
Sri 
Lunka’s 
PRS. 
The 
PRS 
reflects 
afundamental 
change 
in 
the 
role 
of 
the 
(i) 
securing 
lasting 
peace; 
(ii) 
building 
a supportive macroeconomic environment; 
(iii) 
accelerating economic growth, 
with 
the 
private 
sector 
leading 
the 
effort; 
(iv) 
investing 
in 
people; 
and, 
(v) 
strengthening 
“governance” 
in 
the 
public 
sector 
to 
enhance 
the development 
impact 
of 
public 
resources. 
18. 
In 
line 
with 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
(MDGs), 
the PRSP 
identifies 
the target 
of 
halving 
the 
number 
of 
poor 
by 
2015 
as 
the 
key 
objective that 
will 
guide the 
long-term 
strategy 
for 
poverty 
reduction. 
Within 
this 
framework, 
the other 
key 
targets 
that 
the 
PRSP 
sees 
as 
achievable 
in 
the 
medium- 
term 
include: 
increasing 
the 
GDP 
growth 
rate 
to 
around 7 percent 
within 
next 
three-four 
years 
(and then 
increasing 
it 
further 
to 
near 
10 
percent 
in 
the second 
half 
of 
the 
current 
decade); 
and 
creating 
a 
minimum 
of 
two 
million 
new 
jobs 
during 
the 
next 
several 
years 
for 
the 
currently 
unemployedunder-employed 
and the 
new 
entrants 
to 
the 
workforce; 
and 
reducing 
the 
national 
headcount 
poverty index 
from 
25 
percent 
to 
20 
percent and the 
rural 
headcount 
poverty index 
from 
27 
percent 
to 
22 
percent 
by 
2005.

Re-orientation 
of 
public 
expenditures. 
Consistent 
with 
these 
objectives, 
the 
PRSP 
envisages 
gradual 
shifts 
in 
the 
allocation 
of 
public 
expenditures. 
Additional fiscal 
room 
that the 
ongoing fiscal 
consolidation 
(detailed 
below) 
will 
create 
is 
expected 
to 
allow for 
a 
deficit 
reduction 
of 
about 
4.5 
percent 
percentage 
points 
of 
GDP 
in 
four 
years, 
while 
also 
creating 
room 
for 
gradual 
increase 
in 
capital 
spending 
in 
education, 
health 
and 
infrastructure. 
The 
share 
of 
social 
sector 
capital 
expenditures 
would 
more 
than 
double 
to 
2.2 
percent 
of 
GDP 
by 
2006 
from 
its 
2001 
level.  Similarly, 
the 
PRS 
includes 
strengthened 
public 
sector programs 
for 
rural 
development--in agriculture, 
irrigation, 
rural 
electrification, 
connecting 
roads, 
and 
initiatives 
to 
promote community-based activities.

reduction 
strategy. 
Recognizing 
that 
ending 
the 
conflict 
and 
establishing 
peace 
will 
be 
a 
challenging 
and 
long 
process, 
the 
Government 
is 
pursuing 
a 
three-pronged approach 
to 
secure 
lasting 
peace 
consisting 
of 
(i) 
negotiating 
a 
political 
settlement; 
(ii) 
enacting 
constitutional 
reforms 
to 
fulfill 
the aspirations 
of 
all 
citizens; 
and 
(iii) 
expediting 
development 
in 
the 
conflict-affected 
areas. 
The 
Reliej 
Rehabilitation, 
and 
Reconciliation 
(RRR) 
process 
was 
initiated 
to 
address 
the basic 
needs 
of 
the people 
affected 
by 
the 
protracted 
conflict, 
to 
improve 
conditions 
for 
the 
resumption 
of 
economic activities, and 
to 
facilitate 
reconciliation 
among 
all 
ethnic 
groups. 
Between 
September 
2002 
and 
March 
2003 
six 
rounds 
of 
formal 
peace 
talks 
took 
place between 
the 
LTTE 
and Government. 
The 
talks were 
temporarily 
suspended 
in 
April, 
but 
it 
is 
anticipated 
that 
they 
will 
resume 
in 
the 
not 
too 
distant 
future. 
In 
the meantime, 
the 
Government 
is 
actively 
engaged 
with 
donors 
to 
mobilize 
financial 
support 
for 
immediate 
humanitarian 
and 
rehabilitation 
needs 
in 
the 
North 
and 
East. 
To 
this 
end, 
the 
Oslo 
Donor 
Conference 
was 
held 
on 
November 
25,2002, 
in 
which 
development 
partners 
indicated 
pledges 
of 
about 
US$70 
million 
for 
the 
North 
East 
Reconstruction 
Fund, 
for 
which 
the 
World 
Bank 
is 
the 
Administrator. 
This 
fund 
will 
be used 
for 
immediate humanitarian 
and 
reconstruction 
needs. 
A 
Conference 
on 
Reconstruction 
and 
Development 
of 
Sri 
Lanka 
is 
planned 
in 
Tokyo 
in 
June 
2003, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
yet 
clear 
whether 
this 
will 
go 
ahead 
as 
currently 
planned.

Box 
2: 
The 
Humanitarian 
Effects 
of 
the 
Conflict 
The 
conflict 
in 
Sri 
Lanka 
has 
led 
to 
loss 
of 
life, 
the 
displacement 
of 
persons 
belonging 
to 
all 
ethnic 
groups and 
the 
destruction 
of 
infrastructure, 
health 
care 
facilities 
and schools. 
Approximately 
2.5 
million 
persons 
lived 
in 
areas 
of 
direct 
military 
activity--65,000 
people 
have 
been 
killed, 
800,000 
are 
intemally 
displaced, 
including 
172,000 
living 
in 
refugee 
camps 
and another 
700,000 
left 
the 
country. 
There 
are 
30,000 
war 
widows 
and 
an 
estimated 
300,000 
displaced 
children 
in 
the 
North-East 
where 
the 
school drop out rate 
is 
double 
the 
national 
average. 
The 
infant 
mortality 
rate 
in 
the 
North 
East 
is 
twice 
the 
national 
average, 
the 
matemal 
mortality 
rate 
is 
thrice 
the 
national 
average 
and 
92% 
of 
malaria 
deaths 
are 
reported 
from 
the 
region. 
There 
are 
an 
estimated 
1.8 
million 
landmines 
in 
the 
North--a 
per 
capita incidence 
comparable to 
Angola. 
The 
Bank’s Activities 
in 
the 
North 
East 
Since 1999, 
the 
Bank 
has 
been 
a 
leader 
in 
assisting development 
of 
the 
North 
East 
(NE). 
The 
NE 
Irrigated Agriculture 
Project 
(NEIAP; 
1999) 
has 
been 
active 
in 
conflict-affected 
areas 
supporting 
community-driven efforts 
to 
rebuild 
economic 
activity 
and 
the 
2001 
Land 
Mine 
Action 
Project 
(a 
US$1 
million 
Post 
Conflict 
Fund 
Grant administered 
by 
UNDP) 
has 
been 
supporting 
de-mining 
activities. 
In 
mid-2002, 
the 
Bank 
developed 
a 
three-phase  strategy 
for 
comprehensive 
reconstruction 
support 
to 
the 
NE. 
In 
the 
first 
phase, 
we 
are 
redirecting, 
expediting, 
and 
scaling-up 
activities 
in 
the 
NE 
in 
those 
projects 
which 
focus 
on 
the 
entire country, 
but 
activities 
could not 
be 
carried 
out 
in 
the 
NE 
because 
of 
the 
conflict. 
Approximately 
US$15 
million 
was 
identified through 
four projects. 
In 
the 
second 
phase, 
certain 
projects--with significant 
savings and/or 
where 
project 
components 
will 
not 
meet 
development objectives 
by 
closing--have 
been 
restructured 
to 
provide additional urgently 
needed 
support 
to 
the 
reconstruction efforts. 
US$3 
1 
million 
was 
identified 
in 
three 
operations 
and 
a restructuring 
package 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
Board 
on November 14,2002. 
In 
the 
third 
phase, 
a longer-term program 
to 
meet 
the 
development 
needs 
of 
the 
NE 
is 
being 
addressed 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
CAS. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Bank 
will 
administer 
the 
North 
East 
Reconstruction 
Fund 
(NERF)--the 
main 
vehicle 
for 
implementing 
humanitarian 
and 
rehabilitation 
programs 
in 
the 
NE.

This 
would 
mean 
that 
fiscal 
support 
needs 
associated 
with 
the 
peace 
process and the 
RRR 
efforts 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
significant 
as 
well. 
It 
is 
important 
that the 
population 
begins 
to 
see 
the 
gains 
from 
peace at 
an 
early 
stage 
and 
that resources 
are 
in 
place 
to 
permit 
resettlement 
to 
occur. 
Faced 
with 
the 
very 
tight 
budgetary 
situation, the 
Government 
has 
allocated 
budgetary resources 
amounting 
to only 
about 
0.5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2003 
for 
the 
RRR 
activities 
in 
the 
North 
East. 
However, 
the 
Government 
intends 
to 
prepare 
a 
“Supplementary 
Budget” 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
additional 
concessional 
assistance 
for 
the 
North 
and 
East. 
In 
this 
regard, the 
ongoing efforts 
to 
mobilize 
more 
concessional 
financial 
support 
to 
meet 
not 
only 
the 
immediate 
RRR 
needs 
but 
also the 
significant 
pent-up maintenance 
and investment 
needs 
in 
the 
conflict-affected 
region 
are 
important. 
As 
detailed 
in 
Box 
2, 
the 
Bank 
has 
already expanded 
its 
support 
program 
for 
the 
North 
East. 
Other 
development partners 
are 
willing to 
increase 
their 
assistance 
to 
Sri 
Lanka 
in 
the 
short-term 
to 
support 
RRR 
programs, and 
it 
is 
expected that 
they 
will 
also 
participate 
in 
the 
medium- 
and 
longer-term 
reconstruction and 
development 
efforts 
under a 
successful 
peace process 
and 
effective implementation 
of 
Sri 
Lanka’s 
PRS. 
Building 
a 
Supportive Macroeconomic 
Environment 
22. 
as 
stressed 
in 
the PRS. 
Consistent 
with 
this 
objective, 
there 
is 
an 
acceleration 
in 
the pace 
of 
structural 
reforms 
aimed 
at: 
reforming 
factor 
markets, the 
commercial 
legal 
framework 
and 
the 
public 
sector; 
facilitating 
greater 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
infrastructure; 
and 
reinvigorating 
the 
rural 
economy. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
recognizing 
that 
macroeconomic 
stability 
is 
a 
sine 
qua 
non 
for 
sustained 
high 
economic 
growth, 
the PRS also places 
strong 
emphasis 
on 
fiscal 
sustainability 
and 
on 
strengthening the 
macroeconomic 
framework. 
Creating 
the 
conditions 
for 
accelerating 
economic 
growth 
on 
a 
sustainable basis 
is 
a 
key 
priority 
23. 
The 
Govemment 
is 
committed 
to 
continuinR 
fiscal consolidation 
and strengthening 
the 
macroeconomic 
framework. 
The medium-term objective 
is 
to 
reduce 
the budget 
deficit below 
5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
and 
the 
public 
debt 
to 
around 
81 
percent 
of 
GDP 
by 
2006. 
Fiscal 
consolidation 
will 
continue 
through 
revenue 
as 
well 
as 
expenditure 
measures. 
On 
the 
revenue 
side, 
the tax revenue/GDP 
ratio 
is 
expected 
to 
increase 
by 
2.7 percentage 
points 
during 
2002-2005, 
mostly 
by 
extending 
VAT’s 
coverage 
to 
retail 
activities 
and 
by 
reducing 
VAT 
exemptions. 
The 
removal 
of 
tariff 
exemptions 
on 
imports 
and the 
introduction 
of 
a 
minimum 
import 
tariff 
rate 
are the other 
important 
source 
of 
improved 
tax 
buoyancy. 
Already, Section 
17 
of 
Board 
of 
Investment 
(BOI) 
Law 
was 
repealed, 
thereby 
eliminating 
BOI’s 
power 
to 
grant tax 
holidays/incentives outside 
the 
regular tax legislation. 
Also, 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
unified tax 
authority 
is 
expected 
to improve 
tax 
collection 
in 
general. 
On 
the 
expenditure 
side, 
the target 
is 
to 
reduce 
the 
current expenditure/GDP 
ratio 
by 
2.3 
percentage 
point 
in 
four 
years. 
This 
is 
to be 
achieved through 
reductions 
(as 
a 
percent 
of 
GDP) 
in 
salaries/wages, defense 
spending, 
interest 
payments, 
and 
subsidiedtransfers, 
including 
the 
scaling 
down 
of 
the 
Samurdhi 
program 
through 
better 
targeting. 
The 
Government also intends 
to 
rely 
on 
grants 
and 
concessional 
donor 
assistance 
in 
meeting 
the 
financing 
needs 
of 
additional 
RRR 
activities 
in 
the 
North 
and 
East, 
thus 
maintaining fiscal 
discipline. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
latter 
fiscal 
measures, 
some 
of 
the 
structural reforms 
initiated 
under the program, 
including 
the 
ongoing restructuring 
and 
privatization 
efforts 
in 
the 
SOE 
sector, 
will 
contribute 
to 
the 
fiscal 
consolidation 
and 
deficiddebt 
reduction 
effort. 
The acceleration 
of 
economic 
growth 
will, 
of 
course, 
enhance 
the 
budgetary revenue 
base 
and 
improve 
debt 
servicing 
capacity, 
thus 
strengthening 
fiscal 
sustainability 
(see 
Box 
3). 
24. 
There 
are, 
of 
course, 
some 
downside risks 
faced 
by 
the 
Government 
in 
strengthening 
fiscal 
balances 
and 
restoring 
fiscal 
sustainability 
in 
the 
medium-term. 
Internally, 
a 
resumption 
of 
hostilities, 
sustained 
drought 
and, 
externally, 
any sustained 
adverse 
impact 
of 
the 
post-Iraq 
War 
developments 
in 
the 
Middle-East 
on 
oil 
prices, 
tourism 
revenues, tea 
exports, 
and 
remittances 
could 
affect 
Sri 
Lanka’ 
s 
growth 
performance and 
external 
balances 
negatively, 
thus 
undermining 
the 
anticipated 
benefits 
of 
the 
ongoing 
fiscal consolidation 
and 
structural 
reform 
efforts.

Box 
3: 
Fiscal 
and External 
Debt 
Sustainability 
Fiscal 
policy/public 
debt 
sustainability. 
As 
noted 
earlier, 
under 
continued 
fiscal 
consolidation 
and 
structural reforms 
in 
the 
medium-term 
(detailed 
below), 
Sri 
Lanka’s 
fiscal 
policy 
will 
be 
sustainable, 
with 
the 
primary 
budget 
deficit 
falling 
and 
the 
public 
debt/GDP 
ratio declining 
(Table 
3). 
Not 
unexpectedly, however, 
sensitivity 
analysis 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
IMF 
demonstrates that, even 
with 
strong 
fiscal 
adjustment, 
achieving 
a 
rising 
GDP 
growth 
rate 
from 
the 
very 
low 
2001 levels 
is 
critical for 
securing 
fiscal 
sustainability. 
There 
are 
other 
risks 
to 
fiscal 
sustainability 
in 
the 
medium-term: 
the 
revenue 
measures 
may 
fail 
to 
be 
effective; 
concessional 
external financing 
may 
fall, 
leading to 
more non-concessional 
foreign 
borrowing; 
and 
capital 
spending 
may 
exceed 
prudent 
levels. 
External 
debt 
sustainability. 
Sri 
Lanka’s 
total 
external 
debt 
was 
US$9.7 
billion 
at 
end-2001 
(about 
62 
percent 
of 
GDP), 
with 
85 
percent 
of 
it 
being public/publicly 
guaranteed 
debt. 
Due 
to 
the 
high 
concessionality 
of 
the 
public 
debt, 
net 
present 
value 
of 
the 
external 
public 
debt 
was 
about 
74 
percent 
of 
the 
nominal 
stock. 
The 
medium-term 
macroeconomic 
scenario 
summarized 
in 
Table 
3, 
with 
rising 
GDP 
growth 
and 
increasing concessional donor 
assistance, 
shows 
a declining 
external 
debt/GDP 
ratio. 
The 
latter 
is 
of 
course 
sensitive 
to 
GDP 
growth 
rate 
assumption. 
And 
the 
IMF’s 
sensitivity 
analyses 
indicate 
also 
that 
the 
external 
debt 
ratio 
shows 
reasonable robustness 
to 
temporary 
shocks 
to 
interest 
rates, 
growth, 
and 
the 
external current 
account, 
though 
a 
combination 
of 
these 
or 
a 
large depreciation 
of 
the 
Rupee 
could 
undermine 
sustainability. 
25. 
actions 
have been taken 
as 
well. 
The 
Fiscal 
Management 
(Responsibility) 
Act, 
enacted 
in 
January2003, 
requires 
regular 
mid-year and end-fiscal 
year 
‘fiscal 
position’ 
reports. 
It 
also 
mandates 
a ‘Pre-election 
Budgetary 
Position’ report 
to 
discourage 
pre-election 
‘hand-outs’. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Act 
sets 
a 
strict 
limit 
on 
borrowing 
from 
the 
Central 
Bank3 
and 
fixes 
the 
budget 
deficit 
target 
for 
2006 
at 
below 
5 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
Moreover, 
circulars 
were 
sent 
to 
the 
Secretaries 
of 
Ministries 
and 
Chairmen 
of 
the 
Boards 
of 
SOEs 
and Statutory Boards 
in 
May 
2002, 
establishing strict 
time 
limits 
on 
the 
submission 
of 
annual accounts 
and performance 
reports; 
(these 
circulars 
also establish 
penalties 
for 
non-compliance). 
Strengthening 
fiscal 
balances 
will 
continue 
to 
reduce 
budget 
deficit 
and 
the 
public 
debt 
to 
sustainable 
levels. 
To 
ensure 
that 
fiscal discipline 
is 
maintained 
and 
fiscal 
consolidation 
continues, 
legislative 
Accelerating 
Private 
Sector-Led 
Economic 
Growth 
26. 
Based 
on 
extensive 
assessments 
and actual 
experience, the 
liberalization 
of 
the domestic 
economy and strengthening 
of 
the 
enabling 
business 
environment 
are 
seen 
as 
key 
steps 
to 
fostering 
private 
sector-led 
growth. 
In 
this 
regard, there 
is 
a 
significant 
focus 
on 
reforming 
factor 
markets, 
which 
this 
proposed 
operation 
would 
support. 
Amendments 
are 
being 
made 
to 
the 
rigid 
labor 
laws 
to 
increase 
flexibility 
in 
the 
labor 
markets 
and thereby 
enhance 
labor 
mobility, 
productivity, 
and 
employment 
generation. 
The 
amendments 
seek 
to 
require 
the 
Labor 
Commissioner 
to 
apply 
new compensation 
formula 
to 
be published 
in 
a Gazette 
for 
job 
termination 
cases 
and expedite redundancy/labor dispute related 
hearings 
and determinations under 
a 
time-bound labor 
dispute 
settlement 
rule 
(details 
are 
in 
Section 
I11 
below). 
Preparations are also 
underway 
to 
foster 
efficient 
use 
of 
rural 
(as 
well 
as 
urban) 
land 
by 
establishing clear 
property 
rights 
and 
modernizing 
institutional framework 
that 
would 
lead 
to 
efficient 
functioning 
of 
land 
markets. 
To 
this 
end, 
efforts 
are 
made 
to 
establish 
a 
legal 
framework 
to 
remove 
restrictions 
related 
to 
the 
sale, 
leasing, transfer, 
and 
mortgaging 
of 
the 
rural 
lands that have 
been 
distributed 
to 
farmers 
on 
grant 
basis 
under 
the 
Land 
Development 
Ordinance 
and 
Land Grants (Special 
Provisions) 
Act. 
Similarly, 
consideration 
is 
also 
being 
given 
to 
divest 
unutilized 
state-owned 
urban 
land 
both 
to 
raise 
resources 
and 
to 
promote 
efficient 
use 
of 
urban 
land. 
Legal 
and 
organizational reforms 
are 
also 
being 
developed 
to 
improve 
the 
land 
administration 
system 
through 
title 
registration 
(see 
Section 
I11 
for 
details). 
27. 
Thefinancial 
sector, 
which 
has 
been 
strengthened 
in 
the 
last 
two 
decades 
through 
improvements 
in 
the 
legal 
framework, 
still 
has 
considerable 
weaknesses 
which 
constrain 
efficient financial 
intermediation 
and 
private 
sector development. 
The 
sector 
is 
dominated 
by 
larger 
and 
less 
efficient 
state- 
owned institutions. 
And 
the 
state 
claims 
a 
large 
portion 
of 
financial 
resources--particularly 
of

term 
funds--to finance 
the budget 
deficit, 
thus 
putting 
upward 
pressure 
on 
real 
interest rates 
and 
crowding 
out 
the 
private 
sector. 
The 
two 
state-owned 
commercial 
banks, 
Bank 
of 
Ceylon 
(BOC) and 
People’s 
Bank 
(PB), 
account 
for 
well 
over 
50 
percent 
of 
banking 
sector 
assets. 
Of 
the 
two, 
BOC 
has 
improved 
its 
performance 
recently 
and 
has 
lowered 
its 
NPL 
ratio 
(13.3 
percent). 
However, 
People’s 
Bank 
is 
still 
a 
very 
weak 
bank 
with 
negative 
net 
worth 
and a 
very 
high 
NPL 
ratio 
(20 percent--and 
even 
higher 
under 
the 
international 
loan 
classification 
norms). 
Currently, 
there 
is 
an ongoing 
effort 
to 
restructure 
the 
state- 
owned 
banks.  Since 
early 
2002, 
Bank 
of 
Ceylon 
has 
been 
implementing 
a 
business 
plan to 
improve 
returns 
on 
assetdequity, reduce employee 
cost 
ratios, 
speed 
up 
the 
recovery 
of 
NPLs, 
and 
reduce the 
number 
of 
branches. 
Among 
various 
restructuring 
options 
recommended 
by 
a 
Bank-IMF 
team, 
two 
possibilities 
of 
commercializing 
the 
PB 
are 
now 
being 
considered; 
specially: 
(i) 
identifying 
suitable 
strategic 
investor 
to 
take 
over 
the 
PB; 
or 
(ii) 
breaking 
up 
the 
PB 
into 
a 
commercia2 bank 
and 
savings 
bank, 
and 
then 
finding 
a 
strategic 
investor 
to 
take over 
the 
commercial 
unit. 
In 
either 
case, 
an 
asset 
management company 
(AMC) 
will 
be 
established 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
collection 
of 
NPLs 
(see 
Section 
I11 
for 
more 
details). 
To 
deepen 
the 
financial 
sector and 
improve financial 
intermediation, 
reforms 
have been 
and 
are 
being 
undertaken 
to 
increase 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
the insurance and 
provident 
fund 
industry, 
and 
to 
strengthen the 
regulatory 
and 
supervisory 
framework 
for 
the 
banking 
and 
the 
capital 
marketsa4 
28. 
Contractual 
savings 
are 
accounted 
for 
mainly 
by 
the 
two 
public 
provident 
funds 
for 
private 
sector 
employees, 
the 
Employees’ 
Provident 
Fund 
(EPF) 
and the 
Employees’ 
Trust 
Fund 
(ETF), 
and 
10 
insurance companies. 
In 
the insurance 
industry, 
the 
legal 
prohibition 
on 
private 
insurers 
and 
brokers 
was 
removed 
in 
1986 
with 
the amendment 
to 
the Insurance 
Control 
Act 
of 
1962.  Since 
then, seven 
private 
insurance companies have been 
authorized 
as 
well 
as 
44 
insurance brokers. 
The 
Sri 
Lanka 
Insurance 
Corporation 
(SLIC), 
which 
still 
dominates the 
market 
with 
about 
55 
percent 
of 
the 
industry’s 
assets, 
was 
privatized 
in 
April 
2003. 
This 
action, together 
with 
the 
earlier 
privatization 
of 
the 
National 
Insurance 
Corporation 
(NIC), 
created 
an 
insurance sector that 
is 
100 
percent 
privately 
owned. 
The 
three largest 
private 
insurers 
next 
to 
the 
SLIC 
account 
for 
about 
32 
percent 
and 
two 
foreign controlled 
insurance 
companies 
5 
percent 
of 
the 
industry’s 
assets. 
Compulsory 
15 
percent reinsurance 
to 
NIC 
by 
other 
companies 
on 
their 
fire 
and 
marine 
insurance contracts 
was 
abolished 
with 
the 
enactment 
of 
the 
new 
Insurance 
Law 
in 
August 
2000. 
Insurance 
companies are 
now 
free 
to 
reinsure 
with 
other 
domestic 
insurers 
or 
with 
foreign 
reinsurance companies. 
Foreign 
companies 
are 
allowed 
to 
operate 
in 
Sri 
Lanka 
in 
any 
form 
(branch, 
subsidiary, 
or 
joint 
venture) 
and 
restrictions 
on 
foreign 
ownership 
were 
fully 
relaxed. 
A 
new 
agency,

Board 
of

The

plans 
to 
introduce private 
management 
of 
the

a 
competitive

initially 
limited to

entire

some overseas 
investments 
in 
the 
medium-term 
could 
further 
increase

and performance. 
The 
Government 
has 
also 
decided 
to 
amalgamate the 
EPFBTF 
to 
improve 
the 
administration 
of 
these 
funds. 
A 
study 
will 
be 
launched 
in 
2003 
to 
review 
their 
current structure

of

Notwithstanding 
the 
successes 
with 
its 
privatization program 
so 
far 
in 
the 
agricultural 
and 
manufacturing 
sectors, 
Sri 
Lanka 
still 
has 
a 
significant 
number 
of 
large 
state-owned enterprises 
(SOEs) 
involved 
in 
many commercial 
activities, 
including 
utilities, 
transport, 
banking, petroleum, and 
the 
wholesale 
of 
basic 
commodities. 
Many 
of 
the 
SOEs 
and 
public 
departments 
producing 
goods and 
services have become unsustainable burdens 
on 
the 
public 
purse. 
Long 
delays 
in 
adjustments 
of 
administered prices and 
significant inefficiencies 
in 
SOE 
operations, 
particularly 
in 
the energy 
sector, 
have been a 
major 
drag 
on 
the economy and 
burden 
on 
the budget. 
The 
losses 
of 
SOEs 
equaled 
1.5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2000, 
and the budgetary 
(recurrent and 
capital) 
transfers 
to 
SOEs 
amounted 
to 
3 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2001. 
SOEs 
have also been unable 
to 
deliver 
reliable 
and 
affordable 
goods and 
services demanded 
by 
citizens, 
particularly 
in 
utilities 
where 
the 
SOEs 
have enjoyed 
monopoly 
positions. 
To 
tackle 
the 
SOE 
sector 
problems 
and 
mobilize 
resources, 
there 
is 
commitment 
to 
continuing 
the 
privatizution 
program 
in 
most commercial 
a~tivities,~ 
and the 
Government 
is 
in 
the process 
of 
restructuring 
some 
of 
the 
large 
SOEs 
in 
utilitiedinfrastructure 
to 
improve 
their efficiency/financial 
performance, 
as 
well 
as 
to 
introduce 
private 
sector 
participation in 
infrastructure.

Ceylon Electricity 
Board 
(CEB) 
and 
Ceylon 
Petroleum 
Corporation 
(CPC), 
there 
is 
determination 
to 
continue 
reforms 
in 
the 
energy 
sector. 
In 
petroleum, 
the 
Government 
started 
implementing 
an automatic 
price 
adjustment 
formula 
in 
January 2002, 
which 
allows 
for 
monthly 
adjustments 
in 
petroleum 
and diesel 
prices according 
to 
changes 
in 
international 
prices 
(taking 
Singapore 
prices 
as 
reference). 
Steps are 
being 
taken 
to 
open 
the 
importation, distribution, 
and 
retail 
activities 
to 
the 
private 
sector.  Some 
of 
the 
assets 
of 
CPC 
are 
being 
divested. 
The 
Indian 
Oil 
Company 
(IOC) 
has 
purchased 
100 
of 
the 
300 
filling 
stations 
owned 
by 
CPC; 
(currently, 
the 
private 
sector 
owns 
600 
filling 
stations). 
The 
IOC 
will 
also 
be 
free 
to 
supply 
all 
privately owned 
filling 
stations, 
thus 
ending CPC’s current 
monopoly 
over 
supplying 
all 
900 
gas 
stations. 
There 
are 
plans 
to 
spin 
off 
CPC’s 
infrastructure 
facilities 
(storage and 
distribution) 
and 
establish 
a 
separate 
(petroleum infrastructure) 
company 
in 
which 
a 
couple 
private 
companies 
would 
be 
allowed 
to 
purchase 
equity 
stake. 
Sri 
Lanka’s power 
sector 
has 
also 
faced 
serious 
difficulties 
in 
recent 
years, 
partly 
due 
to 
the 
ongoing 
structural problems 
and 
inefficiencies and 
partly 
due 
to 
external 
petroleum 
price 
shocks 
and 
the 
prolonged 
drought. 
In 
response, 
electricity tariffs 
were raised 
by 
38 
percent 
in 
April 
2002, 
and 
a 
significant 
reform 
program 
has 
been 
initiated 
aimed 
at 
restructuring 
CEB 
and 
promoting 
increased 
private-sector 
participation 
in 
generation 
under a 
sound 
regulatory framework 
(see 
Section 
111 
for 
further 
details).

bitter 
experience

rural 
areas. 
Despite 
its 
declining 
contribution 
to 
GDP 
(20 
percent 
in 
2000), 
the 
agricultural 
sector 
(including livestock 
and 
fisheries) 
remains 
vital for 
employment 
and 
income 
generation. 
Thus, 
fostering 
rapid rural 
development, 
particularly raising 
productivity 
and 
competitiveness 
in 
agriculture 
and 
non-farm 
rural 
sectors, 
is 
a 
critical 
element 
of 
achieving 
faster 
overall 
economic 
growth 
and 
poverty reduction 
in 
Sri 
Lanka. 
This 
is 
well 
recognized 
by 
the 
policy 
makers, and 
the PRS 
gives 
high 
priority to rural 
development. 
As 
noted 
earlier, 
measures 
are 
being 
taken 
to 
remove 
the 
key

About 
80

Sri 
Lanka 
has 
had 
good 
experience 
with 
privatization 
of 
SOEs 
in 
the 
plantation 
sector 
and 
manufacturing 
industries. 
Its 
ongoing privatization 
program-expanded 
in 
2002 
by 
including Sri 
Lanka 
Insurance 
Corporation (SLIC) and additional 
public 
stakes 
in 
Sri 
Lanka 
Telecom (SLT)--is 
being 
managed 
by 
Public 
Enterprise 
Reform 
Commission 
(PERC).  The 
program 
is 
on 
track. 
During 
the last 
10 
months, the Government sold: 
Pelwatte and Sevanagala 
Sugar 
Companies, 
Lanka 
Marine 
Services, 49 
percent stake 
in 
Shell 
Gas 
Lanka, certain 
cluster

companies, 
12

of 
the 
publicly 
held

of 
the 
SLT, 
and 
more recently 
90 
percent stake 
in 
SLIC 
(for 
over 
US$60 
million). 
Among 
these, 
SLT 
and 
SLIC 
are the largest

including 
the 
ongoing 
reforms 
in 
the 
labor

The 
other 
key 
elements 
of 
the 
strategy 
for 
promoting 
commercially 
oriented, 
efficient 
and productive 
agriculture include: 
(i) 
rationalizing 
the 
trade 
regime 
for 
agricultural 
outputs, 
inputs, 
and 
technology 
with 
the 
view 
to 
lowering 
the 
very 
high 
import 
protection 
rates 
and 
making 
the 
import 
tariff 
policy 
more 
predictable 
and transparent; 
(ii) 
gradually reducing 
public 
sector 
involvement 
in 
agricultural 
marketing; and 
(iii) 
supporting improvements 
in 
rural 
infrastructure--roads connecting 
to 
urban 
markets, 
rural 
electricity, 
water and sanitation, 
communications--to 
facilitate 
economic

is 
central 
to 
the 
PRS. 
Recognizing 
the 
backlog 
of 
needs 
in 
social 
services, 
the 
intention 
is 
to 
promote a 
growing 
private 
sector 
role 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
education and 
health 
services. 
This 
would 
allow public 
resources 
to 
be 
directed 
towards 
improving 
access 
and service 
quality 
in 
the 
poor 
areas. 
In 
education, 
the 
focus 
will 
be 
on: 
addressing 
regional inequities 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
quality 
basic education; 
improving 
the 
curricula 
in 
secondary education; 
and, 
in 
tertiary 
education, 
on 
enhancing the relevance 
of 
tertiary 
education 
in 
line 
with 
the 
market 
needs, 
increasing capacity 
by 
opening 
the 
tertiary 
education 
sector 
to 
the 
private 
sector, 
and 
reforming 
education finance. 
In 
the 
healthhutrition 
area, 
the 
principal 
strategic goals are 
to 
improve nutritional 
status 
of 
infants, 
children 
and 
pregnant 
women, 
prevention 
of 
non-communicable 
diseases, 
prevention 
and 
control 
of 
malaria 
and 
HIV/AIDS. 
In 
health 
care, 
the 
main 
focus 
will 
be 
on 
preventive 
programs, 
while 
the 
private 
sector 
will 
be 
encouraged 
to further 
develop 
the 
secondary 
and tertiary 
care 
private 
hospitals. 
Sri 
Lanka’ 
s 
long-standing 
strengths 
in 
social 
mobilization 
will 
be capitalized 
on 
to 
rely 
on 
community-based organizations 
to 
expand 
the 
provision 
of 
safe 
drinking 
water 
and sanitation 
services 
in 
rural 
areas 
under 
a 
sustainable system 
of 
tariff 
setting 
and 
maintenance. 
In 
urban 
areas, 
the 
private 
sector 
will 
be encouraged 
to 
play 
an 
increasing 
role 
in

activities.

the

system. 
Basic 
assistance 
and 
income 
support 
through 
well-targeted 
safety 
net 
programs 
would 
still 
be required 
for 
some 
chronically 
poor 
and 
disadvantaged groups 
as 
well 
as 
those 
who may 
require 
a temporary cushion 
from 
shocks. 
The 
major 
welfare system 
of 
Sri 
Lanka--the 
Samurdhi 
program--as 
it 
has 
existed 
during 
recent 
years 
has 
suffered 
from 
flaws 
in 
design that 
has 
led 
to 
enormous 
mis-targeting, 
which 
have 
considerably reduced 
its 
impact. 
A 
sizable component 
(80 
percent) 
of 
the 
Samurdhi 
program 
is 
a consumption 
grant 
in 
the 
form 
of 
food 
stamps 
to 
households. 
According 
to 
the 
findings 
of 
Bank’s 
recent 
Poverty 
Assessment 
study, 
the 
program 
misses about 
40 
percent 
of 
households 
ranked 
in 
the 
poorest 
quintile, 
while 
almost 
44 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
Samurdhi 
transfer 
budget 
is 
spent 
on 
households 
from 
the 
top 
3 
quintiles. Furthermore, 
targeting 
errors are 
not 
random, 
but 
rather 
reflect 
flaws 
in 
the 
design 
of 
the 
program 
(see 
Section 
I11 
below 
and 
Annex 
I1 
for 
details). 
Because 
the 
program 
covers 
around 
half 
of 
the 
population, 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
program 
on 
the 
poor 
is 
limited 
by 
the 
generally 
small 
size 
of 
the transfer. 
Recognizing 
the 
above, 
the 
Welfare 
Reform 
Act 
was 
enacted 
in 
September 
2002, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
firstly, rationalize 
all 
social welfare programs 
and, 
secondly, 
to 
de- 
politicize 
and 
improve 
the

of 
Samurdhi.

gender 
equality 
in 
the 
labor

protection 
of 
women’s 
rights 
are 
viewed 
as 
central 
to 
mainstreaming 
gender 
in 
anti-poverty efforts. 
In 
line 
with 
the 
Women’s Charter 
and the 
Women’s 
Manifesto, 
there are 
intentions 
to 
submit 
legislation 
that 
will 
reserve 
a 
certain 
percent 
of 
all 
seats 
in 
local 
and 
national 
elections 
for 
female 
candidates. 
A 
detailed 
analysis 
of 
gender 
bias 
in 
public 
services 
has 
been undertaken, and 
efforts 
are 
being 
strengthened 
to 
integrate 
gender 
into 
budgeting, personnel 
policies 
and 
program 
design. 
Other 
elements 
of 
the gender strategy, 
particularly 
those that 
address 
constraints 
faced 
by 
women 
in

include: 
(i) 
increased emphasis

Sri 
Lanka’s 
public 
administration 
was 
once 
the 
envy 
of 
the 
developing world, 
and 
its 
accomplishments 
in 
the 
years 
immediately 
after 
independence were 
impressive. 
However, 
its 
performance 
has 
degraded 
significantly 
over 
the 
past three 
decades. 
Stretching 
back 
to 
1987, 
successive 
administrative 
reforms 
commissions 
have 
identified 
a 
host 
of 
problems 
resulting 
in 
a 
steady 
erosion 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
service 
delivery, 
but 
efforts 
to 
reverse 
this 
trend 
have been 
elusive. 
Yet 
recent 
decisions 
demonstrate that the 
current Government 
is 
willing 
to 
make 
tough 
choices 
in 
pursuit 
of 
its 
administrative

agenda. 
To

Commission 
(PSC) 
in 
1972 
is 
widely 
credited 
with 
being 
a 
pivotal 
turning 
point 
in 
the 
decline 
of 
meritocracy 
and 
the 
rise 
of 
patronage-based 
recruitment. 
In 
recognition 
of 
this 
problem, 
the 17” 
Amendment 
to 
the 
Constitution 
was 
recently 
passed, 
which 
seeks 
to 
reestablish 
an independent

The new 
Commission 
members were 
appointed 
in 
late 
2002, and the 
new 
PSC 
began 
operation 
in 
January 2003. 
To 
further 
strengthen 
meritocracy 
and 
competitiveness 
within 
the

envisions 
adopting 
a 
policy 
of

is

In

there 
are 
significant 
overlaps 
between 
various 
layers 
of 
government, such 
as 
the 
central 
and 
provincial 
levels, 
leading 
to 
massive redundancies and 
inefficiencies. 
This 
problem 
is 
being 
targeted 
along 
a 
number 
of 
dimensions. 
In 
March 
2002, the 
Expenditure 
Reform 
Commission 
initiated 
a “zero 
based 
review” 
of 
public 
sector 
that 
will 
examine 
agency missions, objectives, programs, 
administrative 
structures 
and 
staffing 
with 
the 
goal 
of 
eliminating 
unnecessary 
functions

encouraging 
a 
consolidation 
of 
government 
departments 
and 
agencies 
to 
reduce overlap and 
duplication 
at 
all 
levels 
of 
the 
public

The 
PRS 
stipulates 
that every 
public

will 
be 
required 
to 
submit 
proposals 
for 
consolidation 
of 
functions 
within

to 
pronounced 
overstaffing. 
With 
a 
ratio 
of 
civil 
servants 
to 
per capital 
population 
of 
3.6 
per 
100, 
Sri 
Lanka 
has 
one 
of 
the 
most 
overstaffed 
public 
sectors 
in 
the 
developing 
world. 
The 
final 
report 
of 
the 
Salaries 
Commission 
for 
2002 
estimates that 
as 
many 
as 
30 
percent 
of 
the 
civil 
service 
positions 
could 
be eliminated. 
This

problem 
is 
being 
addressed 
through 
a 
hiring 
freeze that 
by 
all 
accounts 
appears 
to 
be 
effective. 
Vacant 
posts have been 
abolished and 
the 
contracting 
out 
of 
various support 
services, 
such 
as 
drivers 
is 
being 
explored. 
A 
draft 
civil 
service 
pension 
bill 
has 
recently been 
sent 
to 
Parliament 
that 
will 
help control 
pension expenditure 
by 
creating 
a 
funded 
system 
for 
new 
recruits6 
Finally, 
a 
major rightsizing 
exercise 
is 
being 
contemplated and 
the 
Bank 
has 
been approached 
for 
assistance 
in 
designing 
a 
Voluntary 
Retirement 
Scheme 
(VRS) 
for 
the 
civil 
service. 
So 
far 
the 
administration 
has 
successfully resisted pressure 
for 
an 
across-the-board increase 
in 
civil 
service 
salaries 
in 
the 
wake 
of 
the 
Salaries Commission 
report

in

for

in

In 
the

phase, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
move 
into 
a 
more 
transparent 
and consultative

through 
the 
preparation 
of 
a 
Medium

Budget 
Framework 
(MTBF), 
which 
aims 
to 
link 
three essential 
elements, 
i.e., 
the

and

Introduction 
of 
sectoral 
expenditure ceilings 
at 
the 
start 
of 
the 
2004 
budget preparation 
process, 
consistent 
with 
the 
MTBF, 
will 
be 
another 
important 
element 
for 
maintaining 
aggregate 
fiscal discipline 
and 
avoiding 
unrealistic 
and over-inflated 
budget 
submissions. 
Finally, 
there 
is 
a 
need 
to 
formulate 
an 
action 
plan to 
improve 
the 
monitoring 
of 
budget 
execution, 
involving both 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
and the 
Ministry 
of 
Policy 
Development 
and 
Implementation 
and 
gradually introduce 
a 
performance-orientation 
in 
budget 
management. 
The 
Government 
is 
following 
this 
path 
and 
has 
initiated 
improvements 
in 
the 
legal 
framework. 
In 
44. 
Overall 
publicfinancial 
management 
in 
Sri 
Lanka 
appears 
satisfactory, 
but 
a 
major effort 
is 
needed 
with 
respect 
to 
oversight 
aspects. 
Based 
on 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
recently 
completed 
Country 
Financial Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA), 
initiatives 
are 
being 
taken 
to 
strengthen 
public 
financial 
management 
and 
accountability 
by 
improving 
the independence 
of 
Department 
of 
the 
Auditor 
General, 
improving 
the 
legal 
framework 
for both 
internal 
and external 
audit, 
improving 
audit 
methodology, the 
transparency 
of 
public 
accounts and the responsiveness 
of 
the 
audit institutions 
to 
the 
Parliament 
and 
citizenry 
(see 
Section 
I11 
below 
and 
Annex 
IV 
for 
details 
on 
public 
financial 
management). 
Similarly, 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
Country 
Procurement 
Assessment 
Report 
(CPAR)- 
-which 
calls 
for 
a 
simplification 
of 
the 
regulatory framework 
for 
procurement, 
possibly through 
a 
new 
procurement law--are 
being 
reviewed.

Transparency, 
accountabilitv 
and improved sewice 
deliverv. 
For 
the 
medium 
term, 
there 
is 
a 
need 
to 
reduce the 
culture 
of 
secrecy that surrounds 
the 
workings 
of 
the 
civil 
service 
and 
enhance 
the 
transparency 
through 
which public 
sector business 
is 
conducted. 
Towards 
this 
end, 
a 
variety 
of 
approaches are 
under 
consideration, 
ranging 
from 
annual 
departmental reports 
and 
consultation 
with 
stakeholders 
to 
'access 
to 
information' 
legislation. 
As 
a 
part 
of 
its 
e-Lanka 
initiative, 
the 
Government 
is 
planning 
to 
use 
information 
technology and 
business 
process 
reengineering 
to 
streamline 
procedures and 
enhance 
service 
delivery. 
These 
measures 
will 
be 
combined 
with 
citizens 
charters, 
the 
development 
of 
"report 
cards" 
on 
government 
services 
by 
NGOs 
and 
civil 
society 
representatives, 
and other 
approaches 
to 
improve client 
orientation. 
New 
public 
service 
recruits 
will 
contribute 
8 
percent 
of 
their 
salaries 
to 
the 
fund, 
while 
the 
Govemment 
would 
contribute 
an 
additional 
12 
percent. 
' 
Preparations 
are 
underway--with 
support 
from 
the 
ADB--to 
introduce 
a 
medium-term 
expenditure 
framework. 
In 
addition, annual 
Public 
Expenditure 
Analysis 
--to 
be 
carried out 
jointly 
with 
the 
Govemment 
and 
the 
IMF--is 
an important 
element 
of 
the 
Bank's 
assistance 
program.

Discussions 
are 
currently 
underway 
between 
the 
Bank 
and 
the 
Government 
for 
assistance 
with 
a 
host 
of 
governance 
related 
activities 
under the 
Economic 
Reform 
Technical 
Assistance 
Project 
(Cr.3722- 
LE) 
approved 
in 
December 2002.  Areas under 
consideration 
include 
the 
design 
of 
a 
Voluntary 
Retirement 
Scheme 
(VRS) 
for 
the core 
civil 
service, 
including 
a legal, financial, 
economic, 
managerial 
and 
social 
assessment 
of 
the 
potential 
costs 
and benefits 
of 
such 
an approach. 
Particular attention 
would 
be 
devoted 
to 
ensuring 
the 
equity 
and cost-effectiveness 
of 
the 
scheme, 
as 
well 
as 
to avoiding 
problems 
of 
adverse 
selection 
(the 
best 
people 
leave the 
public 
sector) 
and 
moral 
hazard 
(staff 
who 
are 
let 
go 
re-enter 
the 
civil 
service 
or 
are 
brought back 
on 
contract).  Other 
areas 
include 
the 
creation 
of 
a computerized 
Human 
Resource 
database 
that 
will 
strengthen establishment 
control 
and 
provide 
accurate, 
real-time 
information 
on 
the size 
and 
scope 
of 
the 
civil 
service, 
as 
well 
as 
streamlining 
personnel rules 
and 
regulations and 
rationalizing 
systems 
for 
recruitment, performance review, 
promotion, 
transfer and 
discipline. 
The 
Bank 
may 
also 
provide 
support 
for identifying 
opportunities 
for 
administrative 
rationalization through 
the merger 
andor 
elimination 
of 
ministries 
and departments; 
for 
outsourcing; and 
for 
developing 
a 
communication 
strategy 
to 
explain 
the 
need 
for 
public 
sector 
reform. 
Furthermore, 
the 
World 
Bank 
Institute 
(WBI) 
is 
helping 
to 
strengthen 
public 
accounts 
and 
parliamentary 
committees, 
focusing 
on 
the 
oversight 
role 
of

in

which 
support 
rural 
livelihoods, agricultural 
development and 
a 
tourism 
industry 
is 
critical for 
Sri 
Lanka’s economic 
growth.  However, 
the 
country 
also 
has 
one 
of 
the 
highest 
population 
densities 
in 
the 
world 
(280 people 
per 
sq.km.) 
and 
efforts 
to 
improve 
living 
standards 
are 
creating heavy 
pressure 
on 
the 
natural 
environment. 
The 
elephant, 
an internationally 
recognized 
symbol 
of 
Sri 
Lanka, 
is 
losing 
its 
traditional 
habitats and human-elephant 
conflict 
is 
now 
a 
serious 
problem 
in 
several 
areas. 
To 
help 
deal 
with 
issues 
such 
as 
these, 
legislation 
is 
in 
place 
for 
the 
protection 
of 
coastal 
areas 
and 
natural 
reserves, 
and also 
for 
environmental impact 
assessment 
(EIA) 
of 
major 
development activities. 
The 
EL4 
requirements 
of 
the 
Government 
are 
in 
line 
with 
international 
practice 
and 
generally 
consistent 
with 
the Bank‘s 
own 
policies8 
and 
a 
six-year 
program 
of 
World 
Bank 
support 
to 
environmental capacity-building 
under 
the 
Environmental 
Action 
Project 
(closing 
in 
December 
2003) 
has 
helped--along 
with 
support 
from 
other 
donors--in 
improving 
implementation 
of 
the requirements. 
Given 
also 
good 
public 
awareness 
and active 
NGOs, 
a 
solid 
basis 
now 
exists 
for 
a 
sound 
environmental 
management 
system 
to 
meet 
the challenges 
of 
accelerated 
private 
sector-led 
growth. 
To 
make 
this 
happen, 
the 
Government 
needs 
to 
continue 
strengthening 
its 
environmental 
management capacity. 
As 
a 
major 
step 
to 
increase the effectiveness 
of 
environmental 
regulation 
and 
enforcement 
and 
in 
line with 
broader 
decentralization 
process, 
the 
Government

to

a 
sound 
foundation 
for 
the 
Bank‘s 
assistance. 
The 
PRS 
candidly 
lists 
the 
causes 
of 
poverty.  Aside 
from 
the 
civil

it 
correctly identifies 
the

have 
inhibited 
the

of 
the domestic

and 
rural 
economy 
as 
principal 
causes 
of 
Sri 
Lanka’s

It 
also acknowledges that the heavy 
involvement 
of 
the 
state 
in 
commercial activities 
has 
constrained 
private

the 
recognition 
that the

are some 
weaknesses

have been subject to considerable 
public 
consultation

The 
latter 
is 
to be 
achieved through 
greater 
public 
expenditure devoted 
to 
human 
resource development 
and infrastructure. 
The 
PRS 
also 
calls 
for 
smaller and better 
targeted safety 
net 
programs. 
Given 
the 
large 
public 
debt 
and 
the 
tight fiscal 
situation, 
the PRS 
correctly 
indicates 
that the pace 
at 
which 
the 
reform 
agenda 
can be 
implemented 
depends 
on 
the 
fiscal 
space 
that 
can 
be 
created 
by 
economic growth, 
the 
restoration 
of 
peace, 
macroeconomic 
stability 
and

specifically: 
This 
said, 
the 
JSA 
points 
out 
a 
number 
of 
areas 
in 
which 
the PRS 
could 
be 
strengthened; 
there 
is 
nothing 
with 
regard 
to 
institutionalizing 
a 
public 
sector 
tracking 
system; 
although 
there 
is 
a comprehensive 
picture 
of 
the patterns 
and 
determinants 
of 
poverty, 
further 
work 
is 
warranted 
to 
monitor 
and 
assess 
the 
impact 
of 
current and 
future 
fiscal 
policies 
on 
the poor; 
the 
poverty 
diagnostics 
for 
the 
North 
East 
is 
inadequate 
and 
needs 
to 
be improved; 
and 
there 
is 
a 
need 
to 
enhance 
institutional 
arrangements 
to 
coordinate 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
and 
promote 
incentives 
for 
its 
use 
in

and budgetary decision-making.

to 
measuring, analyzing, 
monitoring 
and evaluating 
poverty

outcomes. 
It 
is 
recommended that 
the 
first 
annual 
progress 
report 
of 
the 
PRS 
include: 
(i) 
an update 
of 
the macroeconomic 
framework 
and 
prioritization 
of 
policies aligned 
to 
a 
detailed 
costing 
of 
the 
PRS 
agenda; 
(ii) 
addressing 
critical 
issues 
in 
the governance 
agenda, 
especially 
in 
civil 
service 
reform, 
transparency 
and 
decentralization; 
(iii) 
a selection 
of 
indicators 
and baselines 
to 
monitor 
PRS 
implementation 
and 
setting 
up 
an 
expenditure 
tracking 
system; 
(iv) 
a 
preliminary 
assessment 
of 
the

on 
the 
poor

achieve an 
economic performance 
commensurate 
with 
its 
human 
and 
natural 
resources. 
In 
tandem 
with 
the 
implementation 
of 
this 
credible 
reform 
program 
and the 
positive 
developments 
in 
the 
peace process, 
Sri 
Lanka’s medium-term 
prospects 
for 
higher 
GDP 
growth 
and 
sustained 
fiscal 
and 
external 
sustainability have 
improved 
recently. 
A 
healthy 
economic 
revival 
and 
higher 
economic 
growth 
should 
result 
from 
the sustained 
fiscal 
consolidation 
and 
successful 
implementation 
of 
the 
growth-focused 
structural 
reform 
program, 
along 
with 
improving 
investor 
sentiments. 
Also, 
the 
expected 
pick-up 
in 
reconstruction activities 
in 
the 
North-East 
and 
increasing 
trade 
between 
the 
North-East 
and 
the rest 
of 
the 
country, 
as 
well 
as 
improvements 
in 
the 
power 
supply, and 
recovery 
in 
agriculture 
and 
services 
should 
contribute 
to 
the anticipated 
stronger 
macroeconomic performance. 
Looking 
ahead, 
Sri 
Lanka 
has 
a great

recovery 
in 
the 
GDP 
growth 
rate, 
Sri 
Lanka 
could 
achieve 
around 
7 
percent 
GDP 
growth 
with 
single 
digit 
inflation 
in 
the medium-term, 
as 
also 
projected 
by 
the PRS 
(see 
Table 
3 
and 
Box 
4). 
Regarding 
the 
fiscal 
outlook, 
sustained 
implementation 
of 
the 
program, 
together 
with 
higher 
GDP 
growth, 
would 
lead to 
gradual 
reduction 
of 
the 
budget 
deficit 
and 
of 
the 
public 
debt 
towards 
sustainable 
levels. 
This 
would 
also 
create 
increasingly more 
fiscal 
space 
for 
high 
priority 
poverty 
programs. 
Thus, 
if 
peace 
holds 
and 
the 
stabilization 
and structural 
reform 
program 
stays 
on 
track, 
after 
a

As 
noted 
earlier 
(paragraph 24), there are 
downside 
risks 
to 
the robustness 
of 
Sri 
Lanka’s 
medium-term 
macroeconomic framework, 
given 
the 
tight fiscal 
situation, the 
fragile 
peace 
process, 
and 
the 
vulnerabilities 
to 
external 
shocks. 
A 
weak implementation 
of 
the 
budgetary revenue 
measures 
(detailed 
in 
paragraph 
23) and/or 
a 
failure 
to 
withstand 
pressures 
to 
increase 
expenditures 
beyond 
prudent 
levels 
could 
undermine efforts 
to 
restore 
fiscal 
sustainability. 
A 
derailment 
in 
the 
peace 
process 
and/or 
a 
deterioration 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
situation 
also 
constitute 
major 
downside 
risks 
to 
this 
medium-term 
outlook.  However, 
as 
elaborated 
above, 
the 
Government 
is 
determined 
to

Resource 
requirements. 
During 
the 
next 
several 
years 
Sri 
Lanka 
will 
need substantial 
financial 
resources 
to 
continue 
implementing 
its 
comprehensive 
economic 
reform 
program, 
undertake the 
priority 
PRS programs, 
help 
support 
the 
acceleration 
of 
economic 
growth 
and investment, and 
increase 
official 
reserves 
to 
prudent levels (Table 
3). 
Preliminary 
estimates 
indicate 
that 
during 
2003-2006, 
Sri 
Lanka’s 
additional 
external 
financing 
needs 
would 
average about 
US$0.4 
billion 
a 
year 
(in 
the 
range 
1.3-2.3 
percent 
of 
GDP 
annually). 
In 
view 
of 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
stabilization 
and 
structural 
reform 
program 
and 
demonstrated 
commitment 
to 
reforms, 
as 
well 
as 
the successful 
peace process, 
new 
concessional 
assistance 
from 
donors 
is 
likely to 
meet 
the external 
financing 
gap 
in 
the 
medium-term. 
The 
IMF 
is 
expected 
to 
provide 
about 
US$560 
million 
under 
the 
PRGF-EFF 
arrangement, and the 
Asian 
Development 
Bank’s 
(ADB) 
total 
support 
would 
be 
about 
US$400 
million 
(with 
US$200 
million 
in 
balance 
of 
payments 
support), 
and the 
bilateral 
donors--particularly 
Japan, 
U.S.A., 
Germany, and 
Kuwaiti 
and Saudi Funds--are 
likely 
to 
contribute 
about 
US$70 
million 
annually 
in 
program 
support.

Potential 
Sources 
of 
Economic 
Growth 
Supply-side. 
In 
the 
short- to medium-term, 
Sri 
Lanka’s 
prospects 
for 
strong economic 
recovery 
and 
higher 
growth 
are 
good. 
Already 
the economy 
is 
experiencing 
increasingly 
strong 
recovery 
from 
the 
dismal 
level 
recorded 
in 
2001, 
but 
this 
is 
not 
unexpected. 
The 
cessation 
of 
hostilities 
and 
strongly 
positive 
developments 
in 
the 
peace 
process have created 
a post-conflict 
spurt 
in 
economic 
activity 
that 
is 
generally 
observed 
in 
similar 
situations. 
In 
addition, 
the 
improved 
political 
environment, 
the 
retum 
of 
normal 
rains, 
the 
increased 
power 
supply, 
the 
improving 
macroeconomic 
situation, 
and 
the 
(credible) ongoing 
structural 
reform program 
all 
appear 
to 
have 
also 
boosted 
the 
recovery 
of 
domestic economic 
activity, particularly 
in 
services. 
Reconstruction 
activities 
and economic 
revival 
in 
the 
North-East 
will 
boost 
overall growth 
performance. 
Agricultural 
production 
is 
expected to 
retum 
to 
its 
trend 
levels 
in 
the 
near-term, 
and 
then 
pick 
up 
further 
in 
the 
medium-term 
with 
the 
removal 
of 
policy 
distractions 
in 
input, 
output, 
and 
technology 
markets, 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
more 
stable trade 
regime 
in 
agriculture, 
and 
the 
reform 
of 
land 
and 
labor 
markets 
(see 
Annex 
I11 
for 
a 
detailed 
coverage 
of 
the 
core 
agricultural 
issues 
and 
on 
the 
ongoing/future 
measures 
to 
address 
these). 
The 
ongoing structural 
reforms--in 
the 
factor 
markets, 
economically 
sound 
energy 
pricing, 
further 
import 
tariff 
rationalization, 
the 
enabling commercial 
legal 
environment, 
steps 
towards 
lower 
and 
uniform 
income taxation, 
restructuring/privatization 
in 
the 
SOE 
sector, 
and 
public 
sector--as 
well 
as 
improvements 
in 
infrastructure 
should contribute 
towards 
more 
efficient 
resource 
allocation 
and 
lead 
to 
productivity 
gains. 
These 
developments 
should have 
deep 
and 
lasting 
effects 
on 
the 
resource 
allocation 
efficiency 
and 
productivity 
in 
the 
economy, 
lowering production 
costs, 
enhancing domestic 
competition 
and 
intemational 
competitiveness, 
and 
encouraging 
private 
investment. 
As 
elaborated 
in 
the 
PRS, 
in 
the 
medium-term, 
aside 
from 
agriculture, 
service sectors 
(tourism, financial 
services, wholesale/retail 
trade, transport, 
particularly port 
activities), construction, 
offsfarm 
rural 
activities, 
and 
manufacturing 
industries 
are 
expected 
to 
show 
stronger 
growth 
performance, 
with 
improved productivity 
and 
rising 
private 
(and complementary 
public) 
investment. 
Small 
and 
medium-scale 
enterprises 
(SMEs), 
which 
account 
for 
about 
90 
percent 
of 
industrial 
establishments 
and 
70 
percent 
of 
employment 
in 
the 
manufacturing, 
would 
benefit 
from 
improved 
business 
environment 
and 
be 
induced 
by 
structural reforms 
to 
increase 
their 
scale 
of 
operation 
and 
employment 
levels. 
There 
are 
also 
expected 
to 
be 
significant 
spill-over 
effects 
on 
productivity 
and 
efficiency 
from 
the 
expansion 
of 
IT 
industriedactivities, which 
are 
themselves expected 
to 
be 
important growth 
areas. 
Demand-side. 
On 
the 
demand-side, 
higher 
economic 
growth would 
be supported 
by 
an 
expanding 
household consumption 
demand, 
increasing 
private 
investment 
as 
well 
as 
rising 
public 
investment 
in 
social 
and 
physical 
infrastructure, 
which would 
be 
supported 
by 
donor 
assistance. 
It 
is 
expected that 
the 
investment/GDP 
ratio would 
increase 
by 
over 
six 
percentage 
points 
of 
GDP 
during 
the 
next four 
years. 
Helped by diversification 
and 
productivity 
gains, merchandise 
exports 
are 
also 
expected 
to 
expand, despite 
some 
(moderate) 
setback 
that 
might 
be caused 
by 
the 
removal 
of 
the 
MFA 
quotas. 
Adjustment 
to 
the removal 
of 
MFA 
quotas. 
Exports 
of 
garmentskextiles account 
for 
more 
than 
50 
percent 
of 
Sri 
Lanka’s 
merchandise 
exports. 
And 
the 
share 
in 
manufacturing 
value-added 
of 
the 
latter two 
categories, 
together 
with 
the 
leather 
products, 
is 
about 
40 
percent, 
and 
they account 
for 
just 
over 
5 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
The 
elimination 
of 
the 
MFA 
quotas 
by 
2005 
might lower 
Sri 
Lanka’s garmenthextile 
exports 
as 
China 
and 
other 
large competitors 
such 
as 
India 
expand 
their 
exports. 
However, 
the 
adverse 
impact 
on 
Sri 
Lanka 
is 
likely 
to be 
moderate 
given 
that 
most 
of 
the 
exports 
are 
carried out 
by 
10-1 
1 
large 
companies 
which 
have 
already 
started 
taking 
steps 
to 
further 
enhance 
their 
competitiveness. 
Also, 
most medium-size 
firms 
are 
expected 
to 
merge 
to 
improve 
their 
readiness 
for 
the 
post-quota period. However, 
small, 
mostly 
sub-contracting 
firms 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
adversely 
affected. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
critical 
importance 
of 
the 
apparels 
production 
and 
exports, 
the 
Govemment 
recently 
created 
a 
committee 
with 
a 
mandate 
to 
assess 
the 
likely 
impact 
of 
the 
removal 
of 
garmenthextile 
quotas and 
develop 
a 
strategy 
to 
contain 
the 
adverse 
impacts. 
The 
committee 
has 
made 
recommendations 
to enhance 
competitiveness 
through worker 
training, 
development 
of 
industry infrastructure, 
and 
the 
adoption 
of 
modem technology. 
The 
ongoing 
structural 
reforms should 
also 
help 
in 
the 
reduction 
of 
production 
costs.

would

maintain 
a 
prudent 
fiscal 
policy 
stance 
and a sound 
overall 
macroeconomic 
framework, 
particularly 
given 
the 
country’s 
enormous 
public 
debt 
burden 
and 
very 
limited 
fiscal 
space; 
(ii) 
manage 
and respond 
to 
the 
heightened 
aspirations 
for 
greater 
employment and 
higher 
income

given 
the 
last 
two 
decades 
of 
missed opportunities 
and 
pent-up

create 
adequate

the 
PRSP’s 
priority

the 
North 
and 
East, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
all 
other 
hitherto 
disadvantaged 
regions 
of 
the 
country. 
Given 
these 
country 
circumstances, 
for 
the 
PRS 
to 
be 
successfully 
implemented, 
increased 
financial 
and 
other 
support 
from 
donors 
would 
be 
needed, 
as 
noted 
earlier. 
As 
highlighted 
earlier, 
in 
implementing 
Sri 
Lanka’s 
PRS, 
there 
will 
be 
major 
challenges to: 
(i) 
B. 
Design 
58. 
The 
proposed 
program 
for 
PRSC 
I 
is 
a 
part 
of 
an integrated, 
four-year 
program 
involving 
a 
series 
of 
four 
operations that 
would provide financial 
support 
on 
an annual 
basis 
to 
help 
implementation 
of 
the 
PRS 
program 
and 
enhance 
poverty-orientation 
of 
public 
expenditures 
(see 
the 
Policy 
Matrix 
in 
Annex 
I). 
While 
paying 
attention 
to 
the 
complementarities 
within 
the 
whole 
PRS 
program 
and 
coordinating 
with 
the 
IMF’s 
PRGF-EFF 
operation, the proposed 
credit 
will 
support the 
implementation 
of 
the 
key 
structural 
reforms 
in 
areas 
where the 
Bank 
has 
been 
involved 
for 
some 
time 
in 
terms 
assessments 
and 
policy 
dialogue. 
Specific 
areas 
include: 
the 
factor and 
energy markets; the 
rural 
sector; 
the 
welfare 
system; 
and 
governance 
in 
the 
public 
sector, 
including 
the 
public 
expenditure 
management, 
public 
financial 
accountability, 
and environmental 
management.  Progress 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the PRS 
will 
be 
monitored, 
including 
the 
shifts 
in 
the 
poverty 
focus 
of 
public 
expenditures, 
and appropriate triggers 
will 
be 
relied 
on 
to 
initiate 
subsequent 
phases 
of 
the 
PRSC 
program. 
59. 
first 
credit, 
PRSC 
I, 
would 
support the 
continuation 
and, 
in 
some 
cases, 
launching 
of 
structural reforms 
in 
the 
key 
areas, 
including 
public 
actions that 
will 
create 
flexibility 
and foster 
efficiency 
in 
the 
labor 
and 
land 
markets, strengthen the 
financial 
market, 
reform 
the 
power 
sector, 
and strengthen governance 
in 
the 
public 
sector 
as 
cited 
above. 
The 
emphasis 
on 
factor 
markets 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
PRS 
priorities 
and 
with 
the 
long-standing 
view 
shared 
by 
the Government, 
the 
private 
sector, researchers, 
and donors that 
Sri 
Lanka could 
achieve 
higher 
growth 
by 
addressing the 
policy-induced 
constraints 
to 
private 
sector 
activity, 
including 
the 
rigidities 
in 
labor 
and 
land 
markets, 
inefficiencies resulting 
from 
public 
sector 
presencehterventions 
in 
the 
banking 
and 
energy 
sectors. 
It 
is 
envisaged that the 
PRSC 
I1 
would follow 
in 
2004 
and 
PRSC 
I11 
in 
2005. 
They 
would 
continue supporting 
the 
ongoing and 
new 
structural 
reforms 
and 
their 
implementation. 
PRSC 
I1 
and 
PRSC 
I11 
would 
also 
expand 
the 
program’s 
coverage 
of 
the 
ongoing 
reform 
initiatives, 
particularly 
in 
the 
area 
of 
Sri 
Lanka’ 
s 
over-extended 
and 
inefficient 
welfare 
system, 
and 
in 
the 
policy/institutional 
environment 
critical to 
reinvigorating 
the 
rural 
economy 
on 
which 
80 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
rely 
for 
their livelihoods, 
including 90 
percent 
of 
the 
country’s poor. 
The 
findings 
of 
the 
Development 
Policy 
Review 
(DPR) 
that 
is 
planned 
for 
FY04 
will 
help 
determine 
additional 
reform 
areas 
to 
support 
for 
the 
PRSC-IV 
in 
2006. 
The 
time 
horizon 
of 
the proposed 
PRSC 
series 
overlaps 
with 
the PRSP 
and 
CAS 
periods. 
This 
60. 
It 
is 
important 
to

with 
the

World

has 
undertaken 
major 
steps 
towards 
restoring 
fiscal

with 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
PRS: 
The 
PRSC 
I 
--as 
well 
as 
the 
subsequent 
PRSCs--is 
structured around 
two 
principal 
components 
0 
0 
Accelerating 
economic 
growth 
and 
supporting 
private 
sector 
development; 
and 
strengthening 
governance 
in 
the 
public 
sector 
and 
improving 
the 
welfare 
system. 
63. 
These 
two 
components 
aim 
to 
enhance 
the effectiveness 
of 
the 
overall 
strategy 
for 
poverty 
reduction. 
The 
first 
component 
reflects 
thefundamental  importance 
Sri 
Lanka 
is 
giving 
to 
the 
promotion 
of 
strong private-sector 
led 
growth 
in 
its 
economic development 
and 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy. 
And 
the 
second 
component aims 
to 
help 
address 
the 
key 
weaknesses 
in 
the 
public 
administration 
(described 
in 
the 
above section) and 
public 
expenditure 
management 
(PEM). 
The latter 
is 
also recognized 
as 
a 
top 
priority 
challenge, 
which 
sees 
improved institutional 
capacity 
for 
effective 
policy 
formulation 
and 
PEM 
as 
essential prerequisites 
for 
the successful 
implementation 
of 
the 
PRS. 
This 
would 
enable the 
public 
sector 
to 
assume 
its 
changing 
role 
effectively 
as 
a 
facilitator 
of 
private 
sector-led 
growth 
and 
creator 
of 
opportunities 
for 
the 
poor. 
64. 
There 
is 
a 
long-standing 
and 
broad 
consensus 
among the public 
sector, 
the private 
sector, 
donors, 
and the 
observershesearchers 
that 
Sri 
Lunka's 
economy 
could grow 
faster and generate 
higher 
employment 
if 
the 
existing factor market 
distortions 
and 
power 
sector 
inefficiencies 
are 
addressed 
effectively.' 
Indeed, 
various 
private 
sector 
groups have 
been 
all 
along 
complaining 
about the 
highly 
restrictive 
labodland 
markets and 
the 
inefficiencies 
in 
the 
commercial 
banking 
and 
power 
sectors 
caused 
by 
public 
sector 
interference 
and the 
dominance 
of 
SOEs. 
The 
chambers 
of 
commerce and 
industries 
have 
been 
asking 
for 
reforms 
in 
the factors markets 
and 
in 
the 
enabling 
business 
environment 
to 
foster 
private 
sector 
development and 
investment." 
The 
PRS 
has 
correctly 
identified 
these 
areas 
as 
the 
priority 
reform 
areas 
in 
pursuit 
of 
private 
sector-led growth. 
The 
Bank 
fully 
agrees 
with 
these 
reform 
priorities.  Accordingly, 
within 
the 
context 
of 
an 
integrated 
medium-term 
program 
and 
consistent 
with 
the 
PRS 
priorities, 
PRSC 
I 
as 
well 
as 
subsequent 
PRSCs 
would 
support 
public 
actions 
that 
have 
been recently 
undertaken 
and 
those 
future 
follow-up 
actions that 
will 
be 
undertaken 
to 
reform 
the 
factor 
markets (labor, 
land, 
and financial), 
the 
power 
sector, 
the 
enabling 
business 
environment, 
and 
the 
rural 
economy. 
Under 
the 
second 
component, the 
key 
actions 
that 
are 
to 
be 
supported 
include 
reforms: 
in 
the 
welfare 
system, 
in 
the 
public 
administration 
(civil 
service) and 
institutional 
dimensions 
of 
public 
expenditure 
management, 
and 
in 
public financial 
management/accountability 
and 
fiduciary 
capacity.

reduction. 
As 
assessed 
and 
analyzed 
in 
detail 
in 
Sri 
Lanka: 
A 
Fresh Look 
at 
Unemplovment 
(see 
paragraph 
103), 
the 
labor market 
in 
Sri 
Lanka 
suffers 
from 
considerable segmentation, 
which 
is 
reflected 
in 
the 
large 
wage 
premium 
provided 
in 
the 
‘formal’ 
sector 
and 
in 
public 
sector 
jobs. 
These wage 
differentials 
are 
artificial 
and 
result 
from 
a 
policy 
environment 
that 
provides protection 
to 
certain 
segments 
of 
the 
labor 
market, 
including: 
(i) 
the 
formal 
labor 
market, 
which 
benefits 
from 
very 
stringent 
job 
security regulations; 
(ii) 
certain product 
markets that 
are 
protected 
by 
tariffs; 
and 
(iii) 
the 
public 
sector 
that 
offers preferential employment 
and 
pay 
treatment. 
Sri 
Lankan 
workers 
in 
the protected 
sectors 
earn 
between 34-100 percent 
more 
than 
those 
in 
unprotected 
sectors, 
with 
the 
premium 
being 
highest 
in 
the 
public 
sector. 
In 
the 
public 
sector, 
despite 
job 
security and 
a generous 
pension 
system, 
employees 
in 
the 
lower 
levels enjoy 
the 
largest 
premiums 
due 
to public 
sector 
pay 
policies, 
which 
tend 
to 
be 
shaped 
by 
high 
salary increases 
recommended 
by 
the ‘Salaries 
Commissions’. 
Issues. 
A 
well 
functioning 
labor 
market 
is 
a 
pre-requisite 
for 
economic 
growth 
and 
poverty 
67. 
With 
respect 
to 
the 
formal 
sector, 
which 
covers 
firms 
with 
15 
or 
more 
employees, 
Sri 
Lanka 
has 
had 
one 
of 
the 
most 
stringent 
job 
security regulations 
in 
the 
world, restricting and 
segmenting the 
country’s 
labor 
market.  There 
is 
ample 
evidence that 
this 
rather 
rigid 
and 
outdated 
labor legislation 
(and 
the 
resulting 
high 
unit 
labor 
costs 
in 
the 
formal 
sector) 
has 
discouraged 
domestidforeign 
private 
investment, 
inhibited 
the 
graduation 
of 
small 
enterprises 
from 
the 
informal 
private 
sector, 
and constrained 
employment 
generation. 
Jobs 
in 
the 
formal 
labor market 
are 
subject 
to 
collective 
bargaining. 
Tripartite 
‘Wage 
Boards’, 
consisting 
of 
delegates 
from 
the 
major 
labor 
unions, 
private 
employers, and the 
Commissioner 
of 
Labor, 
set 
minimum 
wages 
for 
each 
skill 
level 
by 
sector. 
Interference 
by 
politicians 
in 
the 
collective bargaining 
process 
and 
in 
wage 
board 
decisions 
have 
encouraged 
labor 
unions 
to 
develop 
political affiliation 
over 
the 
years 
and 
to 
take 
militant 
agendas. 
Today, 
Sri 
Lanka 
has 
a 
large number 
of 
small 
trade 
unions 
with 
considerable leverage. 
68. 
Currently, 
employers cannot easily 
adjust 
their 
work 
force 
to 
normal 
business 
cycles due 
to 
the 
restrictions 
enshrined 
in 
the 
Termination 
of 
Employment 
of 
Workmen 
Act 
(TEWA-1971) 
and 
the 
ZndustriaE 
Disputes 
Act 
(1950). 
The 
TEWA 
applies 
to 
private 
sector 
firms 
with 
15 
or 
more 
employees. 
Under 
the 
TEWA, 
the 
termination 
of 
any 
worker’s 
service 
is 
only 
possible 
with 
prior 
written 
consent 
of 
the 
Commissioner 
of 
Labor 
or 
the 
employee 
concerned. 
The 
Commissioner 
has 
the 
discretion 
to 
accept 
21 
Page  28
or 
reject a 
firm’s 
application 
to 
terminate 
an 
employee 
and, 
moreover, 
has 
the 
prerogative 
to 
determine 
the exact 
compensation 
to 
be 
paid. 
The 
process 
is 
non-transparent, 
as 
neither 
the act 
nor 
any other 
regulation 
defines the 
minimum 
compensation that a 
laid-off 
worker 
is 
entitled 
to. 
Each 
application 
for 
lay-off 
is 
considered 
individually which 
has 
led 
to 
discrepant awards. 
In 
addition, 
the 
dispute resolution 
process 
takes 
several months and sometimes 
even 
years, 
during 
which 
time 
the 
firm 
has 
to 
continue 
paying 
the salary 
of 
its 
redundant 
worker. 
69. 
showed that 
97 
percent employed 
less 
than 
15 
workers 
implying 
that 
economies 
of 
scale 
in 
both 
agriculture 
and 
industry 
were 
probably 
not 
realized. 
Firms 
with 
15 
or 
more 
employees have become 
reluctant 
to 
hire 
additional 
workers 
and instead 
preferred 
to 
employ 
contractual workers 
who 
have 
no 
protection 
under 
the 
law. 
Thus, 
the 
law 
protects about 
1 
million 
formal 
workers, 
but 
has 
failed 
to 
protect 
over 7 
million 
contractual or 
casual workers. 
It 
has 
also 
prompted 
businesses 
to 
close 
down 
completely 
to 
avoid carrying 
costs 
indefinitely 
instead 
of 
merely downsizing 
or 
forced them 
to 
accept 
larger 
losses 
in 
business 
downturns.” 
The 
response 
to 
this 
in 
the past 
has 
been 
to rely on public 
sector 
employment 
at 
increasing 
costs 
and create enclaves such 
as 
the 
free 
trade 
zones 
that 
circumvent 
local 
labor laws. 
This 
legislation 
has 
discouraged 
small 
firms 
from 
expanding.

hiring 
policies, and 
by 
tackling 
the 
long-standing 
issue 
of 
the 
inflexible 
labor 
legislation. 
In 
the near-term, the 
main 
focus 
is 
on 
the latter. 
The 
Factories Ordinance 
has 
been 
amended 
to 
liberalize 
the 
practice 
for 
overtime, 
especially 
for 
female 
workers, 
in 
line 
with 
international 
norms. 
In 
order 
to 
limit 
the 
Labor 
Commissioner’s 
role 
and 
discretion 
in 
labor 
disputes 
the 
so 
called 
‘4-3-2’ 
formula 
has 
recently 
been 
introduced. 
Under 
this 
formula, a 
4-month 
limit 
has 
been 
established 
to 
settle 
a 
labor tribunal 
case, 
a 
3-month 
limit 
for 
an arbitration 
case, 
and 
a 
2-month 
limit 
to 
decide 
on 
appropriate remuneration 
for 
a terminated worker. 
It 
is 
important 
that 
these 
arrangements 
are 
confirmed 
by 
legislative 
changes 
(see 
below). 
These 
legislative 
amendments 
will 
liberalize 
the 
labor 
market 
and reduce the 
involvement 
of 
the 
Labor 
Commissioner. 
However, 
workers 
who 
are 
paid 
less 
than 
the 
minimum 
or 
who 
believe 
that 
they were 
laid 
off 
for 
reasons 
other 
than redundancy can 
appeal 
their 
case 
with 
the 
Labor 
Tribunal. The 
latter’s 
role 
will, 
therefore, 
be 
changed 
to 
settling 
grievances 
instead 
of 
determining 
whether there 
was 
a genuine 
business 
downturn 
or 
not.

of

Labor 
Organization 
(LO), 
will 
also 
be 
introduced. 
However, 
in 
view 
of 
the very 
tight 
fiscal 
situation, 
there 
is 
a need 
to 
minimize 
the

Issues. 
As 
noted 
earlier, 
in 
Sri 
Lanka, the 
existing 
weaknesses 
in 
the 
financial 
sector have 
72. 
Some 
reforms 
in 
the 
financial 
sector 
have 
been implemented. 
These 
include improved financial 
disclosure 
through 
the 
adoption 
of 
international 
accounting 
and auditing 
standards 
in 
banking 
and 
capital 
markets. 
The 
ability 
of 
banks 
to 
recover 
loans 
has 
been 
strengthened 
by 
parate 
execution 
powers, 
which 
allow 
banks 
to 
recover 
loan 
collaterals 
without 
resorting 
to 
the courts.  Measures 
to 
improve 
the 
regulatory, supervisory and 
institutional 
infrastructure 
have 
helped 
to 
establish 
a world-class stock market 
in 
Colombo.  Despite 
progress 
to 
date, 
the 
financial 
system 
is 
shallow, 
with 
the 
asset 
side concentrated 
in 
immobilized 
government 
securities 
(38 
percent), 
and 
the 
liabilities 
side 
in 
bank 
deposits (33 percent). 
In 
the 
post-September 
11 
period, 
the 
occupancy rates 
of 
the 
hotels 
fell 
to 
as 
low 
as 
20-22 
percent 
in 
Colombo for 
an 
extended 
period, 
yet 
the 
TEWA 
prevented them 
from 
laying 
off 
workers.

while 
savers

in

The

is 
inefficient, 
especially 
in 
the state-owned 
segment. 
The 
level 
of 
non-performing

is 
high

in

to

These

at the

of 
both

and borrowers. 
The

has 
taken

the

by 
the

of

External

objective 
in 
the 
financial 
sector 
is 
to 
improve financial 
intermediation 
by 
reducing 
the 
state’s 
intervention 
and 
dominance, 
promoting 
increasing 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
the 
sector 
(including 
in 
the insurance 
and 
pension 
fund 
industry), 
and 
by 
strengthening the 
regulatory 
and supervisory 
framework 
for 
banking 
and the 
capital 
markets. 
To 
this 
end, 
the 
current 
and 
near-term 
priority 
focus 
is 
on 
improving 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
commercial 
banking 
sub-sector, 
particularly 
by 
addressing 
the 
issue 
of 
the 
SCBs. 
Some 
steps 
have 
recently 
been 
undertaken 
to 
improve 
their 
operating performance and 
financial position. 
To 
strengthen 
corporate 
governance 
and 
management, 
the 
boards 
of 
both 
banks 
were revamped 
to 
include 
representatives 
from 
the 
private 
sector, 
and 
the boards were made 
more 
independent. 
In 
addition, 
recently 
recruited 
expatriates 
and 
private 
sector bankers have been 
appointed 
to 
key 
management 
positions. 
Other 
actions 
include: 
(i) 
increasing 
the 
minimum 
capital 
adequacy 
requirement 
for 
banks 
from 
9 
to 
10 percent 
effective 
from 
January 1,2003; 
(ii) 
withdrawing 
the sovereign 
guarantees 
for 
lending 
to 
SOEs; 
and 
(iii) 
public 
announcement 
of 
the 
plan 
to 
commercialize 
the People’s 
Bank 
(PB). 
Both 
state 
banks 
are 
committed 
to 
their 
restructuring 
programs submitted 
to 
the 
Government 
in 
September 
2001 
that 
will 
reduce 
their 
size 
and 
regional 
scope, 
streamline 
their

Financial

reforms. 
Building 
on 
the recent reforms, the 
key 
medium- 
and 
longer-term 
75. 
The 
PB 
is 
a 
very 
weak 
institution 
with 
a negative 
net 
worth 
and inadequate 
capital 
adequacy. 
Until 
recently 
it 
had 
relied 
on 
a ‘letter 
of 
comfort’ 
from 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
to 
continue 
its 
operations. 
The 
letter 
of 
comfort 
has 
recently 
been 
withdrawn 
and 
the 
Government 
has 
announced 
its 
intention 
to 
commercialize 
the 
PB. 
The 
Bank 
of 
Ceylon 
(BOC), 
on 
the 
other hand, 
is 
relatively 
well 
positioned 
with 
a 
capital 
adequacy 
of 
over 
13 
percent, 
rising 
revenues and 
pre-tax 
profits. 
The 
BOC 
has 
also adequately 
provided 
for 
anticipated 
loan 
losses 
well 
above the 
industry 
standard. 
This 
situation 
has 
led 
the 
Government 
to 
support 
BOC’s 
continued 
operations, 
while 
insisting 
that 
the 
bank 
continue 
its 
efforts 
aimed 
at 
improving 
its 
performance 
in 
line 
with 
the 
agreed 
performance 
targets 
and 
schedule. 
In 
the 
context 
of 
restructuring 
the 
two 
SCBs, 
it 
is 
important 
to 
acknowledge 
their 
differences. 
76. 
new 
large 
re-capitalization 
would 
impose 
a significant 
burden 
on 
the 
population, 
the 
Government 
correctly 
treats 
the 
commercialization 
of 
the 
PB 
as 
an urgent 
priority. 
As 
a 
lasting solution 
with 
a 
minimum 
impact 
on 
the budget, 
the 
commercialization 
of 
the 
PB 
will 
be carried 
out 
with 
a 
view 
to 
identifying 
a 
strategic 
investor 
to 
take 
over 
it 
as 
a single 
unit 
(first 
preference--Option 
1) 
or, 
if 
this 
option 
does 
not 
materialize, 
by 
splitting 
the 
PB 
into 
a 
commercial bank 
and a 
savings 
bank 
and then 
seeking 
strategic 
investor 
to 
take 
over 
the 
commercial 
unit 
(Option 
2) 
in 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
2004. 
Under 
either 
option, 
an 
asset 
management 
company 
(AMC) 
will 
be 
established 
to 
enable the 
SCBs 
to 
deal 
with 
their 
NpLs. 
As 
a 
whole, 
this 
task 
will 
require 
proper 
due 
diligence 
and an 
open and 
transparent process 
to 
prepare the 
PB 
for 
commercialization. 
To 
these ends, steps 
have 
recently 
been 
initiated. 
These measures 
are 
regarded 
as 
substantive 
so 
as 
to 
make 
the process 
of 
commercializing 
the 
PB 
irreversible,

potential 
of

private 
sector 
and reduce 
poverty. 
In 
addition 
to 
limited 
access 
to 
public 
services 
and 
technology, the 
rural 
poor 
in 
particular 
has 
faced constraints 
from 
nonfunctioning 
land 
markets.” 
As 
a 
result, 
a 
majority 
of 
Sri 
Lankan 
farmers 
use 
natural 
resources 
inefficiently 
and 
are 
trapped 
in 
small-scale, 
unproductive 
agriculture 
(see 
Annex 
I11 
for 
details 
on 
rural 
development). 
Land 
market 
constraints 
result 
in 
sub-optimal 
land 
use.

and 
policy reform

owned, 
but 
allocated 
to 
and farmed 
by 
private 
farmers 
under 
varying 
grants 
and permits, most 
of 
which 
allow 
private 
use 
and inheritance 
but 
restrict 
lease, sale, 
subdivision, and 
mortgaging. 
An 
additional, 
smaller 
portion 
of 
land 
was 
affected 
by 
the 
Land 
Reform 
Act 
1970, 
which 
nationalized private 
land 
holdings 
in 
excess 
of 
50 
acres 
and 
redistributed 
them 
to 
small-holder 
tenants 
in 
perpetuity. 
The 
Act 
placed a 
ceiling 
of 
5 
acres 
on 
tenant 
farms. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
restrictions 
on 
land 
transactions, 
those 
households 
who would 
want 
to 
move 
to 
other 
sectors 
or 
areas 
with 
better 
growth 
prospects 
would 
have 
to 
leave 
without 
any 
compensation 
for 
their 
land, and 
thus 
even 
farmers 
with 
non-viable 
holdings 
are 
trapped 
in 
agriculture. 
The 
land 
tenure 
pattern 
in 
Sri 
Lanka 
is 
highly 
complex. 
The 
majority 
of 
land 
in 
Sri 
Lanka 
is 
state 
80. 
Private 
land 
owners 
face 
similar 
constraints. 
Most 
private 
land 
records are 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
deeds 
registration 
system, 
which 
records transactions 
and 
serves 
as 
evidence 
only 
in 
support 
of 
proving 
titling 
to 
land. 
A 
prudent 
purchaser 
of 
land 
must 
undertake 
a 
cumbersome search 
of 
all 
past 
deeds 
concerning a 
particular parcel 
in 
the 
system 
(having 
to 
go 
back 
to 
records over a 
30-year period),  and 
often 
vital 
documents 
are 
missing. 
l3 
The 
multiplicity 
of 
inheritance and customary 
land 
laws reflecting 
the 
island’s 
multi-ethnic 
character (Kandyan, Thesavalamai, 
Moslem, 
and 
Roman-Dutch 
Law) 
further 
complicates 
land 
tenure and 
affects 
gender 
equity. 
Private 
lands 
are 
also 
affected 
by 
land 
use 
restrictions, 
such 
as 
the 
Paddy 
Lands 
Act 
which 
does 
not allow 
paddy 
land 
to 
be used 
for 
non-paddy 
cultivation 
without 
government 
permission 
and restricts 
the 
ability 
of 
the 
owner 
to 
lease 
the 
land 
to 
a 
tenant. 
In 
combination, 
all 
these 
factors 
impede 
the 
efficient 
use 
of 
land. 
The urban 
land 
market 
is 
also 
affected 
by 
inappropriate 
government 
restrictions 
and 
ownership. 
8 
1. 
Land 
market 
reforms. 
One element 
of 
a 
long-term solution 
to 
these 
challenges 
is 
the 
removal 
of 
the 
restrictions 
on 
transactions 
by 
conversion 
of 
grants 
and permits 
to 
fully 
marketable 
freehold 
deeds 
or 
titles. 
Another 
element 
is 
a 
nation-wide 
conversion 
to 
a 
registration 
of 
title 
system. 
In 
contrast 
to 
the 
deed system, 
under a 
title 
system 
the 
parcel 
is 
registered, 
with 
transactions thereafter 
registered 
against 
the parcel. 
A 
title 
system facilitates boundary dispute resolution, 
accuracy, transparency and 
accessibility 
of 
records, 
willingness 
of 
lenders 
to 
provide 
financing, and 
efficient land 
transactions. 
I2 
This 
includes 
lack 
of 
secure 
property rights, 
high 
transaction 
costs 
in 
land 
sales 
and 
other 
administrative 
services, 
inability 
to 
use 
land 
as 
collateral, 
and 
little 
control 
over 
land 
management. 
l3 
In 
Sri 
Lanka, the 
parcel 
and 
boundary 
information 
for 
private 
lands 
is 
held 
in 
ofices 
of 
private 
surveyors and 
may 
not 
be readily 
available. 
Land 
transactions thus 
often 
involve 
significant 
cash 
and 
opportunity 
costs 
for 
clients. 
Furthermore, 
the 
deeds 
may 
not 
agree 
with 
the 
facts 
on 
the 
ground 
and 
disputes are common. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
a 
dispute, settlement times 
for 
land 
cases 
in 
courts 
usually 
take 
more 
than ten 
years, 
and lack 
of 
affordability 
limits 
the 
access 
of 
poor 
land 
holders 
including 
women-headed households 
to 
dispute resolution. 
24 
Page  31
82. 
The 
strategy 
to 
tackle 
these 
challenges 
includes 
removing 
restrictions 
related 
to 
the 
sale, 
lease, 
transfer, 
sub-division 
and mortgage 
of 
state 
land 
that are 
currently 
held 
under 
grants 
and 
permits. 
Regarding 
these 
lands 
in 
rural 
areas 
under the 
Land 
Development 
Ordinance 
and 
Land Grants 
(Special 
Provisions) 
Act, 
a 
Draft 
‘Land 
Ownership 
Law’ 
is 
being 
prepared, 
which 
will 
likely 
be 
sent 
to 
Parliament 
in 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2003. 
The latter 
is 
intended 
to 
provide 
a 
legal 
framework 
for 
converting 
grant lands 
to 
freeholds, 
thus 
establishing 
private 
ownership and 
clear 
property 
rights 
and 
removing 
the 
above 
cited 
restrictions.  However, 
the 
draft 
has 
some 
drawbacks 
in 
that 
in 
its 
current 
form 
it 
could 
lead 
to 
an 
inefficient, 
non-transparent 
process 
of 
conversion 
without 
clear and 
appropriate 
decision 
making 
criteria. 
It 
is 
not 
obvious 
that the 
current 
design 
of 
the 
process 
would 
adequately 
help 
vulnerable 
land 
holders, 
including 
women, 
to 
have 
freedom 
of 
choice 
and 
to 
make 
informed 
choices. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
critical 
importance 
of 
converting 
grant lands 
to 
freeholds 
for 
achieving 
higher 
productivity 
in 
agriculture, efforts 
to 
establish 
and 
implement 
an 
efficient, 
transparent, and appropriate 
process 
of 
land 
conversion 
would 
be 
supported 
under 
the 
PRSC program 
(see 
Table 
4 
below).

been 
initiated 
on

arrangements 
for

of 
unutilized

owned 
by 
the 
state. 
It 
will 
be 
important 
for 
these 
arrangements 
to 
take 
into 
consideration 
international 
experience 
and 
potential 
governance, social, economic, 
fiscal, 
and 
environmental

in

of

supported 
under 
the

(see

It 
will 
be 
important 
to 
ensure 
clarity, 
completeness, 
legal 
soundness, 
and 
overall quality 
of 
these 
amendments. 
In 
July 
2002, the 
Survey

was 
enacted, 
which 
takes 
into

unbundling 
of 
the 
power

companies 
with 
the 
transmission 
company 
acting 
as 
the 
single 
buyer 
of

from

According 
to 
the schedule 
agreed 
with 
the 
ADB, 
unboundling 
of 
the 
CEB 
will 
be 
completed 
by 
October 
2003 and the 
successor 
companies 
will 
be 
formed. 
This 
restructuring 
process 
is 
seen 
as 
a 
necessary step 
to 
introduce 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
small 
and medium-scale 
hydro 
generation, and 
it 
is 
expected that the 
successor 
entities 
of 
the 
CEB 
would 
enjoy better 
incentives, 
reduced 
political 
interference, and face 
accountability.

Commission 
of 
Sri Lanka 
(PUCSL), 
having 
regulatory 
powers over 
the 
Electricity 
Reform 
Act. 
The 
PUCSL 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
pricing 
(retail 
and 
bulk 
tariffs), 
licensing, and 
other 
regulatory functions. 
The 
latter’s 
independence 
is 
statutorily 
guaranteed, 
and 
it 
is 
expected 
that the 
new industry 
structure, 
coupled 
with 
the 
regulatory 
oversight 
of 
the 
PUCSL, 
will 
facilitate more competition 
with 
increased 
private 
sector 
participation. 
This 
would 
also 
result 
in 
reduced 
fiscal 
burden 
by 
the

Civil

and 
administrative 
reform. 
A 
major 
cause 
of 
the 
progressive degradation 
in 
social 
services 
over 
the past 25 
years 
is 
the decline 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
public 
administration.  Problems 
have 
included: 
an increase 
in 
politicization 
and 
patronage-based 
recruitment; a 
major 
expansion 
in 
the 
size 
of 
the 
civil 
service that 
has 
lowered 
its 
productivity 
and 
increased 
the 
burden 
of 
the wage 
bill; 
excessive 
administrative fragmentation and balkanization; 
and 
a 
lack 
of 
transparency and 
client-focus. 
A 
number 
of 
efforts 
have 
recently 
been 
initiated 
to 
address these 
concerns 
(which 
are discussed 
in 
paragraphs 
37-41

civil 
conflict, 
expenditure 
control 
has 
been shaky 
and 
the other 
two 
objectives--allocating 
resources 
in 
conformity 
with 
government 
policies, 
and creating 
the 
conditions 
for 
sound 
operational 
management-- 
neglected 
altogether. 
There 
is 
therefore a 
need 
for 
a 
substantial 
and 
durable 
improvement 
in 
public 
expenditure programming, budgeting, and 
financial 
management 
and 
accountability. 
Some 
technical 
progress 
in 
public financial 
management 
in 
Sri 
Lanka 
has 
been made 
starting 
in 
late 
2001, 
and 
the 
dialogue 
with 
donors, 
including 
the 
Bank 
has 
intensified. 
As 
noted 
earlier, 
the 
various 
building 
blocks 
for 
a 
comprehensive diagnosis are 
now 
available 
from 
technical 
assistance 
by 
other

from

Reforms. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
administrative reform, 
there 
is 
movement 
on 
two 
fronts. 
First, 
a number 
of 
important 
steps 
have 
been taken 
to 
stop the 
decline 
of 
the 
public 
service, 
with 
particular 
emphasis 
upon 
the 
twin 
goals 
of 
ending 
political 
interference and 
restoring meritocracy 
in 
recruitment 
and 
containing 
the 
growth 
of 
the 
wage 
bill. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
analytic 
work 
has 
been 
initiated 
that 
will 
facilitate 
its 
ability 
to 
advance the 
reform 
agenda 
in 
the 
months 
ahead. 
With 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
Bank 
and 
other 
donors, 
this 
effort 
is 
unfolding 
along 
several dimensions, 
including: 
(i) 
the 
development 
of 
a 
comprehensive, 
authoritative, 
web-based 
organizational 
chart 
for 
the 
public 
sector 
as 
a whole, 
which 
will 
provide 
support 
26 
Page  33
for 
the broader 
rationalization effort; 
(ii) 
the development 
of 
a 
pay 
and 
employment 
model 
that 
will 
allow 
the analysis 
of 
various 
rightsizing 
scenarios; 
(iii) 
careful 
analysis 
of 
issues 
of 
establishment 
control 
to 
ensure 
that 
unauthorized 
recruitment 
is 
not 
taking 
place and prevent 
re-entry 
in 
the event 
of 
a 
rightsizing 
exercise; and 
(iv) 
the 
provision 
of 
consultancy support 
for 
exploring 
various 
rightsizing 
options 
such 
as 
a 
VRS. 
A 
variety 
of 
other 
initiatives, ranging 
from 
streamlining 
guidelines 
for 
personnel 
management 
to 
developing an 
integrated computerized human

database, 
are 
also underway.

To 
this 
end, 
with 
donor

is 
currently 
ongoing 
to

the

as 
well 
as

Recently, 
the 
Government 
has 
prepared a 
draft 
Public 
Finance 
Act 
(PFA) 
and 
distributed 
for 
review 
and 
comments. 
After 
it 
is 
further 
refined 
and 
strengthened, 
the enacted 
PFA 
will 
fill 
the 
important

and

that

and

As 
noted 
earlier, a 
Country 
Financial 
Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA) 
was 
carried 
out. 
The 
report 
is 
in 
draft 
stage 
and 
is 
being 
discussed 
with 
the 
Government. 
The 
analytical 
work 
carried out 
under 
the 
CFAA 
and other diagnostic 
studies 
note 
that the 
framework 
for 
public 
financial 
accountability 
in 
Sri 
Lanka 
is 
generally 
sound 
and 
firmly 
rooted 
on 
the 
principles 
of 
the 
Westminster 
model 
of 
governance. 
The 
study 
observes 
that the 
primary 
accountability institutions 
and organizations, 
though 
long 
established, have 
not 
evolved 
with 
time 
(see 
Annex 
IV 
for 
further 
details). 
This 
has 
reduced 
the 
effectives 
of 
these 
institutions, resulting 
in 
less 
than 
adequate assurance 
that 
public 
funds 
are 
used 
for 
the 
purposes 
intended. 
The 
CFAA 
findings 
indicate 
that 
institutional 
reforms 
(in 
the 
form 
of 
legislations 
and 
changes 
to 
rules and 
procedures 
of 
public 
financial 
management 
in 
the 
government 
system) 
alone cannot 
bring 
about a sustained 
improvement 
in 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
public 
financial 
accountability 
in 
Sri 
Lanka. 
The 
report 
emphasizes 
the 
need 
to: 
(i) 
mobilize 
stakeholders 
within 
and outside 
the 
public 
sector 
(i.e., 
legislators, 
Auditor 
General, and 
the 
media); and

In

important initiatives 
have been taken 
by 
the 
Government,

recommends an

in 
place 
but 
a 
number 
of 
important 
issues 
remain 
to 
be 
addressed. 
Over 
the 
last 
10 
years 
of 
experience 
with 
Environmental 
Impact 
Assessment 
(EN) 
in 
Sri 
Lanka, 
the weakest 
link 
has 
been the 
Project 
Approving 
Agencies 
(PAA) 
system where a 
line 
ministry’s 
role 
in 
clearance 
of 
the 
EL4 
may 
lead 
to 
conflict 
of 
interest. 
A 
critical review 
of 
the 
PAA 
system, 
its 
effectiveness, 
long 
term 
sustainability 
and 
alternative 
approaches 
is 
needed. 
In 
addition, 
while 
project 
specific 
environmental 
impact 
assessments 
are 
conducted 
reasonably 
well, 
the 
broad policies 
and programs 
implemented 
by 
the 
Government can have 
serious 
unanticipated 
environmental 
consequences. 
This 
concern 
needs 
to be 
addressed, 
perhaps 
through 
promotion 
of 
increased use 
of 
strategic 
and 
sectoral 
environmental 
assessments 
(SEA) 
for 
policies 
and programs. 
As 
in 
most 
countries, the 
main 
concerns 
are 
related 
not 
to 
the 
EL4 
regulations 
but 
to 
the 
weak 
implementation 
of 
the

Programs 
to 
build 
environmental 
management capacity have been 
conducted 
in 
a 
few 
selected 
provinces 
on 
a 
pilot 
basis. 
Key 
issues 
that 
still 
need 
to 
be 
addressed 
include 
clear 
allocation 
of 
roles

responsibilities between 
the

most 
effective 
way 
to 
ensure 
sufficient 
capacity 
in 
the 
regional 
offices 
to 
carry out 
these 
responsibilities 
effectively. 
Furthermore, 
the 
Government 
expressed 
strong 
interest 
in 
a 
pilot 
initiative to 
harmonize 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
clearance procedures 
for 
all 
donor-supported projects 
in

review 
and 
computerization 
of 
the

process 
initiated 
under 
the 
existing

provides 
a 
very 
helpful 
start 
for 
further improvement. The next 
steps 
include

and 
raising 
capacity 
of

the 
most significant 
component--has 
suffered 
from 
serious 
design 
flaws 
that 
have 
led 
to 
considerable 
mis-targeting. 
An 
evaluation 
of 
Samurdhi 
suggests 
that 
its 
targeted food-stamp 
program, 
which 
constitutes 
80 
percent 
of 
the 
total program 
budget, 
misses 
about 
40 
percent 
of 
households 
ranked 
in 
the poorest 
quintile, 
while 
almost 
44 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
budget 
is 
spent 
on 
households 
from 
the 
top 
3 
quintiles. 
Qualitative 
results 
suggest 
that 
political 
factors, 
including 
party 
affiliation 
or 
voting 
preferences 
influence allocation 
of 
Samurdhi 
grants. 
Large-scale 
leakage

as 
half 
of 
the 
population--far 
above the 
poverty 
rate, 
estimated 
at 
less 
than 
25 
percent--with 
the 
result 
that the 
benefits 
are spread 
too thinly 
and 
the 
small 
size 
of

welfare 
programs, 
and 
to 
improve 
the targeting performance 
of 
the 
Samurdhi 
food-stamp 
program 
in 
particular: 
On 
the governance 
side, 
the 
Act 
mandates 
an 
independent 
Welfare 
Benefits 
Board 
and 
lower 
level 
Selection Committees 
to 
set 
eligibility 
criteria, validate 
entry 
and 
exit 
into 
the 
program, and 
redress 
appeals. 
On 
the 
technical 
aspect 
of 
identifying 
beneficiaries, 
the 
Act 
envisages 
setting objective 
criteria 
for 
the 
selection 
of 
beneficiaries, 
based 
on 
easily 
observable 
and 
measurable characteristics 
of 
households, 
with 
a 
longer 
term 
objective 
of 
integrating 
the 
criteria 
to 
cover 
all 
welfare 
programs 
in 
the 
country. 
Given 
that 
available 
evidence 
suggests 
that 
the systemic 
problems 
of 
Samurdhi 
are 
mainly 
a 
result 
of 
politicization 
of 
the process 
of 
identifying 
beneficiaries, 
the 
changes 
ensconced 
in 
the 
Act 
represent 
significant 
steps. 
If 
implemented effectively, 
these 
are 
likely 
to 
enhance 
objectivity 
and 
transparency, thereby 
minimizing 
the 
scope 
for political 
interference 
in 
the 
selection 
process 
and 
increasing targeting efficiency.  The 
improved 
system 
will

As 
formulated 
in 
the

planned 
over 
the

a basis 
to 
fine-tune 
subsequent PRSCs. 
The

such an increase

dramatic change 
both 
in

Coordination 
and 
partnership 
with 
JBIC 
and 
ADB 
are 
especially 
critical, given 
that 
their 
assistance 
complements that 
of 
the 
Bank, 
providing 
opportunities 
for 
parallel 
or 
joint 
financing. 
Coordination 
is 
strengthened 
by 
systematic sharing

finding 
ways 
to 
reinforce 
each 
other’s programs and

In 
the 
financial 
sector, 
the 
Bank 
focuses 
on 
the 
banking 
sector and 
pension 
funds, 
while 
the 
ADB 
focuses 
on 
capital

The 
ADB 
is 
also 
supporting 
ongoing 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
public 
expenditure 
management, 
which 
complement the 
Bank‘s 
work 
on 
civil 
service and 
administrative 
reform 
issues. 
JBIC’s involvement 
in 
financing 
infrastructure 
is 
complemented 
by 
the 
Bank 
through 
support 
to policy 
reforms 
that can 
enhance 
the 
outcomes 
of 
these 
projects 
for 
the 
country. 
The

Social 
Impact 
Analysis

geared 
towards 
poverty 
reduction. 
Sri 
Lanka’s 
PRSP 
highlights 
the 
overall 
plans 
for 
M&E, 
including 
preparations 
underway 
to 
strengthen 
monitoring 
capacity 
and 
to 
fill 
quantitative 
and 
qualitative 
information 
gaps 
(for 
the details 
of 
support 
under 
the 
PRSC 
program, 
see 
Annex 
I). 
The 
M&E 
framework 
contains 
five 
critical 
components, 
which 
will 
also 
address 
the 
needs 
of 
a 
Poverty 
and 
Social 
Impact 
Analysis 
(PSIA) 
of 
policy 
reforms: 
Monitoring 
and

(M&E) 
is 
an 
essential 
part 
of

and 
fine-tuning policies 
0 
Rationalize 
the 
existing 
surveys, 
like 
the 
Household 
Income 
and 
Expenditure 
Survey 
(HIES) 
and 
Consumer 
Finance 
and Socio-economic Survey 
(CFSES)--which 
are 
included 
in 
the 
M&E 
framework outlined 
by 
the PRSP--to 
regularize 
their periodicity, 
synchronize 
their 
timing, 
and 
strengthen 
some 
modules (especially 
in 
the 
area 
of 
human 
development) 
to 
track indicators 
related 
to quality 
of 
services. 
Introduce 
a 
mechanism 
to 
track 
the 
poverty 
and 
social 
impact 
of 
policy 
changes. 
For 
the 
aforementioned welfare reform, 
two 
components 
are 
currently 
being 
discussed: 
(i) 
a 
Poverty 
Map 
to 
identify 
geographic 
areas 
of 
isolation 
and 
poverty, 
which 
will 
aid 
targeting 
of 
poverty 
programs 
in 
general; and 
(ii) 
an 
in-built 
monitoring 
system 
of 
the 
welfare 
program 
to 
track 
improvements 
in 
indicators 
of 
poverty 
that 
will 
help 
with 
identifying 
movement 
of 
beneficiaries 
in 
and out 
of 
the program. 
To 
monitor 
the 
impact 
of 
broader 
policy 
measures 
that 
are 
likely 
to 
have 
varying 
effects 
across 
heterogeneous groups--e.g., 
changes 
in 
land 
and 
labor 
policies--the 
existing 
HIES 
may 
provide 
some 
answers, 
along 
some 
basic dimensions 
of 
poverty. 
Additionally, 
other components 
of 
the 
existing 
M&E 
framework--e.g.,  the 
Labor 
Force 
surveys 
and 
the 
Demographic 
and 
Health 
Survey 
(DHS)--could be tailored to 
address 
the 
impact 
of 
specific policies. 
(However, 
it 
will 
be important to 
increase the 
frequency--currently 
once 
every 
5 
years--of 
both 
the 
HIES 
and the 
DHS). 
With 
the 
peace 
accord 
and 
post-conflict 
reconstruction efforts, 
an 
opportunity 
now 
arises 
for 
understanding 
poverty 
in 
the 
North-East. 
The 
HIES 
and other 
surveys 
will 
need 
to 
be 
representative 
of 
this 
region, 
and the current 
HIES 
on 
the 
ground 
appears 
to 
have accomplished 
this 
goal. 
An 
integral part 
of 
poverty 
monitoring 
and 
impact 
is 
also the 
participatory 
component 
to 
assess 
access 
and consumer 
satisfaction 
issues. 
The 
PRS 
acknowledges the 
importance 
of 
this 
and 
proposes a broad-based 
monitoring 
team 
that 
will 
need 
to 
be 
regularized. 
Finally, 
and perhaps 
most crucial, 
are 
the 
institutional 
arrangements 
to 
coordinate 
the 
M&E 
system and 
promote 
incentives 
for 
its 
use 
in 
policy 
and 
budgetary decision-making. 
An 
immediate 
objective 
would 
be 
to 
enhance 
capacity 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Census 
and Statistics 
(DCS) 
to 
be able 
to 
conduct 
the 
HIES 
at 
intervals 
of 
2-3 years 
(currently,

agencies--the 
DCS 
and 
the 
Central Bank--alternate 
in 
fielding 
two 
similar

is 
both 
inefficient 
and 
introduce 
comparability

Our 
policy 
dialogue 
so 
far 
has 
been 
to 
present 
this 
concern 
and 
move beyond 
it 
towards a decision. 
Two 
options 
can 
be 
considered: 
(i) 
a single 
household 
survey conducted 
by 
a single 
authority, 
Le., 
DCS, 
to 
collect 
incomekonsumption 
data 
and expand 
the survey 
to 
include more 
social indicators, 
akin 
to 
an 
LSMS 
(the 
preferred 
option); and 
(ii) 
continue 
to 
have 
two 
surveys, 
but 
coordinate 
them 
in 
terms 
of 
timing, 
expanding 
one 
of 
them 
(for 
example, CFSES) 
to 
include 
broader 
social indicators--one 
model could 
be 
the 
Sri 
Lanka 
Integrated Survey (SLIS) 
conducted 
in 
1999-2000.  Once 
clarity 
is 
achieved 
on 
the 
institutional 
arrangements 
and 
survey plans, 
it 
will 
facilitate rationalizing 
of 
the 
poverty 
monitoring 
system

Central 
Bank 
Safeguards 
Assessment. 
The 
IMF 
conducted a 
Stage 
Two 
Safeguard 
Assessment 
in 
July, 2001. 
It 
determined 
that 
while 
a 
number 
of 
measures 
have been 
initiated 
to 
strengthen the 
CBSL, 
there 
are 
significant 
vulnerabilities 
that need 
to 
be 
addressed. 
To 
address these 
vulnerabilities, 
the 
assessment 
recommended: 
(i) 
the 
adoption 
of 
stronger 
external audit 
mechanisms 
under 
the oversight 
of 
an 
Audit 
Committee; 
(ii) 
implementation 
of 
International Accounting 
Standards; 
and 
(iii) 
appropriate 
review 
and 
control 
procedures over data 
submitted 
to 
IMF. 
The 
CBSL 
has 
made 
good 
progress 
in 
implementing 
these 
recommendations and

RISKS

broad 
public 
sector reform, 
as 
well 
as 
on 
the 
rural 
sector 
that 
is 
critically 
important 
for 
poverty 
reduction, 
the proposed PRSC 
is 
expected 
to 
help 
implementation 
of 
the 
poverty reduction 
program 
in 
several ways. 
First, 
it 
will 
help 
the 
Government’s 
implementation 
of 
important 
structural 
reforms, 
boosting 
investor 
confidence. 
Second, 
in 
the short- 
to 
medium-term, 
the 
credit 
will 
support 
fiscal consolidation 
and 
help 
create 
conditions 
for 
accelerating 
economic 
growth 
by 
providing 
quick-disbursing 
assistance 
at 
a 
time 
when 
economic 
recovery 
is 
still 
slow 
and there 
is 
a 
very 
tight 
budget 
situation. 
Third, 
the 
credit 
will 
support 
poverty reduction 
not 
only 
by 
creating 
fiscal 
space, 
but 
also 
through 
improvements 
in 
the 
poverty-focus 
of 
public 
expenditure 
programs. 
The 
credit 
will 
facilitate 
the 
latter 
also 
by 
inducing 
and 
supporting 
analytical 
work 
(annual

and

Finally, 
the 
credit 
will 
help 
the

the strengthening 
of

Risks. 
The 
overall 
PRSC 
program 
faces 
several 
risks: 
Peace 
process. 
A 
resumption 
of 
hostilities 
and 
the 
derailment 
of 
the peace 
process, 
which 
could 
worsen the precarious 
fiscal 
situation, 
slow 
down 
economic 
activity, 
hurt 
business confidence, 
and postpone the 
implementation 
of 
the 
PRS 
program. 
Politics 
under 
a cohabitation 
government. 
Sri 
Lanka 
is 
going through 
‘‘cohabitation’’--a 
President 
from 
one 
party 
and a 
Government 
from 
another--for the 
first 
time. 
The 
President 
has 
0 
37 
Page  44
the 
constitutional power to 
dismiss 
the 
Government and 
call 
elections.  Such 
an 
event 
could 
obviously 
disrupt 
both 
the 
peace 
process 
and economic 
reforms. 
The 
President 
has 
stated 
that 
she 
would 
not 
dismiss 
the Government 
as 
long 
they 
continue 
to 
command 
the 
confidence 
of 
Parliament. 
Nevertheless, 
this 
remains a 
risk 
for 
this 
operation. 
Opposition 
to 
reforms. 
Stronger reactions/opposition 
to 
some 
reforms, such 
as 
bank privatization, 
or 
if 
the 
reforms 
were 
seen 
as 
a threat 
to 
the 
peace 
process, 
the Government 
might 
slow 
down 
its 
efforts. 
ExtemaE. 
Sri 
Lanka 
remains a 
country 
with 
heavy 
external 
dependence. 
If 
the 
situation 
in 
the 
Middle 
East were 
to 
deteriorate further, the economy 
might 
be 
hurt 
due 
to 
likely 
decline 
in 
international 
tourism 
and 
tea 
exports, a slower 
recovery 
in 
the 
global 
economy, and 
sustained 
high 
oil 
prices, 
just 
at 
the 
time 
the 
Sri 
Lankan 
economy 
is 
recovering. 
Inflows 
of 
workers’ 
remittance 
might 
also 
be 
affected 
in 
the

intentionally 
so, 
because 
of 
the 
historic 
moment 
at 
which 
Sri 
Lanka 
finds 
itself.  The 
Government and 
indeed the 
LTTE 
are 
themselves 
being 
very 
bold 
and 
taking 
enormous 
risks 
with 
respect 
to 
their 
own 
political 
futures, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
a 
better 
future 
for 
the people 
of 
Sri 
Lanka. 
It 
seems 
only 
reasonable 
that 
the 
Bank 
should 
also 
be 
prepared 
to 
accept 
the 
risks 
of 
this 
strategy 
so 
long 
as 
the 
two 
parties 
remain 
committed 
to 
achieving 
peace 
and 
laying 
the 
foundation 
for 
a 
renewed attack 
on 
poverty. 
It 
is 
therefore a 
strategy 
that 
has 
high 
risks, 
but 
potentially 
very 
high 
rewards 
in 
a 
country 
that 
for 
too 
long 
has 
been 
performing 
below 
its 
full 
potential. 
Sri 
Lanka now 
has 
the 
opportunity 
finally to 
break out 
of 
the 
conflict 
and 
follow 
a 
path 
of 
sustained progress 
for 
all 
its 
people. 
The 
World 
Bank 
Group 
can make a substantial 
contribution to 
this 
process. 
Of 
these 
risks 
the 
first 
two 
are 
the 
most 
critical. 
This 
is 
therefore 
a 
relatively 
risky 
strategy. 
It 
is 
116. 
major communications 
program 
is 
being 
developed 
to 
present and 
explain 
the 
reform 
program 
to 
the 
population. 
This 
should 
reduce resistance 
to 
the reforms. 
In 
addition, 
a 
major program 
of 
technical 
assistance 
for 
the 
reform 
process 
has 
been approved--Le., 
the 
Economic 
Reform 
Technical 
Assistance 
Project--which 
should boost 
implementation 
capacity. 
Both 
the 
IMF 
and 
the 
Bank 
will 
also 
provide 
support 
to 
strengthen 
the 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
capacity 
building 
effort. 
To 
handle 
these 
risks, 
several 
mitigation 
strategies are 
being 
adopted. 
First, 
with 
Bank 
support, a 
117. 
The 
political 
risks 
are harder 
to 
mitigate, 
but 
should 
be 
tractable 
so 
long 
as 
the Government 
retains the 
confidence 
of 
Parliament. 
The 
successful 
implementation 
of 
the 
reform 
program 
and 
successful 
negotiation 
of 
the 
peace process 
are 
the 
best guarantees 
of 
this. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
peace 
process, 
there 
is 
every 
indication 
of 
strong commitment 
from 
both 
sides 
and the best prospect 
to 
supporting 
this 
is 
an 
early demonstration 
of 
the benefits 
of 
peace. 
Thus, 
the 
Bank--along 
with 
other 
development 
partners--will 
provide 
early 
support 
for 
reconstruction 
efforts 
as 
part 
of 
the 
strategy. 
Finally, 
the 
external 
shocks 
require 
that 
foreign 
reserves 
be 
built 
up 
as 
quickly 
as 
possible.

LETTER 
OF 
DEVELOPMENT 
POLICY 
The 
Government 
of 
Sri 
Lanka, 
at 
a 
critical time 
.in 
its 
history, 
has 
launched 
an 
econo&c 
program 
which 
aims 
to 
reduce 
poverty 
by 
creating 
an 
enabling environment 
for 
inclusive private 
sector 
led 
growth 
and 
to 
consolidate 
the 
peace 
process 
by 
relief, 
rehabilitation, 
and 
reconstruction efforts.

far-reaching 
strategy 
is 
laid 
out 
in 
Regaining 
Sri 
Lanka: 
Vision  and 
Strategy 
for 
Accelerated

On 
behalf 
of 
the 
Government 
of 
Sri

I 
am 
writing 
to 
request 
the 
First 
Poverty Reduction Support 
Credit 
(PRSC) 
of 
US$ 
1 
10

sets 
out 
the 
actions that 
Government 
will 
undertake 
over 
the

to 
implement 
this 
strategy, 
focusing 
on 
measures 
that 
will 
increase 
the

GOVERNMENT 
OF 
SRI 
LANKA 
LETTER 
OF 
DEVELOPMENT 
POLICY 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
AND 
STRATEGIC 
CONTEXT 
Background 
01. 
The 
Government 
of 
Sri 
Lanka 
is 
in 
a 
process 
to 
reverse 
the 
legacy 
of 
two 
decades 
of 
painful 
and 
costly 
conflict 
and 
enter 
into 
a new 
phase 
of 
economic  development. 
The 
Government’s 
commitment 
towards 
a negotiated 
settlement 
of 
the 
conflict 
and 
the 
progress 
being 
made 
including 
relief, rehabilitation 
and 
reconstruction efforts 
have raised expectations throughout the 
country 
and the 
international community 
that 
lasting 
peace 
may 
finally 
be 
within 
reach. 
In 
recognition 
that 
peace 
and 
inclusive 
economic 
growth 
are 
closely linked, 
we have developed 
a 
comprehensive 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy 
(PRS) 
which 
is 
articulated 
in 
our  Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy  paper 
(PRSP) 
titled 
“Regaining 
Sri 
Lanka: 
Vision 
and  Strategy 
for 
Accelerated 
Development.” 
This 
strategy 
is 
the outcome 
of 
a 
four 
year 
extensive 
consultative 
process 
and 
it 
focuses 
on 
strengthening the 
basis 
for 
competitive, 
private 
sector-led 
growth 
through fiscal 
consolidation 
and far-reaching 
structural reforms. 
02. 
Despite achieving very 
high 
social 
development 
indicators early 
in 
its 
development, 
poverty 
in 
Sri 
Lanka 
remains 
high. 
The 
findings 
of 
the recent 
World 
Bank 
Poverty 
Assessment 
indicate 
that 
in 
the 
mid- 
1990s 
about one 
fourth 
of 
Sri 
Lankans 
lived 
below 
the 
national poverty 
line. 
The 
inclusion 
of 
data 
from 
the 
North 
and East 
would 
make 
this 
situation 
worse. 
Thus, 
to 
address 
this 
problem,  our 
PRS 
represents 
a 
departure 
from 
erstwhile 
policies 
of 
transfers  and 
redistribution 
to 
a 
strategy  that  aims 
at 
fostering 
growth,and 
widening 
opportunities 
for 
the 
poor. 
03. 
In 
the 
last 
three 
decades 
Sri 
Lanka 
performed below 
its 
potential 
in 
economic growth, 
especially 
relative 
to 
its 
East 
Asian 
neighbors 
who 
were 
its 
peers 
in 
the 
1960s. 
Though 
a 
5 
percent 
average 
annual 
growth 
recorded 
in 
the 
1990s 
is 
respectable 
given 
that the 
country 
was 
entangled 
with 
a 
serious 
conflict, 
it 
is 
not 
commensurate 
with 
Sri 
Lanka’s human 
and 
natural 
resource endowment. 
This 
has 
largely 
been 
the 
result 
of 
the 
continued 
dominance 
of 
the 
public 
sector 
in 
commercial 
activities, distortions 
in 
the labour, land, 
and 
credit 
markets, 
poor connectivity 
to 
the 
rural 
economy, 
as 
well 
as 
an 
onerous 
regulatory 
and 
legal 
framework 
constraining 
competitive private 
sector 
participation 
in 
key 
industries. 
Although 
after 
the 
initial 
phase 
of 
the 
economic 
liberalisation 
in 
1977, 
the 
country’s 
economic 
policy 
environment 
was 
strengthened 
further 
through 
subsequent 
reforms, 
momentum 
of 
reforms 
had slowed-down 
and 
more 
fundamental reforms 
were 
not 
implemented, 
as 
economic management 
became 
complicated 
with 
the escalation 
of 
the 
conflict 
and 
lack 
of 
political 
will. 
As 
a 
result, 
important 
distortions 
and 
barriers 
to 
productivity 
growth 
remained, 
making 
Sri 
Lanka relatively 
less 
attractive 
to  foreign 
investment 
and 
not 
so 
friendly 
to 
competitive private 
sector 
participation. 
04. 
When 
the present 
Government 
took 
office 
after 
the General 
Election 
in 
December 
2001, 
the 
country 
was 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
a 
serious  economic 
contraction 
mainly 
caused 
by 
escalating 
military 
conflict, 
deteriorating 
fiscal 
accounts 
and weak 
external environment. 
The 
Stand-By 
Agreement 
(SBA) 
launched 
in 
April 
2001 
had got 
derailed. 
The real 
GDP 
declined 
in 
2001 
for 
the 
first 
time 
since independence. 
Public 
debt 
climbed 
to 
over 
105 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
while 
interest payments reached 
7% 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
Interest 
payments 
on 
public 
debt, 
wages, 
defense 
expenditure, and transfers 
to 
households and 
SOEs 
absorb about 
95 
percent 
of 
government  revenue, 
leaving 
minimal 
fiscal 
space 
for 
investment 
in 
physical 
and 
social 
infrastructure. 
The 
peace 
process and the 
economic 
policies 
of 
the 
government 
have 
now 
provided 
a 
new 
lease 
of life 
to 
an 
ailing 
economy. 
The Government 
has 
already taken 
strong 
measures 
to 
foster 
an 
enabling 
environment 
for 
private 
sector-led 
growth 
and 
job 
creation. 
The 
immediate 
priority 
was 
to 
restore 
macro- 
economic 
stability. 
We 
moved 
quickly to 
curtail 
defense 
expenditure, broadened the 
tax 
base, 
imposed a

hiring 
freeze 
in 
the 
public 
sector, 
and 
introduced 
several 
urgent 
structural  reforms. 
With 
these, 
the 
stabilization 
program 
was 
brought 
back 
on 
track, 
and 
as 
a 
broad 
endorsement 
of 
our economic program, 
the 
IMF 
released the 
remaining 
tranches 
under 
the 
SBA 
in 
April 
and 
September 
2002. 
Recent 
Economic Performance 
and 
Medium-Term 
Prospects 
05. 
The 
measures 
adopted 
by 
the  Government 
are 
paying 
off 
and  setting 
the 
stage 
for 
improved 
medium-term 
prospects. 
In 
2002,  the  economy recovered  and the  macroeconomic 
situation  improved. 
Despite 
weak 
external 
demand, 
the 
economy grew 
by 
4 
percent 
in 
2002, 
with 
a significant  recovery 
of 
domestic 
economic 
activity 
in 
the 
second 
half, 
reflecting 
the 
normalization 
of 
the security 
situation 
and 
improved 
consumer and 
business 
confidence. 
Inflation 
declined 
to 9% 
percent 
in 
2002 
from 
14 
percent 
in 
2001. 
The 
external 
current account 
deficit 
declined 
reflecting improved 
services receipts, 
including 
from 
tourism,  and 
higher 
remittances. 
The 
capital 
account showed 
higher 
FDI. 
Gross 
official 
reserves 
rose 
to 
US$1.5 
billion 
(2% months 
of 
import 
cover) 
while 
the 
rupee 
remained 
stable at 
around 
Rs96/US$. 
We 
believe 
that 
full 
implementation 
of 
the 
reform 
program 
will 
further 
brighten 
medium-term 
prospects 
for 
Sri 
Lanka, 
specifically 
in 
terms 
of 
raising 
real 
GDP 
growth 
and 
reducing 
the 
fiscal deficit 
and 
public 
debt. 
06. 
In 
2002, 
the 
fiscal 
deficit 
was 
reduced 
by 
2 
percentage 
points 
of 
GDP 
to 
8.9 
per 
cent 
of 
GDP 
(despite 
losses 
associated 
with 
the 
transition 
from 
the 
GST/NSL 
to 
a 
simplified 
two-rate 
VAT 
system) 
through 
restraint 
on 
expenditure. 
The 
2003 
Budget 
presented 
in 
November, 2002 
reflects 
our continued commitment 
to 
fiscal 
consolidation 
and 
structural reforms. 
The 
fiscal 
adjustments 
and 
the 
decline 
in 
inflation 
allowed 
interest 
rates 
to 
be 
cut 
by 
300 
basis 
points 
since January 2002, 
setting the 
stage 
for 
an 
expansion 
of 
private 
sector 
credit and 
investment. 
These 
measures 
have fostered 
investor 
confidence,  boosted 
the 
stock 
market 
considerably, 
and doubled 
capital 
inflows. 
07. 
We 
expect 
these 
positive 
developments 
in 
the 
Sri 
Lanka 
economy 
to 
continue 
as 
the 
reform 
program 
advances. 
Economic 
growth 
in 
2003 
is 
projected 
at 
5% 
percent and 
inflation to 
decline 
to 
7 
percent 
by 
end- 
2003.  Gross reserves 
are 
targeted 
to 
increase 
to 
US$2 
billion. 
We 
are 
aiming 
for 
a 
medium-term 
growth 
rate 
of 
6% percent 
over 
2003-06 
and sustained 
high 
growth 
rate 
of 
8-10 
percent 
in 
the 
long-run. 
The 
inflation 
rate 
is 
expected 
to 
fall 
to 
5 
percent, and 
gross 
official 
reserves 
to 
rise 
to 
cover 3 months 
of 
imports 
by 
2006. 
08. 
The 
Government 
of 
Sri 
Lanka 
has 
already taken 
steps 
to 
secure 
the 
availability 
of 
external 
financial 
resources 
to 
facilitate 
faster 
growth. 
Reconstruction related 
imports 
alone 
are 
likely 
to 
raise the current 
account 
deficit 
to 
4 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
Moreover, 
preliminary 
estimates 
indicate 
that 
during 
2003-06, 
annual 
external 
financing 
needs 
would 
average 
about 
US$400 
million. 
Bilateral 
donors, 
particularly 
Japan, 
U.S., 
Germany, 
Kuwait, 
and 
Saudi 
Arabia, 
are 
likely 
to 
contribute 
about 
$70 
million 
in 
program 
support. 
In 
support 
of 
our 
three-year 
Poverty Reduction 
and 
Growth Facility 
(PRGF) 
and 
EFF 
arrangements 
(EFF) 
approved 
in 
April 
2003, 
the 
IMF 
has 
committed 
US$567 
million 
equivalent 
to 
100 
per 
cent 
of 
our 
quota. 
Of 
this 
US$ 
369 
million 
is 
provided 
under 
the 
concessional 
PRGF 
and the balance 
US$ 
198 
million 
is 
provided 
under 
EFF. 
In 
2003, 
we expect 
US$161 
million 
to 
be disbursed under 
PRGFEFF 
program. 
The 
Asian 
Development 
Bank’s  total financial 
support 
during 
2003-06 
would 
be 
US$ 
400 
million, 
with 
a 
program 
component 
of 
US$200 
million. 
About US$60 
million 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
disbursed 
as 
program 
support 
by 
the 
ADB 
in 
2003. 
Under 
its 
new 
Country 
Assistance 
Strategy, 
the 
World 
Bank’s 
base 
case 
lending program 
consists 
of 
about 
four 
projects 
per 
year 
for 
a 
total 
of 
US$800 
million 
of 
IDA 
resources over 
the 
Bank’s 
FY03-FY06.  The 
proposed 
PRSC 
I, 
equivalent 
to 
US$110 
million, 
is 
part 
of 
the 
World 
Bank’s 
strategy 
to 
support 
Sri 
Lanka’s 
PRS.

Sri 
Lanka

Regaining 
Sri 
Lanka-our 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy 
Paper-brings 
together  complementary 
elements 
of 
the Government’s  economic 
program 
to 
achieve 
inclusive 
growth 
and 
lasting 
stability. 
This 
comprehensive strategy 
is 
the 
result 
of 
a far-reaching  stakeholder 
consultation dating 
back to 
the 
drafting 
of 
the 
Poverty Framework 
(PF) 
in 
1998. 
The 
consultations 
with 
line 
ministries, 
donors, 
NGOKBO 
network, 
private 
sector 
representatives, 
trade 
unions, government 
agencies, 
and research organizations 
continued 
until 
it 
was 
finalized 
in 
January 
2003. 
Within 
this 
extended discussion period, we have reached understandings 
on 
the 
broad 
areas 
that 
will 
be 
supported 
by 
the 
World 
Bank, 
the 
IMF, 
the 
ADB, 
and other 
bilateral 
and 
multilateral 
donor 
partners, 
11. 
The 
PRS reflects 
a fundamental 
change 
in 
the 
role 
of 
the 
state 
to 
creating 
an 
enabling 
environment 
for 
faster 
economic 
growth 
and 
poverty 
reduction. 
The 
principal 
elements 
of 
the Government’s 
PRS 
include: 
0 
Securing 
lasting 
peace 
0 
0 
Reducing conflict-related 
poverty 
0 
0 
Investing 
in 
people 
0 
0 
12. 
In 
line 
with 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
(MDGs), 
the PRSP 
identifies 
the target 
of 
halving 
the number 
of 
poor 
by 
2015 
as 
the 
key 
objective 
that 
will 
guide 
the 
Government’s 
long-term 
strategy 
for 
poverty 
reduction. 
Within 
this 
framework, 
the other 
key 
targets that 
the 
PRSP 
envisages 
in 
the 
medium- 
term 
include: 
Strengthening a supportive macroeconomic 
environment 
Creating opportunities 
for 
pro-poor

by

Progress 
in 
Economic 
Reforms 
13. 
We 
give 
below 
the 
specifics 
of 
the 
Government’s economic 
program 
to further 
strengthen 
macro- 
economic 
stability 
and 
to 
place 
Sri 
Lanka 
on 
a 
path 
of 
self-sustaining 
high 
growth, employment creation 
and 
poverty reduction 
in 
the 
medium-term. 
14. 
Restoring 
Fiscal 
Sustainability 
and 
reducing 
pressure 
on 
interest rates. 
Our 
aim 
is 
to 
make 
further 
progress towards strong 
fiscal 
consolidation and 
low 
inflation 
as 
envisaged 
in 
the 
IMF-supported 
three 
year 
PRGFLEW 
program. 
To 
bring 
public 
debt 
to 
a 
manageable 
level, 
the 
program 
aims 
to 
reduce the 
fiscal 
deficit 
by 
1% 
percent, 
on 
average, 
per 
year 
through 
2006. 
To 
achieve 
this, 
we 
plan 
to 
raise 
revenues 
by 
2% 
percent 
of 
GDP 
by 
2006, 
through 
broadening 
the 
tax 
base, 
rationalizing 
tax 
incentives, 
and 
improving 
tax 
administration. 
We 
have already  extended the 
VAT 
to 
the 
financial 
sector, 
extended the 
debit 
tax 
from 
current 
accounts 
to 
savings  accounts, 
imposed 
duties 
on 
most  exempt 
imports 
and  reduced 
defense 
expenditures. 
We 
also 
reduced 
the 
top 
income 
tax  rate 
to 
30 
per 
cent 
from 
35 
per 
cent. 
The 
revenue 
augmenting and 
expenditure 
cutting 
measures 
in 
2003 
are 
expected 
to 
reduce the 
fiscal 
deficit 
to 
7% 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
While 
this 
includes 
about 
% 
per 
cent 
of 
GDP 
for 
post-conflict 
spending 
in 
the North-East,  we 
feel 
Page  52
Attachment 
1 
Page 
5 
of 
12 
that  we 
should 
be 
able 
to 
accommodate another 
?h 
per 
cent 
of 
GDP 
for 
additional 
reconstruction 
and 
rehabilitation 
expenditures 
be 
financed 
out 
of 
mainly 
additional 
donor 
funding, 
without bringing 
in 
undue 
macro-economic 
pressures. 
Significant 
progress 
has 
already been made 
in 
other 
areas 
of 
fiscal 
and quasi- 
fiscal 
consolidation: 
The 
Fiscal 
Management 
Responsibility 
Act 
No. 
3 
of 
2003 
was 
enacted 
in 
January 2003. 
The 
Act 
sets 
a 
medium-term 
fiscal 
deficit 
path 
and 
ceiling 
on 
maximum level 
of 
public 
debt. 
It 
also 
mandates 
pre- 
election budget 
reports 
to 
discourage pre-election 
handouts. 
By 
2006, the 
Act 
stipulates a 
ceiling 
on 
public 
debt 
at 
85 
percent 
of 
GDP 
and  the 
budget 
deficit 
at 
5 percent 
of 
GDP. 
Tax Incentive 
Scheme was 
harmonized 
in 
2002 
for both 
BO1 
registered 
companies and 
those 
that come 
under 
the 
Inland 
Revenue 
Authority. 
A 
Welfare 
Reform 
Act 
was 
enacted 
in 
September 2002, 
setting 
transparent 
eligibility 
and 
exit 
criteria. 
A 
computerized  applicant 
scoring 
system 
for 
the 
Samurdhi 
cash 
benefit 
scheme 
is 
being 
installed 
with 
World 
Bank 
assistance. 
A 
contributory 
pension 
scheme 
for 
all 
new public 
officers 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
Parliament 
in 
January 
2003 and 
is 
being 
implemented. 
A 
project 
manager 
and team entrusted 
with 
responsibility 
for 
setting 
up 
a Revenue 
Authority 
have 
been 
appointed, 
to 
strengthen 
tax 
collection 
and 
provide 
better  service. 
The  draft  legislation 
is 
under 
preparation. 
Key 
public 
enterprises 
(CPC, 
CWE, 
and 
CEB) 
will 
limit 
their bank 
borrowing. 
The 
existing 
freeze 
on 
hiring 
civil 
servants, 
with 
limited 
exceptions and 
abolition 
of 
redundant 
vacant 
positions, continues. 
The 
progress 
in 
reducing 
the 
deficit 
has 
already 
led to 
lower 
need 
for 
domestic 
financing. 
As 
a result, 
in 
combination 
with 
a sound 
monetary 
policy, 
inflation 
has 
been reduced 
enabling 
nominal 
interest 
rates 
to 
be 
lowered significantly-- 
prime lending 
rates 
now 
stand at 
11.5 
percent and Treasury 
Bill 
yields 
of 
9.5 
percent compared 
with 
the 
beginning 
of 
last year. 
15. 
Labour 
Market 
Reforms. 
A 
well 
functioning 
labour market 
is 
a 
prerequisite 
for 
economic 
growth. 
For 
workers 
covered 
under  the 
Termination 
of 
Employment 
of 
Workman 
Act 
(TEWA) 
of 
1971, 
i.e., 
employees 
of 
enterprises 
with 
more 
than 
15 
workers, 
Sri 
Lanka 
has 
had 
one 
of 
the 
most 
stringent 
job 
security 
regulations 
in 
the 
world, 
restricting 
and  segmenting 
the 
country’s  labour  market  and 
discouraging 
the 
expansion 
of 
employment and 
foreign 
direct 
investment. 
Furthermore, 
labour 
disputes 
litigated 
under 
the 
Industrial 
Disputes 
Act 
of 
1950 
through 
a 
low-capacity Labour Tribunal 
system 
were costly, lengthy, fraught 
with 
ad hoc 
discretionary 
rulings. 
Hence, the Government 
seeks 
to 
foster market 
flexibility 
through 
the 
adoption 
of 
labour 
reforms, 
including 
the 
revision 
of 
legal 
provisions 
on 
redundancy compensation, time- 
bound resolution 
of 
labour 
disputes, and 
assistance 
for 
workers  options 
for 
voluntary 
retirement 
to 
find 
appropriate employment. 
In 
this 
regard, the 
Government 
has 
already 
undertaken 
the 
following 
actions: 
e 
Amendments 
to 
TEWA 
and 
the 
Industrial 
Disputes Acts 
were enacted 
in 
January 2003. 
Accordingly, 
a 
maximum 
time 
frame 
for 
settlement 
of 
labour 
disputes 
has 
been 
set 
and 
the 
Labour 
Commissioner 
is 
required 
to 
use 
the 
termination 
compensation 
formula 
to 
be 
published 
in 
the 
Government 
gazette. 
The 
formula 
will 
be 
in 
line 
with 
international 
practices. 
. 
e 
The 
Factories 
(Amendment) 
Act 
No. 
19 
of 
2002 
enacted 
to 
harmonize 
labour  legislation 
with 
international 
practice. 
e 
The 
first 
of 
17 
proposed 
country-wide 
Job 
Information 
Centers 
(Jobs 
Net) 
has 
been 
set 
up. 
The 
centers 
will 
help 
potential 
employers connect 
with 
job 
seekers. 
e 
The Government 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
LO 
is 
considering 
various designs and 
funding 
options 
for 
an 
Unemployment 
Benefit 
(UB) 
scheme 
that 
would provide 
appropriate  short-term 
income 
support 
for 
retired 
workers. 
However, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
tight 
fiscal 
space, 
we 
are 
keen 
to 
minimize 
the 
fiscal 
burden 
of 
any such 
scheme 
on 
the 
budget.

Land 
Market 
Reforms. 
Land 
market reforms 
are an 
important 
element 
of 
the Government’s 
strategy 
to 
increase 
productivity 
in 
the 
rural 
agricultural 
economy. 
The 
majority 
of 
land 
in 
Sri 
Lanka 
is 
owned 
by 
the 
state, 
but 
farmed 
by 
private 
farmers 
under 
various 
tenure agreements 
with 
restrictions 
on 
sale,  lease, 
and 
collateralization. 
The 
land 
grants under 
the 
Land 
Development Ordinance 
(LDO) 
and 
Land 
Grants (Special 
Provision) 
Act 
constitute a large 
portion 
of 
small-scale 
paddy lands that 
are 
held 
by 
private 
farmers 
in 
this 
manner. 
Granting 
farmers  clear 
titles 
for 
their 
land, 
thus 
giving

independent 
control 
over 
land 
management and 
access 
to 
collateralized 
credit, 
is 
the 
Government’s 
priority 
action 
in 
the 
land 
market 
reform 
program. 
In 
addition, 
the 
existing 
land 
administration 
system 
is 
based 
on 
a 
deed 
registration 
system, 
which 
reduces 
the 
efficiency 
of 
land 
transactions, 
tenure security, and 
land 
market 
choices. 
In 
this 
connection, we 
have already undertaken 
the 
following 
actions:

The 
Government 
is 
preparing a draft 
Land 
Ownership 
Law 
to 
convert 
land 
grants 
under 
the 
LDO 
Act 
and 
the 
Land 
Grants 
(Special Provisions) 
Act 
to freehold 
lands 
to 
facilitate 
marketable 
freehold  or 
leasehold 
titles. 
This 
law 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
presented 
to 
Parliament 
in 
July 
2003. 
The 
Survey 
Act 
No. 
17 
of 
2002 
was 
passed 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
land 
titling 
requirements. 
The 
Government 
is 
preparing 
amendments 
to 
the 
Registration 
of 
Title 
Act 
No.

1998 
to improve 
its 
efficiency 
and coverage. 
A

Power 
Sector 
Reforms. 
In 
recognition 
of 
major 
structural 
weaknesses 
the Government 
has 
embarked 
on 
a 
comprehensive 
power 
sector 
reform 
program. 
The 
vertically 
integrated 
Ceylon Electricity Board 
(CEB) 
has 
Rs 
42 
billion 
in 
long-term 
debt 
plus 
Rs 
6 
billion 
in 
debt service 
arrears 
owed 
to 
the Treasury, and Rs15 
billion 
in 
short-term 
debt 
owed 
to 
state 
banks.  Excessive 
reliance 
on 
hydropower 
has 
resulted 
in 
power 
cuts and widespread 
disruptions 
to 
industry 
whenever 
drought conditions 
prevail. 
Reliance 
on 
expensive 
thermal 
energy 
(e.g. 
under 
drought 
conditions)  and 
unwillingness 
to 
pass 
on 
increased 
costs 
to 
consumers 
have 
further 
deteriorated 
CEB’s 
already  weak 
financial 
situation-the 
cumulative 
result 
of 
past 
poor 
governance, 
weak 
managerial 
capacity, 
inefficiencies, 
and 
lack 
of 
accountability. 
To 
address 
these 
structural 
weaknesses 
and 
with 
the support 
of 
the 
ADB 
through a Power 
Sector 
Adjustment 
Operation, the Government 
has 
already 
undertaken 
the 
following 
actions: 
0 
0 
The 
average 
electricity 
tariff 
rate 
was 
increased 
by 
38  percent 
in 
April 
2002 
to 
contain 
further 
accumulation 
of 
CEB 
losses. 
Unbundled 
the 
CEB, 
as 
provided for 
under 
the 
Electricity 
Reform 
Act 
of 
2002, 
by 
October 
2003. 
This 
restructuring 
is 
seen 
as 
an 
essential 
step 
to 
increase 
efficiency, 
accountability, 
and 
minimize 
outside 
interference. 
The 
Electricity 
Reforms 
Bill 
was 
passed 
in 
Parliament 
in 
December  2002, 
paving 
the 
way 
for 
its 
restructuring. 
The Public 
Utilities 
Commission 
(PUC) 
Bill 
to 
set 
up 
a 
multi-sector 
infrastructure regulatory 
agency, 
having regulatory power 
over 
public 
utilities including 
electricity, 
was 
passed 
in 
Parliament 
in 
December 
2002 
and the 
regulatory 
body 
to 
cover 
electricity 
sector 
was 
established 
in 
December 2002. 
A 
financial 
recovery 
plan 
to 
restore 
the 
viability 
of 
CEB’s 
successor 
entities 
and 
to 
settle 
its 
short-term 
debt 
is 
being 
formulated.

The 
Government 
of 
Sri 
Lanka 
is 
committed 
to 
strengthen 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
financial 
sector 
to 
help 
improve 
its 
contribution  to  private 
sector-led 
growth 
and 
development. 
The inefficiencies 
in 
the 
banking 
sector are 
underlined 
by 
high 
intermediation 
spreads 
and 
narrow 
range 
of 
financial 
instruments. 
The 
high 
level 
of 
non-performing 
loans 
(NPL) 
in 
the 
dominant 
state 
banks-especially 
in 
People’s 
Bank 
(PB)-continue 
to 
mount 
at 
considerable 
expense 
to 
the 
public 
and the 
fiscal 
budget. 
Despite 
two 
re-capitalizations 
in 
1993 and 
1996, 
People’s 
Bank 
again 
has 
a negative net 
worth 
due 
to inadequate governance structures 
(reflected 
in 
past 
political 
interference 
in 
credit 
decisions). 
In 
view 
of 
PB’s 
high 
level 
of 
NPLs 
and 
the 
high 
fiscal 
burden 
of 
any 
recapitalization, 
the 
Government 
is 
treating the 
Financial 
Sector 
Reforms.

restructuring 
of 
PB 
as 
an 
urgent 
priority.  Curtailing 
government 
borrowing 
from 
the 
banking 
system 
is 
also 
a pre-requisite 
to 
foster 
competition 
among banks 
on 
the 
lending 
side-fiscal 
consolidation 
will 
complement 
specific 
financial 
sector 
reforms. 
We 
have already undertaken 
the 
following 
actions: 
We 
have 
publicly 
announced our 
intent 
to 
restructure 
the 
PB. 
The 
People’s 
Bank 
Restructuring Committee 
was 
appointed 
in 
January 2003 
to 
oversee 
its 
reforms. 
The 
process 
to 
hire 
the 
services 
of 
a 
financial 
adviser 
to 
assist 
the 
restructuring 
of 
PB 
has 
been 
initiated. 
The 
World 
Bank-funded  Economic Reforms 
Technical 
Assistance 
(ERTA) 
project 
is 
supporting 
this 
effort.  The 
adviser 
will 
formulate 
appropriate options 
for 
restructuring. The options 
being 
considered 
for 
reform 
are 
to 
commercialize 
it 
as 
a 
single 
entity 
or 
after separating 
it 
into 
viable 
sub-units 
in 
an open and 
transparent process. 
This 
would 
be 
in 
full 
accordance 
with 
the 
Banking 
Act. 
Amendments 
to 
the 
Monetary 
Law 
Act 
were 
enacted 
in 
Parliament 
to 
provide 
the 
CBSL 
more 
control 
over 
its 
monetary 
instruments and strengthen 
its 
role 
as 
the 
commercial bank 
regulator 
and supervisor. 
To 
strengthen the 
integrity 
of 
the 
banking 
system, 
the 
minimum 
Capital 
Adequacy 
Ratio 
(CAR) 
was 
raised 
to 
10 
percent 
for 
all 
domestic 
banking 
units 
from 
January 
1, 
2003 and 
on 
a 
consolidated 
basis 
on 
all 
domestic 
and 
foreign banking 
units 
effective 
December 
31, 
2003. 
Amendments 
to 
the 
Securities 
Commission 
Act, 
which 
increase the 
regulatory 
scope 
of 
the 
agency 
to 
a 
broad 
range 
of 
financial 
institutions, 
were passed 
by 
Parliament 
in 
January 2003. 
To 
increase 
market penetration 
and 
efficiency 
of 
the insurance 
industry, 
the 
state 
owned 
Sri 
Lanka 
Insurance 
Corporation (SLIC) 
was 
privatized. 
19. 
Other 
Structural 
Reforms. 
The 
program 
for 
reform 
and 
liberalization 
of 
external 
trade, 
launched 
in 
1977, 
left 
untouched many 
important 
distortions 
and 
barriers 
to 
productivity growth 
across 
the economy. 
These 
lingering 
obstacles 
have made 
Sri 
Lanka 
relatively 
less 
attractive 
to 
foreign 
investment 
and 
unfriendly 
to 
competitive private 
sector 
participation. 
To 
address these 
issues, 
the 
Government 
of 
Sri 
Lanka 
is 
already 
acting 
on 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
structural 
reforms:

Further 
Twelve 
percent 
of 
Government 
shares 
of 
Sri 
Lanka 
Telecom 
(SLT) 
were 
sold through 
an 
PO 
in 
December 
2002. 
To 
enhance 
competition 
in 
the 
telecommunications 
sector, 
access 
to 
international 
gateways 
was 
liberalized 
in 
January 
2003. 
The Govemment 
has 
initiated 
the 
process 
of 
sale 
of 
the 
Colombo 
Hilton 
Hotel 
and 
the 
retail 
operations 
of 
the 
Cooperative 
Wholesale Establishment 
(CWE) 
in 
2003. 
The Petroleum 
Products  Special 
Provisions 
Act 
was 
adopted and made 
effective 
in 
August 
2002 
to 
provide 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
the 
import, 
export, 
sale, 
supply, 
and 
distribution 
of 
petroleum 
products. 
The Government 
intends 
to 
unbundle 
the 
Ceylon Petroleum Corporation 
(CPC) 
into 
three 
competitive 
distribution 
units 
plus 
a 
common 
use 
facility 
with 
a 
view 
to 
introduce a 
competition 
in 
this 
sector. 
Part 
of 
CPC 
has 
already been divested.

20. 
Education 
Sector. 
Sri 
Lanka 
enjoys 
impressive 
basic education attainment, 
on 
which 
the 
PRSP 
aims 
to 
build 
on, 
to 
attain 
100 
percent 
secondary 
enrollment 
by 
2010 
(net 
primary 
enrollment 
rates 
already 
exceeded 
100 
percent 
in 
late 
1990s). 
However, 
the 
quality 
of 
education 
and returns 
to 
education 
in 
the 
job 
market 
remain 
low. 
For 
example, 
only 
5 
percent 
of 
students 
were exposed 
to 
computers 
in 
2000 
(a 
low 
penetration 
level 
even compared 
to 
countries 
with 
comparable income). 
A 
considerable disconnect exists 
between 
the 
skills 
the 
market 
demands 
and the 
skills 
the 
system supplies. 
A 
larger 
role for 
the 
private 
sector 
and the 
local 
community 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
flexible, 
high 
quality 
education 
services 
is 
envisioned 
for 
those 
who 
are 
relatively 
well 
off, enabling 
the 
Government 
to 
focus 
its 
resources 
on improving 
access 
and service

quality 
in 
poor 
communities. 
Towards 
this 
end, 
the Government 
of 
Sri 
Lanka 
is 
already 
acting 
on 
a wide 
range 
of 
structural reforms, 
including: 
0 
0 
Further 
accelerating 
teacher 
training. 
0

Continuing 
its 
liberal 
licensing 
policy for 
private 
schools. 
Augmenting existing 
basic 
facilities 
in 
rural 
schools. 
Further 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
tertiary education 
and enhancing 
market 
relevance.

Health 
Sector. 
Notwithstanding 
its 
overall 
good 
performance since independence-having 
achieved 
developed 
country 
standards 
in 
many  indicators 
already-the 
health 
care 
system 
faces  several 
major 
challenges, 
including 
a 
resurgence 
of 
malaria 
and 
high 
levels 
of 
undernourishment  and  anemia among 
pregnant and 
lactating 
mothers. 
The 
following 
are 
included 
among the actions that we 
intend 
to 
undertake 
to 
improve 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
health 
sector: 
0 
0 
0 
Continuing 
the 
improvement 
of 
the 
nutrition 
levels 
for 
infants, children, 
and 
pregnant women, 
to 
ensure 
prevention 
of 
disease 
and 
productive 
lifestyles. 
Continuing 
the 
implementation 
of 
prevention 
and 
control 
programs 
for 
malaria 
and 
HIV/AIDS. 
Capitalizing 
on 
Sri 
Lanka’s 
long 
standing 
strengths 
in 
social 
mobilization 
to 
expand the 
provision 
of 
safe 
drinking 
water and sanitation 
services. 
In 
urban 
areas, 
the 
private 
sector 
will 
be 
encouraged 
to 
play 
an 
increasing 
role 
in 
these 
activities. 
22. 
Social 
Safety 
Net. 
The 
Government recognizes that basic 
assistance 
and 
income 
support 
through a 
well-targeted  safety 
net program 
is 
still 
required 
for 
some 
chronically poor 
and 
disadvantaged groups, 
as 
well 
as 
people 
who 
may 
require a temporary cushion 
from 
shocks. 
According 
to 
the 
World 
Bank’s Poverty 
Assessment, 
the 
Samurdhi 
program 
does 
not 
assist  some 
40 
percent 
of 
the 
poorest 
quintile. 
In 
this 
connection, the 
Government 
has 
already undertaken the 
following 
actions: 
0 
0 
Enacting 
the 
Welfare Benefits 
Act 
in 
September 
2002 
with 
a 
view 
to 
de-politicizing 
the 
process 
and 
better 
targeting 
the beneficiaries. 
Formulating 
clear 
eligibility 
and 
exit 
criteria 
(this 
is 
being 
carried out 
with 
World 
Bank 
assistance). 
23. 
Addressing 
gender 
disparities 
in 
participation 
in 
policy-making 
processes, 
promoting 
gender 
equality 
in 
the 
labour 
force,  and the 
protection 
of 
women’s 
rights 
are 
viewed 
by 
the 
Govemment 
of 
Sri 
Lanka 
as 
central 
to 
main 
streaming 
gender 
in 
anti-poverty 
efforts. 
In 
this 
connection, 
the 
following 
actions 
are 
under 
preparation 
or 
have already been undertaken: 
Gender Dimensions.

24. 
In 
line 
with 
the 
Women’s 
Charter and the 
Women’s 
Manifesto, 
the 
Government 
proposes 
formulating 
amendments 
to 
the 
election 
laws 
in 
consultation 
with 
the 
political 
parties represented 
in 
the 
Parliament 
to 
enable 
adequate 
representation 
of 
women 
in 
the 
nominations 
to 
the 
legislative 
organs 
of 
the Government. 
A 
detailed 
analysis 
of 
gender  bias 
in 
public 
services 
has 
been  undertaken,  and 
efforts 
are 
being 
strengthened 
to 
integrate gender 
into 
budgeting, personnel 
policies 
and 
program 
design. 
Empowerment 
of 
Communities. 
The 
Government 
of 
Sri 
Lanka 
believes 
that empowerment 
of 
local 
communities 
and 
civil 
society 
to 
play 
a 
greater 
role 
in 
the management 
of 
their 
day 
to 
day 
affairs 
is 
central 
to 
the 
battle 
against 
poverty. 
The 
results 
of 
the 
Community 
Driven 
Development 
(CDD) 
pilot 
initiative 
currently 
undertaken 
in 
the 
Mahaweli 
area 
show that the 
CDD 
approach 
is 
powerful 
and 
could 
be 
used 
in 
rural 
and 
agricultural 
development 
efforts, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
management 
of 
Sri 
Lanka’s  fragile natural 
resource 
base. 
The 
CDD 
pilot 
projects 
are 
generating 
useful 
results, 
inculcating notions 
of 
demand 
driven 
systems, 
cost 
sharing, 
and empowerment 
in 
poorer 
segments 
of 
society. 
Building 
on 
the 
positive 
experience 
of 
the 
pilots 
already underway, 
the 
Government 
is 
planning 
the 
following 
actions: 
Page  56

In 
the 
medium 
term, the 
CDD 
approach 
will 
be 
extended 
to 
5 
districts 
in 
the Southern Province, and over 
the 
longer 
term 
the 
program 
will 
be 
scaled 
up 
to 
the 
entire country. 
The 
Government 
intends 
to 
continue 
its 
collaborations 
with 
NGOs 
to 
implement 
programs 
to 
assist 
the 
disabled, the 
elderly, 
the 
orphaned, and other vulnerable 
segments 
of 
society.

Strengthening 
Governance 
in 
the Public 
Sector 
25. 
Governance 
and 
Civil 
Service 
Reforms. 
The 
Government 
of 
Sri 
Lanka 
is 
committed 
to 
carrying 
out 
substantial 
public 
sector 
governance and 
civil 
service 
reforms. 
Sri 
Lanka 
has 
one 
of 
the largest 
public 
service 
cadres 
in 
the 
world on 
a 
per 
capita 
basis. 
The 
public 
sector 
suffers 
from 
tremendous overstaffing, 
poor 
service 
delivery,  duplicate institutions,  administrative 
fragmentation,  and inadequate decentralization. 
The poor 
bear 
a 
disproportionate 
share 
of 
the 
cost 
of 
sub-standard 
governance. 
In 
addition, 
bottlenecks 
in 
critical 
government 
functions 
amount 
to 
additional 
costs 
and delays 
for 
commercial activity. 
Although 
Sri 
Lanka 
has 
a 
history 
of 
a 
relatively 
professional 
civil 
service 
cadre, 
it 
has 
seen 
a  gradual  decline 
into 
politicization 
and 
patronage, since the 
abolition 
of 
the Independent 
Public 
Services 
Commission 
(PSC) 
in 
1972. 
In 
the  near 
term, 
we 
will 
focus 
on 
creating  a 
more 
streamlined, 
efficient, 
decentralized,  and 
accountable 
public 
administration. 
We 
are 
also aware that 
administrative 
reforms 
need 
to 
be 
complemented 
by 
sound 
public 
expenditure 
management. 
The 
recently  completed 
World 
Bank 
Country 
Procurement 
Assessment 
Report 
(CPAR)  and Country 
Financial Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA), 
as 
well 
as 
the 
ongoing  Public 
Expenditure 
Review 
(PER), 
will 
form 
the  basis 
for 
our 
comprehensive  expenditure 
management 
system. 
Progress 
has 
already  been 
made 
in 
reforming 
this 
critical 
interface 
between 
the 
Government 
and 
the 
population: 
The 
17th 
Amendment 
to 
the 
Constitution 
reestablishing an independent 
PSC 
was 
passed 
in 
Parliament. 
The 
new 
PSC began operations 
in 
January 
2003. 
Submitted 
a 
Bill 
to 
Parliament 
for 
a 
fully 
funded 
pension system 
for 
new 
recruits to 
the 
public 
sector. 
The Expenditure 
Reform 
Commission 
initiated 
a “zero-based” 
review 
of 
Government 
agency 
structures, 
functions,  and 
staffing 
in 
March 
2002 
with 
the 
goal 
of 
encouraging 
consolidation 
of 
Government 
functions 
and 
eliminating 
duplications. 
An 
across-the-board 
civil

been 
in 
effect 
since 
last 
year. 
An 
Administrative 
Reforms  Committee  chaired 
by 
the 
Secretary 
to 
the 
Prime 
Minister 
has 
been 
constituted 
to 
provide 
policy 
advice and 
help 
coordinate the 
public 
sector 
program.. 
Consultations 
are 
underway 
to 
finalize 
a 
draft  Public

Act  to 
provide 
the 
legal 
basis 
for 
budgeting, 
public 
expenditure 
management, 
and

We 
have 
known for 
a 
long 
time 
what 
steps 
are 
needed 
to 
improve 
economic 
performance, 
but 
often 
these 
steps 
were 
not 
taken due 
to 
the 
absence 
of 
an 
effective 
implementation 
mechanism. 
The 
Government 
has 
now 
introduced 
a 
number 
of 
Steering Committees 
with 
extensive 
private 
sector 
participation, 
to drive 
the 
reform 
process. 
There 
are 
18 
functioning 
Steering Committees  already 
meeting 
to 
iron 
out  the 
priority 
actions 
in 
the 
reform 
program 
in 
their 
respective 
areas. 
Technical 
Assistance 
for 
the Committees 
is 
being 
provided 
through 
the 
World 
Bank’s 
Economic Reforms 
Technical 
Assistance 
Project 
(ERTA). 
The 
Steering 
Committees 
report 
to 
and 
are 
coordinated 
by 
the 
Program Management 
Committee (PMC) 
within 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Policy 
Development 
and 
Implementation 
(MPDI). 
The 
progress 
of 
the Steering Committees 
is 
reported 
by 
the 
PMC 
to 
the 
Economic 
Policy 
Committee 
(EPC) 
chaired 
by 
the 
Prime 
Minister 
and 
represented 
by 
key 
members 
of 
the cabinet, 
MPDI, 
and 
Ministry 
of 
Finance.

Monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
(M&E) 
is 
an 
integral part 
of 
improving 
and 
fine-tuning 
policies 
geared 
towards 
poverty 
reduction. 
Sri 
Lanka's 
PRSP 
highlights 
the 
overall 
plans 
for 
M&E, 
including 
preparations 
to 
strengthen 
monitoring 
capacity and 
to 
fill 
quantitative 
and 
qualitative 
information 
gaps. 
Plans 
to 
improve 
M&E 
already 
include: 
Rationalizing/synchronizing 
the 
Household 
Income 
and 
Expenditure 
Survey 
(HIES), 
Consumer Finance 
and 
Socio-Economic 
Survey 
(CFSES). 
Completing 
a 
poverty 
map 
to 
identify 
geographic pockets 
of 
poverty. 
Introducing 
a mechanism 
to 
track 
the 
poverty 
and 
social 
impact 
of 
policy 
changes. 
Integrating/analyzing North-East poverty 
data 
Building 
capacity 
in 
the 
Department 
of 
Census 
and Statistics (DCS) 
to 
be 
able 
to 
conduct 
the 
HIES 
at 
intervals 
of 
2-3 
years 
Introducing 
continuous stakeholder 
consultation 
in 
M&E 
efforts. 
Implementation 
of 
this 
overall 
framework 
will 
also 
address 
the 
needs 
of 
a Poverty

Social Impact 
Assessment 
(PSIA) 
of

The 
Government 
of 
Sri 
Lanka 
understands 
that 
while 
the 
proposed 
PRSC 
I 
is 
designed 
to 
support 
the 
overall 
implementation 
of 
a 
broad 
set 
of 
reforms 
organized 
around 
the 
country's 
PRSP, 
there 
is 
a 
number 
of 
core 
actions we 
need 
to 
undertake 
which 
will 
trigger 
presentation 
of 
the 
project 
to 
the 
Board 
of 
Directors 
of 
the 
World 
Bank. 
Our 
understanding 
of 
these 
prior 
actions 
for 
PRSC 
I 
is 
summarized 
below. 
Labour 
Market. 
The 
Government 
of 
Sri 
Lanka 
will 
define 
and adopt 
in 
the 
Government 
Gazette 
a 
minimum 
compensation 
formula 
for 
terminated 
workers covered under 
the 
Termination 
of 
Employment 
of 
Workmen 
Act 
(TEWA) 
and 
the 
Industrial 
Disputes 
Act, 
to 
make 
the 
costs associated 
with 
job 
terminations 
transparent 
and predictable. 
The 
Government 
will 
make 
gazette 
announcement 
of 
the effectiveness 
date 
of 
the 
amendments 
in 
the 
labour legislation 
and the compensation 
formula 
by 
20" 
May 
2003. 
Appropriate 
and 
necessary 
action 
shall 
be 
taken 
to 
ensure 
that 
these 
amendments and the compensation 
formula 
are 
implemented 
by 
no 
later 
than

ownership 
in 
a 
manner that 
will 
ensure 
rapid 
and cost 
effective conversion 
with 
the 
involvement 
of 
District

Ownership 
Act 
and 
its 
regulations 
will 
allow 
the 
conversion 
of 
grants 
to 
freehold 
lands, 
including 
those 
which 
were 
sub-divided or 
mortgaged. 
Financid

we 
will 
initiate 
the 
commercialization 
of 
People's 
Bank. 
We 
have  already 
publicly 
announced the 
plan 
to 
restructure  the 
People's 
Bank 
and 
appointed 
a 
Bank 
Restructuring

THE 
STRUCTURAL 
REFORM 
AGENDA 
FOR 
2004 
AND 
BEYOND 
29. 
The Government 
recognizes that 
the 
current 
program 
of 
reforms 
is 
just 
the 
start 
of 
implementation 
of 
“Regaining 
Sri 
Lanka”,  our 
Poverty Reduction 
Strategy. 
The 
core 
reforms 
that we have launched 
- 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
labour, 
land 
and the 
financial 
sector 
- 
will 
move 
to 
full 
implementation 
in 
the 
coming 
period, 
and 
the 
way 
forward 
in 
these 
areas 
is 
already 
well 
known. 
There 
are 
other 
areas 
whose 
implementation 
we 
intend 
to 
initiate 
in 
200314 
and thereafter. 
However, 
these 
actions 
are 
indicative 
only 
and 
would 
be 
refined 
as 
implementation 
of 
the 
program 
advances. 
The 
priority reform 
areas 
are 
summarized 
below. 
Core 
reform 
areas:

in 
activities 
which 
will 
result 
in 
fiscal 
burden

Strengthening 
Outcomes 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation. 
Under 
the 
program 
supported 
by 
the proposed 
PRSC 
11, 
we 
will 
(a) 
complete 
the 
informatioddata 
needs 
assessment 
for 
monitoring 
poverty 
and 
social indicators 
in 
the 
North 
and 
the 
East, 
areas 
which 
have 
not 
been covered 
by 
household 
surveys 
for 
over a 
decade; 
and 
(b) 
develop a 
poverty 
information 
base 
to 
enable 
better 
targeting 
of 
our 
poverty 
programs. 
While 
our 
government 
is 
determined 
to 
make 
steady 
progress 
as 
planned, 
with 
the 
satisfactory 
implementation 
of 
our 
macro-economic and 
structural 
reform 
program 
we 
would 
be 
in 
a 
better 
position 
to 
clearly 
specify 
the 
policy 
content 
of 
the 
2005-2006 
programs, 
in 
line 
with 
the 
broad 
strategy 
in 
Regaining 
Sri

Poverty 
Diagnostics 
and 
Policy 
in 
Sri 
Lanka 
1. 
of 
Sri 
Lanka, 
continued 
commitment 
of 
public 
policy to 
investment 
in 
the 
social 
sectors 
has 
led 
to 
the 
country achieving 
by 
far 
the 
highest 
level 
of 
human 
development 
in 
South 
Asia, and 
higher than 
even that 
of 
some 
wealthier 
countries. 
Moreover, 
a focus 
on 
gender 
equality 
and the 
education 
of 
women 
have 
been permanent features 
of 
Sri 
Lanka’s social 
policies. 
Poverty 
is 
multidimensional 
- 
encompassing 
material 
as 
well 
as 
human deprivation. 
In 
the 
case 
2. 
of 
success 
in 
reducing 
income 
poverty 
is 
apparent 
when 
contrasted 
with 
that 
of 
East 
Asian 
countries that 
were at comparable 
levels 
of 
development 
only 
a 
few 
decades ago. 
In 
the 
1960s, 
Sri 
Lanka’s income per 
capita 
was 
comparable 
to 
that 
of 
Malaysia, 
the 
Republic 
of 
Korea, 
and 
Thailand. 
By 
the 
end 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century, 
income 
in 
Sri 
Lanka 
was 
less 
than 
half 
that 
of 
Thailand, one-fourth 
that 
of 
Malaysia, 
and 
just 
one-tenth that 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Korea. 
A 
significant 
cause 
for 
slow 
poverty reduction 
is 
below 
potential 
economic 
growth. 
Per 
capita 
GDP growth 
in 
Sri 
Lanka 
averaged 
3.8 
percent 
during 
the 
1990s. 
Also, between 1990-91 
and 1995-96, 
inequality 
(as 
measured 
by 
gini 
coefficient 
in 
consumption) 
remained almost 
unchanged. 
Modest 
growth, combined 
with 
no 
redistribution 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
poor 
resulted 
in 
stagnation 
in 
poverty 
rates 
during 
the 
1990s, 
over 
the 
years 
for which 
data are 
available. 
Economic 
development, however, 
has 
lagged consistently 
behind 
social 
development.

primarily 
from 
three 
national 
household consumption 
surveys: 
two 
rounds 
of 
Household Income 
and 
Expenditure 
Surveys 
(HIES) 
conducted 
by 
the 
Department 
of 
Census 
and Statistics 
(DCS) 
in 
1990-91 
and 
1995-96, 
and one 
round 
of 
Consumer 
Finance 
and 
Socio-Economic Survey 
(CFSES) 
by 
the 
Central 
Bank, 
in 
1996-97. 
All 
three 
defined 
the 
poverty 
line 
in 
terms 
of 
the estimated cost (per capita) 
of 
a 
minimum 
food 
and 
non-food 
consumption bundle.’ 
In 
addition, 
the 
Sri 
Lanka 
Integrated 
Survey (SLIS), 
conducted 
in 
1999-2000, 
provides 
important 
insights 
into 
the socio-economic characteristics 
of 
poverty. 
Data 
Sources, 
and Methodology. 
The 
analysis 
of 
poverty 
in 
Sri 
Lanka during 
the 
1990s 
draws 
4. 
Available 
data can 
thus 
tell 
the 
story 
only 
till 
the 
mid-90s, 
since 
no 
nationally 
representative 
household 
survey 
measuring consumption 
is 
available 
since 1996-97. 
Moreover, 
due 
to 
the 
difficult 
situation 
in 
the 
conflict 
areas 
of 
the 
North 
and the 
East, 
all 
the surveys have been unable 
to 
include 
representative 
samples 
of 
these 
areas 
- 
an 
omission 
that leaves the 
picture 
on 
poverty 
somewhat 
incomplete. 
In 
this 
context, 
it 
is 
important 
to 
note 
that 
an 
ongoing 
round 
of 
the 
HIES, 
expected 
to 
be 
completed 
in 
mid-2003, 
will 
not 
only 
address 
the 
question 
of 
what 
has 
happened 
to 
poverty 
since 
the 
mid-90s, 
but 
is 
also 
likely 
to 
provide 
measures 
that 
are 
inclusive 
of 
the 
North 
and

a 
significant 
decline 
between 
1953 
and 
1985.’ 
The 
declining 
trend 
has 
continued 
since 
the 
mid- 
1980s, 
but 
slowed 
during 
the 
early 
1990s. 
Data 
from 
HIES 
suggest 
that absolute 
poverty 
increased 
significantly 
between 
1990/91 
and 
1995/96, 
i.e., 
from 
20 
to 
25 percent, 
according 
to 
the 
lower 
poverty 
line 
(Table 
l).3 
In 
making 
these 
comparisons 
however, 
one 
must 
bear 
in 
mind 
that 
in 
1996 
the 
economy 
was 
hit 
by 
several 
shocks 
- 
including 
a 
prolonged 
drought and 
the escalation 
of 
the 
conflict, 
which 
negatively 
affected 
business confidence, 
tourism, 
and 
foreign 
investment.

Poverty 
in 
Sri 
Lanka 
has 
declined 
since 
independence, 
with 
a 
number 
of 
studies 
’ 
The 
HIES 
used a 
lower 
poverty 
line 
of 
Rs. 
791 
and a 
higher poverty 
line 
of 
Rs. 
950 while 
the 
CFSES 
used a 
Rs. 
860 and 
Rs. 
1,032 
per person 
per 
month 
respectively, 
to 
estimate the 
incidence 
of 
consumption poverty. 
The 
lower poverty 
line 
used 
by 
the 
DCS 
surveys 
was 
also used 
by 
the Poverty 
Assessment 
(World 
Bank, 2001). 
These are estimates 
based 
on 
a 
local 
(reference) 
consumption poverty 
threshold 
of 
2,500 
calories 
and 
53 
grams 
of 
protein 
per day 
and 
male 
adult 
(20-39 
years) 
equivalent, at 1995-96 prices. 
*These 
studies 
included 
World 
Bank 
(1995). 
The results 
using 
a 
“high’ 
and 
a 
“low”  poverty 
line 
can be 
interpreted 
to mean 
that 
most 
of 
those 
living 
below 
the 
lower poverty 
line 
are 
victims 
of 
chronic poverty, 
while 
those 
living 
between the 
lower 
and 
higher poverty 
lines 
are 
vulnerable 
to 
transitory 
poverty.

Regional 
Disparities: 
Looking 
across 
provinces, 
poverty 
is 
found to be 
low 
and 
has 
declined 
rapidly 
in 
the 
Western 
Province 
(Figure

in 
sharp 
contrast 
to 
poor 
provinces 
like 
Uva 
and 
Sabaragamuwa. 
There 
are 
large, 
growing 
disparities 
in 
the 
incidence 
of 
poverty 
across 
regions. 
While 
Western Province, 
where 
the 
capital 
city, 
75 percent 
of 
manufacturing and most 
services 
are 
located, 
has 
a 
headcount 
index 
of 
14 
percent,

people

where small-scale

A 
decomposition 
of 
changes 
in 
the 
Foster, Greer,

measures 
of 
poverty 
reveals that between 
1990191 
and 1995/96, 
lack 
of 
consumption 
growth 
largely 
explains the 
rise 
in 
poverty. 
Favorable 
redistribution offset 
the 
lack 
of 
consumption 
growth 
in 
the 
urban 
sector. 
In 
the 
rural

both growth 
and redistribution 
effects were 
adverse 
(Gunewardena

Sectoral Composition 
of 
Poverty. 
Poverty 
is 
3L7

I 
lower 
and 
has 
unambiguously 
declined 
in 
the 
urban 
sector, 
where 
manufacturing 
and 
services are 
concentrated, 
in 
sharp contrast 
to 
the 
rural 
and 
estate sectors 
(Figures 
2a, 
2b 
& 
2c). 
More 
than 
90 
percent 
of 
all 
poor 
people 
in 
Sri 
Lanka 
live 
in 
rural 
or 
estate 
areas 
(88 
and 4 
percent 
respectively). 
Average 
rural 
consumption 
is 
about 
two-thirds 
of 
urban 
consumption. 
Estate households 
are 
among the 
poorest 
in 
Sri 
Lanka, 
with 
per 
capita consumption 
of 
only 
about 
half 
that 
in 
the 
urban 
sector. 
If 
the 
higher 
poverty 
line 
is 
used, 
the 
estate 
sector 
becomes 
the poorest 
sector 
(poverty 
headcount rises 
to 
45 
percent), 
which 
would 
suggest 
that 
“borderline” 
poverty 
- 
that indicates 
vulnerability 
- 
is 
most prevalent 
in 
the 
estate 
sector. 
Poverty 
in 
the 
estates 
is 
often 
related 
to 
remoteness 
of 
the 
estates, 
which 
restricts 
the 
geographic 
mobility 
of 
estate 
workers 
and 
access 
to 
public 
services. 
Language barriers 
(most 
estate 
workers 
speak 
only 
Tamil) 
and 
discrimination further 
curtail 
their 
ability to 
integrate 
themselves 
into 
the 
Sri 
Lankan 
economy and 
society

finding 
jobs 
outside the

The 
sectors 
with 
the 
highest 
levels 
of 
poverty 
are 
agriculture, 
and 
mining 
and 
quarrying 
(Table 
3). 
Moreover, 
a 
breakdown 
of 
poverty 
by 
occupational 
category reveals 
that 
farmers have the highest 
incidence 
of 
poverty 
(52 
percent). 
The 
level 
of 
poverty 
among 
production 
workers 
is 
also 
quite 
high 
(45 
percent), 
reflecting 
the 
fact 
that 
most 
of 
them 
have 
low 
skills 
and are 
engaged 
in 
providing 
low-value 
goods

to 
small, 
low-income, 
informal 
markets.

closed nature 
of 
the

Although 
education 
is 
free, 
there 
are 
some 
indications 
that the 
quality 
of 
education 
provided to 
the 
poor 
is 
inferior to 
that 
provided 
to 
richer 
households. 
Class 
sizes 
- 
a measurable 
indicator 
of 
education 
quality 
- 
are 
considerably higher 
in 
rural 
areas 
and 
estates 
than 
in 
urban 
areas. 
Language 
of 
instruction 
is 
also 
likely 
to 
be 
important. 
A 
primary 
education 
in 
Tamil, 
for 
instance, 
is 
likely 
to 
yield 
lower 
market returns than 
one 
in 
Sinhalese 
or 
English. 
Basic 
analysis reveals a 
strong 
correlation 
between 
district-level poverty 
incidence 
and 
English 
literacy 
- 
an 
observation 
that 
calls 
for 
further 
research 
on 
the 
relationship 
between 
language 
of 
instruction 
and 
returns 
to 
education.*

On 
health, 
malnutrition, though 
not 
associated 
exclusively 
with 
poverty, 
is 
generally 
regarded 
as 
a 
good indicator. 
Between 
1993 
and 2000, 
the 
prevalence 
of 
stunting 
among 
children 
(under 
5 
years) 
fell 
from 
23.8 
to 
13.5 
percent; that 
of 
wasting 
from 
15.5 
to 
14 percent, and that 
of 
underweight 
children 
from 
37.7 
to 
29.4 percent.’ 
The 
percentage 
of 
children 
born 
with 
low 
birth 
weight 
(an 
indicator 
of 
maternal 
health) 
has 
also 
declined 
from 
19.7 
to 
16.6 percent.” 
These 
numbers 
are 
computed 
using 
the

from

East 
18. 
Part 
of 
Sri 
Lanka's 
difficulties 
in 
raising 
incomes and 
reducing poverty 
can 
be 
traced 
to 
the 
civil 
war, 
which 
has 
gone 
on 
for 
the 
last 
two 
decades. 
While 
the 
humanitarian, social 
and 
economic 
impact 
of 
the 
war 
was 
felt 
most 
directly 
by 
populations 
in 
the 
North 
and East and 
the 
areas 
bordering 
it, 
the 
economic, social, 
and 
psychological 
repercussions 
extend 
far beyond 
the 
theatre 
of 
battle. 
The 
Commissioner General 
of 
Essential 
Services 
has 
estimated that 
the 
number 
of 
persons 
internally 
displaced 
on 
account 
of 
war 
is 
around 
600,000 
(roughly one-third 
of 
the 
population 
in 
the 
conflict 
areas). 
UNHCR 
estimates that 
one-third 
to 
half 
of 
all 
homes have 
been 
damaged 
or 
destroyed 
in 
the 
Province. 
One 
out 
of 
every 12 
households 
in 
the 
North 
reported 
a member 
killed 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
conflict; 
among 
the poorest households, 
it 
was 
one 
in 
seven. 
19. 
Expenditures 
on 
the 
war 
effort, 
which 
consumed about 5 percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
recent 
years, 
crowded 
out 
a 
vast 
range 
of 
pro-growth 
and 
pro-poor 
public 
services. 
The 
instability 
brought 
about 
by 
the 
war 
also reduced 
investment 
and 
job 
creation. 
The 
1999 annual 
report 
of 
the 
Central 
Bank 
of 
Sri 
Lanka 
estimates that the 
conflict 
reduced 
Sri 
Lanka's economic 
growth 
by 
about 
2-3 
percentage 
points 
a year. 
According 
to 
Ministry 
of 
Planning 
estimates, 
the size 
of 
the economy 
of 
the 
Northem 
Province 
shrank 
from US$350 
million 
to 
US$250 
million 
between 
1990 and 
1995.

indicate 
high 
levels 
of 
wasting 
and 
stunting 
among 
children 
and very 
poor nutritional 
status 
of 
women. 
A 
survey 
of 
515 households and 
702 children carried 
out 
in 
Trincomalee 
district 
found 
that 
27 
percent 
of 
children 
under 
5 
were 
stunted, 
26 percent were 
wasted, 
and 
50 
percent were underweight." 
Households 
in 
the 
conflict 
areas 
were also severely 
affected 
in 
terms 
of 
their 
ability to 
obtain 
a 
secure 
1i~elihood.l~ 
Among 
the 
worst affected 
groups 
were 
households that were displaced, 
sometimes 
repeatedly, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
conflict. 
Data 
from 
the 
SLIS 
indicates that one 
of 
the 
most 
common 
reasons 
for 
changing 
the 
place 
of 
residence 
in 
the 
North 
East 
is 
the 
war, 
and that 
nearly 
all 
households that 
moved 
due 
to 
the 
war suffered 
loss 
of 
property 
- 
productive 
assets 
(agricultural 
equipment, 
livestock, 
shops, 
and 
mills), 
and sometimes 
even 
land 
they 
had cultivated 
before 
being 
displaced. 
The 
poor 
tended 
to 
bear 
a 
disproportionate 
share 
of 
the 
costs 
of 
the 
war.

There

unfortunately 
no 
official

conditions 
there have been

difficult

Recent progress 
in 
achieving 
peace 
in 
the 
North-East provides 
much 
cause 
for 
optimism. 
The 
Government and the 
LTTE 
have announced 
a 
cessation 
of 
the 
hostilities, and a 
permanent ceasefire 
in 
February, 
2002 
- 
to 
date, 
the 
longest 
ceasefire 
to 
hold. 
Life 
has 
resumed 
its 
normalcy, 
with 
restrictions 
and 
embargos 
being 
removed, roads re-opened, and 
military 
having 
vacated schools 
and 
other 
public 
buildings. 
There 
is 
also 
a 
concrete 
plan, 
agreed 
upon 
by 
all 
sides, 
for 
post-conflict 
reconstruction, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
future 
federal 
structure 
for 
governance 
in 
the

reduction, and 
these 
are 
broadly 
consistent 
with 
those 
in 
the 
PRSP. 
Although 
Sri 
Lanka 
has 
largely 
achieved the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
on 
human 
development, 
it 
still 
faces 
the challenge 
of 
reducing 
the 
proportion 
of 
its 
population 
living 
in 
poverty 
(currently 
about 
25% 
of 
the 
population). 
Below 
some 
key 
areas 
of 
focus 
for 
achieving 
this 
are 
highlighted. 
Notably, 
some 
elements 
of 
the 
specific 
reform 
agenda 
would 
need 
to 
be 
monitored to 
assess 
impact 
on 
poverty 
and 
on 
disadvantaged groups 
like 
ethnic 
minorities, 
estate 
population, 
and women. 
In 
what 
follows, 
we also 
highlight 
ways 
in 
which 
the 
Poverty 
and 
Social Impact Analysis 
(PSIA) 
of 
these 
policies 
can 
be 
integrated 
into 
the broader 
M&E 
framework. 
The 
diagnostics 
of 
poverty 
briefly 
presented above 
suggest some 
important 
areas 
for 
poverty 
The 
pace 
of 
poverty reduction 
in 
Sri 
Lanka 
will 
benefit 
enormously 
from 
achieving 
higher 
growth 
rates. 
This 
entails 
restoring 
fiscal 
sustainability, 
removal 
of 
factor market 
rigidities, 
improvements 
in 
infrastructure 
like 
the 
road 
network, 
and 
investing 
in 
its 
maintenance and 
sustainability; 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
human 
development services; enhancing the development 
impact 
of 
public 
sector 
governance; and 
reforming 
regulatory 
structures 
to 
improve 
the 
climate 
for 
private 
investment. 
Policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms 
to 
address 
each 
of 
these 
areas--some 
of 
which 
are 
supported under 
the 
PRSC 
program--are expected 
to 
be 
successfully 
implemented, 
given 
that 
peace 
has 
been 
secured. 
Moreover, 
continuity 
and 
predictability 
of 
policies may be 
enhanced 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
recently 
negotiated 
peace 
accord. 
Since 
poverty 
is 
largely 
rural, a 
special 
effort 
is 
essential 
for 
creating 
growth 
opportunities 
in 
the 
rural 
sector. 
Low 
labor 
productivity 
in 
agriculture 
has 
been 
identified 
to 
be 
a 
major 
factor 
behind 
persistent 
rural 
poverty.  Current 
trends 
in 
economic transformation 
show 
a gradual 
shift 
of 
labor 
to 
the 
non-agricultural 
sector, 
which, 
however, 
has 
not 
led 
to 
higher 
productivity 
of 
those 
who remain 
in 
agriculture. 
Yields 
of 
major 
crops have 
either fallen, or 
been 
volatile. 
A 
dominant constraint 
to 
raising productivity 
appears 
to 
be 
excessive government 
intervention 
in 
agricultural commodity 
and 
factor 
markets. 
These 
include restrictive 
land 
policies 
(with 
state 
ownership 
of 
near 
80 
percent 
of 
all 
land) 
which limits 
efficient land 
use 
and 
allocation; regulations 
that 
limit 
technology imports; 
commodity 
price 
interventions; a 
continuing 
emphasis 
on 
input 
and 
credit 
subsidies, at 
the 
expense 
of 
more 
productive 
public 
investments 
on 
infrastructure 
and extension services; 
and  unpredictable 
trade 
policies. 
The 
Government 
has 
initiated 
steps 
towards redressing 
many 
of 
these issues, 
as 
elaborated 
in 
the 
main 
text. 
While 
it 
is 
expected that the proposed 
reforms articulated 
in 
the PRSP 
involving 
liberalization 
of 
the 
commodity 
and 
land 
and other 
factor 
markets 
will 
enhance 
productivity 
and 
incomes 
in 
the 
rural 
sector, 
it 
will 
be 
important 
to 
examine 
how 
these 
reforms 
will 
impact different 
sections 
of 
the 
rural 
sector, 
including 
the 
estates 
where 
deep 
pockets 
of 
poverty 
reside. 
For 
growth 
to 
result 
in 
substantial 
poverty 
reduction, 
it 
must 
translate 
into 
employment, 
particularly 
among the 
youth 
and those 
who 
have 
education 
of 
high 
school 
level 
and 
above. 
The

the 
problem 
is 
apparent 
from 
statistics 
- 
in 
1997/98, 
30 
percent 
in 
the 
age 
group 
of 
19-25 
years, 
and 
24 
percent 
among 
those 
with 
GCE 
(A-Level) qualifications 
were 
unemployed. 
This 
suggests 
the 
need 
for 
more 
appropriate 
skills 
training 
in 
secondary 
and higher 
education, 
provided 
that 
growth 
does 
translate 
into 
job 
creation. 
A 
human 
development strategy 
must 
therefore 
focus 
on 
quality 
of 
services delivered, 
coupled 
with 
deregulation 
of 
restrictive policies 
that 
distort 
incentives 
in 
the 
labor 
market. 
Of 
particular 
importance 
would 
be 
to 
track 
how 
the 
deregulation 
of 
the 
labor 
market 
differentially 
impact 
employment 
and 
wages across 
groups, 
including 
the 
poor 
and 
disadvantaged. 
For 
example, 
it 
will 
be 
especially 
important to 
see 
whether 
these 
reforms 
reduce the 
gender 
differential 
in 
wages, 
and 
increase 
employment opportunities 
for 
those 
in 
isolated 
areas. 
Existing 
studies appear 
to 
suggest 
that such 
policies 
will 
tend 
to 
have 
a 
positive 
impact 
for 
most 
groups. 
Direct 
interventions 
to 
address 
poverty 
and 
human 
deprivation 
is 
also 
a 
priority, 
to 
ensure 
equitable 
distribution 
of 
the 
benefits 
of 
growth. 
While 
universal 
access 
to 
education and 
health 
services 
has 
been 
a 
significant 
achievement 
of 
Sri 
Lanka, 
quality 
of 
services 
for 
the 
poor, especially 
in 
education, 
remains an 
issue. 
Immediate attention 
is 
also warranted 
in 
areas 
of 
child 
and maternal 
nutrition, 
deficiencies 
in 
which 
lead 
to 
long-term 
impairments 
in 
learning 
and development. 
This 
would 
also 
entail 
improving 
access 
to 
basic 
infrastructure, 
like 
sanitation 
and 
safe 
water, 
as 
well 
as 
to 
community 
level 
facilities, 
particularly 
in 
rural 
and 
estate 
areas. 
Basic 
assistance 
and 
income 
support 
through 
well-targeted 
safety 
net 
programs 
would 
still 
be 
required 
for 
some 
chronically poor 
and disadvantaged groups 
as 
well 
as 
people 
who 
may require a 
temporary 
cushion 
from 
shocks. 
The major Welfare 
system 
of 
Sri 
Lanka 
- 
the 
Samurdhi 
program 
- 
as 
it 
has 
existed 
during 
recent 
years 
has 
suffered 
from 
flaws 
in 
design 
that 
has 
led 
to 
enormous 
mis- 
targeting, 
which 
have 
considerably reduced 
its 
impact.

The 
main 
component 
of 
the 
Samurdhi 
program 
(comprising 
about 
80 
percent 
of 
the 
total program 
budget) 
is 
a consumption 
grant 
in 
the 
form 
of 
food 
stamps 
to 
households. 
An 
evaluation 
of 
the 
program 
suggests 
that the 
program 
misses 
about 
40 
percent 
of 
households 
ranked 
in 
the 
poorest 
quintile, 
while 
almost 
44 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
Samurdhi 
transfer 
budget 
is 
spent 
on 
households 
from 
the 
top 
3 quintiles. 
Furthermore, 
targeting 
errors 
are 
not 
random, 
but 
rather 
reflect flaws 
in 
the 
design 
of 
the 
program. 
Qualitative 
results 
suggest 
that 
ethnic 
status, 
and 
party 
affiliation 
or 
voting 
preferences 
influence allocation 
of 
Samurdhi 
grants.  Because the 
program 
covers around 
half 
of 
the 
population 
(to 
the 
extent 
of 
2 
million 
households), 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
program 
on 
the 
poor 
is 
limited 
by 
the 
generally 
small 
size 
of 
the transfer. 
Recognizing 
the 
above, 
the 
Government 
of 
Sri 
Lanka 
(GoSL) 
has 
enacted the 
Welfare 
Benefits 
Act, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
firstly, 
rationalize 
all 
social welfare 
programs 
and 
secondly, 
to 
de-politicize 
and 
improve 
the 
targeting 
efficiency 
of 
Samurdhi 
in 
particular. 
This 
involves 
setting 
up 
an 
independent 
Board 
and 
lower 
level 
Selection 
Committees 
to 
set 
eligibility 
criteria, validate entry 
and 
exit 
into 
the program, and 
credibly 
redress 
complaints. 
The 
reform 
process also 
involves 
setting 
objective 
criteria 
for 
selection 
of 
beneficiaries 
of 
Samurdhi 
through 
means-testing, 
credible 
enforcement 
of 
these 
criteria 
on 
the ground, and the 
concomitant 
development 
of 
a 
complete 
database 
of 
beneficiaries 
to 
track entry 
into 
and 
exit 
from 
the 
program. 
Through 
these 
reforms, the government aims 
to 
achieve 
depoliticization 
and 
rationalization 
of 
the 
selection 
process 
in 
Samurdhi 
cash transfers, 
which 
will 
in 
turn 
lead 
more 
efficient 
targeting 
and 
lower 
rates 
of 
exclusion 
of 
deserving 
beneficiaries. 
By 
concentrating available 
resources among 
those 
who 
need 
it 
the 
most 
at 
a certain 
point 
of 
time, 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
program 
as 
a social 
protection 
against 
shocks 
will 
be 
enhanced. 
In 
the 
longer 
run, 
the 
entire 
welfare 
system, 
comprising 
of 
a 
large number 
of 
smaller 
programs 
in 
addition 
to 
Samurdhi, 
are 
envisaged 
to 
be 
integrated 
into 
the 
system. 
Technical 
support 
to 
devise an 
objective 
set 
of 
criteria 
for 
selection 
into 
the 
program 
is 
being 
provided 
by 
the 
World 
Bank. 
Full 
implementation 
of 
the 
reformed 
structure 
is 
tentatively 
expected 
by 
July, 2003.

Monitoring 
and Evaluation 
(M&E) 
is 
an 
intrinsic part 
of 
improving 
and 
fine-tuning 
policies 
geared 
towards poverty-reduction. 
The 
PRSP 
highlights 
the 
overall 
plans 
for 
M&E 
by 
GoSL. 
The 
M&E 
framework 
will 
entail 
5 
critical 
components, 
which 
will 
also 
address 
the 
needs 
of 
a 
Poverty 
and 
Social Impact Analysis 
(PSIA) 
of 
policy 
reforms. 
o 
Rationalize 
the 
existing 
surveys, 
like 
the 
HIES 
and 
CFSES 
- 
which 
are 
included 
in 
the 
M&E 
framework outlined 
by 
the 
PRSP 
- 
to 
regularize 
their periodicity, 
synchronize 
their timing, 
and 
strengthen 
some 
modules (especially 
in 
the 
area 
of 
human 
development) 
to 
track indicators 
related 
to 
quality 
of 
services. 
Introduce 
a mechanism 
to 
track 
the 
poverty 
and 
social impact 
of 
policy 
changes. 
For 
the 
aforementioned 
Welfare 
reform, 
two 
components are 
currently 
being 
discussed: 
(i) 
a Poverty 
Map 
to 
identify 
geographic 
areas 
of 
isolation 
and 
poverty, 
which 
will 
aid 
targeting 
of 
poverty 
programs 
in 
general, 
(ii) 
an 
in-built 
monitoring 
system 
of 
the 
Welfare 
program to 
track 
improvements 
in 
indicators 
of 
poverty 
that 
will 
help 
with 
identifying 
movement 
of 
beneficiaries 
in 
and 
out 
of 
the 
program. 
To 
monitor 
the 
impact 
of 
broader 
policy 
measures 
that 
are 
likely 
to 
have 
varying 
effects 
across 
heterogeneous 
groups, 
like 
land 
and 
labor 
policies, 
the 
existing 
HIES 
may 
provide 
some answers, 
along 
some 
basic dimensions 
of 
poverty. 
Additionally, 
other 
components 
of 
the 
existing 
M&E 
framework, 
like 
the 
Labor 
Force 
surveys 
and the 
Demographic 
and 
Health 
Survey 
could 
be tailored to 
address 
the 
impact 
of 
specific 
policies. The 
concern here 
is 
to 
do 
with 
the 
frequency (currently 
once 
every 
5 
years) 
of 
both 
the 
HIES 
and 
the 
DHS. 
With 
the 
peace 
accord and 
post-conflict 
reconstruction efforts, 
an 
opportunity 
now 
arises 
for 
understanding 
poverty 
in 
the 
North-East. 
A 
special 
study 
of 
this 
region 
is 
currently being 
undertaken 
by 
the 
World 
Bank. 
The 
HIES 
and 
other 
surveys 
will 
need 
to 
be representative 
of 
this 
region, and 
the 
current 
HIES 
on 
the 
ground 
appears 
to 
have accomplished 
this 
goal. 
An 
integral part 
of 
poverty 
monitoring 
and 
impact 
is 
also 
the 
Participatory 
component 
to 
assess 
access 
and 
consumer 
satisfaction 
issues. 
While 
the PRSP acknowledges 
its 
importance, 
regularizing 
this 
component remains an 
outstanding 
concern. 
Finally, 
and 
perhaps 
most crucial, 
is 
the 
institutional 
arrangements 
to 
coordinate 
the 
M&E 
system 
and 
promote 
incentives 
for 
its 
use 
in 
policy 
and 
budgetary decision-making. 
An 
immediate concern 
would 
be 
to 
enhance 
capacity 
of 
the 
DCS 
to 
be 
able 
to 
conduct 
the 
HIES 
at 
intervals 
of 
2-3 
years 
(currently, 
two 
agencies 
- 
the 
DCS 
and 
the 
Central 
Bank 
- 
alternate 
in 
fielding 
two 
similar 
surveys, 
which 
is 
both 
inefficient 
and 
raise problems 
with 
comparability). 
Once the 
DCS 
is 
empowered 
with 
sole 
responsibility, 
it 
will 
facilitate 
rationalizing 
of 
the 
poverty 
monitoring 
system 
along 
the dimensions described 
above, 
and 
will 
improve 
capacity 
and 
prospects 
for 
developing 
a multipurpose household 
surveys 
(like 
the 
LSMS) to 
aid 
the 
deepening 
of 
the diagnostics and 
monitoring 
of 
poverty.

Rural 
Sector 
Introduction 
1. 
About 
80 
percent 
of 
Sri 
Lanka’s 
population 
and 
90 
percent 
of 
the 
country’s poor 
live 
in 
rural 
and 
estate 
areas. 
More 
than 
half 
of 
the 
rural 
poor 
are 
dependent 
on 
small-scale 
agriculture 
and 
wage 
labor 
on 
farms and 
plantations 
as 
the 
main 
source 
of 
their income 
Thus, 
sespite 
its 
declining contribution to 
GDP 
(20% 
in 
2000), 
the 
agricultural 
sector 
(including livestock 
and fisheries) 
remains 
vital for 
employment 
and 
income 
generation. 
Directly 
employing 
about 
40% 
of 
the 
total 
labor 
force 
in 
the 
country, 
the 
agricultural 
sector 
also contributes 
to 
employment 
generation 
indirectly, 
as 
agro-based 
industries’ 
account 
for 
about 
65% 
of 
employment 
the 
industrial 
sector 
(including 
firms 
with 
5 
or 
more 
employees). 
Thus, 
fostering 
more 
rapid rural 
development, 
particularly raising 
the 
productivity 
and competitiveness, 
and 
accelerating the 
growth 
of 
the 
agricultural 
and 
rural 
non-farm 
sectors, 
are 
critical 
elements 
to 
achieving 
faster 
overall 
economic 
growth, 
and 
hence, 
poverty 
reduction 
in 
Sri 
Lanka. 
More 
rapid growth 
in 
the 
agricultural 
and 
rural 
non-fann 
sectors 
will 
both 
directly 
and 
indirectly 
contribute to 
generating 
greater 
opportunities 
for 
employment 
and 
income 
growth 
in 
rural 
areas. 
In 
addition, 
by 
contributing 
to 
increased 
rural 
incomes, 
this 
will 
build 
a strong 
foundation 
for 
consumer demand 
in 
rural 
areas, 
which 
could 
in 
turn 
would 
stimulate 
growth 
in 
other economic 
sectors. 
Constraints 
to 
Agricultural and 
Rural 
Non-Farm Growth 
2. 
agricultural growth. 
Intended 
to 
assist 
the 
agricultural 
sector 
to 
shift 
from 
low-value 
to 
high-value 
production, 
the 
measures 
also 
aimed 
at 
improving productivity 
and 
international 
competitiveness 
so 
as 
to 
put 
the 
sector 
on 
a 
higher 
growth 
trajectory. 
The 
policy 
reforms included 
various 
private 
sector 
investment 
incentive 
schemes (e.g. 
concessionary credit, 
duty 
waivers 
and tax holidays 
on 
new 
investments), 
increasing 
trade, 
seed 
distribution 
and 
commodity 
market 
liberalization, 
including 
the 
closure 
of 
the Paddy 
Marketing 
Board. 
The 
anticipated supply and 
agricultural 
growth 
response, 
however, 
has 
been 
slow 
to 
materialize. 
3. 
government’s 
goals. 
Among 
the hindrances 
are 
unpredictable 
trade 
policies; 
highly 
restrictive 
quarantine 
regulations; delays 
in 
passing 
key 
seed 
and 
phyto-sanitary 
regulations, 
which 
limit 
technology 
access; 
commodity price 
interventions; 
restrictive 
land 
policies; 
and 
poorly functioning 
water 
delivery 
systems. 
The 
combined 
effect 
of 
these measures 
was 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
complex 
and 
multi-dimensional 
maze 
of 
obstacles, 
which 
ultimately 
dampened 
agricultural 
productivity 
growth, 
hindered diversification 
and 
reduced 
opportunities 
for 
raising agricultural 
incomes. 
Further, 
they 
contributed 
to 
raising 
operating 
costs, 
reducing agricultural 
profitability, 
increasing 
price 
and 
market 
risks, 
diminishing 
competitiveness; 
and 
- 
overall 
-- 
discouraging 
productivity-enhancing 
investments and 
private-sector participation. 
A 
continuing 
emphasis 
on 
input 
subsidies 
with 
limited 
short-term 
impact 
(e.g. 
fertilizer, 
water, 
seeds) 
also 
diverted 
scarce 
public 
resources away 
from 
critical productivity- 
and 
efficiency-enhancing 
investments 
(rural 
roads, 
electricity, 
markets, research and extension) that 
could 
have 
had 
a 
more 
lasting impact 
on 
growth. 
Even 
where 
limited 
investments have been made 
in 
some 
sectors 
(e.g. 
irrigation, 
roads, 
research 
and extension), inadequate emphasis and 
funding 
for 
operations and maintenance 
has 
sapped 
their 
potential. 
4. 
Although 
the 
more 
rapid 
development 
of 
the 
rural 
non-farm 
sector 
is 
critical 
to 
raising 
and 
sustaining 
agricultural 
and 
rural 
growth, 
a 
number 
of 
policy 
and 
structural impediments 
hinder 
necessary 
progress. 
The 
non-farm 
sector 
is 
increasing 
in 
importance 
to rural 
households 
as 
a 
source 
of 
income 
-- 
about 
56% 
of 
the 
total 
by 
1999-2000. 
An 
analysis 
of 
the 
composition 
of 
rural 
non-farm 
incomes 
reveals, 
Since 
1996, 
the 
Government 
of 
Sri 
Lanka 
adopted several 
policy 
measures 
aimed 
at 
hastening 
A 
number 
of 
other

Agro-industries include: 
(i) 
food, 
beverage 
and tobacco; 
(ii) 
textile,

products 
and 
fumiture.

however, that the 
more 
income-vulnerable households 
(bottom 
40% 
in 
rural 
expenditure 
quintiles) 
depend 
in 
the 
main 
on 
lower-paying 
and 
distinctly 
less 
secure, 
casual, 
non-agricultural 
wage 
labor. 
Macro- 
economic 
and 
trade 
policies, 
labor 
rules, and government 
intervention 
marketing, 
however, 
hinder 
more 
rapid growth 
of 
the 
rural 
non-farm 
sector.  Some 
of 
the 
more 
severe 
impediments 
include macro-policy 
that 
raises 
the cost 
of 
capital 
locally, 
unpredictable trade 
policies 
that increase 
price 
uncertainty 
and 
thus 
eventual 
return 
on 
investments, 
highly 
restrictive 
labor 
regulations, 
government 
participation 
in 
marketing 
and 
distribution, 
disorganized 
production 
and 
marketing 
systems 
which 
make regular sourcing 
of 
local 
commodities 
of 
standard 
quantity 
and 
quality 
difficult, 
and inadequacies 
in 
rural 
infrastructure 
and 
services. 
By 
impeding more 
rapid 
agricultural 
sector 
growth, 
these 
factors also 
contribute 
to slowing 
rural 
non-farm 
sector 
growth 
Elaborating 
a 
Long 
term 
Vision 
and 
Strategy 
5. 
agricultural 
and 
non-farm 
sectors 
is 
a 
critical 
step 
toward 
enabling 
Sri 
Lanka 
to 
achieve 
rapid 
economic 
development and 
poverty reduction 
in 
the 
fastest 
possible 
time. 
Such 
an 
integrated 
rural 
development 
framework 
is 
critical 
because measures 
to 
promote more 
rapid growth 
and increased 
productivity 
in 
the 
agricultural 
sector 
can 
complement 
those 
that 
would 
also 
sustain 
growth 
in 
the 
non-farm 
sector. 
Global 
experience shows that 
because 
of 
strong 
forward 
and 
backward 
linkages, the development 
of 
the 
agricultural 
and 
non-farm 
sectors are 
highly 
interdependent. 
Developing 
a 
rural 
development 
strategy 
and 
putting 
it 
into 
practice, however, 
would 
be 
a challenging 
task due 
to 
the 
large number 
of 
Central 
Ministries 
and 
provincial 
governments that 
would 
need 
to 
be involved.  The 
GoSL’s 
program 
to 
formulate 
a 
Poverty Reduction 
Strategy 
would 
be 
a 
critical 
vehicle 
for 
completing 
such 
a 
task. 
6. 
component 
of 
this 
new overall 
strategy. 
In 
the short 
to 
medium 
term, 
reforms 
would 
need 
to 
focus 
on 
two 
major 
areas: 
(i) 
fostering 
the appropriate 
policy 
and 
regulatory 
environment 
and 
moving 
institutional 
reform 
of 
public 
institutions to 
encourage 
increased 
private 
sector 
participation 
and investments and 
permit 
factor 
mobility; 
and 
(ii) 
strengthening 
rural 
infrastructure 
and 
services, 
with 
increased 
emphasis 
on 
operation 
and maintenance 
of 
physical 
assets 
to 
ensure 
their 
longer 
term 
performance. 
7. 
Improving 
the 
policy 
and 
regulatory environment 
in 
the 
agricultural 
sector 
would 
require 
the 
adoption 
of 
policies 
to 
ease 
access 
to improved 
technologies, create 
a 
more 
transparent and 
stable 
trade 
policy 
regime, 
allow 
full 
and transferable 
ownership 
rights 
to 
land, and 
ensure the 
sustainable 
use 
of 
water 
would 
be 
key 
to 
promoting 
increased 
productivity 
and 
incomes. 
Critical 
to 
promoting growth 
in 
the 
non-farm 
sector (and 
indirectly 
to 
the 
agricultural 
sector) 
would 
be 
adopting 
policies 
to 
speed 
up 
currently 
lagging 
private 
sector 
participation 
and investments 
in 
the 
sector. 
This 
includes 
rationalizing currently 
restrictive labor regulation 
and phasing 
out 
government 
involvement 
in 
activities 
that 
could 
be 
efficiently 
performed 
by 
the 
private 
sector 
(e.g. 
retail 
distribution, marketing).

and

Stratepv 
and 
Policv. 
To 
meet 
2lst-century 
challenges, 
Sri 
Lanka 
needs 
to 
formulate 
an updated 
National Agricultural 
Strategy 
and 
Policy, 
consistent 
with 
its 
rural 
development 
srtategy. 
An 
essential component 
of 
the 
National 
Agricultural 
Strategy 
will 
be 
a 
new 
balance 
in 
the 
roles 
of 
the 
public 
and 
private 
sectors 
in 
agricultural 
research and extension. 
Improving 
the effectiveness 
of 
both 
systems 
will 
give 
farmers 
greater 
access 
to 
improved 
agricultural 
technologies and 
market 
support 
services.

Quarantine 
Policv 
and 
Regulations, 
The 
streamlining 
and 
modernization 
of 
the 
national 
quarantine system 
is 
urgently 
needed 
to 
ensure 
that 
it 
effectively 
filters 
out 
harmful 
pests 
and 
diseases 
but 
does 
not 
bar 
entry 
to 
improved 
technologies. 
The 
costs 
of 
Sri 
Lanka’s 
highly 
restrictive 
quarantine 
regulations 
have been 
rising 
relative 
to 
its 
benefits 
in 
recent 
years. 
Necessary 
reforms 
include 
the 
regular 
and accurate 
updating 
of 
the “Host 
Index 
of 
Plant 
Diseases 
in 
Sri 
Lanka” and 
the 
list 
of 
prohibited 
and 
restricted plants 
and 
planting 
materials. Once revised, the 
new 
quarantine 
regulations should

marketing 
and 
distribution 
would 
be 
critical 
to 
encouraging private-sector 
participation 
and investments, and 
thus 
to 
expanding 
the markets 
for 
different 
kinds 
of 
improved 
seeds. 
In 
addition, the government 
should 
privatize 
the 
remaining 
government 
seed 
farms. 
Experience 
with 
the 
two 
earlier privatizations 
of 
government 
seed 
farms 
(Hingurakgoda 
and 
Pelwehera 
seed 
farms) 
resulted 
in 
greater 
productive 
use 
of 
these 
assets, 
including 
the near 
doubling 
of 
seed 
(e.g. 
paddy) 
output 
(CIC 
Agribusiness 
2002). 
If 
needed, 
the government 
could 
sub-contract 
private 
firms 
to 
fill 
the 
seed 
requirements 
of 
various government programs.

Plant 
Variety 
Protection Legislation. 
Enacting intellectual property 
rights 
protection 
for 
seeds 
and 
planting 
material 
is 
a 
crucial 
move 
in 
encouraging private-sector research and development 
(R&D). 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
legislation protecting 
the results 
of 
private-sector 
R&D, 
very 
little 
such 
local 
investment 
has 
occurred. 
Without 
plant-variety protection, 
owners 
of 
the 
intellectual property 
inherent 
in 
many 
of 
those 
seeds 
have 
little 
incentive 
to bring 
them 
into 
Sri 
Lanka, 
adapt 
them 
to local 
conditions, 
and market 
them 
to 
farmers. 
International 
experience 
confirms 
the 
multiple 
benefits 
from 
adopting 
more liberalized 
yet 
environmentally 
prudent 
technology 
policies. 
12. 
Trade 
Policv. 
To 
induce more 
private 
investments 
in 
agriculture, 
agro-industry 
and 
storage, 
reduce 
within-year 
price 
fluctuations, 
and 
improve food 
security, the government 
will 
need 
to 
resist 
the 
pressure 
to 
continue 
seasonal 
altering 
of 
tariff 
rates. 
Over 
the 
short-to-medium 
term, the Government 
needs 
to 
commit 
to 
reducing 
tariff 
protection 
gradually 
for 
various 
agricultural 
commodities. 
This 
reform 
will 
reduce the bias 
in 
favor 
of 
particular 
crops 
(e.g. 
rice, 
potatoes, 
chillies, 
onions) and 
thus 
allow 
improved 
domestic resource 
allocation 
and reduce 
the 
taxation 
of 
consumers 
who 
are 
made 
to 
pay 
above- 
world-market 
prices. 
With 
the 
removal 
of 
price 
distortions, 
cropping 
patterns 
could 
adjust 
to 
follow 
changing 
economic incentives, 
including 
shifting 
from 
low-value 
and 
low-productivity 
activities 
(such 
as 
rice 
production) 
toward commercial production 
of 
alternative higher-value 
crops. 
To 
minimize 
the 
adjustment cost associated 
with 
tariff 
reforms, 
other 
critical 
policy 
changes 
will 
have 
to 
match 
the 
phased 
tariff 
reductions 
with 
measures 
to 
lift 
the constraints 
on 
domestic, 
commodity 
and factor 
(land, 
seeds, 
technology 
and water) markets 
and 
to 
improve 
rural 
infrastructure. 
These 
complementary 
actions 
will 
help 
ensure 
that 
farmers 
have 
the 
freedom and 
the capacity 
to 
alter 
their 
resource-use decisions 
to 
meet 
the 
changing 
needs 
of 
the market. 
13. 
Land 
Policv 
and 
Land 
Administration. 
The 
government’s recent 
decision 
to 
grant 
agricultural 
households, 
who 
have 
received 
LDO 
land 
full 
ownership 
rights, 
will 
bring 
considerable 
benefits 
to 
these 
families. 
Experience 
worldwide 
has 
shown 
that 
more 
secure 
property 
rights benefit 
farmers and 
help 
improve 
their 
productivity 
by 
(i) 
improving 
households’ security 
of 
tenure and 
thus 
their 
ability 
(and 
readiness) 
to 
make investments; 
(ii) 
providing 
better 
access 
to 
credit; and 
(iii) 
reducing 
the transaction 
costs associated 
with 
land 
transfers. 
To 
ensure 
the 
effective implementation 
of 
this 
policy, 
a 
nationwide 
awareness 
and communications campaign 
would 
be 
a 
crucial 
means 
of 
informing 
all 
eligible 
beneficiaries 
not 
only 
about the 
implications 
of 
these 
new 
ownership rights, 
but 
also 
the 
corresponding 
procedures 
involved 
in 
formalizing 
these 
rights, 
to 
ensure 
that 
lack 
of 
information 
about 
the 
program 
does 
not 
disadvantage 
beneficiary 
households.  Consistent 
with 
granting 
farmers 
full 
ownership 
rights, 
the 
government should 
also, 
as 
an 
integral 
component 
of 
implementing 
this 
provision, remove 
the 
minimum- 
size 
restrictions 
on

vital 
step 
in 
ensuring 
the 
more 
efficient 
functioning 
of 
land 
markets. 
Especially 
in 
light 
of 
land- 
policy 
reforms, 
a 
title 
system 
is 
needed 
to 
facilitate 
boundary dispute 
resolution, 
improve 
transparency and 
accessibility 
of 
records, boost the 
willingness 
of 
lenders 
to provide 
financing, 
and 
ensure 
efficient 
land 
sales, leases, 
subdivisions, and other transactions. 
International 
experience validates 
the 
importance 
of 
establishing 
appropriate 
institutional 
mechanisms 
to 
administer 
land 
rights effectively. 
The 
experience 
from 
Thailand, where the 
Government 
has 
been 
carrying 
out 
a very 
effective 
long-term 
program 
for 
land 
titling, 
suggests 
that, 
in 
order 
to 
be 
effective, such 
institutions 
need 
to be 
legally 
valid, authoritative 
and 
complete, 
accessible 
and 
cost-effective, and 
institutionally 
as 
well 
as 
financially 
sustainable. 
Over 
the 
short-to-medium 
term, 
additional 
key 
actions 
are 
required 
to 
ensure 
the effectiveness 
of 
Sri 
Lanka’s 
land 
administration 
system. 
They 
include: 
(i) 
establishing 
the 
legal, regulatory, 
and procedural framework 
for 
efficient, 
effective 
and sustainable 
land 
titling 
and 
title 
registration; 
(ii) 
completing 
the 
restructuring 
and 
streamlining 
of 
land 
administration 
agencies 
to 
promote 
efficiency, 
transparency, 
coordination 
and 
cost 
effectiveness; and 
(iii) 
developing a 
common 
information 
technology 
strategy 
including 
data management 
for 
all 
relevant 
agencies 
in 
order 
to 
make 
information 
on 
land 
tenure, 
land 
use, 
and 
land 
capability 
transparent and 
accessible. 
16. 
strategic 
vision for 
the sustainable development, management and 
use 
of 
water 
resources. 
Key 
elements 
of 
the 
policy would 
be: 
(i) 
promoting 
the 
shift 
from 
supply-driven 
goals 
to 
comprehensive planning, 
allocation 
and management 
within 
a 
river-basin 
framework; 
(ii) 
formulating 
an appropriate 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
and 
reprioritizing 
expenditures 
to 
support such 
a 
shift; 
and 
(iii) 
reforming 
institutional 
structures 
and 
procedures, 
building 
on 
increased 
participatory 
management 
of 
systems, 
to 
improve 
the 
management 
of 
water 
resources 
in 
Sri 
Lanka. 
This 
policy would 
direct 
the 
priorities 
for 
investment and 
institutional 
reforms 
required 
to 
maximize 
returns 
on 
public 
and 
private 
investments over 
the 
longer 
term. 
The 
policy would 
provide 
the 
framework 
for 
redefining 
the roles 
of 
water-related 
departments 
to 
achieve 
more 
efficient, 
sustainable, 
and equitable 
inter-sectoral 
allocation 
of 
scarce 
water 
resources 
(surface 
and 
groundwater) among 
competing 
users (e.g. 
agriculture, 
residential, 
industrial). 
Conducting 
broad-based 
communication 
campaigns 
to 
discuss 
critical 
and sensitive 
issues, 
while 
educating stakeholders 
to 
the extent 
possible 
on 
lessons 
from 
international 
experience 
would 
be 
essential 
to 
successful 
implementation. 
17. 
contribute 
both 
to 
raising 
the 
productivity 
of 
existing 
crop 
areas 
and 
to 
facilitating 
the 
diversification 
by 
farmers 
to 
higher-value 
crops that 
require 
improved 
access 
and 
reliability 
of 
irrigation 
water supply. 
Effective 
action 
will 
necessitate: 
(i) 
prioritization 
of 
expenditures 
from 
a 
primary 
focus 
on 
the 
creation 
of 
new 
assets, 
to 
demand-driven 
investments 
in 
rehabilitation 
and maintenance 
of 
existing 
infrastructure; 
(ii) 
fostering 
greater user 
participation 
in 
managing 
systems 
and 
recovering 
costs, 
so 
as 
to 
ensure 
longer 
term 
financial 
and 
fiscal 
sustainability 
of 
operations 
of 
surface 
irrigation 
systems; 
and 
(iii) 
re-orientating 
and 
restructuring 
existing 
water 
institutions 
to 
ensure 
efficient 
and 
client-oriented 
operations and 
improve 
coordination. 
18. 
Reintroducing 
water 
fees 
-- 
at 
a 
minimum 
to 
cover 
O&M 
expenditures 
in 
surface 
irrigation 
-- 
will 
be 
critical 
for 
several 
reasons. 
It 
will 
promote 
more 
efficient 
water 
use 
by 
reducing 
incentives 
for 
farmers 
to 
use 
water 
to 
excess. 
Raising 
the 
necessary 
financial 
resources 
will 
also enable the appropriate 
execution 
of 
O&M 
activities 
and 
thus 
ensure 
the 
longer 
term 
sustainability 
of 
surface 
irrigation 
systems 
and 
eliminate 
the 
costly 
current pattern 
of 
rehabilitating 
systems 
in 
almost 
5-6 
year cycles. 
Additionally, 
water 
fees 
could 
reduce the 
large 
fiscal 
burden 
of 
operating 
irrigation 
systems 
and 
contribute 
to 
the 
improved fiscal health 
of 
the 
country. 
To 
make their 
reintroduction 
acceptable, 
however, requires 
matching 
improvements 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
delivery 
of 
irrigation 
services, 
for which 
institutional 
reform 
of 
water 
agencies 
is 
a 
prerequisite. 
The 
government’s 
program 
to

Termination 
of 
Employment 
Act 
should 
give 
a 
major 
boost 
to improving 
incentives 
for private 
sector 
investments 
in

sector 
overall. 
Its 
rapid 
adoption 
will 
be critical. 
20. 
Commoditv 
Marketing 
Policies. 
Reorienting 
the 
government’ 
s 
role 
in 
the 
marketing 
system 
would 
be 
critical 
to 
encouraging 
greater 
private 
sector 
involvement 
and investments. 
In 
particular, 
the 
highly 
subsidized 
retailing 
operations 
of 
the 
Cooperative 
Wholesale Establishment (CWE) 
crowd 
out and 
undercut 
private 
sector 
involvement 
in 
the 
domestic 
market. 
The 
government announced 
in 
January 
2002 
its 
intention 
to 
float 
a 
separate 
company 
to 
handle 
CWE’s 
current 
retailing 
activities 
and 
to 
hand 
over 
its 
management 
to 
the 
private 
sector. 
The 
government 
should 
take the 
next 
bold 
step 
towards 
privatization. 
Selling 
these 
assets 
would not 
only 
remove 
the 
crowding-out 
effect, 
but 
would 
free 
up 
fiscal 
resources 
for 
other 
activities. 
In 
the 
immediate 
term, the government 
should 
hold 
off 
adding new commodities 
and 
services 
to 
CWE’s retailing 
activities. Should 
the government 
wish 
to 
assist 
low-income 
households, 
using 
more-targeted 
measures 
such 
as 
food 
stamps 
is 
far 
more 
efficient 
than 
being directly 
involved 
in 
retailing. 
Strengthening 
Rural 
Infrastructure 
21. 
There 
is 
an 
urgent 
need 
to 
improve 
rural 
infrastructure 
beyond 
the 
Western Province. 
Improved 
access 
and 
quality 
of 
rural 
infrastructure 
would 
contribute 
not 
only 
to 
raising 
the 
quality 
of 
rural 
life, 
but 
also 
to 
the successful 
implementation 
of 
government development plans 
for 
the 
modernization 
of 
agriculture 
and 
improving 
the investment 
climate 
for 
rural 
industries 
and 
services. 
Regression analysis 
using 
the 
SLIS 
1999-2000 data 
shows 
access 
to rural 
infrastructure 
in 
addition to 
land 
owned, 
the 
size 
of 
the household, and education, 
are 
significant 
determinants 
of 
household 
participation 
in 
rural 
non-farm 
activities. 
It 
shows that 
lack 
of 
access 
to 
roads (the distance 
from 
the 
nearest 
main 
road) 
is 
negatively 
correlated 
with 
the 
probability 
of 
participating 
in 
non-farm 
employment. Participatory 
planning 
and 
implementation 
of 
rural 
infrastructure 
projects, 
which 
involves 
government and targeted 
users, 
would 
be 
valuable 
to 
ensure 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
investments undertaken. 
22. 
Rural 
Roads. 
Accelerating 
rural growth 
will 
require 
increased investments 
in 
roads 
(rural 
roads 
and 
highways) 
while 
ensuring 
improved 
operations and maintenance 
of 
systems created. 
Notably, 
studies 
(Fen, 
Hazell, 
and 
Thorat 
1999) 
have shown that 
additional 
government expenditures 
on 
roads have 
a large 
impact 
on 
poverty reduction 
as 
well 
as 
a significant 
impact 
on 
agricultural 
productivity 
growth. 
23. 
Rural 
markets. 
There 
is 
a 
need 
to 
increase 
publidprivate 
investments 
in 
rural 
markets 
to 
reduce 
marketing 
costs 
and 
improve 
agricultural 
competitiveness. 
Existing 
markets 
are 
poorly 
situated, 
equipped, 
and maintained. 
The 
high 
cost 
of 
domestic 
marketing 
raises the 
costs 
of 
agricultural 
inputs 
for 
farmers 
and the 
costs 
of 
agricultural 
outputs 
for 
consumers 
and 
agro-processors.

will 
require 
a 
coherent 
and 
coordinated 
plan 
of 
actions 
by 
several 
ministries 
on 
several 
fronts 
as 
discussed above. 
This 
will 
not 
be 
easy. 
However, 
only when 
such 
an 
integrated 
package 
is 
introduced 
is 
it 
likely 
that 
Sri 
Lanka 
will 
see 
economic 
growth 
that 
will 
alleviate

the

at 
the 
political

evident and strong. 
According

the

of 
parliament, namely, 
the 
Committee on Public

(COPA) 
and 
Committee 
on Public

for 
this 
purpose. 
In

with 
this,

are 
not 
open and transparent 
to 
the 
public. 
In 
addition, 
the 
secretariat that 
supports 
the 
two 
parliamentary 
committees 
is 
inadequately resourced and 
is 
not 
able to 
provide 
the 
necessary 
technical 
advice 
to 
the members 
who 
themselves 
lack 
exposure and experience. 
Consequently, 
committee deliberations 
tend 
to 
focus 
on 
minor 
matters, there 
are 
inordinate 
delays 
in 
review 
of 
audit 
reports, and 
hardly 
any 
follow-up on 
recommendations.

Public 
Sector 
Financial 
Management: 
The 
diagnostic 
work 
indicates  that the 
public 
financial 
accountability 
framework 
of 
the government 
is 
archaic, 
focuses 
on 
input 
control, lacks 
legal 
enforceability, 
and 
does 
not clarify 
accountability relationships 
for 
sound 
financial 
management 
in 
the 
public 
sector. 
Further, 
government oversight 
of 
state 
owned 
enterprises and 
government 
owned 
companies 
is 
assessed 
to 
be 
weak 
because 
of 
the 
absence 
of 
organizational 
(in 
terms 
of 
staff 
and 
resources) and 
institutional 
mechanisms 
within 
the 
government 
for 
their 
effective 
supervision. 
The 
fiduciary implication 
is 
that even 
though 
funds 
might 
be 
accounted 
for 
(given 
the 
emphasis 
on 
expenditure controls), there 
is 
a 
risk 
that 
it 
may 
not 
be possible 
to 
satisfactorily 
ascertain whether they 
are 
being 
used 
for 
the 
intended 
purposes. 
In 
addition, 
delays 
in 
releasing 
financial information 
of 
the 
government and 
the 
present 
form 
and content 
of 
such 
information 
make 
it 
difficult 
for 
interested 
public 
to 
assess 
the 
financial 
condition 
of 
the 
state.

Actions 
Taken: 
A 
senior government 
official 
has 
been 
assigned 
the 
responsibility 
for 
overseeing 
implementation 
of 
public 
financial 
accountability reforms. 
The 
parliament, 
under the guidance 
of 
the 
Speaker 
of 
the 
house, has 
initiated 
a 
review 
of 
the 
parliamentary 
procedures and 
the 
Parliamentary 
Powers and 
Privileges 
Act 
to 
explore 
ways 
and 
means 
to 
promote 
greater transparency 
of 
the 
committee 
hearings. 
The 
two 
parliamentary 
committees, namely, 
the 
standing orders 
committee 
and the 
media 
committee, 
are 
reviewing 
these 
procedures 
with 
a 
view 
to 
also 
getting 
the 
media 
more 
involved. 
In 
the 
interim, 
progressive 
initiatives 
have been 
taken 
by 
the 
committees 
to 
address 
issues 
relating 
to 
performance 
of 
entities. 
Recently, the 
COPE 
has 
closely scrutinized 
several loss 
making 
and 
financially 
distressed 
state 
owned 
enterprises 
(e.g. 
Ceylon Electricity 
Board) 
by 
regularly 
summoning 
them 
to 
parliament 
to 
query 
on 
their 
current 
performance. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
has 
initiated 
efforts 
to 
modernize 
the 
public 
financial 
accountability 
framework 
that 
governs 
financial 
management 
in 
ministries, 
departments, and 
state 
owned 
enterprises. 
A 
draft Public 
Finance 
Act 
has 
been prepared 
(repealing 
the 
provisions 
in 
the 
Public 
Finance 
Act 
of 
1971) 
with 
a 
view 
to 
provide legal 
enforceability 
and 
greater 
clarity 
to

the 
roles 
and 
responsibilities 
of 
government 
agencies 
and 
officials 
for 
financial 
management. 
The 
PFA Act 
addresses 
issues 
such 
as: 
clarity 
in 
the 
roles and 
responsibilities 
of 
chief 
accounting 
and accounting 
officers; 
measures 
to 
be 
taken 
when a directive, 
having financial 
implications, 
is 
issued 
by 
an executive 
authority 
to 
an 
accounting 
officer; 
limits on 
the 
number 
of 
supplementary 
estimates 
that can 
be 
submitted 
to 
parliament 
in 
a 
year; 
time 
limits 
for 
rendering 
accounts 
for 
audit 
(i.e. 
3 
months); 
format, 
contents and 
minimum 
disclosure 
requirements 
of 
annual 
financial 
statements; 
roles 
and 
responsibilities 
of 
internal 
audit 
departments; requirement 
for 
establishing 
and 
the 
role 
of 
audit 
committees 
in 
reviewing 
internal, 
external and 
parliamentary 
reports 
of 
the 
agency; 
procedure 
for 
issuing 
government 
guarantees; 
and penalties 
for 
non-compliance 
with 
all 
of 
the 
above. 
The 
government 
has 
now 
re-established the department 
for 
public 
enterprises 
in 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
for 
improved 
oversight 
of 
state 
owned 
enterprises. 
This 
department 
will 
provide 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
with 
dedicated 
staff 
and 
resources 
to 
review 
performance 
of 
state 
owned 
enterprises, 
and 
to 
follow-up 
on 
improvement 
recommendations. 
In 
addition, 
a 
corporate governance 
unit 
has 
also been 
set-up 
in 
this 
department 
for 
implementing 
the 
‘Code 
of 
Best 
Practice’ 
in 
selected 
state 
owned 
enterprises. 
This 
‘Code 
of 
Best Practice’ 
developed 
with 
ADB 
assistance 
prescribes 
six 
principles 
to 
be 
followed 
and 
provides 
guidelines 
for 
their 
practical 
implementation. 
The 
principles 
encompass: 
(i) 
disclosure and 
transparency requirements, 
(ii) 
duties 
and 
responsibilities 
of 
the 
board 
members, 
(iii) 
ownership functions 
of 
the 
government and 
its 
relationship 
with 
the enterprise, 
(iv) 
conduct 
of 
annual general meetings, 
(v) 
public 
interest 
and 
accountability 
to 
stakeholders, and 
(vi) 
performance related 
incentive 
payments, where applicable. 
This 
code 
will 
be 
piloted 
initially 
in 
11 
selected 
public 
enterprises. 
National 
Review 
Committees (under the 
purview 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Public 
Enterprises) 
have been established 
to 
review 
annual reports 
of 
critical 
state-owned 
enterprises, 
recommend 
follow-up 
actions, and 
submit 
reports 
to 
the cabinet. 
This 
is 
an 
interim 
measure 
to 
closely 
supervise 
critical 
state 
owned 
enterprises, 
until 
such 
time 
sufficient 
capacity 
is 
built 
in 
COPE. 
A 
diagnostic study 
has 
been 
carried 
out 
with 
ADB 
assistance 
to 
revise 
the 
format 
for 
the 
presentation 
of 
the 
consolidated 
government accounts 
to move 
towards 
accrual accounting 
and 
to 
prepare reports 
in 
full 
compliance 
with 
PSAS by 
mid 
2007. 
The 
government 
has 
issued 
a 
new 
treasury 
circular instructing 
all 
government 
agencies 
and 
state-owned enterprises 
to 
submit 
audited 
accounts 
within 
5-months 
to 
reduce 
the 
elapsed 
time 
after end 
of 
fiscal 
year 
end 
from 
10 
to 
5 
months. 
b. 
Actions 
underway/proposed 
The internal 
control 
practices 
(as 
specified 
in 
the 
Financial 
Regulations) 
are 
being 
modernized 
and 
revised 
as 
Financial 
Guidelines 
which 
will 
have 
legal 
enforceability 
once 
the 
PFA 
is 
enacted. 
The 
strengthened 
legal 
framework, 
together 
with 
the 
initiatives 
mentioned 
below, 
will 
help 
improve 
overall financial 
management 
in 
the government.

by 
five 
selected 
government 
companies 
(currently 
the 
shareholder

the 
secretary 
to 
the Treasury) 
including 
the 
two 
most 
controversial 
companies- 
Sri 
Lankan 
Airlines 
and 
Sri 
Lanka 
Telecom 
will 
be 
transferred 
to 
the proposed 
State 
Holding 
company 
which 
will 
have 
sufficient 
resources, 
professional 
staff, 
and 
a 
more 
focused approach 
to 
manage the investments 
in 
these 
companies.

IMF 
Approves

in 
PRGFEFF 
Credit 
Arrangements 
for 
Sri 
Lanka 
The Executive 
Board 
of 
the 
Intemational Monetary 
Fund 
(IMF) 
today approved three-year 
arrangements 
under the 
Poverty Reduction 
and 
Growth 
Facility 
and 
Extended 
Fund 
Facility 
amounting 
to 
SDR 
413.4 
million 
(about 
US$567 
million) 
for 
Sri 
Lanka, 
which 
will 
support the government’s economic 
program 
for 
2003-06. 
Of 
this 
amount, 
SDR 
269 
million 
(about 
US$369 
million) 
is 
available 
under 
the 
PRGF, and 
SDR 
144.4 
million 
(about 
US$198 
million) 
is 
available 
under 
the 
Extended 
Fund 
Facility 
(EFF). 
The 
decision 
will 
enable 
Sri 
Lanka 
to 
draw 
SDR 
59.06 
million 
(about 
US$81 
million) 
from 
the 
IMF 
immediately. 
The 
PRGF 
is 
the 
IMF’s 
concessional 
facility for 
low-income 
countries. 
It 
is 
intended 
that 
PRGF- 
supported programs 
are 
based 
on 
country-owned 
poverty reduction 
strategies adopted 
in 
a participatory 
process 
involving 
civil 
society and development partners and 
articulated 
in 
a Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy 
Paper 
(PRSP). 
This 
is 
intended 
to 
ensure 
that 
PRGF-supported 
programs 
are 
consistent 
with 
a 
comprehensive 
framework 
for 
macroeconomic, structural, and 
social 
policies to 
foster 
growth 
and reduce 
poverty. 
PRGF 
loans carry 
an 
annual 
interest 
rate 
of 
0.5 
percent and are repayable over 
10 
years 
with 
a 5 
%-year 
grace 
period 
on 
principal 
payments. 
The 
EFF 
is 
an 
IMF 
financing 
facility 
that 
supports 
medium- 
term 
programs that 
seek 
to 
overcome balance 
of 
payments 
difficulties 
stemming 
from 
macroeconomic 
imbalances 
and structural 
problems. 
The 
repayment 
terms 
are 
10 
years 
with 
a 
4%-year 
grace 
period.

commenting 
on 
the 
Executive 
Board’s 
decision,

and 
Acting

the 
following 
statement:

“Sri 
Lanka 
today 
stands 
at 
a 
pivotal 
point 
in 
its 
history. Over 
the 
past 
20 
years, 
a 
long 
civil 
conflict 
has 
beleaguered 
the 
country, 
which not 
only 
disrupted 
economic 
activity, 
but 
also 
hampered the 
sustained 
implementation 
of 
economic 
reforms. The 
current environment, 
in 
which 
peace 
negotiations 
are 
progressing 
well 
and economic 
activity 
is 
picking 
up, 
provides 
an 
excellent 
opportunity 
for 
Sri 
Lanka to 
implement 
deeper 
economic 
reforms 
and 
put 
the economy 
on 
a 
path 
of 
sustained 
high 
growth. 
The 
PRGF- 
EFF 
supported 
program 
aims 
to 
accelerate 
economic 
growth 
and reduce 
poverty through 
private-sector 
led 
development, 
in 
line 
with 
the 
authorities’ 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy Paper and 
building on 
steps 
taken under the 
IMF’s 
Stand-By Arrangement that 
was 
completed 
in 
September 
2002. 
Key 
elements 
of 
the 
program 
are 
fiscal 
consolidation; 
reforming 
the 
financial 
sector, 
public 
enterprises, 
labor 
market 
regulations, and the trade regime; and strengthening macroeconomic 
policy 
instruments and 
institutions. 
Sri 
Lanka’s 
PRSP 
is 
a 
satisfactory 
policy 
framework 
to 
increase 
growth 
and reduce 
poverty. 
“The 
program’s focus 
on 
fiscal 
consolidation 
is 
appropriate 
in 
light 
of 
the 
public 
debt 
burden. 
It 
is 
also 
necessary 
to 
ensure that adequate resources 
are 
available 
to 
meet 
priority 
spending 
needs 
and 
to 
free 
resources 
for 
private 
sector 
expansion. 
Thus, 
the 
program 
emphasizes 
increasing 
revenue 
by 
broadening 
the tax 
base 
and strengthening 
tax administration 
as 
well 
as 
reorienting 
expenditure towards social, 
infrastructure, and 
post-conflict 
needs. 
“Sustaining 
high 
growth 
depends 
critically 
on 
implementing 
the program’s 
structural reforms. 
The 
progress made 
in 
reforming 
the 
electricity 
and 
petroleum 
sectors, 
restructuring 
state-owned 
enterprises, 
and strengthening the 
banking 
sector 
is 
commendable. 
However, 
further 
reforms 
are needed 
in 
financial 
sector, 
public 
enterprises, 
labor 
markets, and 
the 
trade 
regime. 
“The govemment’s 
attention 
to reducing conflict-related 
and 
rural 
poverty 
is 
well 
placed. 
The 
implementation 
of 
plans 
to 
strengthen 
rural 
infrastructure 
and 
improve 
access 
of 
the 
poor 
to 
quality 
education and 
health 
services are 
appropriate and 
necessary 
steps. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
welfare 
reforms, the 
new 
focus 
on 
depoliticization 
and 
targeting 
of 
Samurdhi benefits 
is 
commendable and 
should 
be 
strongly 
implemented. 
“To 
fully 
realize 
the program’s 
medium-term 
objectives 
for 
growth 
and 
poverty 
reduction, lasting 
peace 
is 
necessary. 
The 
authorities 
are 
fully 
committed 
to 
the 
program 
and have embarked 
on 
difficult 
reforms, 
while 
making 
strong efforts 
to 
preserve 
public 
support 
for 
the 
peace 
process. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
continued 
donor 
financing 
is 
required to 
support 
reforms 
and reconstruction, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
momentum 
of 
the 
peace 
process”, 
said 
Mr. 
Sugisaki. 
Annex 
Recent 
Economic 
Developments 
After 
declining 
in 
2001, the 
economy recovered last 
year. 
Following 
a 
series 
of 
exogenous 
shocks 
in 
the 
second 
half 
of 
2001-the 
global 
slowdown, 
an attack 
on 
Colombo 
airport, 
and 
a 
severe 
drought, 
GDP 
for 
the 
year 
fell 
by 
1% 
percent, 
the 
first 
decline 
in 
several 
decades. 
A 
robust 
expansion 
in 
domestic demand 
and 
tourism 
underpinned 
the 
rebound 
in 
2002, 
as 
progress 
toward 
peace 
revived 
business 
and consumer 
confidence. 
GDP 
growth for 
2002 
is 
likely 
to 
reach 
4 
percent. 
However, 
the 
recovery 
is 
yet 
to 
be 
broad 
based, 
with 
lingering 
weaknesses 
in 
private 
investment 
and exports 
of 
goods. 
Inflation 
slowed 
down, 
due, 
in 
part, 
to 
better weather 
conditions, 
with 
the 
12-month 
rate 
dipping 
below 
8 
percent 
in 
March 
2003. 
Strong 
inflows 
of 
remittances 
and 
tourism 
receipts helped 
gross 
official 
reserves 
to 
rise 
from 
$1.2 
billion 
(December 2001) 
to 
$1.6 
billion 
(March 
2003) 
covering 
2% 
months 
of 
imports. The 
rupee 
remained 
broadly 
stable 
in 
real 
effective 
terms.

Monetary 
policy 
balanced 
the 
need 
to 
support 
the 
economic 
recovery 
with 
restraining 
inflation. 
The 
decline 
in 
inflation 
allowed 
the 
Central 
Bank 
of 
Sri 
Lanka (CBSL) 
to 
cut 
rep0 
rates 
by 
300 
basis 
points 
since January 2002. 
As 
a 
result, other 
lending 
rates also 
declined 
and 
helped 
the 
recovery 
of 
private-sector 
credit. 
The 
fiscal 
deficit 
for 
2002 
is 
estimated 
at 
9 
percent 
of 
GDP-2 
percent 
of 
GDP 
lower 
than 
in 
2001-but 
higher 
than 
the 
budget 
target 
of 
8% 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
This 
outcome 
reflected 
a 
revenue 
shortfall 
of 
around 
1 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
partly 
offset 
by 
spending 
cuts 
of 
about 
?4 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
The 
lower 
revenue 
was 
due 
to 
a combination 
of 
weaker-than-expected 
imports, a 
large 
number 
of 
exemptions granted when 
the 
GST 
was 
replaced 
with 
the 
VAT, 
and 
lower 
nontax 
revenue, 
in 
part, 
reflecting 
a restructuring 
in 
payments 
from 
the 
electricity 
company 
(CEB) 
to 
the 
budget. 
The 
cuts 
in 
expenditure 
reflected 
reduced 
capital 
spending 
(due 
to 
low 
project-implementation 
rates) 
and somewhat 
lower 
current 
spending. 
Reforms 
were 
advanced 
in 
several 
areas. 
Following 
the 
enactment 
of 
the 
Electricity 
Reform 
Bill 
in 
December 2002, the 
unbundling 
of 
the 
state 
electricity 
company 
(CEB) 
is 
proceeding 
on 
schedule, 
while 
Ceylon 
Petroleum 
Corporation 
(CPC) 
reforms 
are 
progressing 
in 
step 
with 
the 
liberalization 
of 
the 
petroleum 
sector. 
A 
12 
percent 
stake 
in 
Sri 
Lanka 
Telecom 
(SLT) 
was 
sold 
in 
December 
2002 
and the 
privatization 
of 
Sri 
Lanka 
Insurance 
Corporation 
(SLIC) 
was 
completed 
in 
early 
April 
2003. Several 
amendments 
to 
the 
labor 
laws 
were 
passed 
by 
Parliament 
in 
January 2003. 
A 
Fiscal 
Management 
Responsibility 
Act 
(FMRA) 
came 
into 
force 
in 
December 
2002, 
while 
a 
Welfare 
Benefit 
Law 
was 
enacted 
in 
September 
to reform 
the 
welfare 
system. 
Program 
Summary 
The 
government’s economic 
program 
supported 
by 
the 
combined 
PRGF-EFF 
arrangements, 
is 
based 
on 
their 
medium-term 
economic and 
Poverty Reduction 
Straten 
Paper 
(PRSP)-Regaining 
Sri 
Lanka-that 
was 
finalized 
in 
January 
2003. 
Under 
the 
PRGF-EFF 
supported program, 
the 
ongoing 
economic 
recovery 
is 
expected 
to gain 
further 
momentum 
this 
year, 
with 
GDP 
growth 
projected 
to 
rise 
to 
5% 
percent. 
A 
resumption 
of 
delayed 
private 
investment 
projects, 
a 
substantial increase 
in 
public 
investment, 
higher tourism, 
and 
a 
return to normal 
weather 
underpin 
the 
projection. 
Inflation 
is 
expected 
to 
slow 
to 
7 
percent 
by 
end-year. 
The 
current 
account 
deficit 
is 
likely 
to 
rise 
to 
3% 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
as 
an 
export rebound 
is 
more than offset 
by 
higher 
imports 
related 
to 
increased 
activity 
and 
reconstruction 
needs. 
Gross 
reserves 
are 
targeted 
to 
reach 
$1.9 
billion 
(2% 
months 
of 
imports) 
by 
end-2003. 
In 
line with 
the 
PRSP, 
growth 
is 
expected 
to 
average 
6% percent 
over 
the 
medium 
term. 
This 
reflects 
both 
higher 
productivity 
and 
capital 
accumulation, 
reflecting labor 
market and 
financial 
sector 
reforms, and 
strong 
public 
and 
private 
investment. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
major 
external 
shocks, 
prudent 
monetary 
policy 
and 
normal 
monsoons 
should 
help 
inflation 
decline 
to 
4% percent 
by 
2006. 
With 
substantial 
reconstruction 
and 
investment imports, 
the 
current 
account 
deficit 
is 
likely 
to 
rise 
to 
4% 
percent 
of 
GDP 
by 
2004, 
before 
falling to 
3% percent 
of 
GDP 
by 
2006. Reasonably 
strong 
capital 
inflows 
should 
help 
gross 
official 
reserves 
to 
rise 
to 
$3 
billion 
(3% months 
of 
imports). 
The 
program’ 
fiscal 
strategy aims 
to 
restore 
fiscal 
sustainability, 
while 
ensuring 
that 
adequate resources 
are 
available 
for 
priority 
spending and 
post 
conflict 
needs. 
Public 
debt 
now 
stands at 
104 percent 
of 
GDP, 
while 
interest payments 
amount 
to 
7% 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
raising 
serious 
sustainability 
concerns. 
To 
bring 
the 
level 
of 
debt 
to 
a 
manageable 
level, 
the 
program 
aims 
to 
reduce the 
fiscal 
deficit 
by 
1% 
percent 
of 
GDP 
per 
year, 
on 
average, 
over 
the 
medium 
term, 
bringing 
it 
down 
to 
4% percent 
of 
GDP 
by 
2006. 
Achieving 
these 
objectives 
will 
require 
revenue 
to 
be 
raised and 
expenditure 
rationalized 
and reoriented 
to priority 
needs. 
The 
aim 
is 
to 
increase revenue 
by 
broadening 
the 
tax 
base-through 
rationalizing 
tax 
Page  104

of 
4 
exemptions and incentives-and 
by 
strengthening 
tax administration-in 
part, 
by 
establishing 
an 
efficient 
revenue 
authority. 
The program 
envisages 
capital 
spending 
to 
rise 
over 
the 
medium 
term, 
while 
continued 
savings 
in 
welfare, 
reflecting 
better targeting 
of 
beneficiaries, 
is 
expected to 
allow 
a 
near 
doubling 
of 
capital 
expenditures 
in 
health 
and education. 
A 
medium-term 
expenditure 
framework 
(MTEF) 
is 
planned 
to be 
established 
by 
mid-2003 
to 
better 
reorient 
expenditure towards 
social 
and 
post-conflict 
needs. 
Financing 
of 
the budget 
is 
programmed 
to 
be 
increasingly 
shifted 
away 
from 
expensive debt 
to 
concessional 
donor 
funds. 
The 
flexible 
exchange rate 
regime 
has 
served 
the economy 
well 
and 
will 
be 
continued. 
Thus, 
market 
interventions 
will 
be 
limited 
to 
smooth 
short-term 
volatility 
or 
meet 
the 
reserves 
target 
in 
line 
with 
the 
monetary program. 
Monetary 
policy 
will 
continue 
to 
be 
guided 
by 
the need 
to 
support economic recovery, 
while 
restraining 
inflation. 
The 
structural 
reform 
agenda 
of 
the 
program 
will 
focus 
on 
the 
following 
aspects 
of 
the 
PRSP: 
0 
0 
0

Financial
