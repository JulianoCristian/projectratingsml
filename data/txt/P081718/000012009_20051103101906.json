project\n            outcome, likely sustainability, and modest institutional\n            development impacts, including satisfactory ratings on\n            performances by both the Bank and Borrower. This experience\n            suggests that more attention needs to be given to the\n            sequencing of reforms. The Poverty Reduction Support Credit\n            (PRSC) program was perhaps too overloaded with\n            \"politically-sensitive\" reforms, i.e., public\n            sector, welfare, labor, and land reforms; rather a more\n            phased approach could have been more manageable. Thus,\n            further consideration should also be given towards ensuring\n            wide-base political support for key reforms, and avoid\n            interruptions every time there is a change in government.\n            This is why governments need to be encouraged to pursue\n            reforms that have bipartisan support, i.e., to enhance\n            consultations with relevant stakeholders, including within\n            government. Other lessons address the recent poverty\n            numbers, which show a sharp increase in inequality between\n            1990-91 and 2002, also reinforcing the importance of\n            focusing on pro-poor reforms, e.g., welfare reforms and\n            rural development, to be the center of the second PRSC\n            operation. Moreover, it is important that future PRSC\n            operations be closely linked to the budget, and, given the\n            difficulties in passing legislative changes, should legal\n            changes be included in the program, careful consideration\n            needs to be given to the constitutionality of the proposed\n            legislations, and whether they could withstand court\n            challenges. Unfortunately, while this operation did\n            (substantially) achieve its objectives, the results are much\n            less satisfactory than they would have been if the intended\n            complementary reforms, originally planned to be supported in\n            subsequent operations, had actually materialized."}, "docdt": "2005-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
