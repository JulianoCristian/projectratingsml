Poverty\n            Reduction Support Credit for Sri Lanka were as follows: the\n            outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was modest, and the Bank\n            and borrower performance were both satisfactory. The\n            findings and implications show that the recent political\n            developments reinforce the importance of linking the release\n            of Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit (PRSC) funds to the\n            effective implementation of up-front actions and not to\n            future promises. Recent poverty numbers, which show a sharp\n            increase in inequality between 1990-91 and 2002, also\n            reinforce the need to focus on pro-poor reforms, e.g.,\n            welfare reforms and rural development. It is important that\n            future PRSC operations be more closely linked to the budget.\n            In this regard, the Bank team is working with the MOF to\n            enhance the policy orientation of the budget through the\n            development of a medium term budget framework. To ensure the\n            sustainability of reforms, the new government needs to be\n            encouraged to enhance consultations with relevant\n            stakeholders, including those within the government, and to\n            inform the public at large of the pros and cons of reforms,\n            perhaps through a more systematic communications strategy.\n            Given the difficulties in passing legislative changes, which\n            in Sri Lanka's context could be subject to court\n            challenges, future operations will need to explore\n            alternative (more pragmatic) options to achieve stated objectives."}, "docdt": "2004-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
