However, both\n            performances by the Bank, and Borrower are rated as\n            moderately satisfactory, given the failure to secure\n            government support to quality interventions, causing\n            unnecessary delays in implementation, and, due to\n            performance difficulties in financial, legal, and activities\n            of the Social Investment Fund, respectively. Lessons\n            highlight the need to establish early on, an evaluation\n            baseline; the importance of focusing on the pedagogical\n            aspects of the project; the need to translate the concept of\n            municipal education, and institutional school improvement\n            plans as defined by legislation, into operational\n            instruments; the need for adequate financial resources; and,\n            the importance of working directly with local authorities.\n            Moreover, lessons demonstrated the potential effectiveness\n            of demand-side subsidies, showing increased coverage, and\n            improved equity through the private sector, without reducing\n            quality. And, the increased awareness of the importance of\n            education, translated into increased investments for the\n            sector, i.e., government agencies, and municipalities alike\n            consider education a high priority in their development\n            plans. However, institutional autonomy still needs\n            definition, and promotion."}, "docdt": "2001-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
