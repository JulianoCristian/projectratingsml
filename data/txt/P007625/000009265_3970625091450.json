         support the Government's long-term objective of\n            gradually opening the Mexican economy through implementation\n            of trade reforms, as a means of improving domestic\n            efficiency and international competitiveness. The loan may\n            be seen as part of a larger program of Bank financial and\n            technical support for Mexico's 1986-88 trade\n            liberalization program to assist both private and public\n            sector firms in their adjustment to a more open trade Policy\n            environment. The Trade Policy Loan Project will also serve\n            to assist Mexico in obtaining associated external financing\n            from commercial banks and other sources. Specifically, this\n            loan will support the reduction of Non-Tariff Barriers\n            (NTBs), which have historically constituted the heart of the\n            Mexican system of protection and the simplification and\n            reduced dispersion of tariffs. The loan will finance part of\n            the additional imports resulting from the removal of NTBs.\n            After an adjustment period which will include further import\n            liberalization measures, additional non-oil export growth\n            resulting from the trade Policy reforms should more than\n            compensate for the additional imports."}, "docdt": "1986-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
