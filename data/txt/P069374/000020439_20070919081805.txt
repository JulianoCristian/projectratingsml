F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The development objective of this project is to improve the efficiency of labor programs
by piloting and testing new approaches and innovative labor redeployment programs and
employment services for the unemployed in selected areas with a view to employment
promotion and increased cost-effectiveness of such programs, by:
1. Development and implementation of redeployment measures targeting redundant
workers in enterprises undergoing deep restructuring or privatization thus facilitating the
rapid return of workers to productive employment.
2.   Introduction of more cost-effective labor market interventions and innovative
employment services for the unemployed to assist them in rapidly reentering the labor
market.


                                             2

3. Development of institutional capacity to collect and analyze labor market data in order
to improve the effectiveness of labor market policies and programs.

               Gross impact analysis of ALMPs showed unusually high placement rates
Comments       of beneficiaries of ALMPs. The results of three waves of tracer surveys of

achievement)   participants (by the survey, only 31 percent of them found new
               employment) than almost any of the ALMPs implemented by NES.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

In 2003, Serbia was dealing with the severe economic consequences of more than a
decade of economic mismanagement, exacerbated by regional conflicts and
sanctions. GDP stood at below one-half of its 1989 level. Economic reform since the
end of 2000 had marked a change in policy that was showing a number of positive
effects. Real GDP growth had rebounded from the highly negative rates of 1999
(impact of the Kosovo conflict) to positive rates of about 5-6 percent in 2000 and 2001.
The new government in Serbia adopted an ambitious program of economic reform,
committing itself to reversing the trends of the previous decade and integrating the
economy with the European Union. In less than two years, trade and prices had been
liberalized; new fiscal and monetary policies had substantially reduced inflationary
pressure and stabilized the exchange rate. Inflation in Serbia fell from 115 percent in
2000 to 39 percent in 2001. Relations with international creditors had been largely
normalized. Comprehensive privatization legislation marked a break with dubious
schemes of the past in welcoming foreign investment to participate in the process.

Unlike most transition economies, the majority of unemployed (56 percent) were
persons without previous labor market experience (mainly youth), rather than
workers who had lost their job. The unemployment rate in Serbia in 2002, at 12.2
percent, was around average by transition economies standards. However, only around
7 percent of the unemployed received unemployment benefits during their spell of
unemployment. Around 75 percent of the unemployed were estimated to be seeking
work for longer than one year, a very high proportion compared with other transition
economies.

The Republic of Serbia had just started a significant enterprise restructuring
reform and privatization program. In the short term, the reforms entailed major labor
displacement. The restructuring would give rise to large inflows into unemployment,
while due to the underdeveloped new private sector, outflows from unemployment
were, in the short- to medium-term, limited. However, public employment services and
other agencies were not equipped to mitigate the impact of group redundancies in
addition to dealing with the unemployed in general.

Owing to budget constraints and high spending on unemployment benefits and
related cash payments (pensions and health insurance), expenditures on ALMPs
were very limited in Serbia. The programs were broadly targeted, and not necessarily
at disadvantaged groups (e.g., groups running a high risk of long-term unemployment).
Most of the ALMPs were being introduced in an ad hoc fashion as a quick response to
perceived problems. In addition, the programs were likely to carry a heavy deadweight
loss, and thus their net impact and cost-effectiveness appeared to be low. Job search

assistance, based on international experience, is one of the most cost-effective active
labor market interventions, was underdeveloped in Serbia.

The objectives of the Employment Promotion Project were highly relevant and
consistent with the 2004 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The situation in Serbia
was characterized by a sharp necessity to mitigate the consequences of large-scale
enterprise privatization and restructuring and to cope with high unemployment and
redundancies. Support was needed not only in the form of financial benefits, but also in
the form of promotion of opportunities for reemployment, training and self-
employment. The fact that Serbian institutions, National Employment Service (NES)
and Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social Protection (MOLESP), had very limited
capacities and were in many aspects not prepared to deal with these problems made
EPP intervention even more helpful.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The Development Objective, as defined in the Legal Agreement and in the PAD (both
in the main document and in Annex 1), was to improve the efficiency of labor programs
by piloting and testing new approaches and innovative labor redeployment programs
and employment services for the unemployed in selected areas with a view to
employment promotion and increased cost-effectiveness of such programs. This
objective was to be accomplished by:

       1.    Development and implementation of redeployment measures targeting
       redundant workers in enterprises undergoing deep restructuring or privatization
       thus facilitating the rapid return of workers to productive employment.
       2. Introduction of more cost-effective labor market interventions and innovative
       employment services for the unemployed to assist them in rapidly reentering the
       labor market.
       3. Development of institutional capacity to collect and analyze labor market
       data in order to improve the effectiveness of labor market policies and programs.

The three key outcome indicators supporting the PDO were:

       (i) Rapid return of workers made redundant to productive employment and thus
       reduce the duration of state supported income support payments;
       (ii) Improved access, quality and utilization of employment services in targeted
       districts; and
       (iii) Increased employment opportunities offered by employment services and
       number of small businesses supported.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDO has not been revised and has remained the same throughout the project.




                                             13

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD
and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations
expected to benefit from the project)

The project intended to:
        (i) build up essential elements of a pro-active labor market services, and create
             a capability for longer term strategic management of the labor market
             administration; and
        (ii) develop a more meaningful set of pre- and post-layoff services.

Therefore, the primary target population included the registered unemployed and the
workers of enterprises undergoing privatization and restructuring. However, the
National Employment Service (central and branches) and the MOLESP were also
expected to benefit from the project.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The Employment Promotion Project had four components:

Component 1: "Design of Labor Redeployment Activities." This component aimed
to reintegrate displaced workers and other job seekers into the labor market and
mitigate the social costs of enterprise restructuring through the development and testing
of new policies, institutional arrangements and labor redeployment programs (LRP),
including the design and implementation of enterprise social plans, through the
provision of training, services and goods. In particular, the component aimed to provide
assistance to persons displaced as a result of restructuring or privatization of enterprises
through labor redeployment services, as part of the carrying out of enterprise social
plans, including job counseling, financial counseling, job search referral, and skill and
entrepreneurial training in four pilot regions. Operating guidelines for a LRP were
going to be prepared, and cadres of LRP specialists trained.

Component 2: "Piloting reforms in Public Employment Services." The primary
objective of this component was to design, pilot and evaluate new and cost effective
public employment services with the view to assisting the unemployed to rapidly re-
enter the labor market, through the provision of improved employment services, such as
job search assistance programs and small business advisory services, as well as the
institutional strengthening of the MOLE and NES, through the provision of training,
services and goods. This component comprised five activities: (i) Improved
Employment Services; (ii) Improved Small Business Assistance Services; (iii) Local
Economic Development Planning Studies Design and Implementation of Virtual
Enterprises (a Practice Firm); and (iv) Staff Development and Management Training.

Component 3: "Labor market information and evaluation: social impact of
restructuring and effects of ALMPs." The objective of this component was to
develop a comprehensive system of labor market information to assess and evaluate the
effects of labor market programs, through the provision of training, services and goods.


                                             14

This component was to build local capacity to generate, analyze and use the
information for policy formulation and program design. The Component comprises five
tasks: (i) Development of the performance information and management system
(PIMS) to monitor labor market trends and programs, and guide program design; (ii)
Training on the principles and methods of the evaluation of ALMPs; (iii) Monitoring of
displaced workers: the use of labor redeployment services and changes in the labor
market status; (iv) Qualitative assessment of ALMP supported by the EPP in four pilot
areas; and (v) Build a Database on Displaced Workers.

Component 4: "Project Management". This component was to assist the MOLE in
the management of the Project through the provision of services, including the audit of
accounts and financial statements, as well as assistance to both the MOLE and NES in
the implementation of the Project through the provision of training, services and goods.

1.6 Revised Components

The components have not been revised.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

There was only one significant change in the scale of the EPP. The original project
design included work on only four pilot sites. Given a very successful implementation
of the project activities and savings due to appreciation of the SDR, the project was
able to include three additional sites for Component 1 and several others for various
innovations regarding ALMPs for Component 2. In order to complete this additional
work, the project was extended for 6 months (June to December 2006).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

This ICR rates Quality at Entry as Satisfactory. Even though there was no formal
Quality at Entry review, the rating is based on the fact that the design was appropriate
and in accordance to the needs of the government. Project objectives were clearly and



                                               15

carefully formulated, and even though a few of them were too ambitious in view of the
available time and resources, the project achieved almost all objectives in a satisfactory
manner. Also, project preparation was carried out effectively, relevant risks were
identified and pertinent mitigation measures were determined. There was close
collaboration with DFID, co-financier of the project. DFID made a very valuable
contribution during the preparation process, producing a very meticulous and useful
report "Serbia: Learning and Innovation Loan Preparatory and Design Mission".

During project preparation, the following risks were identified: i) adequate resources
for implementation and Enterprise Social Plans provided in a timely manner; ii)
recurrent cost implications of LRP specialist training could be met from the
Employment Fund; iii) timely availability of Counterpart Funds; iv) adherence to
agreed training plan and technical assistance schedule; v) technical capacity readily
available; vi) MOLESP and NES management willing to experiment with new
employment services; and vii) the targeted districts participate in the pilot program, and
relevant employment officers agree to participate in the training and development of
new services. Risk ratings were "moderate" for all the above, except for one
("substantial"). Fundamentally, mitigation measures were successful in assuring that
risks never materialized.

Experiences from other countries in the region were taken into account. This was
the first employment promotion Learning and Innovation Loan project in ECA region.
The project design took into consideration similar approaches in reforming active labor
market programs that had been undertaken in Poland (Employment Promotion and
Services Project); Russia (Employment Service and Social Protection Project); Turkey
(Employment and Training Project, and Privatization Social Support Project); Albania
(Labor Market Development Project), and in several countries in the region with
respect to social mitigation of the impact of enterprise restructuring and privatization,
including in Russia, Hungary, Romania, Macedonia, Croatia and Poland. The ALMPs,
aiming at expediting the redeployment of labor, thereby reducing the duration of
frictional and structural unemployment, increasing productivity, and reducing
expenditures on income support programs, are common in most transition countries.

However, evaluation of the net impact of ALMPs in some of the transition countries,
such as Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, showed mixed results. While some
programs can help most groups of the unemployed, other programs, depending on the
labor market situations in particular countries, program design or groups of the
unemployed, showed neutral or even negative outcomes in terms of placement rates,
probability of employment and career development or enhancement of wages. These
mixed results called for careful testing of different approaches and programs on a pilot
basis with the aim of improving their design and cost-effectiveness.1 Developing



1
  A variety of services are needed to address three conditions commonly experienced by displaced workers who are trying to re-
enter the labor market. In case of frictional unemployment, displaced workers have marketable skills for which there is a demand,
but they need intensive job placement assistance. These services can have a substantial positive impact on re-employment and have
low unit costs. As for structural unemployment, displaced workers often lack skills, or their skills are not in demand, and need some



                                                                16

effective ALMPs is essentially a learning process, and the EPP was specifically meant
to facilitate and optimize it.

Overall, the project design and preparation were satisfactory. There was clear
understanding and high commitment of Serbian stakeholders to the objectives of this
intervention even during major political changes in the country. The design of the
project also benefited greatly from competent and focused ground work and analysis
carried out by DFID, the main co-financier of the project.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and
actions taken, as applicable)

This project had no Quality Assurance Group (QAG) review of supervision. This
ICR rates the quality of implementation as Satisfactory. The project was effectively
and efficiently implemented mainly because of (i) the supportive, change-oriented and
open approach of the majority of the labor offices, specially given their very limited
capacities, lack of facilities and funds, enormous overload of staff and high turnover;
(ii) the continuity of the World Bank team during the entire project duration; (iii) the
management arrangement with efficiently working Steering Committee (following mid-
term); (iv) the high quality of selected consultants under the project and their high
professionalism, enthusiasm and commitment; and (v) strict financial discipline in the
implementation and supervision of contracts under the project.

While project implementation was satisfactory overall, in the early years of the
project, there were some challenges, as follows:

     · Project Monitoring. The reports of the PIU did not strictly follow the agreed
            schedule and deliverables; and it was at times difficult to get an overview of
            project implementation and issues. A new format for reporting and a Summary
            of project activities was proposed in the World Bank Aide Memoire in mid-
            2005 and subsequently used to follow up all strategic objectives in a coherent
            manner.

     · The role of the PIU Director. The PIU Director was making all strategic
            decisions regarding the project, and did not adequately consult with other
            relevant government agencies. As a result, the Ministry decided to review the
            limits of his role and responsibilities. By July 2005, a new PIU Director was
            appointed and until project closure, the PIU effectively and efficiently
            coordinated all project activities with MOLESP, NES, and the contractors.




re-skilling to compete and re-enter the labor market. Different types of retraining, including on-the-job and/or institutional training
is needed in these circumstances that can help re-employment at a moderate unit cost per worker.




                                                                 17

    · Counterpart Funds. During the first two years of the project, there were issues
        with the provision of adequate and timely co-financing of project activities from
        the Government side (except non-cash contributions). This was exacerbated by
        the problems with the PIU Director, as noted above. Following the departure of
        the PIU Director, there were no more delays with Government co-financing.

    · Ministry Oversight. MOLESP involvement in supervision was limited and the
        creation of a Project Steering Committee was proposed in early 2005. By July
        2005, the Committee was established and met regularly. MOLESP
        representatives were present in the meetings and supervised the project closely.

All of these challenges were identified during the Mid-term review of the project in
April 2005, and recommendations were made on ways to address these issues. After
mid-2005, once the PIU Director was changed and the Steering Committee was formed,
project implementation became very satisfactory.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

This project included three outcome indicators and eighteen output indicators. Overall,
they were measurable and adequately linked to the Development Objective. The entire
component 3 was devoted to M&E to enhance capacity in the MOLESP and the NES,
specifically, "...to develop a comprehensive system of labor market information to
assess and evaluate the effects of labor market programs, through the provision of
training, services and goods..." This system was also to provide information on project
indicators. For instance, an evaluation, done by means of a beneficiary survey, covered
not only traditional employment services offered by the NES, but also new activities
developed under the project, in particular the performance of Transition Centers and
Virtual Enterprises. This involved a timely and effective strategy of data collection and
entry, the building of a database of displaced workers. In addition, there were two
impact evaluations carried out (job and vacancy fairs and virtual enterprises).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

The project was rated a "C" category project at the time of appraisal as there were no
environmental issues in the project.

Throughout the project life, a satisfactory financial management system has been
maintained. Auditing arrangements were satisfactory. The Borrower respected the
relevant loan financial covenants, by submitting to the WB quarterly financial
monitoring reports and annual audit reports in a timely manner. The only challenge
encountered during the first two years of project implementation was lack of
counterpart financing. This was resolved in 2005.

Procurement activities were implemented by the MOLESP and there were no
misprocurement issues. Procurement specialists in the Project Implementation Unit
were familiar with procurement under Bank financed projects. Consulting services


                                               18

contracts were awarded following Bank Consultant Guidelines, with two main contracts
awarded under the Quality-and-Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) method.



2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and
institutional capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

The following paragraphs summarize key factors affecting the next phase, including
possible follow-up operations.

The concept of a Work Transition Center has officially become a part of the
Government of Serbia policy and was incorporated into the legislation. Labor
redeployment measures provided through Work Transition Centers were successfully
tested and implemented in enterprises undergoing restructuring and privatization in all
pilot and additional regions. Large state-owned enterprises are now obligated by law to
open Transition Centers and prepare social plans (on the basis of the methodology
developed by this project).

NES adopted the methodology for improved employment services in all local
offices.
The set of new or improved employment services (Job Clubs, Job fairs, Employer
Contact Services, Small Business Assistance Services, Cluster Economic Development,
Basic Business Skills, and Business Incubator Operations) were launched in most pilot
regions, and manuals and guidelines on implementation of those employment services
were designed, printed and delivered to MOLESP and NES staff. Workshops and
training were provided to staff in pilot employment offices and NES branch offices.

A Training Center was set up in the MOLESP and its activities are already in the
annual budget for the next years. The Learning Needs Analysis for MOLESP and
NES staff was completed. The Development Strategy for staff training was prepared
and training manuals were prepared and printed.

The following projects are considered a follow-up to the EPP. A new project in the
Bor region has allocated US$10 million to its Socio-Economic Regeneration
Component. This component is designed to serve two mutually reinforcing goals: (i)
support the improved labor redeployment programs and employment services aimed at
RTB Bor redundant workers and unemployed population of the Bor region (job search
assistance programs, off-the-job education and training services, on-the-job training
services, public works, strengthening of the institutional capacity of regional branches
of the National Employment Service); and (ii) promote the development of private
enterprise sector in the region (provision of business development services, assistance
to local communities with establishing and operating business incubation facilities,
lines of credit to qualified micro-institutions). Furthermore, the MOLESP is in the



                                               19

process of requesting a new investment project from the World Bank that would
broaden coverage of active labor market programs.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The objectives of the project were and remain relevant. The DO was consistent
with the 2001 Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) and remains consistent with the
current 3-year CAS of November 2004. The TSS, endorsed by the IBRD and IDA
Boards of Directors, emphasized the need for the Republic of Serbia to build capacity
in the public sector to promote more cost-effective labor redeployment programs, pilot
innovative services for the unemployed, and promote a balance between social
mitigation, fiscal sustainability and facilitating re-entry to the labor market, using the
EPP as a piloting instrument. The CAS supports far reaching structural reforms in the
public and private sector, while seeking to ensure that poverty is reduced, social
protection is adequate and appropriately targeted, and access to social services by the
poor and vulnerable is improved.

The EPP supported the overall Bank program in the country, aimed to sustain
economic reforms, privatization, and enterprise restructuring. In particular, the
activities supported under the Serbia Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC I), were
designed, among other issues, to initiate reforms in labor markets. The EPP was also
thematically linked to the first Serbia Private and Financial Sector Structural
Adjustment Credit (PFSAC I), which focuses on privatizing and restructuring socially
owned enterprises, and to the PFSAC II. In addition, this LIL complemented the Social
Sector Adjustment Credit (SOSAC) for Serbia that supported reforms in active and
passive programs for the unemployed.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)

The Project Development Objective was to be assessed by three outcome
indicators as well as an extensive list of output indicators, as follows:

(1) The first outcome indicator, to facilitate the rapid return of workers made
redundant to productive employment and thus reduce the duration of state supported
income support payments, was achieved by:

    (a) Introducing Work Transition Centers (WTCs) in the selected regions, a new
    instrument which proved to be helpful in the situations of restructuring and
    privatization. Support to redundant workers included not only financial
    compensation but also the opportunity for redeployment, training and self-
    employment. Since the funds for active labor measures were limited given the small
    nature of the LIL, activities of the project were oriented towards piloting and testing


                                               20

   innovative and cost-effective labor market programs. The following completed
   outputs supported the achievement of the project against the first outcome indicator:
   i)Identification of administrative structures for labor redeployment programs (LRP);
   ii) Preparation of operating guidelines for LRPs; and iii) Design and operation of
   LRP (thirteen WTCs were launched and equipped) in pilot regions and beyond in
   Bor, Majdanpek, and Pirot.

   (b) Supporting for labor redeployment programs by providing detailed information
   about the target group by establishing a database to monitor redundant workers, and
   conducting a tracer survey of displaced workers. The following completed outputs
   supported this outcome indicator: i) Training of LRP specialists (5 training sessions
   were held for 223 NES and MOLESP employees); ii) Development of survey
   instruments to assess likely demand for pre and post-layoff services (more than
   20,000 pre- and post-layoff workers were surveyed); and iii) Preparation of a
   database on displaced workers, including number and profile of displaced workers.

   On the basis of the above, it is evident that the project outcome indicator #1 -,
   the facilitation of rapid return of workers made redundant to productive
   employment - has been achieved by the EPP. Thirteen WTCs (instead of 10
   WTCs planned) in 10 regions (instead of 4 regions planned) have been created. The
   WTCs became focal points where potentially redundant workers got first-hand
   information and counseling services about worker rights associated with
   redundancies, information about labor market situation, and various other services
   (for example, seminars on how to invest or spend in the most rational way their
   severance payment were conducted in affected enterprises). Even though the staff
   of WTCs were mainly from HRs departments of the enterprise with limited funds
   and capacity available for placement services, more than 9,000 workers visited the
   centers: an estimated 7,000 workers received counseling services and information,
   and 2,000 workers were trained and retrained using the funds from the Government
   contribution, and around 800 new jobs were created or jobs saved in pilot
   enterprises.   Previously, such services were non-existent. As a result of the
   successful implementation of these centers, the Government amended relevant
   legislation and recommended each and every enterprise undergoing restructuring
   and privatization to establish such centers. Most importantly, the funds in the
   Government Social Program (the Transition Fund) have partially been reoriented
   from purely cash payments for severance into labor redeployment services.


2) The second outcome indicator, to increase employment opportunities offered by
employment services and number of small businesses supported, was achieved by:

   a) Piloting and testing the whole menu of new, modernized ALMPs, which
   significantly changed the image of the NES by making its approach more active and
   competent (7 job clubs were opened and equipped in NES; 10 job fairs were
   organized and supported; virtual enterprises were opened and equipped in 7 branch
   offices of the NES and in the central office in Belgrade; the concept of cluster was



                                            21

launched in four municipalities in Serbia; local economic development studies were
completed for 8 municipalities).

Table 1 below shows the results of the qualitative beneficiary survey conducted
under the project. Gross impact analysis of ALMPs showed unusually high
placement rates of beneficiaries of ALMPs given 20+% unemployment rate in the
country (columns 2 and 3). The results of three waves of tracer surveys of
redundant workers confirm much lower placement rates of non-participants (by the
survey, only 31 percent of them found new employment) than almost any of the
ALMPs implemented by NES (except vacancy fairs which traditionally have
relatively low placement rates but also the lowest unit costs). These findings
confirm that the ALMPs implemented were effective in increasing employment
opportunities in targeted regions.

b) Preparing and distributing manuals for a new menu of ALMPS to all branches of
the NES. The most visible changes were observed with respect to job fairs and job
search training courses- instruments that are now implemented mainly according to
the new methodology and are appreciated by participants.

The following output indicators support this outcome indicator: i) Preparation of
operating guidelines and manuals for a new menu of ALMPs (7 types of manuals on
active job seeking trainings, job clubs, work with vulnerable groups have been prepared,
printed and distributed to NES offices; ii) Training of NES staff to implement pilot
services (3 trainings ­75 employees were trained in principles and methods of evaluation
of ALMPs); and iii) New programs launched in pilot regions (new ALMPs listed in
Table 1 below).

    Based on the information presented above, it is evident that outcome indicator
    #2 ­ increase employment opportunities offered by employment services and
    the number of small businesses supported ­ has been achieved under the EPP.
    Gross impact analysis of ALMPs has shown unusually high placement rates of


                                                        23

  beneficiaries of ALMPs compared to those of non-participants. Right after program
  utilization, average placement rates for participants were 37.4%, while, according to
  tracer surveys, only 31% of non-participants found new jobs. These findings
  confirm that the ALMPs implemented were effective in increasing employment
  opportunities in targeted regions.

3) The third outcome indicator, to improve access, quality and utilization of
employment services in targeted districts, was achieved by:

  a) Strengthening of the capacity of the NES by starting new trends in working with
  the unemployed, improving skills of the staff and setting the basis of the system for
  monitoring effects of the applied measures. In the NES, staff caseload ­ the ratio of
  clients to employment counseling staff ­ was a critical constraint. On average, one
  counselor had to work with more than 1,600 registered unemployed (in some local
  offices the caseload is more than 2,000 unemployed individuals per one counselor)
  making it one of the heaviest work loads of a public employment service anywhere
  in the region (see Table 2 below). To solve these problems, the EPP concentrated
  on more effective and personalized mediation services and provided modern
  information technology, which sped up the work and lead to higher efficiency.

  Evidence available suggests that the project has already had an impact on the
  structure and scope of interventions by NES. A baseline study of existing programs,
  conducted in 2002 during project preparation, concluded that NES programs had
  been focused on the costliest interventions and made available only to a few job
  seekers. The main programs in the NES were: self-employment assistance
  (basically business grants), wage subsidies, or training programs on foreign
  languages and computer training (e.g., for the upper end of job seekers).
  Furthermore, no standards in provision of services existed, and not even the gross
  impact of the programs was ever measured. The table below confirms that ALMPs
  programs have now been reoriented towards group interventions, and most cost
  effective interventions, such as job search assistance, job clubs, and vacancy fairs,
  for which the largest participation and lowest unit costs per placement prevail.

   b) Contributing to the capacity of the MOLESP by establishing the Training and
   Staff Development Center (this is the first center of this kind in any of the
   Ministries within the Government) and to the capacity of the NES by starting new
   trends in working with the unemployed and setting the basis for a system to monitor
   results of the measures applied;

   The following output indicators support this outcome indicator: i) Staff
   development and management training in the MOLESP and NES (56 various
   training courses were held for 1,105 employees in MOLESP and NES and for 1,316
   representatives of social partners); ii) Training on the principles and methods of the
   evaluation of active labor market programs conducted and preparation of training
   materials; and iii) Development of a performance and management system (PIMS)
   to monitor labor market trends and programs.

   On the basis of the above, it is clear that the outcome indicator #3 ­
   improvement of project access, quality and utilization of employment services
   in targeted districts-- has been achieved under the EPP. ALMPs programs
   have now been reoriented towards group interventions, and most cost effective
   interventions, such as job search assistance, job clubs, and vacancy fairs with the
   largest participation and lowest unit costs per placement. The project has enhanced
   the NES capacity in working with the unemployed by starting these new trends, and
   by setting the basis for a system to monitor results of the measures applied.

   3.3 Efficiency

and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)



                                             25

This kind of project did not require an economic analysis to be conducted. Fiscal
benefits of the project are impossible to estimate given the nature of the investments.
All development objectives were achieved and implemented within budget.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The objectives of the project were and remain relevant and consistent with the CAS
objectives, and the project was implemented within budget and on time. As detailed
above, there was substantial progress made against all outcome and output indicators.
The project carried out all of its intended activities in terms of piloting of ALMPs very
successfully and in a timely manner. Given all these significant achievements,
particularly given the tight time-frame of the project, the project deserves a Satisfactory
rating for outcome for all intents and purposes. This view is strongly supported by the
Government assessment of the project (see Annex 8 where the MOLESP rates the
project as "very satisfactory"). This ICR, however, rates the overall outcome of the
project as Moderately Satisfactory because despite the significant attempts made under
the project to measure the impact of some of the piloted programs, in the end (within
the project time frame) it was not possible to carry out a final full net impact evaluation
on all project interventions. The reason for this is that a net impact evaluation is a
lengthy process requiring a follow-up survey of program participants one year (a
standard) after program completion.        However, the following work was done to
measure the outcomes of the project during its implementation:

    · A beneficiary survey was conducted at the end of the project. This survey
        demonstrated that 2/3 of participants saw ALMPs as fully or partially useful for
        finding a job.
    · Two net impact evaluations were carried out on (i) vacancy and job fairs and (ii)
        virtual enterprises. On the vacancy fairs, the results were positive (up to 10-15
        percent of participants found a job immediately following the fair. Also, unit
        costs for these fairs were very low, on average US$200-$500 per 400-600
        participants (job seekers and employers). As far as virtual enterprises, the
        placement rates of beneficiaries after completion of the program were up to 30
        percent in some cases. However, these results were deemed not fully conclusive
        by the independent evaluator of the project given the low numbers of those
        involved in these virtual enterprises.
    · Four regional conferences and one national conference on the outcomes of EPP
        were conducted in which all the outcomes were thoroughly analyzed and
        discussed.    Participants felt that the project made great contributions to
        improving the effectiveness of ALMPs and were very receptive to the creation
        of the WTCs.

As mentioned above, while the final net impact evaluation of the programs under the
project was not possible in the end, most recently, the Ministry has commissioned



                                            26

Economic and Social Policy Institute to carry out a net impact evaluation of various
ALMPs, including those tested under the EPP. Based on the outcomes of this
evaluation, the Ministry will be able to select the most efficient programs, improve their
design, and target them at client groups that benefit most from given interventions.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

This project did not intend to have a gender impact. However, beneficiaries of this
project were unemployed and redundant individuals who were mostly poor or at risk of
poverty.

The project had some social development impact through the local economic
development plans developed to identify regional resources and opportunities, which
should be marketed and promoted as a fuel of future development of local economy and
a source of new employment creation. These plans were developed in Pancevo,
Kraljevo, Lazarevac, Nis, Bor, Majdanpek, Uzice and Krusevac. The main results of
this intervention were: (i) development of promotional and informational materials on
local economic potential and investment projects; (ii) preparation of orientation and
training program, and provision of training for local authorities in use of these studies;
(iii) creation of advisory councils and advisory groups in pilot regions; and (iv)
townhall meetings, periodical workshops and roundtables.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

Although the establishment of Work Transition Centers was challenging as the
whole approach was new and not immediately accepted, the concept of WTC,
which was designed and piloted through the EPP, has become part of Serbian
legislation. Three key drivers were behind the successful implementation of WTCs: (a)
the motivation, commitment and leadership of the WTC team; (b) the support by
enterprise under restructuring; and (c) the competencies and coordination efforts of the
consultant (especially the quality of training delivered).

Furthermore, the EPP contributed to the capacity of the MOLESP by establishing the
Training and Staff Development Center (this is the first center of this kind in any of the
Ministries within the Government).

Despite being implemented in a difficult setting and according to a very tight
schedule, the project has been successful in introducing new approaches to
ALMPs and especially in training of NES staff in implementing them. The quality
of the training seminars, materials and manuals has been highly appreciated by the
participants. The manuals prepared for a new menu of ALMPs were broadly
disseminated on the request of NES in all branch offices. The most visible changes are
observed in respect to job fairs and job search trainings--instruments that are now



                                              27

implemented mainly according to new methodology and are very much appreciated by
the participants. NES characterizes these services as "easy to organize" and "low cost".

Another very important step was made in changing the approach of NES towards
employers. Earlier, employers were even not a target group for NES branches, but with
the EPP, the focus shifted to this group and staff became much more aware that
employers are the primary users of NES services and became more active towards
employers.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

This project had positive unintended outcomes. Given the fortunate event of
appreciation of the currency during project implementation, the project had surplus
budget. Therefore, it was extended by 6 months and additional pilots were included.
The project was then able to reach more target groups than it had initially intended to.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

A beneficiary survey was conducted to assess respondents' opinions about the quality,
content and usefulness of active labor market measures and programs in four pilot
branch offices of the National Employment Service ­Nis, Kraljevo, Pancevo and
Beograd (including the Lazarevac unit). This was a telephone poll, which covered all
measures and programs, except for transition centers for which users were interviewed
face to face. The survey was done in early February 2006. The sample comprised a total
of 3,729 beneficiaries of active labor market programs and measures, of whom 2,387
were polled, resulting in a response rate of 64 percent. Nearly two-thirds of participants
see active measures and programs as fully or partially useful for finding a job. The
Executive Summary of the Final Report ESPI I (2006) "Assessment of the effectiveness
of Active Labor Market Programs" can be found in Annex 5.

Summing up the results of the survey, it may be concluded that measures and programs
supported by the project have produced certain positive effects on employment growth.
Table 1 above (also in Annex 5) gives an overview of active measures and programs.
The effectiveness is expressed through objective indicators ­ the relative effect of the
measure/program on employment, and through subjective indicators ­ the assessment
of how useful the program was for finding a job. Objective indicators are expressed as
the number of persons who found a job immediately after having participated in the
program (Column 2), i.e. the number of persons who had a job six months following
their participation in the program (Column 3). The period of monitoring the effects of
active measures and programs on the target group of beneficiaries, in the duration of six
months, is selected based on the indicators of the characteristics of the Serbian labor
market. Columns 4, 5 and 6 show beneficiaries' perceptions on how useful certain
active measures/programs were for their finding a job.

The survey covered very heterogeneous group of active measures and programs,
whereby certain programs are by their definition in direct correlation with employment


                                               28

from participants' very entry into the program. Therefore, since the implementation of
certain active measures and programs have different relative effects on the employment
of the target group of beneficiaries, positive effects of their implementation were
expressed through the assessment of their usefulness, as well. For this reason, active
measures and programs included in this analysis were ranked according to their
usefulness for the target group of beneficiaries' finding a job. The ranking is done
based on the index of active program/measure's usefulness (Column 7). The index
represents a weighted average of the assessments of usefulness of a measure/program
for respondents' finding a job.

The first group of the analyzed active labor market measures and programs comprises
those programs which the participants perceive as the most useful for finding a job.
These are: trainings for a known employer, trainings in virtual enterprises, business
centers, specialized PC training and financial support for apprentices-volunteers. It
should be stressed that self-employment programs, although initially treating
participants as employed persons, also have high positive effects on the employment of
persons with disabilities ­ subsidy beneficiaries, as well as on the employment of other
persons who entered the program through public call. Participants in these programs
have very positive attitudes on their usefulness. The first group includes those active
measures and programs which have the highest relative impact on employment and
they should be implemented more intensively.

The second group of active measures and programs includes active job search training
and basic PC training. This group has a lower relative impact on employment relative to
the previous one, but its usefulness for employment is still above the average. This
group of measures should be given smaller weight in planning future activities
compared with the first one. Special attention should be paid to the fact that significant
decrease in the number of employed persons was associated with basic PC training.

Finally, there is the third group of active measures and programs, which is the most
heterogeneous, which usefulness got the poorest assessment and which has the lowest
relative effect on the employment of the target group of beneficiaries. This group ranks
below the average for all programs and measures surveyed and it comprises: foreign
language courses, other trainings, transition centers and job fairs.

In addition, as mentioned in Section 3.4 above, four regional conferences and one
national conference on the outcomes of EPP were conducted in which all the
outcomes were thoroughly analyzed and discussed.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The risk to Development outcomes of the project is moderate. The Development
Objectives remain a priority of the government as evidenced by the following key
factors: i) the concept of Work Transition Center has officially become a part of the



                                            29

Government of Serbia policy and was incorporated into the legislation, ii) NES adopted
the methodology for improved employment services in all local offices, iii) a Training
Center was set up in the MOLESP and its activities are already in the annual budget for
the next years, iv) a new project in the Bor region has allocated US$10 million to its
Socio-Economic Regeneration Component, which supports the improved labor
redeployment programs and employment services aimed at RTB Bor redundant
workers and unemployed population of the Bor region, and v) the MOLESP is in the
process of requesting a new investment project from the World Bank that would
broaden coverage of active labor market programs. On the other hand, even though the
Performance Information and Management System (PIMS) has been put in place under
the project, more resources and IT staff in the NES branches are needed in order to
input the detailed data into the system.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Satisfactory

This project was the first labor LIL in the country and it was extensively prepared
making use of experience from other countries in the region. The design of the
project was well-researched and consistent with the priorities of the MOLESP and the
Country Assistance Strategy. Several key risks were identified, including institutional
capacity and skills to complete the project, timely provision of counterpart funds for
implementation of enterprise social plans and appropriate accountability in the use of
project funds and inputs. These risks were well identified and mitigated.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank undertook regular supervision missions (seven in total) and took
advantage of those to engage in active policy dialogue. Mission staff included the
appropriate technical experts and the client was very pleased with the advice and
guidance provided. The project was always rated satisfactory except for once (one
supervision mission in April 2005 declared it to be moderately satisfactory given
problems in the management of the PIU and the lack of involvement of the MOLESP).
There were regular thorough summaries of project activities and achievements,
particularly after May 2005.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's overall performance during project preparation, appraisal and
supervision is rated satisfactory. Good technical expertise was provided and the client



                                               30

was appreciative of the advice and guidance. Continuity in the staffing of WB positions,
including the one of the Task Team Leader, characterized most of project life and was
important for smooth and uninterrupted project implementation.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Government of Serbia was committed to achieving the development objectives.
This commitment arrived two years after project approval and was sustained afterwards
throughout implementation. Overall, the government provided timely counterpart
financing for the project. An exception was recorded during the second year of project
implementation but it was mainly related to the lack of ownership of the project in
MOLESP and the inadequate management style of the PIU Director. Eventually, the
issue was resolved.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Ratings:
Ministry for Labor and Employment                    Satisfactory

Project Implementation Unit                          Satisfactory


The performance of the implementing agencies is rated as Satisfactory by this ICR.
Responsibility for project management and implementation rested with the MOLESP.
The Ministry was assisted with the technical aspects of implementation by a Project
Implementation Unit within MOLESP. The PIU was extremely committed, professional
and enthusiastic, especially after the first Director was replaced in June 2005 given his
inadequate management style.

One of the most salient features of this project was the creation of a Steering
Committee in July 2005, which developed a much needed sense of ownership of the
project and full commitment to its objectives. This Committee, including
representatives of MOLESP, NES, and the PIU, supervised and managed the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Borrower's overall performance is rated satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

Reflecting on the overall project, the key lessons that have been learned and/or
reinforced in the project design/implementation are as follows:




                                             31

(i) This project showed the importance of establishing a project Steering Committee
right at the start of the intervention, with a clearly defined set of roles and
responsibilities in the relevant documents. The creation of the Steering Committee in
July 2005 was crucial for the success of this operation.

(ii) The duration of the project was too short (3 years) for such an ambitious project
with numerous outputs despite the fact that it was extended for 6 months. After
complex contracting, negotiations, agreements for the contracts, which required QCBS,
there was only one year left for design, preparation, staffing, and implementation.

(iii) The inclusion of component #3 was highly relevant and useful. It was entirely
devoted to establishing a good M&E framework in order to enhance capacity in the
MOLESP and the NES, specifically, "...to develop a comprehensive system of labor
market information to assess and evaluate the effects of labor market programs, through
the provision of training, services and goods." In future projects, it is recommended
that special attention (individual component or sub-component) is given to ensure
proper monitoring and evaluation.

(iv) When designing complex systems (such as the Performance Information and
Management System implemented under this project), it is important to assess the
circumstances, resources and capacity of counterparts to maintain such systems after
the project is closed.

(v) Pilot projects, particularly LILs, should have explicit built-in impact evaluations so
that policy-makers can know how limited funds should be allocated to maximize their
impact and how programs might be improved to increase their effectiveness. In
addition, the time-frame for these projects should be adequate to allow for such
evaluations to actually materialize.

(vi) Donor coordination is critical in order to avoid overlapping of topics in the training
sessions. Even though staff at the NES and MOLESP actively participated in all
workshops and training provided by the EPP, the same people ended up taking all the
courses and had a hard time keeping up with their daily duties. More coordination with
donors during EPP implementation could have increased the receptiveness of staff and
effectiveness of efforts.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

This section aims at providing separate evaluations and ratings of achievements
by components. The section presents a summary of what has been achieved and
how it is related to project objectives (a more thorough description of actual values of
output indicators at completion can be found in the Results Framework).            The
Employment Promotion project had four components and all have been rated
Satisfactory by this ICR:


Component 1: "Design of Labor Redeployment Activities" is rated Satisfactory
(actual total cost US$ 1.93 million). This component aimed to reintegrate displaced
workers and other job seekers into the labor market and mitigate the social costs of
enterprise restructuring through the development and testing of new policies,
institutional arrangements and labor redeployment programs. The following output
indicators were put in place to measure the success of this component:

        Identification of administrative structures for labor redeployment programs
        (LRP), as part of the carrying out of enterprise social plans, including job
        counseling, financial counseling, job search referral, and skill and
        entrepreneurial training;
        Preparation of operating guidelines for LRPs,
        Design and operation of LRP (thirteen WTCs were launched and equipped) in
        pilot regions and beyond, in Bor, Majdanpek, and Pirot,
        Training of LRP specialists (5 training sessions were held for 223 NES and
        MOLESP employees);
        Development of survey instruments to assess likely demand for pre and post-
        layoff services (more than 20,000 pre- and post-layoff workers were surveyed);
        Staff development and management training in the MOLESP and NES (56
        various training courses were held for 1,105 employees in MOLESP and NES
        and for 1,316 representatives of social partners);
        Preparation of criteria and approval process for a small "fund facility" to be
        accessed by firms requiring assistance with design and evaluation of LRPs;
        Development and implementation of social plans (LRPs)

All output indicators reached their target level on time, and some of them surpassed the
originally set goals. The only concern regarding this component is that there was not
enough time to measure the impact of Work Transition Centers on redundant workers
appropriately (see Component 3).


Component 2: "Piloting reforms in Public Employment Services" is rated
Satisfactory (actual total cost US$ 2 million). The main objective of this component
was to design, pilot and evaluate new and cost effective public employment services



                                            34

with the view to assisting the unemployed to rapidly re-enter the labor market. The
following output indicators were put in place to measure the success of this component:
       Preparation of operating guidelines and manuals for a new menu of ALMPs;
       Staff development and management training in the MOLESP and NES;
       Determination of equipment and materials needed for relevant activities;
       Training of NES staff to implement pilot services;
       New programs launched in pilot regions (improved employment services, such
       as job search assistance programs and small business advisory services).

Almost all output indicators reached their target level, and some of them surpassed the
originally set goals. The exception was incubator centers, which were to be opened in
each of the pilot sites but were not implemented after unsuccessful search for funding
partners. The results of institutional capacity building were demonstrated through the
creation of a Training Center within MOLESP, whose activities are already in the
annual budget for the next years. Furthermore, the sustainability of this component is
confirmed by the development of a follow-up operation, which puts special emphasis
on broadening ALMPs and the continuation of strengthening of NES service delivery.


Component 3: "Labor market information and evaluation: social impact of
restructuring and effects of ALMPs" is rated Moderately Satisfactory (actual total
cost US$ 0.33 million). The objective of this component was to develop a comprehensive
system of labor market information to assess and evaluate the effects of labor market
programs. The following output indicators were put in place to measure the success of
this component:

       Development of a performance and management system (PIMS) to monitor
       labor market trends and programs, including: review of the currently existing
       PIMS, design of a model PIMS and launch of new/modified PIMS;
       Training on the principles and methods of the evaluation of active labor market
       programs conducted and preparation of training materials (including building
       local capacity to generate, analyze and use the information for policy
       formulation
       and program design);
       Design, implementation and analysis of a tracer survey of displaced workers;
       Design, implementation and dissemination of results of a qualitative assessment
       of ALMPs in pilot areas, including a client satisfaction survey;
       Preparation of a database on displaced workers, including number and profile of
       displaced workers.

Most outcome indicators were accomplished in time. The key concerns regarding this
component are: i) the sustainability of PIMS, given that it is questionable whether there
exists capacity and resources to keep it operational and ii) the impossibility to measure
the cost-effectiveness of most ALMPs given the small size of the pilots and the short
duration of the project.




                                            35

Component 4: "Project Management" is rated Satisfactory (actual total cost
US$ 0.66 million). This component supported the operation of a Project
Implementation Unit (PIU), staffed by a project director and technical staff, which was
responsible for the overall coordination and administration during project life. This
project provided assistance to the MOLESP in the management of the Project through
the provision of services, including the audit of accounts and financial statements, as
well as assistance to both the MOLESP and NES in the implementation of the Project
through the provision of training, services and goods. The PIU was a vital link between
the Bank team and the leadership of the MOLESP. The PIU Director was changed in
2005, given problems with his managerial style, and from then on, the PIU successfully
carried on its normal activities and ensured project implementation to the degree
dependent on its authority and competencies. The PIU contributed greatly to the
creation of the Steering Committee in July 2005.

                               EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The results presented in this Report measure the relative effects of active labor market
programs and measures on employment. These effects are expressed as the job placement
rate of persons who participated in labor market programs or used active labor market
measures organized by the National Employment Service during the selected period. The
effects of active labor market policy could also be measured on the basis of attitudes and
opinions of persons who participated in programs and measures on how much they
directly or indirectly benefited from the participation. These effects are manifested in: (1)
their attitudes regarding the usefulness of a measure/program for finding a job; (2) how
satisfied they are with the contents of the trainings/programs, and (3) their perceptions of
their labor market prospects.

Summing up the results of the survey, it may be concluded that analyzed measures and
programs have certain positive effects on employment growth. However, in order to draw
precise conclusions on the effects of active programs and measures on employment, we
conducted the analysis of their key characteristics. These characteristics may be observed
through the matrix of weaknesses, strengths, opportunities and threats. The analysis of
four quadrants in which characteristics are defined, in the form of strengths and
weaknesses, potential opportunities and threats, is known as SWOT analysis.

Table 1 gives an overview of active measures and programs. The effectiveness is
expressed through objective indicators ­ the relative effect of the measure/program on
employment, and through subjective indicators ­ the assessment of how useful the
program was for finding a job. Objective indicators are expressed as the number of
persons who found a job immediately after having participated in the program (Table 1,
Column 2), i.e. the number of persons who had a job six months following their
participation in the program (Table 1, Column 3). The period of monitoring the effects of
active measures and programs on the target group of beneficiaries, in the duration of six
months, is selected based on the indicators of the characteristics of the Serbian labor
market. Columns 4, 5 and 6 on Table 1 show beneficiaries' perceptions on how useful
certain active measures/programs were for their finding a job.

The survey covered very heterogeneous group of active measures and programs, whereby
certain programs are by their definition in direct correlation with employment from
participants' very entry into the program. Therefore, since the implementation of certain
active measures and programs have different relative effects on the employment of the
target group of beneficiaries, we tried to express positive effects of their implementation
through the assessment of their usefulness, as well. For this reason, we ranked active



                                             40

measures and programs included in this analysis according to their usefulness for the
target group of beneficiaries' finding a job. The ranking is done based on the index of
active program/measure's usefulness (Table 1, Column 7). The index represents a
weighted average of the assessments of usefulness of a measure/program for respondents'
finding a job.

On the basis of the total index of usefulness of all measures and programs for
employment, which is 2.86, the analyzed active labor market measures were classified
into three groups. The first group comprises active measures and programs with above
the average usefulness on employment. The second group comprises active measures and
programs whose usefulness is right above the average and the third group those active
measures and programs which usefulness in finding a job is below the average.

1The indicator expresses the proportion of persons who found a job after having used the measure/participated in the
program, i.e. six months following the usage of the measure/participation in the program in the total number of
respondents.
2 The assessment of usefulness of active programs/measures ranges from 5 ­ excellent to 1-unsatisfactory. Columns 4,
5 and 6 show the percentage of persons who assessed the usefulness of active measures/programs for employment with
4 and 5 (Column 4), 3 (Column 5) and 2 and 1 (Column 6).
3The index expresses a weighted average of the scores which measure usefulness of active labor market program in
finding a job. Scores range between 1 and 5.
4Program participants still work in their old companies. The program still has no effects on new employment.




The first group of the analyzed active labor market measures and programs comprises
those programs which the participants perceive as the most useful for finding a job. These
are: trainings for a known employer, trainings in virtual enterprises, business centers,
specialized PC training and financial support for apprentices-volunteers. It should be
stressed that self-employment programs, although initially treating participants as
employed persons, also have high positive effects on the employment of persons with
disabilities ­ subsidy beneficiaries, as well as on the employment of other persons who
entered the program through public call. Participants in these programs have very
positive attitudes on their usefulness. The first group includes those active measures and
programs which have the highest relative impact on employment and they should be
implemented more intensively.

The second group of active measures and programs includes active job search training
and basic PC training. This group has a lower relative impact on employment relative to
the previous one, but its usefulness for employment is still above the average. This group
of measures should be given smaller weight in planning future activities compared with
the first one. Special attention should be paid to the fact that significant decrease in the
number of employed persons was associated with basic PC training.

Two characteristics are typical for active job-search training: (1) during the monitoring
period, the number of employed beneficiaries decreases and (2) participants do not have
clear perceptions on how much this measure helped them find a job. However, the reason
why this measure should be still implemented is to increase the level of activity of job
seekers and to reduce the risk of growth in long-term unemployment of the target group
of beneficiaries.

The significant portion of participants in basic PC training becomes jobless during the
monitoring period. If we put aside job fairs, this measure has the smallest relative impact
on employment growth, while at the same time, a great number of participants consider it
not useful for finding a job. The measure should be given smaller weight in planning
active measures for the upcoming period.

Finally, there is the third group of active measures and programs, which is the most
heterogeneous, which usefulness got the poorest assessment and which has the lowest
relative effect on the employment of the target group of beneficiaries. This group ranks




                                                          42

below the average for all programs and measures surveyed and it comprises: foreign
language courses, other trainings, transition centers and job fairs.

Foreign language courses have higher than average relative effect on employment, but
their characteristic is considerable drop in employed participants during the monitoring
period, while great number of participants assesses the measure as less useful, i.e. useless
for finding a job. The implementation of this measure should be given smaller relative
weight in planning future activities.

Other trainings are only a little below the average with regard to their relative impact on
employment. However, more than half of beneficiaries view this measure as not useful
for finding a job, which was why it is classified in the last group. Therefore, it should be
given smaller weight in planning future activities.

Transition centers (TC) did not have any impact on employment.2 Although subjective
assessments by more than half of persons who used the services of transition centers
indicate to their not being useful, the effects of this measure on reemployment of workers
who are declared redundant in their companies are expected in months to come. The
program should be encouraged by more intensively organizing trainings for employed
workers.

Job fairs have relatively small, but stable effect on the change of participants' labor
market status. But although participants perceive job fairs as inefficient, this measure
have all the attributes for future implementation due to the fact that it is available to great
number of participants and to its relatively stable impact on participants' employment
status during the monitoring period.




2This assessment was carried out when WTCs were only starting their activities (six months after their opening).
However, a 2 or 3 year-span is need for evaluation of these type of activities.

Overall Assessment : Very Satisfactory

   A. Assessment of Development Objectives and Design

Serbia and Montenegro has agreed with International Development Agency (IDA), - Sub-
Credit Agreement for Serbia, to borrow the equivalent of two million Special Drawing
Rights (SDR 2,000.000) to support Employment Promotion Project (EPP). The
Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, through its
Department of International Development (DFID) has agreed to provide a grant in an
amount equivalent to $1,750.000 (The DFID Grant) to assist in financing of the Project.
The Employment Promotion Project, which by its nature is Learning and Investment
Loan (LIL) was designed by the Department for International Development (DFID, UK)
and the World Bank (WB) to support the development of relevant labour market and
employment policies in Serbia.

The key institutional counterparts were the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social
Policy and the Labour Market Bureau (later transformed into the National Employment
Service).

The EPP was also thematically linked to the first Serbia Private and Financial Sector
Structural Adjustment Credit (PFSAC I) which focuses on privatizing and restructuring
socially owned enterprises, and to the recently negotiated PFSAC II. In addition, this LIC
complements the recently approved Social Sector Adjustment Credit (SOSAC) for Serbia
that supports reforms in active and passive programs for the unemployed.

Serbia has been dealing with the severe economic consequences of more than a decade of
economic mismanagement, exacerbated by regional conflicts and sanctions. The
Government of Serbia has been increasingly concerned about issues of mass
unemployment (predominantly long term unemployment), large informal labor markets
and low efficiency of employment services. Although the informal sector labor market
mitigates the unemployment and poverty problem, in the interest of long term economic
development it is important that unemployment is absorbed by the growing formal sector,
rather than by the informal sector.

    1. Original Objective of the Project

The objective of the Employment Promotion Project (EPP) for Serbia and Montenegro
(sub-lent to the Republic of Serbia) will be to improve the efficiency of labor programs
by piloting and testing new approaches and innovative labor redeployment programs and
employment services for the unemployed in the selected areas with a view to
employment promotion and increased cost-effectiveness of such programs. The EPP had
a strong orientation on learning and innovation.

The development objective of this project is to improve the cost-effectiveness and
efficiency of labor programs in the Republic of Serbia by:
1. the development and implementation of redeployment measures targeting redundant
workers in enterprises undergoing deep restructuring or privatization thus facilitating the
rapid return of workers to productive employment.
2. the introduction of more cost-effective labor market interventions and innovative
employment services for the unemployed to assist them in rapidly reentering the labor
market.
3. the development of institutional capacity to collect and analyze labor market data in
order to improve the effectiveness of labor market policies and programs.

    2. Original Components

The Project has four distinct components: (1) Design of Labor Redeployment Activities,
(2) Piloting reforms in Public Employment Services (3) Labor market information and
evaluation: social impact of restructuring and effects of ALMPs and (4) Project
Management

(1) Design of Labor Redeployment Activities - This component aims to reintegrate
displaced workers and other job seekers into the labor market and mitigate the social
costs of enterprise restructuring through the development and testing of new policies,
institutional arrangements and labor redeployment programs, including the design and
implementation of enterprise social plans, through the provision of training, services and
goods. In particular, the component aims to provide assistance to persons displaced as a
result of restructuring or privatization of enterprises through labor redeployment services,
as part of the carrying out of enterprise social plans. Operating guidelines for a LRP will
be prepared, and cadres of LRP specialists trained. The component will also finance
technical assistance to help up to 10 enterprises in the pilot areas prepare social plans.
The component will provide funding for labor redeployment services for affected
workers as part of the social plan.

The primary objective of Component 2 "Piloting reforms in Public Employment
Services" will be to design, pilot and evaluate new and cost effective public employment
services with a view to assisting the unemployed to rapidly re-enter the labor market,
through the provision of improved employment services.




                                              46

The Component comprises 5 tasks. The objective of the (1) Improved Employment
Services is to provide enhanced public employment services to workers, who have been
displaced by the privatization of SOEs and enterprise restructuring programs, and other
job seekers, to assist them in rapidly reentering the labor market. It includes the following
activities: job search skill training programs; job clubs; special employment programs for
vulnerable groups (youth, disabled, and minorities); vacancy and job fairs; and employer
contact services. The objective of the (2) Improved Small Business Assistance Services
is to encourage the unemployed to enter self-employment and assist individuals to start
successful businesses. It includes the following activities: small business advisory
services; business incubator services; and development of a general framework for local
economic potential studies The objective of the (3)Local Economic Development
Planning Studies is to help communities to develop the local economy and generate new
employment by identifying and marketing regional resources and opportunities to
potential investors. The (4)Design and Implementation of Virtual Enterprises (a
Practice Firm) aims to improve interactive learning, obtain and develop business skills,
and introduce the job seekers and students into the day-to-day business life and labor
market reality. (5)Staff Development and Management Training in the Ministry of
Labor and Employment and the Labor Market Bureau aims to enable MOLESP and NES
develop technical and process management skills for the effective development of
employment policy and labor market interventions, and ensure effective implementation
of EPP.

The objective of Component 3 "Labor market information and evaluation: social
impact of restructuring and effects of ALMPs" is to develop a comprehensive system
of labor market information to assess and evaluate the effects of labor market programs,
through the provision of training, services and goods. This involves building local
capacity to generate, analyze and use the information for policy formulation and program
design.

The Component comprises five tasks: (i) Development of the performance information
and management system (PIMS) to monitor labor market trends and programs, and guide
program design; (ii) Training on the principles and methods of the evaluation of ALMPs;
(iii) Monitoring of displaced workers: the use of labor redeployment services and changes
in the labor market status; (iv) Qualitative assessment of ALMP supported by the EPP in
four pilot areas; (v) Build a Database on Displaced Workers.

Component 4 ,,Project Management" This component will provide assistance to
MOLESP in the management of the Project through provision of services, including the
audit of accounts and financial statements, as well as assistance to both MOLESP and
NES in the implementation of the Project through the provision of training, services and
goods. PIU will be under the overall supervision of the MOLESP. It will act as a
coordination office for the project conducting the complete liaison with the Bank and
reporting to it, administering all procurement issues and fulfilling financial management
responsibilities. PIU staff will be led by a manager (PIU Director) who would have
overall responsibility for the project. He/she will be assisted by a financial specialist with
responsibility for project finance and accounting, and a procurement specialist who



                                             47

would advise and assist with all procurement procedures and monitor their
implementation. PIU will also have a Component Coordinator for technical work on the
components and support to staff members.

B. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

In recent years, the Republic of Serbia has embarked on a significant enterprise
restructuring reform and privatization program. It was expected that in the short term the
reforms would entail major labor displacement. The restructuring would give rise to large
inflow of the unemployed, while due to the underdeveloped new private sector,
employment would be, in the short to medium-term, limited. The Employment Promotion
Project was highly relevant for Serbia in that situation, characterized by sharp necessity
for mitigating the consequences of privatization and restructuring and coping with high
unemployment and redundancies.

The implementation of this program was a main challenge for MOLESP in the light of
inevitable redundancies in certain enterprises. Support to workers who became jobless
was supposed to cover not only financial compensation but also to provide an opportunity
for redeployment, training and self-employment. In addition to general unemployment
that it dealt with, the Employment Service did not have sufficient capacity for solving the
problems that occurred. Since the funds for active labor market measures were
significantly limited, activities of the Project oriented towards piloting and testing
innovative and cost effective labour market programs, were very relevant.

The learning took place through active participation and engagement of relevant
MOLESP and NES staff in designing, implementation and evaluation of the piloted
innovative labor market programs. The menu of piloted LRP/ALMPs was tested in
various economic and social situations and with the participation of local authorities and
other key stakeholders. The pilot areas were chosen in regions with high unemployment
rates and mass redundancies resulting from enterprise restructuring, privatization or
closure.

At the local level (in the selected pilots) local partnerships were established to facilitate
the coordination of local stakeholders and oversee the implementation of activities
(LLOs, local administration, trade unions, employers, NGOs).

The concept of Workers Transition Centers designed and piloted through the project has
officially become a part of the Government of Serbia policy and was incorporated in the
legislation. Enterprises are now encouraged by law to open Transition Centers and
prepare social plans (on the basis of the methodology developed by the project).

The Project did contribute to the capacity building within the Ministry (Employment
sector) and NES. The Terms of Reference for management development set the basis for
and founded The Staff Training and Development Centre in the Ministry. As of July this
year, this centre has proceeded to operate independently, to work on the development of
employees through establishing needs and organizing trainings.



                                             48

The Project certainly made an impact on the National Employment Services. In spite of
the fact that NES staff are overloaded and also stretched between training courses
provided by different donors (technical assistance efforts were not well coordinated),
NES services improved through start of new trends in work with the unemployed and
setting the basis of the system for monitoring effects of the applied measures. The results
are also shown through the third component of the Project, which contributed to the work
methods in evaluating and monitoring effects on the labour market, as well as to getting
familiar with the new approaches and analyses in this field. The establishment of
database for monitoring redundant workers is also considered to be of particular
importance to the Ministry, as it enables them to follow up and direct activities in this
field.

The manuals prepared for a new menu of ALMPs are broadly disseminated at the request
of NES in all branch offices. The most visible changes are observed in respect to job fairs
and job search training courses ­ instruments that are now implemented mainly according
to the new methodology and are very much appreciated by the participants. NES also
qualifies these services as `easy to organise' and `low cost'.

The establishment of EPP Steering Committee was not required from the beginning. But
its creation in July 2005 became a positive step for the development of ownership and
further project implementation. A steering Committee was composed of the
representatives of MOLESP, NES and donors and was convened regularly (once a month,
on average). Even though its role was never precisely defined, the Steering Committee
followed all of the Project's activities, made key decisions, and was able to influence
planning of activities.

Four pilot areas were chosen in regions with high unemployment and mass redundancies
resulting from enterprise restructuring, privatization or closure. The choice of pilots was
made in such a way that it allowed testing variety of measures in different environments.

Participation of MOLESP and NES

Even though at the very begining problems concerning the Project management were
encountered due to the lack of experience and absence of participation of the key
stakeholders in the Project, taking over the ownership of the Project in July 2005,
establishing the Project Steering Committee and changing the PIU Director, the Ministry
entirely took over the leading role and that certainly affected the final outcome of the
Project. Support of the management of MOLESP and NES (including NES Pilot branch
office managers), their wholehearted cooperation with PIU and the selected consultants,
as well as committment and participation of employees of the National Employment
Service enabled implementation of all planned activities. Positive attitude towards the
Project and awareness of its usefullness largely affected efforts and motivation of
MOLESP and NES staff for participation and acceptance of novelties offered by the
Project. NES local branch offices were the main promoters and implementors of activities
in the field.



                                             49

It should be noted that the working style and management approach of the first PIU
Director caused loss of empowerment, ownership and motivation. Micro-management
and miscommunication created wrong expectations among the participants and
established barriers for the development of cooperation between stakeholders.
Coordination, provided by PIU, improved after the change of its Director.

Lack of ownership posed a problem from the very beginning, therefore the establishment
of the Steering Committee was proposed for the purpose of strengthening the ownership.
The fact that representatives of the stakeholder institutions in the Steering Committee had
to have a regular close cooperation that contributed to a more efficient project
implementation, as well as to the development of a dialogue between partners on the
project. The right choice of the Committe members guaranteed that it would become the
first real working body that would make the path for project implementation.

Participation of the World Bank and DFID

The Team of the Bank responsible for this Project rendered an exceptional and very
significant support to the Ministry and Implementation Unit throughout the
implementation and administration of the Project. Coordination by an expert team of the
Bank at all stages and operations on the Project was present and invaluable for the whole
duration and made a significant impact on the successful completion of all planned
activities. Regular participation of donor represenatives in the Sterring Committee
meetings was very important for project coordiation.

The project was well organised and coordinated. The delivery mechanisms proved to be
efficient in the majority of cases. It should be emphasised that project benefited from the
procedures allowing high level of flexibility in introducing necessary modifications to the
initial plans.

Overall, the EPP project had a number of positive results. All expected results were
accomplished on time. Being relatively compact project in terms of size, EPP turned out
to be very `visible'. The project was widely advertised in Serbia, public was broadly
informed about this intervention and the outcomes became clearly visible.

The fact that Serbian institutions (NES and MOLESP) had very limited capacities and
were in many aspects not prepared to deal with these problems made EPP intervention
even more helpful.

Prior to Project launch the Ministry and the National Service certainly did not have
enough experience in dealing with the Donors or Projects in general. In that sense, the
experience gained on this one and other projects will certainly be valuable in the future
and will influence further cooperation on similar projects in the sense of creating the
projects and defining expected results. The model of the Steering Committee set up in the
course of implementation could be a good example of management for other projects as
well.




                                             50

A number of project achievements and outcomes should be seen as the most important.
Among them, the following ones had a learning effect and brought about innovation:
-      Introduction of a new instrument of Workers Transition Center in the selected
       regions, which proved to be helpful in the situations of restructuring and
       privatisation in other countries.
-      Supporting labour redeployment programme by establishment of the database for
       monitoring redundant workers, and conduct of a tracer survey of displaced workers
       ­ interventions which help to provide detailed information about the target group.
-      Strengthening the capacity of National Employment Service NES: services
       improved through the start of new trends in work with the unemployed, improving
       skills of the staff and setting the basis of the system for monitoring effects of the
       applied measures.
-      Testing the whole menu of new (or modernised) ALMPs in pilots (including, job
       fairs, training for active job search, employer contact services, virtual enterprises,
       job clubs, etc.) which significantly changed the image of LLOs, made their
       approach more active and competent.
-      Obvious contribution to the capacity of the Ministry (Employment sector) by
       establishing of the Training and staff development centre. This is the first training
       centre of its kind in any of the Ministries within the Government.
-      Catalysing the development of social dialogue and building local partnerships via
       (i) introduction of a new concept of clusters and (ii) preparation of local economic
       development studies.
-      Bringing new experience in dealing with large-scale donors projects in general. In
       that sense, the experience gained on this project will certainly be valuable in the
       future and will influence further cooperation on similar projects. The model of the
       Steering Committee set up in the course of implementation could be a good
       example of management for other projects as well.

Specific Achievements:

(1)13 WTC were launched and equipped in Serbia. So far 20,692 pre-layoff and post-
layoff workers have been surveyed and participated in various counseling and job search
assistance programs, and 2,122 of them have received training and retraining.
(2) 14 Social plans for training and retraining were financed from Government
contribution (451.546$ in total) for 2.122 redundant workers.
(3) The concept of a Transition Centre incorporated into the Government Social Program
(2005) as one of the means for solving the problem of redundancies.
(4) 56 various training courses were held for 1.105 employees from MOLESP and NES
(all Branch offices) and for 1.316 Social partners' representatives.
(5) A sustainable training system was created. Staff Development and Training Centre
was opened in MOLESP as a part of organization chart of the MOLESP for the training
of its employees. The same space is used for the training of NES staff. The Centre
organized 6 training on its own for 277 employees in 2006.
(6) A contribution to the development of internal communication in MOLESP is
initiation and design of an electronic newsletter by the Staff training and development


                                              51

Centre. The newsletter compiles and provides information on all the sectors in the
Ministry. The newsletter is issued fortnightly and so far 11 issues have been produced.
(7) 28 Manuals (26.362 copies) were designed, printed and distributed in the areas of
labor redeployment programs, Transition centers, new labor market measures, small
business, clusters, human resources.

supported , Virtual enterprises were opened and equipped in 7 NES Branch offices and
Central office in Belgrade.
(9)The concept of cluster was launched. The establishment of agriculture and textile
clusters has been initiated in 4 Municipalities in Serbia.
(10) Local Economic Development Studies were completed for the 8 pilot municipalities.
(11) The basis of system for performance and information monitoring and management
was established in NES.

(13) Procurement of computers, lap tops and other equipment for NES and MOLESP was
made.
(14) All activities from EPP primary planed for 4 pilot sites were implemented in 15 NES
Branch offices and municipalities in Serbia.

C. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

A number of external and situation-based factors contributed to it and influenced EPP
implementation:
-     At the time when the project had to start Serbia was a part of the State Union of
      Serbia and Montenegro. Within this political structure the launch and progress of
      the Employment Promotion Project required approvals at `several levels', including
      approval at the level of the State Union Parliament. Only after the approval by the
      State Union Parliament the decision making process was moved to the level of the
      Republic. These complicated arrangements created delays and contributed to start-
      up difficulties. Also the change of Serbian Government in 2004, changes in
      ministerial teams and management of NES also had an impact on the
      commencement of the Project.
-     Certain procedures required for launching such large-scale project (for example,
      opening the accounts for WB loan and DFID grant; tender procedures required by
      international rules) were rather complicated and bureaucratic. Besides, political
      changes delayed finalization of these procedures lengthy and demanding in
      themselves and postponed actual start of the project till spring 2004 (although
      formal approval of EPP was made already in May 2003).
-     The implementation of such projects was totally new for Serbia. Beneficiaries were
      not familiar with the procedures, requirements, and mechanisms of delivery typical
      for World Bank interventions. This partly explains start up difficulties ­ the
      implementation was almost six months delayed. The time was needed to
      consolidate the efforts; the stakeholders had to understand how such large-scale
      projects work, etc.



                                             52

-      Factors that certainly affected the whole context of NES performance, which is
       characterized by very limited capacities, lack of facilities and funds, enormous
       overload of staff and its high turn over. Those factors by themselves restricted the
       possibility for maneuvering and affected readiness of staff to accept changes
       offered throught the Project.

According to the Evaluation Report of EPP, a number of factors was identified which
contributed to effective and efficient implementation of the project. Among them it is
important to mention: (a) high commitment of Serbian stakeholders, developed
ownership of the project; (b) clear understanding by Serbian stakeholders of the need and
purpose of the intervention; (c) supportive, change oriented and open approach of the
majority of the labour offices; (d) very competent and focused ground work and analysis
carried out by DFID experts at the initial stage of programme design; (e) stability of the
World Bank team that stayed unchanged during the whole project duration; (f)
management       arrangement    with    efficiently   working     Steering   Committee;     (g)
professionalism, enthusiasm and commitment of the majority of selected Consultants; (h)
high financial discipline in the operation of the contract, as well as professionally
conducted negotiations with contractors, contributed to project cost-efficiency. As for the
context, favourable exchange rate conditions should be mentioned which allowed
accumulating the savings and extending the project for additional six months.

D. Sustainability

It is certain that Transition centres established in pilot enterprisee will continue operating.
Expected continuation of privatization and restructuring indicated that there would be a
need for services rendered by Transition centres. It is a fact that Transition centres have
already acquired invaluable experience and that they have people who have knowledge
and experience in running the centres. MOLESP and NES staff have the required skills
for coordination of work and establishment of new Transition centres. This, for sure, are
factors that strengthen the perspective of Transition centres sustainability. On the other
hand, it is important to secure financial support from the budget for continuation of work.

Overall, the project brought about a positive shift in the image that LLOs have in the
regions, NES system became more visible in the local community. As a result of the
training provided by EPP and further practical support and guidance, LLOs staff in pilot
regions became more skilled and competent with a number of active labour market
measures, and the approach became much more structured. However, one should not lose
sight of the fact that the degree of success varies depending on the specific branch office
and that it is primarily influenced by the attitude of employees, their openness and
readiness to take changes on board.

Piloting of a new instrument of Virtual Enterprises mainly targeted at young people with
no or very limited working experience was relevant for Serbian situation characterised by
high unemployment among new entrants, what is considered to be one of the most
serious problems for the labour market.Although there is an intention of NES to continue
this programme as part of their regular activities, there is still a dilemma as to whether


                                               53

this programme should be a part of high school curriculum or remain within NES as
support to the employment of young people without working experience.

The choice of NES to work in line with new procedures and methods introduced from the
Project is clear. Almost all policies piloted on the project were integrated into the work
program for the previous and the following year, like job fairs, active job search training,
job clubs, virtual enterprises, intensive contact with employers and alike. NES assessed
job fairs, active job search training as cheap and easily applicable measures that in 2006
addressed twice the greater number of people than in the previous year.

Staff development and training centre in the Ministry is organized as a group in MOLESP
HR department; it has three employees; it is located in an equipped space comprising two
offices and a training room with 12 laptop computers, which makes it movable all around
whole Serbia; The Centre also has a library and documentation base. Six training courses
have been organised by the Centre. Employees of the training Centre are very qualified
and dedicated to work. Training Centre issues certificates for training program attendants
and they are retained as a part of every staff member's file in HR department.
Sustainability of this Centre has been secured by incorporating its costs (for key
functions, training and user contact activities) in the draft Budget for 2007. Project of the
training Centre for the forthcoming period has been enclosed to the National Investment
Plan, which gives the possibility to access this fund as well.

Useful achievement within the project, as a contribution to the development of internal
communication in MOLESP is electronic newsletter of the Ministry. The newsletter
compiles and provides information on all sectors in the Ministry. The newsletter is issued
forthnightly and 11 issues have been produced so far.

The LED studies have been useful and have significantly contributed to the activation of
local stakeholders and the development of their strategic thinking. In Pancevo, municipal
authorities have decided to invest their own funds in the replication of the studies at the
sub-municipal levels and the process of contracting out the consultant is being finalized.
In Nis and Krusevac it seems that the ideal level of sustainability has been achieved,
since local authorities have not only purchased recommended software, but have also
employed the persons to permanently work on the LED monitoring and updating.

E. Lessons Learned

1. Before the commencement of the Project, MOLESP and the National employment
service were not experienced enough in work with donors and Projects in general. In that
sense, experience gained on this and other projects will certainly be of value for the
future ones and it will make impact on further cooperation with similar projects in terms
of project creation and defining expected results.

2. The Project benefited from a high level of participation on the part of stakeholders.
After quite a difficult inception period during which the beneficiaries had to work on a
better understanding of implementation process and to create committment and the sense



                                             54

of ownership, the involved institutions managed to develop a good level of cooperation,
they have learn to work together and develop a very dedicated attitude.

3. Involvement of the Ministry and National service was extremely important since
without their support the Project would not be able to achieve results. Enterprises selected
for participation in the Project found their interest in participating in it. Their interest was
reflected paricularly in terms of availability of financial means for retraining of workers.

4. As regards organisation of management, one should make use of lessons learnt on the
current project concerning the role of a Steering Committte in supervising and managing
a project, but also in developing a sense of ownership of the project and full committment
to it objectives. Establishment of the Project Steering Committe in July 2005 was for
sure crucial for launching the activities and undertaking important decision making by the
Ministry and National service. Up to that moment information on the Project were
imprecise and certainly insufficient for a real control of Project events.

5. Transition centre has managed to gradually change traditional way of thinking through
its activities (the previous communist approach where workers were oriented only
towards a single enterprise throughout their entire career and relied on it); Transition
centres helped workers accept changes in their working status and develop a more active
attitude to dealing with their situation. Through activities of a Transition centre,
enterprises, in most cases, established better connections with employment offices, health
insurance funds, pension funds and other institutions in local community. When
establishing Transition centres lessons learnt from the Project should definitely be used in
terms of need for: providing detailed information on its role, function and objectives so
that workers, trade unions enterprise management and wider public could understand and
accept it; ensure participation of all stakeholders in establishemnt and work of TC;
choose optimum time for start in terms of expected redundancies; types of services that a
Transition centre should deliver and alike.

6. The efficiency and overall outcome of training initiatives for NES staff (capacity
building) can be increased by avoiding overlapping of trainings provided by different
donors and ensuring closer coordination with other donors and projects providing similar
services.

7. The National Employment Service has very few resources and limited capacity for
financing or providing active labor market programs to help the unemployed get back to
the labor market. In this situation of very limited resources and capacities it would be
desirable to clearly define priorities that should be focused on, the level of employability
of the clients should be assessed and specific groups selected as targets of active
measures. The choice should be made in favor of such instruments of active labor market
policies which will be able to address a large number of the unemployed and at the same
time could be run with relatively low costs.

8. Experience with project management indicates the need for uniform program for
administering finance in line with the World bank reporting needs. The existing program



                                              55

was not user friendly due to inexperince at the beginning of the Project. Mismatch
between software currency and credit currency frequently caused unnecessary delays and
affected reporting efficiency. Also, the program structure did not make allow proper
reports   and tables in line with the World bank and audit requirements. All of this
required extra activities on the part of financial officer and manager for purpose of
checking data.

9. The Project was remarkably extensive and complex treating an important and sensitive
area for Serbia. The World bank and the credit beneficiary cooperated closely and were
dedicated in all the project stages with a view to its complete implementation and
achievement of the set objectives.

10. The decision of the Bank to approve the extension of project completion deadline for
further 6 months, on the grounds of the request from the credit beneficiaries, was crucial
for achieving results.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

The EPP, which by its nature is Learning and Investment Loan was designed by DFID
and the World Bank to support the development of relevant labor market and
employment policies in Serbia. The implementation of the EPP was supported by WB
loan and DFID grant:

The World Bank developed excellent collaboration with DFID. Despite the initial
difficulties and delays at project start up/inception the World Bank expert team
responsible for the Project rendered an exceptional and significant support to the Ministry
and Project Implementation Unit. High commitment and stability of the team during the
whole project duration, as well as their excellent cooperation with DFID and other donors,
made a significant impact on the successful completion of planned activities.

The creation of the Steering Committee composed of representatives of WB, DFID,
MOLESP and NES was positive step for the development of ownership and further
project implementation. Even though its role was never precisely defined, the Steering
Committee followed all of the Project's activities, made key decisions, influenced the
activity planning and once more confirmed the importance of co financiers' partnership
and collaboration for the successful project implementation.

It should be highlighted that the project was well organized and coordinated and overall,
had a number of positive results.
