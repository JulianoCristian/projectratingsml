testing new approaches, and innovative labor\n            redeployment programs, and employment services in selected\n            areas. Component 1 involves the Design of Labor Redeployment\n            Activities, in order to reintegrate displaced workers into\n            the labor market, and mitigate the social costs of\n            enterprise restructuring, through the development of new\n            policies, institutional arrangements, and labor redeployment\n            programs, including the design, and implementation of\n            enterprise social plans, through the provision of training,\n            services and goods. In particular, the component will\n            provide assistance to persons displaced as a result of\n            restructuring, or privatization of enterprises through labor\n            redeployment services. The component will also finance\n            technical assistance to help enterprises in pilot areas\n            prepare social plans. Component 2, Piloting reforms in\n            Public Employment Services, will design, pilot, and evaluate\n            cost effective public employment services, to assist the\n            unemployed re-enter the labor market, through improved\n            employment services, search assistance programs, and small\n            business advisory services. Component 3, Labor market\n            information, and evaluation - social impact of restructuring\n            and effects of Active Labor Market Programs, will develop a\n            comprehensive system of labor market information to assess\n            the effects of labor market programs, through the provision\n            of training, services and goods. This involves building\n            local capacity to generate, analyze, and use the information\n            for policy formulation, and program design. The fourth\n            component will provide assistance to the Ministry of Labor\n            and Employment (MOLE) in Project management, through the\n            provision of services, including the audit of accounts, and\n            financial statements, as well as assistance to both the\n            MOLE, and Labor Market Bureau during project implementation,\n            through the provision of training, services and goods."}, "docdt": "2003-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
