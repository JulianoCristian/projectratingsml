LIL 
Justification 
1. 
What 
is 
to 
be 
learned (why 
the 
piloting)? 
The 
objective 
of 
the 
Employment Promotion Project 
(EPP) 
for 
Serbia 
and 
Montenegro 
(sub-lent 
to 
the 
Republic 
of 
Serbia) 
will 
be 
to 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
of 
labor 
programs 
by 
piloting 
and 
testing 
new 
approaches 
and 
innovative 
labor redeployment programs 
and 
employment 
services 
for 
the 
unemployed 
in 
selected 
areas 
with 
a 
view 
to 
employment 
promotion 
and 
increased 
cost-effectiveness 
of 
such programs. 
The 
hypothesis 
to 
be 
tested 
is 
that 
carefully 
designed 
labor 
redeployment programs 
(LRPs) 
and active 
labor 
market programs 
(ALMPs) 
can 
be 
a 
cost 
effective 
tool for 
reintegrating displaced workers  and 
other 
job 
seekers 
into 
the 
labor 
market 
and mitigating 
the social 
costs 
of 
enterprise 
restructuring. 
The 
main 
mechanism 
selected 
to 
test 
this 
hypothesis 
will 
be 
to 
build 
the  capacity 
in 
relevant 
agencies, 
primarily 
in 
the 
Republic 
of 
Serbia’s 
Ministry 
of 
Labor 
and 
Employment 
(MOLE) 
and 
Labor Market 
Bureau 
(LMB), 
and 
to 
develop  the 
skills, 
policy 
instruments 
and 
procedures 
necessary 
to 
facilitate 
enterprise 
restructuring  and 
mitigate 
the  social 
costs 
involved. 
In 
particular, 
the 
project 
will 
seek 
to 
introduce 
innovative labor 
redeployment programs 
and 
employment 
services 
to 
the 
public 
and 
private 
employment 
agencies, 
to 
enhance 
their capability 
to 
deal 
with 
and respond 
to 
labor 
market 
challenges 
accompanying  economic  reforms 
in 
the  country, 
reduce  the 
short-term 
negative 
impact 
of 
labor 
restructuring 
on 
affected 
workers 
and 
communities, 
and 
support 
efforts 
to monitor 
and 
evaluate the 
employment and 
other 
social impacts 
of 
different 
pilot 
interventions. 
This 
is 
the 
second 
stage 
of 
Bank 
interventions 
in 
Serbia 
on 
labor 
issues. 
The 
first 
stage 
involved 
helping 
to 
revise the 
legal 
framework. 
In 
particular,  the 
approval 
of 
a 
new 
Labor 
Law 
in 
December 
2001 
is 
assisting 
removal 
of 
structural impediments 
to 
the containment 
of 
costs 
in 
the enterprise 
sector, 
removing 
key  legal 
bottlenecks 
to 
the 
reduction 
of 
overstaffing 
in 
enterprises 
and budgetary  institutions, 
and 
providing 
an 
impetus 
to 
growth 
in 
employment. 
This 
will 
be 
assisted 
with 
another 
legislative 
reform 
which 
will 
bring 
the 
new 
Serbian 
Law on 
Employment and 
Insurance 
in 
Case 
of 
Unemployment 
into 
line 
with 
requirements 
of 
a 
market 
economy, 
and 
will 
harmonize 
appropriate 
employment protection 
with 
European 
Union 
(EU) 
and 
International 
Labor 
Organization 
(LO) 
regulations. 
The 
new 
law, aimed 
at 
active 
labor 
market 
programs, 
is 
encouraging 
job 
creation 
by 
the 
investment 
in 
prospective 
labor 
market 
programs, 
development 
of 
entrepreneurship 
and 
small 
and 
medium 
enterprises 
(SMEs) 
and 
creating 
programs 
of 
re-employment, 
vocational 
training 
and 
self-employment. 
Under 
the 
new 
law 
the 
policy 
will 
move 
from 
passive 
to 
active 
measures 
in 
order 
to 
stimulate 
unemployment 
beneficiaries 
to 
become active 
job 
seekers. 
The 
second 
stage, 
supported 
under the proposed 
project, 
will 
build 
on 
that 
framework 
and 
focuses 
on 
improving inefficient 
programs. 
The labor 
market 
policy reform 
program 
is 
needed 
as 
Serbia 
enters 
an 
intensive 
period 
of 
privatization 
and  enterprise 
restructuring, 
both 
in 
terms 
of 
controlling 
fiscal  impact 
and 
in 
terms 
of 
promoting 
interventions 
which 
are 
more effective 
in 
facilitating 
retum 
to 
work 
for 
those 
laid 
off. 
In 
particular, 
priority 
reforms 
supported under 
the 
SOSAC 
agenda, 
include 
also 
reform 
of 
the 
Law 
on 
Employment 
and 
Insurance 
in 
Case 
of 
Unemployment, 
and 
the Social 
Program. 
This 
requires also 
capacity 
strengthening 
in 
the 
LMB 
which 
will 
be 
done 
under the 
EPP 
which 
is 
assisting 
in 
the 
design, 
piloting 
and 
evaluating 
of 
new 
and more 
cost 
effective labor market intervention 
and 
innovative 
active programs. 
A 
third 
stage 
country ‘roll-out’  and institutional 
strengthening 
might 
be 
considered depending 
on 
project 
results 
and 
outcomes. 
Serbia 
is 
presently 
dealing 
with 
the 
severe 
economic 
consequences 
of 
more 
than 
a 
decade 
of 
economic 
mismanagement, 
exacerbated 
by 
regional 
conflicts and 
sanctions. 
GDP 
stands 
at 
below 
one-half 
of 
its 
1989 
level. 
Economic 
reform 
since 
the 
end 
of 
2000 
has 
marked 
a 
change 
in 
policy 
that 
has 
already 
had 
a 
-2- 
Page  7
number 
of 
positive 
effects. 
Economic 
performance 
has 
been 
solid. 
Real 
GDP 
growth 
rebounded 
from 
the 
highly 
negative 
rates 
of 
1999 
(impact 
of 
the 
Kosovo 
conflict) 
to 
positive 
rates 
of 
about 
5-6 
YO 
in 
2000 
and 
2001. 
For 
2002, 
preliminary 
estimates 
put 
growth 
at about 
4 
percent. 
The 
new 
government 
in 
Serbia 
adopted 
an 
ambitious 
program 
of 
economic  reform, 
committing 
itself to 
reversing  the 
trends 
of 
the 
previous 
decade 
and integrating the economy 
with 
the European 
Union. 
In 
less 
than 
two 
years 
trade 
and 
prices have 
been 
liberalized; 
new 
fiscal 
and monetary 
policies 
have substantially reduced 
inflationary 
pressure 
and 
stabilized 
the 
exchange 
rate. 
Inflation 
in 
Serbia 
fell 
from 
115% 
in 
2000 
to 
39% 
in 
2001. 
For 
2002, 
it 
is 
estimated 
at 
14.2%, 
well 
below 
the 
initially 
projected 
20%. 
Relations 
with 
international 
creditors 
have 
been 
largely 
normalized. 
Comprehensive 
privatization legislation marked 
a 
break 
with 
dubious 
schemes 
of 
the 
past 
in 
welcoming 
foreign 
investment 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
process. 
The 
unemployment rate 
in 
Serbia, 
at 
12.2 
percent, 
is 
around 
average 
by 
transition 
economies 
standards. 
Unlike 
most transition 
economies, 
the 
majority 
of 
unemployed 
(56 
percent) 
are 
persons 
without 
previous 
labor market 
experience 
(mainly 
youth), 
rather 
than workers 
who 
lost 
their 
job. 
Only 
around 
7 
percent 
of 
the 
unemployed 
receive unemployment benefits 
during 
their 
spell 
of 
unemployment. 
Currently 
around 75 
percent 
of 
the 
unemployed 
are 
estimated 
to 
be 
seeking 
work 
for 
longer 
than 
one 
year, 
a 
very 
high 
proportion 
compared 
with 
other 
transition 
economies. 
There 
is 
a 
large 
discrepancy 
between 
the 
labor 
force 
survey 
(LFS) 
and  registration 
data 
on 
unemployment. 
According 
to 
administrative 
records 
the 
number 
of 
registered 
unemployed 
is 
about 
twice 
as 
high 
(892,000 
in 
October 
2002) 
as 
according 
to 
the 
LFS. 
However, 
the 
LFS 
data 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
approximate 
to 
reality 
for 
the 
usual 
reasons 
of 
various incentives 
to 
register 
- 
mainly 
the 
availability of 
pension and health 
insurance. 
As 
a 
result, 
a 
large 
proportion 
of 
persons 
registered 
as 
unemployed 
are 
not 
genuinely 
unemployed, 
i.e. 
they either 
have 
a 
job 
in 
the 
informal 
sector, 
or 
are 
not 
actively 
looking 
and 
available 
for 
work. 
On 
the other 
hand, 
the 
employers 
must 
legally 
notify 
vacancies, 
and 
the number 
of 
registered 
by 
the 
LMB 
vacancies 
is 
quite 
significant. 
In 
2001, 
542,200 
vacancies 
were 
registered, 
and 
during 
the 
first 
10 
months 
of 
2002 
- 
393,900  vacancies.  These are 
mostly 
in 
companies 
which 
have 
very 
bad working 
conditions 
and 
low 
salaries. 
However, 
with 
respect 
to 
short 
term 
contracts,  each 
time 
there 
is 
an 
extension 
it 
is 
notified 
as 
a 
new 
vacancy, 
leading 
to 
serious 
double 
counting 
of 
vacancies 
and 
job 
placements. 
The 
Government 
of 
Serbia 
is 
increasingly 
concerned about 
issues 
of 
mass 
unemployment 
(predominantly 
long 
term 
unemployment), 
large 
informal 
labor 
markets  and 
low 
efficiency 
of 
employment 
services. 
Although 
the 
informal 
sector 
labor market 
mitigates the unemployment and 
poverty 
problem, 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
long term 
economic  development 
it 
is 
important 
that 
unemployment 
is 
absorbed 
by 
the 
growing 
formal 
sector, 
rather than 
by 
the 
informal 
sector. 
In 
recent 
years, 
the 
Republic 
of 
Serbia has 
embarked 
on 
a 
significant 
enterprise 
restructuring 
reform 
and 
privatization 
program. 
It 
is 
expected  that 
in 
the  short 
term 
the 
reforms 
will 
entail 
major 
labor 
displacement. 
The 
restructuring 
will 
give 
rise 
to 
large 
inflows 
into 
unemployment, 
while 
due 
to 
the 
underdeveloped 
new 
private 
sector, 
outflows 
from 
unemployment 
will 
be, 
in 
the 
short- 
to 
medium-term, 
limited. 
However, 
public 
employment 
services 
and 
other 
agencies  are 
not 
equipped 
to 
mitigate 
the 
impact 
of 
group 
redundancies 
in 
addition 
to 
dealing 
with 
the unemployed 
in 
general. 
Currently, 
owing to 
budget constraints 
and 
high 
spending 
on 
unemployment benefits 
and 
related 
cash 
payments 
(pensions 
and 
health 
insurance), 
expenditures 
on 
ALMPs 
are 
very 
limited 
in 
Serbia. 
The 
programs 
are 
broadly 
targeted, 
and 
not 
necessarily 
at disadvantaged 
groups 
(e.g., 
groups 
running 
a 
high 
risk 
of 
long-term 
unemployment). 
Most 
of 
the 
ALMPs 
are 
being 
introduced 
in 
an 
ad 
hoc 
fashion 
as 
a 
quick 
response 
to 
perceived 
problems. 
In 
addition,  the programs 
are 
likely 
to 
carry 
a 
heavy deadweight 
loss, 
and 
thus 
their net impact and 
cost-effectiveness 
appears 
to 
be 
low. 
Job 
search 
assistance, 
which 
based 
on 
international 
experience 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
cost-effective active 
labor 
market 
interventions, 
is 
underdeveloped 
in 
Serbia.

All 
programs 
are 
administered 
and 
financed 
by 
the 
LMB 
and 
its 
local 
branches. 
The 
LMB 
has 
currently 
1,693 
employees 
(1,438 
permanent 
employees). 
One employment advisor 
on 
average 
handles 
a 
roster 
of 
more than 
2000 
unemployed 
persons 
making 
it 
one 
of 
the 
heaviest 
work 
loads 
of 
a 
public 
employment 
service 
anywhere 
in 
the 
region. 
In 
the 
EU 
client 
caseloads 
can 
be 
approximately 
150400. 
The 
Advisers 
in 
Serbia spend 
less 
than 
15 
minutes 
with 
each 
new 
registered client. 
These 
figures 
are 
a 
considerable 
inhibiting 
factor 
to 
the 
development 
of 
successful 
ALMPs. 
The 
LMB 
is 
constrained 
in 
its 
ability 
to 
hire 
new 
staff. 
The 
EPP 
would 
allow 
the 
LMB 
to 
learn 
new 
approaches 
which 
should facilitate 
the 
provision 
of 
cost-effective 
ALMPs. 
Regarding 
labor 
redeployment 
programs, 
currently most 
redundant 
workers 
(90-95 
percent) 
in 
enterprises 
undergoing  privatization  and 
restructuring 
opt 
for 
a  generous 
lump 
sum 
monetary 
compensation 
amounting 
to 
10 
average 
wages 
in 
the  economy 
of 
the 
Republic 
or 
YUD 
6,000 
for 
each  year 
of 
employment, 
since 
alternatives 
for 
participation 
in 
active 
labor programs 
are 
limited. 
For 
example,  a 
redundant employee can also 
opt 
for 
additional 
training, 
which 
lasts 
for 
3 
months. 
In 
reality 
training 
is 
limited to 
what 
the 
LMB 
can 
currently 
provide, 
i.e., 
basic, 
specialist 
or 
employer related training 
much 
of 
which 
is for 
less 
than 
3 
months 
in 
duration. 
Moreover, 
an 
experience 
from 
Romania, 
Russia 
and other 
countries 
indicates 
that 
severance 
as 
seed 
capital 
failed 
to 
result 
in 
an 
appreciable 
level 
of 
development 
activity 
(new 
businesses 
were 
not 
created). 
The 
Social 
Program 
- 
with 
the 
current budget 
of 
5 
billion 
YUD 
annually 
- 
has 
no 
system 
for 
tracking 
participants. 
The 
EPP 
would 
encourage dismissed 
workers 
towards programs 
which 
are 
likely 
to be 
more 
effective 
for 
their 
age 
and 
skill 
profile. 
The 
development objective 
of 
this 
project 
is 
to 
improve 
the 
cost-effectiveness 
and 
efficiency 
of 
labor 
programs 
in 
the Republic 
of 
Serbia 
by: 
1. 
development 
and  implementation 
of 
redeployment 
measures 
targeting 
redundant  workers 
in 
enterprises 
undergoing 
deep 
restructuring 
or 
privatization 
thus 
facilitating 
the 
rapid 
return 
of 
workers 
to 
productive 
employment. 
2. 
introduction 
of 
more 
cost-effective 
labor  market 
interventions 
and 
innovative 
employment 
services 
for 
the 
unemployed 
to 
assist 
them 
in 
rapidly 
reentering the 
labor 
market. 
3. 
development 
of 
institutional 
capacity 
to 
collect and 
analyze 
labor 
market 
data 
in 
order 
to 
improve 
the effectiveness 
of 
labor 
market 
policies 
and 
programs. 
Activities 
supported 
by 
the 
EPP 
would be 
improved 
employment 
services 
and 
new 
programs 
for 
the 
country, 
which would 
be 
tested 
in 
4 
pilot 
areas 
(municipalities), 
evaluated 
and then 
expected 
to be 
implemented more broadly. Accordingly,  the 
EPP, 
as 
a 
learning 
process, 
will 
support 
new 
policies 
and 
institutional 
arrangements 
for 
a 
LW, 
by 
building 
capacity 
to 
implement 
a 
LRP 
targeted  at 
workers 
displaced 
by 
privatization, 
and 
will 
enhance 
ALMPs 
through 
piloting 
and 
evaluating 
new 
and 
more 
cost-effective  interventions, 
including 
job/social 
counseling, 
job 
searcwjob 
club 
programs,  enhanced 
labor 
exchange, 
and placement 
services, 
in 
order 
to 
improve 
both 
their impact 
and 
cost-effectiveness. 
Additionally 
Economic Development 
Planning 
Studies 
and 
Small 
Business 
Advisory 
Services 
will 
help 
to 
address issues 
related 
to 
the 
demand 
for 
labor. 
Program 
evaluation  anticipated 
in 
the 
project 
will 
play 
a 
critical 
role 
in 
informing 
the 
allocation 
of 
resources 
to, 
and expansion 
of, 
programs 
with 
the 
largest 
impact. 
In 
particular, the 
project 
is 
intended 
to 
develop 
performance 
information 
and 
management 
system (PIMS) 
to 
support cost-effective 
delivery 
of 
labor market 
programs. 
The 
efficacy 
of 
the labor 
redeployment 
program 
is 
to be 
learned 
through 
the 
monitoring 
of 
changes 
in 
the labor 
market 
status 
of 
displaced 
workers. 
The 
extent 
to 
which 
different 
programs 
tested 
under 
the 
EPP 
project 
have 
contributed 
to 
improving 
job 
prospects 
of 
the 
displaced 
workers 
and 
the 
unemployed 
will 
be 
tested 
through qualitative 
assessment 
of 
ALMP 
supported 
by 
EPP 
in 
pilot 
areas. 
The project 
will 
improve 
operational 
efficiency 
and the 
provision 
of 
improved information

2. 
How 
are 
the 
results going 
to 
be 
used 
(vis a vis 
CAS 
objectives 
and 
any 
follow-on 
operation)? 
Document 
number: 
A 
full 
Country 
Assistance Strategy 
(CAS) covering 
FY04-06 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
presented 
to 
the 
Board 
in 
the 
fall 
of 
2003. 
In 
May 
2001 
a 
Transitional 
Support Strategy 
(TSS) 
was endorsed 
by 
the 
IBRD 
and 
IDA 
Boards 
of 
Directors 
which 
was 
updated 
in 
August 
2002. 
The 
Transitional 
Support Strategy 
Update 
(TSS) 
for 
the 
Federal 
Republic 
of 
Yugoslavia 
(now 
Serbia 
and Montenegro) 
emphasizes 
the 
need 
for 
the 
Republic 
of 
Serbia 
to 
build 
capacity 
in 
the 
public 
sector 
to 
promote  more 
cost 
effective  labor 
redeployment 
programs, 
pilot 
innovative 
services 
for 
the unemployed, 
and 
promote 
a 
balance 
between 
social 
mitigation,  fiscal 
sustainability  and 
facilitating 
re-entry 
to 
the 
labor 
market, 
using 
the 
EPP 
as 
a 
piloting 
instrument. 
The 
EPP 
would 
also support 
efforts 
to monitor 
and 
evaluate 
the 
employment 
and 
other social impacts 
of 
different 
interventions. 
Date 
of 
latest 
CAS 
discussion: 
The 
EPP 
will 
support 
the 
overall 
Bank 
program 
in 
the 
country aimed 
to 
sustain 
economic 
reforms, 
privatization, 
and 
enterprise 
restructuring. 
In 
particular, 
the 
activities 
supported 
under 
the 
Serbia 
Structural 
Adjustment 
Credit (SAC 
I), 
were 
designed, 
among other 
issues, 
to 
initiate 
reforms 
in 
labor 
markets. 
The 
EPP was also 
thematically 
linked 
to 
the 
first 
Serbia 
Private 
and 
Financial 
Sector 
Structural 
Adjustment Credit 
(PFSAC 
I) 
which 
focuses 
on 
privatizing 
and 
restructuring socially owned 
enterprises, 
and 
to 
the 
recently 
negotiated 
PFSAC 
II. 
In 
addition, 
this 
LIC 
complements 
the 
recently 
approved Social 
Sector 
Adjustment 
Credit 
(SOSAC) 
for 
Serbia that supports 
reforms 
in 
active and 
passive 
programs 
for 
the 
unemployed. 
3. 
Other 
countries 
or 
situations 
where 
similar efforts have 
shown promise. 
This 
is 
the 
first 
labor 
Learning 
and 
Innovation 
Loan 
project 
in 
ECA 
region. However, 
in 
recent 
years 
and 
with 
the 
Bank 
support, 
similar 
approaches 
in 
reforming 
active 
labor 
market 
programs  have 
been 
undertaken 
in 
Poland 
(Employment 
Promotion 
and 
Services Project); 
Russia (Employment 
Service and 
Social 
Protection 
Project); 
Turkey 
(Employment 
and 
Training 
Project, and 
Privatization 
Social 
Support 
Project); 
Albania 
(Labor 
Market 
Development 
Project), 
and 
in 
several 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
with 
respect 
to 
social 
mitigation 
of 
the 
impact 
of 
enterprise 
restructuring 
and 
privatization, 
including 
in 
Russia, 
Hungary, 
Romania, Macedonia, 
Croatia 
and Poland. 
The 
ALMPs, 
aiming 
at 
expediting 
the 
redeployment 
of 
labor, 
thereby 
reducing 
the 
duration 
of 
frictional 
and 
structural 
unemployment,  increasing 
productivity, 
and 
reducing 
expenditures 
on 
income 
support 
programs, 
are 
common 
in 
most 
transition 
countries. 
However, evaluation 
of 
the 
net 
impact 
of 
ALMPs 
in 
some 
of 
the 
transition 
countries,  such 
as 
Hungary,  the 
Czech 
Republic 
and 
Poland,  showed 
mixed 
results. 
While 
some 
programs 
can 
help most 
groups 
of 
the unemployed, 
other programs, 
depending 
on 
the 
labor 
market situations 
in 
particular 
countries, 
program 
design 
or 
groups 
of 
the 
unemployed, 
showed 
neutral 
or 
even 
negative 
outcomes 
in 
terms 
of 
placement 
rates, 
probability 
of 
employment 
and 
career 
development 
or 
enhancement 
of 
wages. 
These 
mixed 
results 
call 
for 
careful 
testing 
of 
different 
approaches 
and 
programs 
on 
a 
pilot 
basis 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
improving 
their 
design 
and 
cost-effectiveness. 
A 
variety 
of 
services 
are 
needed 
to 
address 
three 
conditions commonly 
experienced 
by 
displaced workers 
who 
are 
trying 
to 
re-enter 
the 
labor 
market. 
In 
case 
of 
frictional 
unemployment, displaced workers 
have 
marketable 
skills 
for 
which 
there 
is 
a 
demand, 
but 
they 
need 
intensive 
job 
placement 
assistance. 
These 
services can have 
a 
substantial 
positive 
impact 
on 
re-employment  and 
have 
a 
low 
unit 
costs. 
As 
for 
structural 
unemployment, 
displaced 
workers 
often lack 
skills, 
or 
their 
skills 
are 
not 
in 
demand, 
and 
need 
some 
re-skilling 
to 
compete  and  re-enter 
the 
labor 
market. 
Different 
types 
of 
retraining, 
including 
on-the-job 
and/or 
institutional training 
is 
needed 
in 
these 
circumstances 
that 
can 
help 
re-employment 
at 
a 
-5- 
Page  10
moderate 
unit 
cost 
per 
worker. 
Among 
the 
donor  supported 
programs 
in 
Serbia, 
issues 
related 
to 
structural unemployment 
will 
be 
addressed 
by 
the 
European 
Agency 
for 
Reconstruction and 
the 
European 
Training 
Foundation 
in 
their 
programs. 
Lack 
of 
demand 
for 
labor 
is 
a 
particular 
problem 
in 
areas 
of 
high 
unemployment and 
in 
mono-enterprise 
communities 
where 
many workers 
are 
laid 
off. 
Programs 
include 
small 
business 
consulting 
assistance, 
business 
incubators, and 
micro-loans. 
These 
programs tend 
to 
be 
more 
expensive 
than 
other 
services, 
attract a 
limited 
number 
of 
participants, 
but 
can 
be 
quite 
effective. 
Developing 
effective 
ALMPs 
is 
essentially  a 
learning 
process, 
and 
the 
EPP 
is 
specifically 
meant 
to 
facilitate 
and 
optimize 
it. 
B. 
Structure 
of 
the 
Pilot 
1. 
How 
will 
learning 
take 
place? 
The learning 
will 
take 
place through active 
participation 
and 
engagement 
of 
relevant 
MOLE 
and 
LMB 
staff 
in 
designing, 
implementation 
and 
evaluation 
of 
the 
piloted 
innovative  labor 
market 
programs. 
Relevant 
staff 
of 
government 
agencies 
will 
be 
trained 
to 
design 
social 
plans  (labor  redeployment 
programs) 
for 
enterprises 
undergoing 
privatization 
and 
restructuring, 
and implement 
them. 
Also 
program 
evaluations 
on 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
active 
labor 
market 
policies 
will 
be 
conducted 
to 
determine 
the 
impact 
of 
various 
piloted 
ALMPs 
programs. 
In 
particular, 
the 
performance 
information 
and 
management system 
will 
be 
developed 
to monitor 
labor market 
trends 
and 
on 
the 
effects 
of 
labor 
market 
programs. 
A 
tracer 
survey 
of 
displaced workers 
will 
be conducted 
to 
monitor 
their labor market 
status 
and 
the 
use 
of 
labor 
redeployment 
services. 
This 
allows 
to 
learn 
about 
the 
efficacy 
of 
the 
labor 
redeployment program, and 
to 
improve 
the 
Social 
Program’s  design 
and 
effectiveness. 
Qualitative 
assessment 
of 
ALMPs 
in 
pilot 
area 
will 
be 
performed, 
including client 
satisfaction. 
In 
particular, 
relative 
performance 
of 
various programs 
will 
be 
assessed, 
including pre-layoff 
services, 
job 
counseling, 
job 
clubs,  business 
incubators 
tested 
under 
EPP, 
as 
well 
as 
program 
effects depending 
on 
local 
labor 
market conditions. 
Finally, 
the 
MOLE 
and 
LMB 
staff 
will 
be 
trained 
on 
the 
principles 
and methods 
of 
the 
evaluation 
of 
ALMPs. 
The 
pilot 
will 
be 
deemed ready 
for 
larger 
scale 
implementation 
if 
relevant 
cadres 
are 
well 
trained, 
operating guidelines 
and manuals prepared 
and 
the 
positive 
response 
of 
participants 
to 
selected 
programs 
of 
pilot 
activities 
will 
be 
documented 
through 
various 
surveys 
and 
assessments. 
2. 
Outcome-level 
test 
to 
be 
conducted 
The 
EPP 
will 
introduce  relevant 
labor 
redeployment  programs 
in 
pilot 
enterprises, 
and 
will 
pilot 
improved 
and a 
new 
set 
of 
active 
labor 
market 
programs, 
including 
job 
search 
skill 
training 
programs, 
job 
clubs,  special 
employment programs 
for 
vulnerable 
groups  (youth,  disabled, 
and 
minorities); 
job 
and 
vacancy fairs; 
employer 
contact 
services; 
small 
business 
advisory 
services; business 
incubator 
services; 
virtual 
enterprises (or 
simulation 
models 
of 
a 
business 
enterprise), 
and 
local 
economic 
development 
planning 
studies. 
Associated 
participatory 
techniques 
through 
the 
district 
labor market offices 
is 
expected 
to 
result 
in 
adoption 
of 
the 
programs 
by 
a 
significant 
number 
of 
enterprises 
undergoing 
privatization 
and 
restructuring, 
and 
local 
labor 
bureaus 
in 
subsequent 
years based 
on 
the 
successful experiences 
of 
the 
early 
adopters. 
The 
menu 
of 
piloted 
LRPIALMPs 
will 
be 
tested 
out 
under 
the 
various economic and 
social 
situations 
and 
with 
the 
participation 
of 
local 
authorities and 
other 
key 
stakeholders. 
The 
pilot 
areas 
will 
be 
chosen 
in 
regions 
with 
high 
unemployment 
rates 
and 
mass 
redundancies 
resulting 
from 
enterprise restructuring, 
privatization or 
closure. 
In 
particular, 
the 
pilot 
areas 
that 
have been chosen 
for 
the 
project 
include 
the 
following 
municipalities. 
Pilot 
1: 
Pancevo 
in 
Vojvodina: 
A 
municipality 
with 
high 
development 
potential 
and 
future 
emplovment 
possibilities.

Major 
companies: 
Two 
big 
companies 
will 
currently 
be 
privatized 
through 
restructuring: 
HIP AZOTARA 
- 
chemical 
industry 
(1,700 
employees); 
and 
HIP 
PETROHEMIJA 
- 
chemical industry 
(3,100 
employees) 
(autonomous 
pre-privatization restructuring 
activities). 
Currently 
for 
both 
of 
these 
companies 
the 
total 
number 
of 
surplus 
employees 
is 
not 
known. 
Pilot 
2:

Major 
companies: 
Two 
big 
companies 
will 
be 
privatized 
in 
Kralijevo 
through 
restructuring: 
MAGNOHROM 
- 
fire

(5,000 
employees 
of 
which 
1,800 are 
surplus). 
This 
company 
is 
a

with 
divisible 
technology 
and 
heterogeneous products. 
FAJ3RKA

Kralijevo 
is 
also 
one 
of 
the 
areas 
of 
highest concentration 
of 
intemally 
displaced 
persons 
(IDPs) 
and 
refugees 
in 
the 
country. 
It 
has 
been 
estimated  that  perhaps 
forty 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
of 
the 
municipality 
is 
IDPs 
and 
refugees.

involving 
key 
players 
in 
the

area 
will 
be 
established 
under 
the 
auspices 
of 
the 
MOLE, 
who 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
overall 
project 
implementation. 
The 
precise 
composition 
and 
size 
of 
local 
partnerships 
for 
the 
project 
should be 
determined 
by 
local 
needs 
but 
for 
purposes 
of 
EPP 
implementation 
key 
stakeholders 
should 
consist 
of 
local 
self-govemment, 
enterprises 
undergoing 
restructuring, 
local 
labor 
market 
bureau, 
SME 
agencies, 
and other 
relevant 
civil 
society.

Steps 
involved 
in 
conducting 
the 
pilot 
The 
project 
would 
provide 
technical 
assistance, 
training,  materials  and equipment  that 
would 
allow 
piloting 
a 
newhevised 
menu 
of 
active 
labor 
market programs 
(ALMPs) 
and 
LRP 
of 
the 
following: 
e 
developing 
an 
institutional 
framework 
for  piloted 
LRP 
and 
ALMPs, 
including 
operating

Triggers 
for 
a 
follow-on 
operation 
The introduction 
of 
new 
employment 
services 
and 
associated 
participatory 
techniques 
in 
a 
selected range 
of 
municipal 
employment  bureaus 
is 
expected 
to 
lead 
to 
approaches 
and 
lessons 
that  can 
be 
applied 
across 
the 
country. 
In 
the 
CAS 
discussions 
between 
the 
Bank 
and 
the 
Government 
currently 
ongoing, 
innovations 
in 
the 
EPP 
could potentially 
be 
applied 
in 
another operation. 
Key 
trigger points may 
include, 
but 
would 
not 
be 
limited 
to: 
An 
institutional  framework 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
all 
the  components 
nationwide 
has 
been 
established; 
different 
administrative 
structures 
for 
the 
LRP 
have 
been 
tested 
and 
assessed 
using 
approaches 
based 
on 
learning-by-doing 
and 
taking 
into 
account the pace 
of 
enterprise 
restructuring 
and 
local 
conditions; 
administrative support 
materials, 
instruments 
and detailed 
procedures have been 
prepared. 
These 
will 
include detailed implementation 
plans 
for 
all 
products and 
procedures 
for local 
employment 
offices 
(manuals, 
guidelines, 
etc.), 
and  specifications 
of

instruments 
to 
determine 
the 
demand 
for 
redeployment 
services 
by 
redundant  workers 
and 
for 
particular 
ALMP 
services 
have 
been 
prepared 
which 
will 
provide 
a 
budgeting 
base. 
Capacity 
of 
the 
MOLE, 
the 
LMB 
and 
local

services 
to 
generate, 
analyze 
and 
use 
the 
information 
for policy 
formulation 
and 
program 
design, 
and 
to 
help 
agencies 
responsible 
for 
labor 
market 
policy 
make 
informed 
decisions 
has 
been 
enhanced. 
In 
particular, 
the  performance 
information 
and management 
system 
(PIMS) 
to 
monitor 
labor 
market 
trends 
and programs 
is 
in 
place. 
A 
learning network 
is 
in 
place 
to 
improve efficiency 
and 
incorporate 
an 
expansion 
of 
the 
labor 
exchange 
function 
and 
proactive 
employment, 
including “Train

have 
been completed 
followed 
by 
investment 
in 
those 
measures 
that 
produced 
the 
best 
results. 
Positive 
feedback 
from 
key 
stakeholders, 
including 
participants 
of 
improved 
labor 
programs, 
local 
authorities, and 
social partners 
will 
provide 
important 
input 
for 
future 
policy 
development.

Components 
and 
Implementation Arrangements 
1. 
LIL 
Components 
Component 
1 
involves 
the 
“Design 
of 
Labor 
Redeployment Activities”. 
This 
component  aims 
to 
reintegrate 
displaced workers 
and 
other 
job 
seekers 
into 
the 
labor 
market 
and 
mitigate 
the 
social 
costs 
of 
enterprise 
restructuring through 
the 
development and 
testing 
of 
new 
policies, 
institutional 
arrangements 
and 
labor 
redeployment 
programs, 
including 
the 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
enterprise 
social 
plans, 
through  the 
provision 
of 
training, 
services 
and 
goods. 
In 
particular, 
the 
component  aims 
to 
provide 
assistance 
to 
persons 
displaced 
as 
a 
result 
of 
restructuring 
or 
privatization 
of 
enterprises 
through 
labor 
redeployment 
services, 
as 
part 
of 
the 
carrying out 
of 
enterprise 
social 
plans, 
including 
job 
counseling, 
financial 
counseling, 
job 
search 
referral, and 
skill 
and entrepreneurial training. 
Operating 
guidelines 
for 
a 
LRP 
will 
be 
prepared, 
and 
cadres 
of 
LRP 
specialists trained. 
The 
component 
will 
also 
finance technical 
assistance 
to 
help 
up 
to 
10 
enterprises 
in 
pilot 
areas 
prepare 
social 
plans. 
The 
social 
plans 
are 
to 
be 
prepared 
as 
part 
of 
the 
Government’s 
Social 
Program 
for 
enterprises 
undergoing restructuring 
and 
will 
detail 
the 
number 
of 
redundancies expected, the structure 
of 
the 
affected workers and the proposed 
mitigation 
measures. 
Approval 
of 
enterprise 
social plans 
will 
be 
done 
by 
MOLE 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
government 
regulations,  ‘‘Decision 
of 
the 
Government 
of Serbia 
on 
the 
Social 
Program 
for 
Employees 
who 
are 
dismissed 
during 
enterprise 
restructuring 
and preparation 
for 
privatization, 
bankruptcy 
and 
liquidation”. 
The 
Government’s 
Social Program provides 
for 
funding 
from 
the 
budget 
for 
severance 
payments for redundant 
workers. 
The 
component 
will 
provide funding 
for 
labor redeployment 
services 
for 
affected workers 
as 
part 
of 
the  social plan. 
Possible 
services 
to 
be 
financed 
(to 
be 
agreed 
with 
MOLE) 
would 
include 
the 
following: 
group 
and 
individual 
information 
sessions, 
job 
counseling, 
career  counseling, 
financial 
counseling 
for 
redundant 
workers 
and 
their 
families, 
job

and 
implementation 
arrangements 
for 
labor 
redeployment 
services 
to 
be financed 
as 
part 
of 
the 
social 
plans 
will 
developed 
by 
MOLE, 
working 
with 
the 
local 
partnerships and 
technical 
assistance 
during 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
implementation. 
The 
allocation 
for 
this 
activity 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
a 
condition 
of 
disbursement 
until 
the 
implementation 
plan 
has 
been 
developed 
and agreed 
with 
the 
Bank. 
The 
primary 
objective 
of 
Component 
2 
“Piloting reforms 
in 
Public 
Employment 
Services” 
will 
be 
to 
design, 
pilot 
and evaluate 
new 
and cost effective 
public 
employment 
services 
with 
the 
view 
to 
assisting 
the 
unemployed 
to 
rapidly 
re-enter the 
labor 
market, 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
improved 
employment 
services, 
such 
as 
job 
search 
assistance 
programs and 
small 
business 
advisory 
services, 
as 
well

the 
institutional 
strengthening 
of 
the 
MOLE 
and 
LMB, 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
training, 
services and

The 
component 
will 
also assist 
in 
the 
design 
of 
ALMPs 
that can 
be 
used 
to 
screen 
unemployment benefit 
recipients, 
and 
increase system 
confidence 
in 
the 
employment 
status 
of 
claimants. 
These

will 
be 
provided 
by 
the 
local 
employment 
agency, 
or 
by 
an 
external 
service 
provider 
following 
a process 
of 
public 
tendering, 
will 
be 
made 
by 
the

The 
objective 
of 
Component 
3 
“Labor  market 
information 
and 
evaluation: 
social 
impact 
of 
restructuring 
and  effects 
of 
ALMPs” 
is 
to 
develop 
a 
comprehensive 
system 
of 
labor 
market 
information 
to 
assess 
and 
evaluate  the 
effects 
of 
labor 
market 
programs, 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
training,  services 
and 
goods. 
This 
involves 
building 
local 
capacity 
to 
generate, 
analyze 
and 
use 
the 
information 
for 
policy 
formulation 
and 
program 
design. 
The 
Component 
comprises 
five 
tasks: 
(i) 
Development 
of 
the 
performance 
information and 
management 
system 
(PIMS) 
to monitor 
labor 
market 
trends 
and 
programs, 
and 
guide 
program 
design; 
(ii) 
Training 
on 
the 
principles 
and methods 
of 
the evaluation 
of 
ALMPs; 
(iii) 
Monitoring 
of 
hsplaced 
workers: the 
use 
of 
labor 
redeployment 
services 
and 
changes 
in 
the 
labor 
market 
status; 
(iv) 
Qualitative 
assessment 
of 
ALMP 
supported 
by 
the 
EPP 
in 
four 
pilot 
areas; 
(v) 
Build 
a 
Database 
on 
Displaced 
Workers. 
Surveys 
will 
use a 
targeted 
sample 
drawn 
from 
unemployment 
register 
records at 
the 
disposal 
of 
the 
LMB. 
Survey 
results 
will 
enable 
determination 
of 
unit 
costs 
per 
placement 
of 
different 
programs, 
and 
assess 
the 
relative 
effectiveness 
of 
local 
LMBs, 
and eventually 
inform 
and 
guide 
resource 
allocation 
across 
programs 
and localities. 
It 
is 
anticipated that the analysis 
of 
the results 
of 
labor 
market 
monitoring 
will 
be 
concentrated 
in 
2005 
so 
as 
to 
ensure 
sufficient 
accumulated 
experience 
with 
ALMPs 
and labor 
redeployment. 
If 
the  results 
confirm  that 
the 
new 
employment 
services 
were 
more 
effective 
compared 
to 
those 
currently 
used, 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
new 
methods 
would 
be 
expanded 
and 
replicated 
throughout 
the country. 
Therefore, 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
relevant 
set 
of 
new 
employment 
services 
and 
associated 
participatory 
techniques 
through 
the 
model 
offices 
and model 
municipalities 
is 
expected 
to 
result 
in 
adoption and 
replication 
of 
the 
programs countrywide. 
The 
EPP 
will, 
therefore, 
aim 
to 
support 
new 
activities and 
ALMPs 
outlined 
in 
the 
new 
Law 
on 
Employment 
and 
Insurance 
in 
Case 
of 
Unemployment.

Implementation 
Arrangements 
Responsibility 
for 
project 
management 
and implementation 
rests 
with 
the 
MOLE. 
The 
Ministry 
will 
be 
assisted 
with 
the 
technical 
aspects 
of 
implementation 
by 
a 
Project Implementation 
Unit 
within 
MOLE. 
The 
PIU 
has 
been established 
by 
a 
ministerial 
order 
and 
will 
report 
to 
the 
Minister 
of 
Labor 
and 
Employment. 
The 
PIU 
will 
be 
staffed 
with 
local 
consultants 
(non 
civil 
servants) 
and 
will 
be financed 
from 
the 
credit 
proceeds. 
It 
will 
be 
staffed 
with 
the 
following 
positions: 
Director, 
Component Coordinator, Procurement 
Officer, 
Financial 
Management 
Officer 
(Accountant)  and 
an 
Assistant. 
Office 
space 
for 
the 
PIU 
will 
be 
made 
available 
by 
the 
MOLE/LMB 
and 
equipment 
and 
operating 
costs 
will 
be financed 
from 
the 
credit. 
At 
the 
local 
level 
of 
the 
pilot 
sites, 
there 
will 
be 
a 
local 
partnerships 
established 
to 
facilitate 
the 
coordination of 
local 
stakeholders 
and 
oversee 
implementation 
of 
the 
activities 
in 
the 
municipalities. 
These 
partnerships 
will 
include 
local 
stakeholders 
for 
this 
project 
such 
as 
local 
administration, 
labor 
market 
bureau, 
major 
employers,  trade 
unions, 
and 
nongovernmental  organizations 
involved 
in 
labor 
issues. 
These 
committees 
should 
meet 
at least 
once 
per 
quarter and 
more 
often 
as 
necessary. 
The 
PIU 
is 
responsible 
for 
implementation 
fimctions 
such 
as 
project 
accounting, 
procurement, 
disbursements, 
consolidation 
of 
quarterly 
project 
management 
reports and 
budgets. 
It 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
organizing 
all 
tenders 
under 
the 
project 
and payment 
of 
contracts.

a. 
Procurement 
Since Procurement 
activities 
will 
be 
implemented 
by 
the 
MOLE, 
a procurement capacity 
assessment 
was 
carried 
out 
which 
indicated 
that 
procurement 
staff 
in 
the 
MOLE 
are 
dealing 
with 
some 
procurement 
under 
the 
ministry’s 
budget 
but 
may 
be challenged 
by 
having 
to 
apply 
the 
Bank’s 
procurement 
guidelines 
when 
hiring 
consultants 
and purchasing 
goods for 
this 
project. 
It 
was 
therefore 
agreed 
that 
the 
hiring 
of 
a 
procurement specialist 
familiar 
with 
procurement 
under 
Bank 
financed 
projects 
will 
constitute 
adequate 
resources 
to 
carry 
out 
the 
few 
procurement 
activities 
foreseen 
under 
the 
EPP. 
Consulting 
services contracts 
will 
be 
awarded 
under 
the 
project, 
following 
Bank 
Consultant Guidelines 
(January 
1997; 
revised 
September 
1997, 
January 1999 
and 
May 
2002), 
with 
two main 
contracts 
to 
be 
awarded 
under 
the Quality-and-Cost-Based 
Selection 
(QCBS) method. 
Miscellaneous 
office 
equipment, 
supplies, 
printing 
of 
materials 
shall 
be 
procured 
through 
international 
or 
national 
shopping, 
following 
the 
Bank 
Guidelines: 
Procurement 
under 
IBRD 
Loans and 
IDA 
Credits 
(January 
1995, 
revised 
up 
to 
January 
1999), 
for 
Goods 
and 
Works (threshold 
IS 
below 
USS100,OOO 
and 
NS 
below 
USS50,OOO). 
Details 
of 
the 
proposed 
procurement 
arrangements 
are 
given 
in 
Annexes 
6. 
b. 
Financial 
Management 
A 
review 
was 
undertaken 
in 
December 
2002 
(updated 
in 
February 
2003 
and 
again 
in 
April 
2003) 
to 
determine 
whether 
the 
financial 
management arrangements 
for 
the EPP 
are 
acceptable 
to 
the 
IDA. 
It 
has 
been 
concluded  that 
the 
Project 
satisfies  the 
IDA’S 
minimum  financial 
management 
requirements. 
The 
PN’s 
interim 
financial 
management system 
is 
considered capable 
of 
satisfactorily 
recording 
all 
transactions 
and 
balances 
and supporting 
the 
preparation 
of 
regular and 
reliable financial 
statements. 
However, 
to 
further 
strengthen 
financial 
management 
within 
the 
PIU, 
an 
integrated 
accounting and 
reporting 
package 
will 
be procured 
during 
the 
early 
part 
of 
project implementation 
to 
replace 
the 
interim 
spreadsheet 
based 
system. 
Disbursements 
from 
the 
IDA 
credit 
will 
follow 
the 
transaction-based method, 
i.e., 
the 
traditional 
IDA 
procedures 
including 
reimbursements 
with 
full 
documentation,  Statements 
of 
Expenditure 
(SOE), 
direct 
payments and special 
commitments, 
It 
is 
not 
anticipated that the 
project 
will 
migrate 
to 
report 
based 
disbursement 
. 
c. 
Other 
Project 
monitoring 
and 
supervision. 
Project implementation 
will 
be 
monitored 
by 
the 
PIU 
and 
the 
MOLE. 
During 
negotiations 
an 
agreement was reached 
that the 
following 
documents 
will 
be 
prepared 
by 
the 
PIU 
to 
facilitate project 
monitoring: 
0 
Quarterly 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Reports 
(FMRs), 
which 
should 
(i) 
set 
forth 
actual 
sources 
and 
applications 
of 
funds 
for 
the 
project, 
both 
cumulatively 
and 
for 
the 
period 
covered 
by 
the 
report, and 
(ii) 
contain 
an 
update 
of 
the 
project 
cost 
and procurement 
plan 
indicating 
the 
progress 
in 
project 
implementation and 
explaining 
variances 
between 
the 
actual and 
previously 
forecast 
implementation 
targets; 
and 
(iii) 
contain 
a 
statement 
of 
Special 
Account 
0 
Annual project

statements 
for 
each 
fiscal 
year 
(which

the 
calendar 
year 
in 
Serbia) 
audited 
by 
independent auditors 
by 
June 30 
of 
the 
next 
year. 
The 
monitoring 
of 
the 
project 
will 
include regular 
supervision 
by 
the 
Bank’s 
Task 
Team, 
jointly 
with

Risks 
1. 
Social 
and 
Environmental 
Risk 
Social impacts 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
positive 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
adoption 
of 
improved 
employment 
services 
which 
would 
help 
redundant 
workers 
and 
job 
seekers 
to 
cope 
with 
their 
new 
status 
and 
to 
reintegrate 
into 
the 
labor market 
by 
providing 
placement 
services 
and 
assisting 
workers 
to 
undertake 
self-employment, 
and 
reduce the short-term 
negative impact 
of 
labor 
restructuring 
on 
affected workers and 
communities. 
Design 
of 
employment 
services 
will 
take 
into 
account 
recurrent

For 
Component 
1, 
there 
is 
a 
risk 
that the 
Government’s 
Social Program 
may not 
have 
sufficient 
funds 
for 
redundancy 
payments 
for 
all 
enterprises 
in 
pilot 
areas. 
The 
project 
is 
safeguarding 
against 
this 
risk 
by 
stipulating 
that the 
EPP 
will 
support 
“eligible 
enterprises”, 
which 
are 
defined 
as 
those 
committed 
to 
deep 
restructuring and approved 
for 
support 
under the 
Government’s

Program.

b. 
Other 
Social 
Risks 
The 
social 
risks 
of 
undertaking 
the EPP 
are 
low. 
Although 
the 
labor 
market 
situation 
is 
already 
tense 
and 
more 
workers 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
made 
redundant, 
the 
EPP 
intends 
to 
build 
public 
support  for 
restructuring 
by 
signaling 
to 
citizens, 
communities 
and labor 
representatives that 
those 
responsible for 
restructuring 
are 
tuned 
to 
the 
needs 
of 
affected 
workers 
and 
the unemployed 
people 
and 
that 
they 
are 
ready 
and 
willing 
to 
assist 
those 
that need 
and 
want 
help. 
Positive 
benefits 
are 
expected 
to 
accrue 
to 
the 
Bank’s 
and 
UK 
DFID’s 
reputation 
as 
a 
result 
of  their 
involvement 
in 
the 
pilot 
project. 
The 
potential 
positive 
social 
outcomes 
are 
high, 
and far 
outweigh 
the 
very 
low 
social 
risks 
to 
the

Project 
Component

- 
US$2.41 million 
Design 
of 
Labor 
Redeployment 
Activities 
The 
objective 
of 
this 
component 
is 
to 
reintegrate 
displaced 
workers 
and other 
job 
seekers 
into 
the 
labor 
market 
and 
mitigate the 
social 
costs 
of 
enterprise 
restructuring through 
the development 
and 
testing 
of 
new 
policies, 
institutional 
arrangements 
and 
labor 
redeployment 
programs, 
including 
the  design 
and 
implementation 
of 
enterprise 
social 
plans, 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
training, 
services 
and 
goods. 
Component 
1 
involves 
the 
design, 
testing, 
and implementation 
of 
a 
LRP 
that 
will 
support 
workers 
affected 
by 
enterprise 
restructuring 
and 
privatization, 
is 
consistent 
with 
international 
best 
practices, 
and 
is 
feasible 
for 
replication 
under 
the 
conditions 
existing 
in 
Serbia. 
Piloting 
of 
a 
LRP 
will 
benefit 
from 
a 
learning-by-doing  approach 
to 
ensure  that: 
(i) 
tracking, 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
results 
as 
well 
as 
social 
partner feedback 
are 
an 
integral 
part 
of 
the 
LRP 
design 
and 
would 
be 
used 
to 
fine-tune the 
LRP 
program;  and 
(ii) 
different  implementation delivery 
structures 
would 
be 
tested 
depending 
upon 
local 
capacity, 
e.g. 
public 
employment 
services; 
private 
service 
providers, 
NGO’s, 
local level 
partnerships. 
These 
would 
be 
evaluated 
for 
effectiveness 
(quality 
of 
results 
and 
cost). 
The 
LRP 
is 
responsive 
to 
the 
government’s  pace 
of 
enterprise 
restructuring and 
targets 
redundant 
workers 
for 
information 
and 
assistance 
prior 
to 
leaving 
the  workplace. 
International 
experience 
has 
shown 
that 
pre-layoff 
services 
such 
as, 
information 
on 
departure  options,  counseling,  screening 
and 
referral 
to 
other 
redeployment 
assistance 
during 
the 
notification 
period may 
improve 
employability 
and 
lessen 
the 
chances 
that 
redundant 
workers 
join 
the 
ranks 
of 
the 
long 
term 
unemployed. 
Summary 
of 
Technical 
Assistance: 
Technical 
assistance 
under the 
project 
for 
this 
component 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
MOLE 
and 
to 
LMB, 
and 
to 
participating 
enterprises 
and 
local 
communities. 
Firstly, 
technical 
assistance 
will 
be provided 
to 
the 
MOLE 
and 
LMB 
related 
to 
the  design 
and 
delivery 
of 
the 
LRP 
including 
the 
identification, testing and 
assessment 
of 
different 
administrative 
structures 
for 
the 
LRP. 
Secondly, 
technical 
assistance 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
eligible 
enterprises 
in 
the 
preparation and 
testing 
of 
Social 
Plans 
in 
10 
selected 
enterprises 
in 
the 
four 
pilot 
areas, 
based 
on 
criteria 
agreed 
with 
MOLE. 
Technical 
assistance 
related 
to 
managing labor restructuring 
will 
also 
be 
provided 
to 
enterprise 
managers. 
Criteria 
agreed 
with 
MOLE 
for 
enterprise 
selection 
for 
the 
pilot 
include: 
- 
the 
size 
of 
the 
enterprise 
and 
magnitude 
of 
restructuring; 
- 
the enterprise 
is 
on 
the 
list 
of 
enterprises 
undergoing 
restructuring; and 
- 
the enterprise 
demonstrates 
willingness 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
pilot. 
Demonstration 
of 
the 
willingness 
to 
participate 
will 
include 
agreement 
to 
provide 
suitable 
physical 
space, 
operating 
costs 
(heating,  telephone) 
and 
a 
minimum 
of 
one 
staff 
(to 
be 
trained under the 
project) 
for 
contributing 
to 
the 
staffing 
of 
a 
“redundant 
worker 
action 
center” 
(RWAC). 
Technical 
assistance 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
stakeholders  at  the 
community  level 
(enterprises, 
worker 
representatives, 
labor 
market 
bureaus, 
local self 
government). 
Testing 
new 
approaches 
for 
overseeing 
labor 
redeployment programs and 
employment 
services 
in 
the 
project 
will 
involve 
key 
actors 
in 
each 
of 
four 
pilot 
areas 
to 
be 
carried out through 
the 
formation 
of 
local 
partnerships.

support the partnerships. 
Local 
partners 
would 
include, 
but 
not

the 
enterprises 
that 
are 
undergoing 
restructuring, 
local 
self-government 
local 
labor

bureau, 
SME 
agencies, 
and 
other 
relevant 
civil 
society. 
The 
exact 
form 
of 
partnership 
in 
each 
area 
will 
depend 
upon 
factors 
such 
local 
capacity, 
conditions 
and 
local 
needs 
as 
well 
as 
the  magnitude 
of 
enterprise 
restructuring. 
Local 
partnerships 
could be 
expanded 
to 
other 
key  community 
actors 
such 
as 
trade 
unions, 
training 
and 
educational institutions, 
foundations, 
NGOs, 
Chambers 
of 
Commerce 
and 
other 
public 
or 
private 
sector 
associations.

funding 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
enterprise 
social 
plans: 
Basic 
criteria for 
a 
LRP 
funding. 
The 
project 
will 
provide 
funding, 
which 
enterprises 
or 
local 
level 
partnerships 
can 
draw  upon 
to 
finance 
labor 
redeployment 
services 
in 
order 
to 
implement 
the 
enterprise-level 
social 
plans 
during 
restructuring 
and 
privatization. 
Local 
partnerships 
in 
the 
pilot 
areas, 
formed 
under 
the 
auspices 
of 
the 
MOLE, 
will 
review 
and 
recommend 
to 
MOLE 
labor 
redeployment 
services 
contained 
in 
enterprise 
social 
plans 
to be 
funded 
under the project. 
The 
project 
will 
provide 
a 
maximum 
total 
of 
USD 
1 
million 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
social plans (labor redeployment 
services) 
for 
up 
to 
10 
enterprises 
in 
four 
pilot 
sites. 
LRP 
funding 
for 
enterprises 
is 
not 
intended 
to 
relieve financial 
distress 
in 
enterprises 
and 
LRP 
services 
in 
pilot 
enterprises 
should 
be 
demand 
driven. 
Maximum 
allocations per 
eligible 
enterprise 
will 
be 
negotiated 
with 
the 
MOLE. 
Redundant Workers 
Action 
Centers. 
Task 
3 
will 
also 
involve 
the 
establishment 
of 
one 
to two 
“redundant 
worker 
action 
centers”, 
which 
will 
be 
equipped 
under the project 
in 
each 
of 
the 
four 
pilot 
areas. 
The 
RWACs 
will 
act 
as 
a 
resource center 
providing 
information 
on 
workers’  redeployment  options 
and 
options related 
to 
the 
Government’s 
Social Program 
and 
will 
assist 
in 
test 
implementation 
of 
enterprise 
social 
plans. 
This 
will 
include acting 
as 
a 
worker 
communication 
and 
coordination 
center 
for 
labor 
redeployment 
pre-layoff 
and 
post-layoff 
services 
such

Although 
redundant 
workers 
in 
enterprises 
undergoing restructuring 
are 
the 
primary 
targets, 
testing 
of 
pre-layoff 
and post-layoff 
redeployment programs 
may 
also 
include 
a 
public 
sector 
redundancy 
pilot.  The 
Health

of 
Kralijevo 
has 
been 
identified 
as 
a 
potential 
test 
site. 
Task 
4: 
Involvement 
of 
key 
stakeholders, 
monitoring, 
and 
tracking 
outcomes 
of

programs 
will 
be 
developed, 
and 
training 
conducted 
for 
selected 
counselors 
in 
pilot 
areas. 
Study tours 
for local 
LMB 
staff 
in 
pilot 
areas 
will 
be 
arranged 
on 
topics relevant 
to 
the 
sub-components. 
If 
needed, 
assistance 
is 
will 
also 
be 
provided 
to 
local labor 
offices 
related 
to 
sub-contracting

providers 
to 
deliver 
respective 
services 
following 
procedures 
in 
the 
Project 
Operational 
Manual 
as 
agreed 
with 
the Bank. 
The 
decision 
on 
whether 
this 
service 
will 
be 
provided 
by 
the 
local 
employment 
agency, 
or 
by 
an 
external service 
provider 
following 
a process 
of 
public 
tendering, 
will 
be 
made 
by 
the 
MOLE 
or 
local 
authorities, 
as 
described 
in 
the 
Employment 
Law 
and 
other relevant 
acts. 
At

a 
client 
database, 
will 
provide 
the 
potential 
for 
client 
profiling. 
This 
will 
enable 
all 
LMB 
Offices 
to 
prepare 
accurate 
profiles 
of 
client 
groups 
(for 
example, 
the 
database 
will 
tell 
them 
what 
are 
the 
main 
characteristics 
of 
a 
person 
who 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
unemployed 
for 
over 
2 
years; 
what 
is 
the 
probability 
that 
they 
will 
be 
female, 
over 
50; 
from 
a 
specific 
location 
and 
so 
on). 
This 
will 
also enable 
the 
LMB 
to 
forecast 
what 
the 
likely 
employment 
chances 
are 
for 
specific people 
facing 
redundancy 
(profiling) 
in 
order 
to 
better 
target 
LW 
initiatives and 
ALMPs.

Service 
providers 
will 
be 
required 
to 
conduct 
an 
extensive 
consultation 
process 
to review 
the  social 
issues 
and 
local 
factors. 
This 
process 
will, 
inter 
alia,

ministries 
to 
evaluate 
the 
impact 
of 
ALMP 
and 
use 
evaluation 
results 
for 
(re) 
designing 
labor 
market 
policies 
and 
programs. 
To 
this 
end 
international 
consultants 
will 
be 
hired to 
carry 
out 
a 
workshop 
on 
ALMP 
evaluation. 
The 
workshop 
will 
provide 
the 
key 
stakeholders 
(MOLE, 
LMB) 
with 
key 
concepts, 
methods 
and 
results 
of 
ALMP 
evaluation. 
In 
particular, the 
workshop 
is 
planned 
to 
cover the 
following 
issues: 
(a) 
objectives 
of 
ALMP 
evaluation, 
(b) 
macroeconomic 
vs. 
microeconomic 
ALMP 
evaluations, 
(c) 
concepts 
of 
deadweight 
loss, 
substitution and 
displacement 
effects, 
(d) 
concepts 
of 
targeting 
and allocative 
efficiency, 
(e) 
treatment effects, 
the 
concept 
of 
a 
comparison group 
(gross 
vs. 
net 
impact), 
(9 
program 
effects 
and 
cost-effectiveness 
(basic  elements 
of 
cost-benefit 
analysis), 
(g) 
basic 
approaches 
to 
and 
methods 
of 
determining 
the 
net impact 
of 
ALMP 
(experimental  and 
quasi-experimental 
designs, 
etc.), 
(h) 
data 
collection 
strategies, 
(i) 
interpreting 
the 
results 
of 
net impact 
evaluations 
(statistical 
vs. 
economic 
significance), 
0) 
examples 
and 
lessons 
from 
of 
ALMP 
evaluation 
in 
OECD 
and 
transition 
economies, 
and 
finally 
(k) 
using 
evaluation 
results 
for 
improving 
and 
re-designing 
labor 
market 
programs. 
Tusk 
3: 
Monitoring 
of 
Changes 
in 
the 
Labor 
Market 
Status 
of 
Displaced 
Workers. 
The 
purpose 
of 
the 
monitoring 
Subcomponent 
is 
to 
learn 
about  the 
efficacy 
of 
the  labor 
redeployment  program, 
and 
to 
improve 
the Social 
Program’s  design 
and 
effectiveness. 
To 
this end 
a 
special tracer 
(follow-up) 
survey 
of 
displaced workers 
will 
be 
designed 
and 
implemented. 
Survey results 
will 
allow 
one 
to 
determine 
changes 
in 
the 
welfare 
and 
labor market 
status 
of 
workers 
hsplaced 
due 
to 
the 
enterprise 
restructuring 
and privatization, 
who 
benefited 
from 
the  Social 
Program. 
Specifically,  the  survey 
will 
(a) 
identify 
assistance 
received 
under 
the 
Social 
Program 
(e.g. 
pre- 
and 
post-lay 
off 
services,  severance 
pay), 
(b) 
determine 
the 
typical 
pattern 
of 
labor 
market  behavior 
(e.g. 
methods  and 
intensity 
of 
job 
search, 
assessment 
of 
the 
difficulty 
to 
find 
a 
job, 
job 
search 
duration, 
the current 
labor force and 
earnings 
status) 
, 
and 
finally 
(c) 
determine 
changes 
in 
the 
economic 
status 
in 
the wake 
of 
redundancy 
(an analysis 
of 
a 
transition 
matrix 
showing 
aggregate 
worker 
flows 
across 
the 
three 
labor  force 
states: 
employment, 
unemployment and inactivity). 
Eventually, 
the study 
will 
aim 
at 
drawing 
policy 
implications, 
which 
should 
include 
(a) 
identification 
of 
worker 
groups 
which 
are 
encountering problems 
in 
re-integration 
into 
the 
labor 
market  and 
who 
are 
encountering 
problems 
in 
maintaining 
their 
economic 
status, 
and 
recommendations 
for 
remedial action 
(e.g. 
additional 
labor 
redeployment 
and 
social 
services), 
and 
(b) 
assessment 
of 
and recommendations 
concerning the 
effectiveness 
of 
the benefits 
and 
services 
provided 
under 
the 
Social 
Program.

Task 
4: 
Qualitative 
Assessment 
ofALMP 
Supported 
by 
EPP 
in 
Pilot 
Areas. 
The 
key 
goal 
of 
a 
LRP 
and 
ALMPs 
is 
to 
improve 
job 
prospects 
of 
the displaced workers and 
the 
unemployed. 
The 
objective 
of 
this 
Subcomponent 
is 
to 
determine 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
different 
programs 
tested 
under 
the 
EPP 
project 
have 
contributed 
to 
meeting 
this 
goal. 
The 
eventual purpose 
is 
to 
improve 
program 
design 
and program 
mix. 
The 
assessment 
will 
include: 
(a) 
relative performance 
of 
various programs 
(such 
as 
pre-layoff 
services, 
job 
counseling, 
job 
clubs,  business 
incubators)  tested 
under 
EPP, 
(b) 
effects 
of 
different 
programs 
on 
different client 
groups, 
and 
(c) 
program 
effects depending 
on 
local 
labor market conditions 
(e.g. 
impact 
in 
high 
unemployment 
vs. 
low 
unemployment 
regions). 
It 
is 
envisaged that 
the 
assessment 
will 
be 
done 
using 
the 
results 
of 
a 
client 
satisfaction 
survey 
and/or 
focus 
groups. 
Clients 
(stakeholders) 
include 
displaced 
workers 
who 
used  the 
labor 
redeployment 
program, 
the 
unemployed 
who 
participated 
in 
ALMP, 
local 
employers, 
local 
LMB 
staff, 
and 
local 
govemment/community. 
It 
is 
anticipated 
that the analysis 
of 
the results 
of 
labor market 
monitoring 
will 
be 
concentrated 
in 
2005 
so 
as 
to 
ensure 
sufficient 
accumulated 
experience 
with 
ALMPs 
and 
labor 
redeployment 
programs. 
If 
the 
results 
confirm 
that 
the 
new 
employment 
services 
and 
redeployment  programs 
were  more 
effective 
compared 
to 
those 
currently 
used, 
it 
is 
expected that 
the 
new 
methods 
would 
be 
expanded 
and 
replicated 
throughout 
the 
country. 
Therefore, 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
relevant 
set 
of 
new 
employment 
services 
and 
associated 
participatory 
techniques 
through the 
model 
offices and 
model 
municipalities 
is 
expected 
to 
result 
in 
adoption and replication of 
the programs 
countrywide. 
Task 
5: 
Building 
a 
database 
on 
displaced 
workers. 
The 
objective 
of 
building 
the 
database 
is 
twofold. 
First, 
to 
determine the 
number 
and 
profile 
(structure) 
of 
displaced workers. 
Second, 
to 
provide 
a 
sample 
frame 
to 
draw 
a 
sample 
of 
displaced 
workers, 
which 
will 
be 
used 
by 
the 
survey 
of 
displaced workers 
(see 
above). 
Data 
will 
be 
collected 
mainly 
from 
companies 
covered 
by 
the Government 
Social 
Program. 
The 
primary 
users 
of 
the 
database 
will 
be 
the 
central 
LMB 
in 
Belgrade 
and 
four 
local Labor 
Market 
Bureaus 
in 
designated 
project 
sites. 
The 
database 
will 
be 
used 
to 
produce 
summary 
reports 
(tabulations 
and 
cross-tabulations) 
on 
the 
numbers 
of 
redundant 
workers 
in 
various break-downs 
(by 
company, 
locality, 
age, 
education,  occupation, 
etc.). 
The 
EPP  provides 
for 
all 
project 
components 
additional  financing 
for: 
a) 
materialdequipment 
for 
implementation 
of 
improved 
employment 
services 
programs  developed 
under 
this 
project; 
b) 
office 
equipment 
and 
computers 
for local 
labor 
offices 
in 
pilot 
areas. 
Project Component

million 
Project Management 
This 
component 
will 
provide 
assistance 
to 
the 
MOLE 
in 
the 
management 
of 
the Project through 
the 
provision 
of 
services, 
including 
the 
audit 
of

as 
well 
as 
assistance 
to 
both 
the 
MOLE 
and 
LMB 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the Project. 
It 
will 
finance 
staff 
costs, 
equipment, 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
in 
project 
management, 
procurement 
and 
financial 
management 
and

Assessment 
Report 
SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO: 
Employment Promotion Project 
Country 
Issues 
The 
FRY 
- 
Federal 
Republic 
of 
Yugoslavia 
was 
renamed 
Serbia and 
Montenegro 
following 
adoption 
of 
the 
new 
constitution 
on 
February 
4, 
2003. 
CFAA 
report 
notes 
that 
there 
are 
a 
number 
of 
risks 
on 
the 
management 
of 
public 
funds 
in 
the 
FRY. 
The 
risks 
to 
the 
public 
funds 
include: 
(a) 
poor 
public 
sector 
financial 
management 
in 
the 
past, 
(b) 
unfinished reforms 
- 
the 
new 
governments 
that were elected have 
commenced 
a 
process 
of 
major 
reform, 
which 
looks 
good 
as 
designed, 
but 
it 
is 
still 
too early 
to 
say 
if 
the 
reforms 
will 
be 
totally 
successful, 
(c) 
capacity 
constraints 
in 
both 
the 
Federal 
and Republic 
governments, 
(d) 
weak 
banking 
sectors, 
(e) 
weak 
audit 
capacity, 
(f) 
poor 
implementation 
capacity 
in 
line 
ministries, 
and 
(g) 
the 
lack 
of 
recent 
Bank 
implementation 
experiences 
within 
the 
FRY. 
Since 
re-joining 
the 
membership 
of 
the 
World 
Bank, 
FRY 
has 
been 
using 
individual 
implementation 
units 
for 
each 
investment 
project 
(traditional 
PIU 
model), 
located 
within 
the  relevant 
line 
ministries 
or 
project 
beneficiaries, 
to 
mitigate 
some 
of 
these 
risks. 
This 
arrangement 
is 
acceptable 
to the 
Bank 
and 
the 
Bank 
has 
provided training 
on 
financial 
management 
and 
disbursements 
to 
the 
projects’ 
staff 
in 
March 
2002. 
Strengths 
and 
Weaknesses 
The 
strengths 
that 
provide 
a 
basis 
for 
placing 
reliance 
on 
the project financial 
management system 
lie 
in 
the  general 
corporate 
accounting 
experience 
of 
the 
Project 
accountinddisbursement 
officer 
and 
the 
comprehensive 
Operations 
Manual 
prepared 
for 
the 
Project 
by 
a 
consultant 
with 
extensive 
prior Bank 
experience. 
Weaknesses 
include 
reliance 
initially 
on 
a 
spreadsheet 
based 
recording 
system 
and the 
lack 
of 
experience 
of 
the 
PIU 
staff 
in 
managing 
IDA 
funded 
projects. 
Staffing 
of 
the 
AccountingJFinance 
Function 
The 
finance 
function 
comprises 
a 
single disbursement 
officer/project 
accountant 
who 
reports 
directly 
to 
the 
PIU 
Director. 
The 
Accountant 
is 
a 
licensed auditor 
in 
Serbia 
and 
has 
prior 
experience 
in 
corporate 
accounting. 
Accounting Policies and Procedures 
An 
Operations 
Manual 
(OM), 
prepared 
specifically 
for 
the 
project, 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
MOLE 
on 
April 
1 
1,2003. 
The 
OM 
details 
a 
series 
of 
preventative 
and 
detective controls 
and 
places 
a 
strong 
emphasis 
on 
the 
need 
to 
maintain 
an 
adequate 
segregation 
of 
duties. 
It 
is 
likely 
that 
at 
project 
effectiveness, 
the 
PIU 
will 
be 
operating 
a 
spreadsheet 
based 
accounting 
system. 
Such 
a 
system 
lacks 
many 
of 
the 
“software” 
controls 
common 
to 
modern 
accounting 
packages 
and 
hence 
reliance 
is 
initially 
placed 
on 
manual 
controls 
to 
ensure 
the accuracy 
of 
financial 
reporting.

Internal 
audit 
As 
noted 
in 
the 
CFAA, 
line 
ministries 
are 
subject 
to 
internal 
audit 
inspections. 
However, 
this 
function 
is 
not 
conducted  systematically  and 
hence  the 
IDA 
will 
place 
no 
reliance 
upon 
internal  audit  when 
determining 
the  extent 
of 
Project 
level 
internal 
controls 
necessary 
to 
give 
assurance 
that 
funds 
are 
adequately 
protected and 
transactions 
are 
accurately reported. 
External 
audit 
The 
PKJ 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
ensuring that Project 
financial 
statements 
are 
audited 
by 
an 
independent 
auditor 
acceptable 
to 
the 
IDA, 
in 
accordance 
with 
standards 
on 
auditing 
that 
are 
acceptable 
to 
the 
IDA. 
It 
was agreed 
during 
negotiations 
that 
auditing 
standards 
acceptable 
to 
the 
IDA 
are 
International 
Standards 
on 
Auditing 
promulgated 
by 
the International Federation 
of 
Accountants (IFAC). 
It 
was agreed 
during 
negotiations 
that  auditors 
acceptable 
to 
the 
IDA 
are 
those  auditors 
that 
have 
been unconditionally 
pre-qualified 
to 
audit 
IDA 
funded 
projects 
in 
SAM. 
The 
cost 
of 
the 
audit 
will 
be 
financed 
from 
the 
proceeds 
of 
the credit. 
The 
following 
chart 
identifies 
the 
audit 
reports that 
will 
be 
required 
to be

Information 
Systems 
Currently, 
the 
PTU 
has 
a 
spreadsheet 
based 
information 
system. 
At 
effectiveness, 
project 
expenditures 
and 
cash 
balances 
will 
be 
recorded 
using 
excel 
spreadsheets. 
However, 
the 
PTU 
is 
in 
the 
process 
of 
procuring 
integrated accounting 
software 
capable 
of 
automatically 
generating 
reports 
for 
the 
IDA, 
the 
MOLE 
and 
the 
MOF 
Debt 
Monitoring Unit. 
Disbursement Arrangements 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
proceeds 
of 
the 
Credit 
will 
be 
disbursed over 
a 
period 
of 
three 
years, 
which 
includes 
six 
months 
for 
the 
completion 
of 
accounts 
and 
the 
submission 
of 
withdrawal 
applications. 
The 
estimate 
of 
the 
volume 
of 
counterpart 
funds 
required 
to 
fully 
implement 
the 
Project 
is 
based 
on 
the 
Standard 
Disbursement 
Profile for 
Serbia. 
Disbursements 
from 
the 
IDA 
credit 
will 
follow 
the 
transaction-based 
method,

the 
traditional 
Bank 
procedures 
including 
reimbursements 
with 
full

Supervision 
Plan 
The 
reports 
of 
the 
progress 
of 
the 
project implementation 
will 
be 
monitored 
in 
detail 
during 
supervision 
missions. 
FMRs 
will 
be reviewed 
on 
a 
regular 
basis 
by 
the 
Belgrade-based 
FMS 
and 
the 
results 
or 
issues 
followed 
up 
during 
the 
supervision 
missions. 
Financial audit 
reports 
of 
the 
project 
will 
be 
reviewed 
and 
issues 
identified 
and 
followed 
up. 
When 
it 
is 
prepared, 
the 
FMS 
will 
review 
the Operational 
Manual 
dealing 
for 
the 
carrying out 
of 
labor 
redeployment 
services 
to 
ensure 
that 
any 
financial 
risks 
arising 
as 
from 
these 
activities 
are adequately 
mitigated through 
the 
imposition 
of 
financial 
controls.

The 
project 
was  prepared 
as 
a collaborative 
effort 
between 
MOLE, 
LMB, 
DFID 
and 
the 
Bank. 
A 
preliminary 
assessment 
of 
institutional 
capacity 
for 
project 
implementation 
and 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
of 
the 
EPP, 
financed 
by 
UK 
DFID, 
was 
conducted 
in 
August-September 
2002, 
and 
an 
assessment 
of 
pilot 
municipalities 
was 
completed 
in 
December 
2002. 
Also 
the 
DFID-financed 
qualitative 
baseline 
study 
on 
local 
socio-economic and 
labor 
market 
conditions 
in 
four 
pilot 
areas 
is 
scheduled 
to 
be 
completed 
by 
mid-2003 
to 
explore 
policy 
and operational  options 
for 
EPP 
in 
pilot 
areas 
to 
promote 
employment opportunities 
and 
reduce 
social exclusion. 
The 
study 
will 
focus 
on 
the 
key 
characteristics 
of 
the 
demand 
for 
labor 
and 
the 
supply 
of 
labor, 
and 
the mechanisms 
by 
which 
employers 
and workers 
are 
brought 
into 
contact 
with 
each other 
via 
the 
local 
LMBs, 
and 
assessing 
the 
means 
by 
which 
EPP can 
support 
measures 
to 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
labor 
market clearing 
institutions 
in 
the 
four 
pilot 
areas. 
These 
preparatory 
tasks 
were 
intended 
to 
help 
the 
Government 
of 
Serbia, 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
DFID 
articulate and 
implement 
the 
EPP, 
and 
to 
address 
the 
issues 
and 
challenges.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements 
SERBIA 
AND 
MONTENEGRO: Employment Promotion Project 
Procurement 
1. 
Organization 
: 
Since  Procurement 
activities 
will 
be 
implemented 
by 
the 
MOLE, 
a 
procurement 
capacity 
assessment was 
carried 
out 
which 
indicated 
that procurement 
staff 
in 
the 
MOLE 
are 
dealing 
with 
some 
procurement under the 
ministry’s 
budget 
but 
may 
be 
challenged 
by 
having 
to 
apply 
the Bank’s 
procurement guidelines 
when 
hiring 
consultants 
and 
purchasing 
goods 
for 
this 
project. 
It 
was 
therefore 
agreed that 
the 
hiring 
of 
a 
procurement 
specialist 
familiar 
with 
procurement 
under 
Bank 
financed 
projects 
will 
constitute 
adequate 
resources 
to 
cany 
out 
the 
few 
procurement 
activities 
foreseen 
under the 
EPP. 
Procurement activities 
will 
be 
overseen 
by 
this 
procurement 
specialist 
who 
will 
be 
responsible 
to 
prepare 
the  procurement  plans 
for 
the 
EPP  (annual 
plans 
to 
be 
proposed 
each  year 
by 
July 
31st, 
beginning 
2003), 
and 
to 
carry out 
the 
procurement. 
2. 
Consulting 
services 
and 
training: 
about sixteen 
consulting 
services 
contracts 
will 
be 
awarded 
under 
the 
project, 
following 
Bank 
Consultant Guidelines 
(January  1997;
