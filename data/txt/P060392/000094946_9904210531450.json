coverage and quality of health services\n            and related programs that will improve the health status of\n            the population, and to empower communities to improve their\n            health status; and b) strengthen local capacity to respond\n            to health needs. The project consists of three components.\n            The first component will: 1) support the implementation of a\n            new medium term plan for immunizations; 2) implement new\n            strategies for the Integrated Management of Childhood\n            Illness and for the Mother-Baby Package; and 3) provide\n            resources to finance demand-driven local subprojects. The\n            second component will 1) support the implementation of a\n            basic health insurance system; 2) strengthen the development\n            of the management information system; and 3) strengthen the\n            capacity and accountability of the health districts to\n            manage and supervise the implementation of project\n            activities. The third component will finance the\n            establishment and operation within the Ministry of Health of\n            a management structure appropriate for the coordination of\n            all project activities and the monitoring and evaluation of\n            the project in accordance with the project performance benchmarks."}, "docdt": "1999-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
