"Overall, ratings show a satisfactory\n            project outcome, with a highly likely sustainability, and\n            high institutional development impacts, achieved through\n            satisfactory Bank, and Borrower performances. Despite\n            success, some lessons of experience convey the following.\n            The use of well-defined indicators linked to expected\n            outcomes, agreed ex-ante with the Borrower, serves an\n            important dual purpose: first, it helps improve project\n            design and implementation by ensuring focus, and aligning\n            interventions towards the achievement of a set of clear\n            benchmarks; and, second, it helps the Borrower, central and\n            local governments in centering their policy dialogue on\n            specific actions. For the successful introduction of such a\n            results-oriented culture, several conditions need to be in\n            place: Policy instruments are needed to bring the nationally\n            agreed targets to the operational level; Incentives, to\n            comply with set targets and sustain the level of effort and\n            interest; and, The health sector must have the appropriate\n            means to reach the agreed upon targets. Other important\n            issues for success address taking into account the cultural\n            barriers created by ethnic diversity; developing\n            partnerships; and, pursuing a focused and gradual approach,\n            only on few priority activities."}, "docdt": "2004-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
