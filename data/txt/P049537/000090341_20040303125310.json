The lessons learned indicate that: ownership\n            and commitment of the government are critical for successful\n            implementation of the reforms. External agencies like the\n            Bank can only facilitate the process by providing technical\n            and financial assistance. Reform design has to be state\n            specific, recognize the starting conditions and political\n            realities of the state. Political economy dimension of the\n            power reforms need to be realistically integrated in the\n            implementation strategy and expectation of the reform\n            outcomes. The expectation of the pace at which the reforms\n            can be implemented and the outcomes realized should be\n            realistic. Given the socio-political constraints the pace of\n            reforms will be determined by the willingness and capacity\n            of the governments to address key reform issues. The problem\n            of subsidized power supply to agriculture and resistance to\n            metering is embedded in distorted agricultural policies and\n            political economy factors. Communication with the\n            stakeholders is important for successful implementation of\n            reforms. Tariff subsidy to the consumers must be explicitly\n            defined and transparently delivered without compromising the\n            utility's finances. The Government of Andhra Pradesh\n            (GOAP) provided substantial support for financial\n            restructuring, but the support from financiers and suppliers\n            of power (central PSUs) was delayed. The utility managers\n            should be selected through a transparent and competitive\n            process. A strong Regulatory Commission with autonomy in\n            funding and management of its budget, staffing and\n            functioning can play a significant role in promoting\n            reforms. Reforms are considered synonymous with tariff\n            increase which is resisted by all consumers. Integration of\n            the financing requirements of the power utilities in the\n            medium term fiscal framework of the state governments,\n            supported under the Bank's structural adjustment\n            program, is useful for improving transparency in public expenditure."}, "docdt": "2004-02-20T00:00:00Z"}
