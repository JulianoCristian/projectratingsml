on\n            institutional development was substantial, sustainability is\n            likely, and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower\n            was satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, institutional reforms and capacity building\n            to achieve sustainable and cost effective agricultural\n            services is a long term process that requires clearly\n            defined short, medium, and long term objectives, and the\n            long term commitment of the government and its development\n            partners to support such objectives. Second, initiating the\n            restructuring process during project preparation with PPF\n            funding and making it an effectiveness condition was\n            instrumental to the success of the institutional reform.\n            Third, permanent and participatory diagnostics at the\n            contact group level, as well as the village level,\n            contributed significantly to increasing the participation of\n            farmers and the pertinence of extended technologies and\n            their impact. Fourth, support to agriculture schools to\n            increase the supply of adequately trained extension workers\n            would have helped and improved the quality of extension.\n            Finally, simultaneous restructuring and support to\n            agricultural extension and research institutions may\n            significantly improve the cost effectiveness of the adaptive\n            research components of agricultural services projects."}, "docdt": "1998-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
