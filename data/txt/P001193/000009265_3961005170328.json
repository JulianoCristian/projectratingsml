improved research and\n            extension, the generation, dissemination and adoption of\n            environmentally sound technology required to sustain\n            productivity gains in agriculture in the long run. The\n            project will be implemented over a period of two years on a\n            national scale. In line with the Government's overall\n            civil service reforms, the project's strategy will be:\n            (a) to assure the delivery of basic agricultural services\n            through the establishment of a National Agricultural\n            Services Agency (ANADER) which will be the Government's\n            main sub-contractor for extension, adaptive research and\n            support to farmers' organizations; and (b) to\n            streamline and strengthen MINAGRA's regional\n            directorate (DRAs) in each of the ten regions of the\n            country. DRAs' role will be refocused on their public\n            service mandate geared to establishment and implementation\n            of agricultural policies and regulations. As part of this\n            mandate, they will be given clear responsibilities and\n            directions to assist in the development of private sector\n            initiatives. In support of the above strategy, the project\n            will include the following components: (a) restructuring\n            process; (b) operating support to ANADER; and (c)\n            institutional strengthening."}, "docdt": "1994-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
