MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO COTE D'IVOIRE
FOR A NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL SERVICES SUPPORT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
Credit to C&te d'lvoire for SDR 15.7 million (US$21.8 million equivalent). The Credit will be on
standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years. The credit will help to finantce a project designed to
(a) streamline and decentralize the organization ofagovernment agricultural services; (b) enhance the
role of the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources (MINAGRA) in policy making and
supervision of agricultural development; and (c) increase farmers' participation over the policy
making process. This will increase smallholders' incomes and food security, thereby contributing to
economic growth and reducing poverty.
2.    Background. Cote d'Ivoire is one of the principal countries in the CFA zone, with a
population of about 13 million and a GDP of US$ 9.2 billion in 1993. lTe cou-.;y has been in
recession since 1986 and faces a severe external debt problem. High population growth coupled with
economic decline has resulted in a steady fall of living standards. GNP per capita in 1992 was
estimated at less than US$700 compared to well over US$1000 in the early 1980s. Social indicators
have also been deteriorating, reflecting, among others, the effects of the economic crisis as well as
neglect of basic social services.
3.    Recent Economic Developments (1989-1993). Faced with an unsustainabNe economic
situation, the Government adopted a new stabilization and adjustment program in mid-1989. As one
of its principal measures, guaranteed producer prices for cocoa and coffee were halved which helped
eliminate the deficit of the Agricultural Stabilization Fund (CAISTAB), hence reducing the overall
fiscal deficit. While progress was achieved under this program during 1989-90, additional structural
reforms were deemed necessary for restoring international competitiveness and growth. Tnis led to
the design of a Medium-Term Economic Framework (MTF) for 1991-95, spelling out an internal
adjustment strategy which was supported by an IMF stand-by arrangement and three Bank adjustment
operations in the areas of finance, competitiveness/regulatory reform and human resource
development. Although the Government initially made progress in cutting the primary deficit in the
early 1990s, its failure to effect a real derreciation of the CFA franc with internal adjustment
measures and the continued high outlays for public salaries during 1990-93, resulted in the failure of
the MTF to materialize as planned. With the deepening of the recession in 1993, the primary deficit
rose again to 3 percent of GDP, and the Government's efforts to settle domestic and external arrears
faltered.
4.    The continuing fiscal and balance of payments problems revealed in part the limitatir s posed
by the internal adjustment strategy. When this strategy did not yield the anticipated economic turn-
around, policy slippage intensified. Delays in the implementation of the economic reforms were also
caused by institutional weaknesses, now being addressed through three IDA-financed technical
assistance projects. As a result of these macroeconomic difficulties, the economic decline observed
since 1986 was not halted and investment levels remained at a low 10 percent during the early 1990s.
Real GDP contracted by a cumulative 4 percent, and, on a per capita basis, by a cumulative 18
percent during 1990-93. Confronted witl a deteriorating economic situation, the Government
decided, together with its partner countries in the CFA zone, to complement the on-going internal
adjustment efforts with a realignment of the parity of the CFA franc to the equivalent of 100 CFAF to



1 FF. effective as of January 12, 1994. The Govermnent expects that - with the parity change and
the implementation of the accomparnying fliscal, monetary and structural adjustment policies - the
Ivorian economy will be able to maintain and strengthen its restored international competitiveness and
return to a sustainable growth path.
5.    Medium-Term Economic Pr.gram (19924-9. Following the CFA devaluation, the
Gosv rnment has spelled out a new stabilization and structural adiustment program for 1994-96 in a
Policy Framework Paper (PFP) which was discussed by the Committee of the Whole in March 1994.
The PFP aims at: (a) increasing real GDP growth to an annual rate of approximately 6 percent
beginning in 1995-96; (t) generating sustained and increasing primary budget surpluses; (c)
strengthening external competitiveness through trade, price, and regulatory reforms; and
(d) intensifying human resource development and increasing efforts to alleviate povexY. These
obje%tives have been translated into a broad-based adjustment program which includes: (a) a
comprehensive fiscal reform; (b) import tariff reform and elimination of non-tariff barriers; (c) further
price liberalization; (d) other reforms to stimulate private sector development and the country's
international competitiveness, including increasing labor market flexibility, introduzing a new
investment code, aid deregulating domestic and maritime transport; and (.) a broadening of social
measures. Budgetary discipline will be key to attaining these objectives. In a first move, the
Government introduced a series of tax measures in January 1994 and complemented them with othier
fiscal measures which have been incorporated in the rev;sed 1994 Budget Law. These measures
included a VAT reform, revision of petroleumn taxation, and the reduction of import tariffs.
Moreover, the Government has 5im;ted the civil service base wage increase in 1994 to a nominal 10
percent which translates into a substantial decline in the real wage bill. In line with the PFP, the
Government has identified measures to be implemented quickly that are critical to economic recovery.
These measures will be supported by a proposed IDA-fimanced Economic Recovery Credit (ERC),
and subsequent complementary reforms by a set of other sector adjustments operations, among which
a proposed IDA-financed Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit (ASAC).
6.    With the decision to complement internal adjustment measures with a devaluation of the CFA
franc, the Government is effectively addressing some of the main obstacles for renewed growth,
including the lack of international competitiveness and unsustainable fiscal and balance of payments
deficits. This historic change in policy direction augurs well for successfully implementation of the
reform programn. The recovery of the economy will be led primarily by the agricultural sector and
agro-industries. In this context, trade and price policies, as well as private sector development, rank
prominently on the Government's reform agenda. These policies are expected to stimulate the
demand for labor and, in this way, help contain the spread of poverty, especially in rural areas.
According to the PFP, a successful stabilization effort coupled with the envisaged structural measures
should result in sustained growth rates of as much as S to 6 percent per annum starring in 1995.
7.    Agriculture Sector. COte d'Ivoire's main growth potential remains the efficient and
sustainable use of its considerable agricultural resources and the development of industries and
services which supply agriculture or process agricultural raw materials for the domestic or export
markets. Between 1960 and 1980, the agricultural sector was the main engine of growth of the
Ivorian economy, with real value added in the sector increasing by nearly 4 percent p.a. This
performance was the result of a combination of favorable circumstances: abundant land; high
immigration of productive labor from neighboring countries; favorable international prices for the
country's main export crops; and a stable political environment. Most of this growth was obtained by
increasing the areas cropped and by shting the production mix towards more remunerative cash
crops such at - -ee, cocoa and cotton. This resulted in a gradual change in the structure of the
agricultural  - , with the share of export crops rising over the 1965-85 period from 35 percent to 45



- 3 -
percent of total GDP, while the share of food crops and livestock declined from 55 percent to 45
percent, and forest production -after rising to more than 10 percent - fell to 5 percent. At present,
COte d'Ivoire remains the first producer of cocoa in the world with 790,000 tons in 1992, the second
producer of robusta coffee with 190,000 tons after Ittdonesia, and the third African producer of cotton
with 194,000 tons. Thbe country has great potential for the rubber production for which it has the
highest yields in the world (total production was 72,000 tons in 1992). Except for rice and wheat,
the country is self-sufficient in food at present. With a medium- to long-term population growth
projected at 3.5 percent p.a., agricultural production will need to grow by at l dast 4.0 percent p.a. to
meet the countrv's domestic demand for food and raw material, and to sustain a growing flow of
exports.
8.    In spite of the importance of agricultural activities, for the most part, COte d'1voire's farming
is still at a basic level of technology and yields are far below potential. In the short-run, substantial
productivity increases can be achieved by the adoption by farmers of relatively simple low-input
improvements in husbandry practices. Adaptive research needs to develop technology packages that
quickly offer sufficient returns to appeal to farmers, i.e. practices which are cost-effective and raise
farmers' income at grassroots level. In the medium- to long-term, sustained productivity gains wiil
require the adoption of L steady flow of increasingly sophisticated technologies. This will require not
only improvement in technology generation/dissemination, with resulting needs in upgrading the
capacity of the country's research and extension systems, but also development of efficient input
supply systems, better availability of credit to finance new technologies, as well as the emergence of a
new class of farmers better educated and more open to progress.
9.    Project Cbjectives. The proposed project will be insirumental to support eontinued
implementation of the Government's policy to develop the rural economy, disengage from comnmercial
and prodtiction activities, and promote effective participation of beneficiaries in the definition,
financint, and implementation of agricultural services. Its main objectives will be to: (a) streamline
and decentralize the organization of agricultural services; (b) enhance the role of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Animal Resources (MINAGRA) in policy making and supervision of agricultural
development; and (c) increase farmers' participation over the policy making process.
10.   Project Strategy and Sone. The project will be implemented over a period of two years on a
national scale (PNASA Project). It will be the first phase of a five-year program (PNASA Program)
designed to support, through improved research and extension, the generation, dissemination and
adoption of environmentally sound technology required to sustain productivity gains in agriculture in
the long run. In line with the Government's overall civil service reform, the project's strategy will
be: (a) to ensure the delivery of basic agricultural services through the establishment of a National
Agricultural Services Agency (ANADER); this agency created in September 1993, has replaced three
former extension parastatals (SATMACI, CIDV and SODEPRA); it will be the Government's main
sub-contractc.r for extension, adaptive research and support to farmers' organizations; and (b) to
streamline and strengthen MINAGRA's regional directorates (DRAs) in each of the ten regions of the
country; DRAs' role will be refocussed on their public service mandate geared to establishment and
implementation of agricultural policies and regulations; as part of this mandate, they will be given
clear responsibilities and directions to assist in the development of private sector initiatives.



- 4 -
11.   PEtq   Description. In support of the above strategy, the proposed project will include the
following components:
(a)    Restructrin Process (US$8.3 million) (US$2 million by IDA) designed to: (i) revamnp
agricultural services through the merging of three existing crop-based parastatal extension
organizations into a single, multi-purpose and decentralized National Agricultural Services
Agency (ANADER) with management autonomy and strong representation of farmers;
ANADER was created by presidential decree of September 29, 1993 and has mixed society
status; and (ii) streamline MINAGRA's regional directorates (DRAs); this component is
financed under the PPF and will be completed before project effectiveness;
(b)    Qperating Support to ANADER (US$22.9 million) (US$12.2 million by IDA) geared to
assisting in all facets of ANADER's operations, including adaptive research to be su'u-
contracted to research institutes (IDESSA, IDEFOR and IRDT) and support to farmers'
organizations; this component will include extensive training activities to systematically
upgrade the skills of all ANADER's staft; the component represents Part A of the project;
and
(c)   Institution StreLn,thening (US$13.4 million) (US$7.6 million by I1DA) of MINAGRA (all
regional direcorates, and the central direct. ates of Administration/Finance and
Plaunirng/Programming), the Ministry of Scientific Resea. zh and Higher Education-MESRS
(Sub-Directorate of Adaptive Research) and the Ministry of Finance-MEPP (Sub-Directorate
of Audit Control), with a view to strengthening ministerial structures involved in the support
to agricultural services; support to MINAGRA will focus on policy-making and planning,
monitoring and --valuation, and human resources and financial management; MESRS will be
strengthened through support to adaptive research activities and MEFP through support to
audit control activities (this latter support will be provided in close liaison with the Economic
Management Project (CR. 2503-IVC)); this component represents Part B of the project.
12.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. The proposed project is central to the Government's strategy
to restore sustainable growth through deliverv of improved agricultural services and redefinition of the
Government's role in the agriculural sector. Implementation of this strategy has started in 1992 with
the streamlining of extension agencies and the reduction of their staff. The project's main thrust, i.e.
refocusing the Government's role on the provision of essential public services, empowering farmers
and improving their skills, and reducing civil service cost, is also at the core of the Bank's strategy to
foster efficiency and growth in the rural sector. Since 1986, the Bank has played a leading role in the
restructuring of Cte d'Ivoire's national agricultural services. Its continued involvement in the second
phas' of this restructuring process is essential to sustain the Governmert's commitment to difficult
and critical reforms and mobilize the support of other donors. A Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
has already been distributed, it will be discussed by the Executtive Directors in parallel with this
project. The CAS confirms the importance of the proposed project as part of the key role to be
played by the agricultural sector for the country's economic recovery.
1J.   Project Costs and Financing. Total estimated project costs over the two-year implementation
period, including all incremental capital and recurrent expenditures, are estimated at CFAF 25.9
billion (US$44.6 million), of which CFAF 9 billion (US$12.5 million) or 28 percent in foreign
exchange, and about CFAF 5.2 billion (US$9 million) or 19 percent in taxes and duties. IDA will
finance US$21.8 million; the Government, US$12.4 million; UNDP, US$0.7 million; CFD, US$5
million; AGCD, US$0.5 million; IFAD, US$1.9 million; and Afl)B, US$2.3 million.



- 5 -
14.      ject I. Following completion of the restructuring process carried out before
Credit effectiveness, the project will be implemented with the following tutelage arrangements: (a)
Part A under oversight of ANADER's Board of Directors and in consultation with Regional Advisory
Committees at regicnal level; and (b) Part B under oversight of MINAGRA, whose Minister chairs
the National Steering Committee in charge of overall coordination of activities under the PNASA
Program. Responsibility for daily implementation of Part A will rest with ANADER's Director
General at national level and with ANADER's branch managers at regional level. Responsibility for
daily implementation of Part B will be entrusted to the respective cabinet directors in the three
ministries concerned (MINAGRA, MESRS and MEFP). Overall coordination of activities for Part B
will rest with MINAGRA's Cabinet Director.
15.   Projct stainabilit. Decreased costs of support services, parallel e.Lpowerment of farmers'
organizations and increased generation of its own resources by ANADER through the sale of its
services will pave the way for long term financial sustainability of project actions. Capacity building
both within ANADER and DRAs will lay the basis for technical sustainability. Suppression of
duplications and elimination of redundant staff will reduce overall costs of agricultural services
delivery by about 25 percent. Total budgetary impact for MNAGRA will represent a 20 percent
reduction compared to the 1992 budget. The budgetary costs will continue to diminish to the extent
that ANADER increases its cost effectiveness and farmers' organizations gradually take over. In this
respect, one of the focal points will be the reduction of the ratios of field extension workers per
number of farm families. Sinmilarly, special emphasis will be put on strengthening farmers'
organizaions. These organizations will gradually take increasing control over agricultural servicee
and will therefore assume greater financial responsibility. One major thrust of tne project will be to
build up and rationalize management of human resoures at ANADER and DRAs. To dtis effect, the
project will provide for specialized short-term consultancies to help establish and implement adequate
personnel management procedures. The training program to be undertaken as part of the project will
be very comprehensive. It will concern all professional staff and touch upon all facets of the
technical expertise required to implement the project. This will ensure sustainability of project
operations through appropriate human resource capacity building.
16.   Lessons Learnt from Previous Bank Involvement. The proposed project is largely based on
the lessons learnt .mder the initial Agricultural Extension Project (PVA) implemented over the period
1986-1991. The project aimed to support both agricultural extension through three development
agencies (SATMACI, CIDV and CIDT), and adaptive research through two research institutes
(IDESSA and IRCC). The PVA has led to key lessons which were taken into consideration in
designing the present project. Overall, these lessons point to the need of: (a) establishing structured
work programs for agricultural extension activities, based on the Training and Visits (T&V) extension
management system; (b) strengthening linkages between research and extension; (c) providing
systematic training to extension staff; and (d) paying increased attention to farmers' needs.
Concerning financial and administrative management, the PVA lessons are: (a) improving financial
and logistic support to extension activities; (b) upgrading budget programming and accounting
procedures through computerized accounting systems; and (c) performing systematic auditing of
accounts. The PVA lessons finally illustrate the necessity to develop human resources through: (a)
strengthening the skills of the implementing agencies' trainers; (b) appointing and training Subject
Matter Specialists (SMSs), responsible for training of extension staff and strengthening research-
extension linkages; (c) providing continuous and systomatic training of all extension staff; and (d)
ensuring training of senior financial staff on procarement and disbursement procedures.
17.   Actions Agred. During negotiations assurances were obtained that: (a) the Agricultural
Services Policy Letter will serve as framework for project implementation; (b) part of the assets of



- 6 -
the former extension agencies necessary to ANADER's operations will be transferred to ANADER,
by December 31, 1994; (c) MINAGRA will prepare a feasibility study, jointly with ANADER and
CIDT, to assess the feasibility for CIDT to engage exclusively in the purcnase and processing of
cotton seed and the marketing of cotton fiber, by December 31, 1995; (d) regulations pertaining to
agricultural cooperatives will be revised as necessary to facilitate their establishment and operations,
by December 31, 1995; and (e) the Government will sign a financing agreement with ANADER to
make available part of the proceeds of the IDA credit to the latter. Conditions of Credit effectiveness
are that: (a) the staff of ANADER and MINAGRA's Regional Directorates have been formally
employed, and the remaining taff of former extensior. agencies have been either reassigned or
dismissed; (b) the Borrower has submitted drafts of bidding documents satisfactory to the Association
for the procurement of vehicles, goods and equipment and tie selection of consultants; (c) the
Borrower has opened two project accounts in local currency on behalf of ANADER and MIINAGRA,
and has deposited therein initial deposits in amount of CFAF 1.5 billion and CFAF 60 million
respectively; (d) the Financing Agreement has been executed, to pass on part of the proceeds of the
IDA credit on a grant basis from the Borrower to ANADER; (e) the Borrower has submitted a
detailed work progran (including a training program) satisfactory to the Association for the first year
of project implementation; (f) the Borrower has submitted detailed closing audit reports satisfactory to
the Association on SATMACI's, CIDV's and SODEPRA's accounts and operations as of March 31.
i994, satisfactoiy to the Association, (g) the Borrower has submitted ANADER's opening balance
sheet after its review and approval by MEFP; and (h) ANADER's Manual for Human Resource
Management Procedures has been completed in a form and substance satisfactory to the Association.
18.   Environmental Aspects. The only way to increase farmers' revenue, in the long term, is to
make agriculture more environmentally sustainable. The rapid degradation cf soil fertility in the
Savannah region and the increasing demographic pressure in the forest regibn forcce farmers to move
toward a more stable f- rm of agriculture, adopt techniques of improved fallow and effectively
integrate livestock and agriculture. Adoption of these themes, amongst others, will diminish farmers'
pressure on the rainforest, and will increase protection against soil degradation. One of ANADER's
main challenges will be to produae technical themes which constitate long term solutions to farmers'
constraints. To this end, the project will implement a systemic adaptive research process, based on
the household farm economy, and assuring effective research-farmers-extension linkages. Through
such an adaptive research process, the interface between agriculture. livestock and agro-forestry
activities will be one of the main sources of environmentally sustakx4ble technical messages.
19.   Poverg jiDact. The project will emphasize household food security and poverty reduction
among resource-poor farmers, many of whom are female, through increased productivity and
diversification of farming activities.
20.   Areas of Special Emphasis. The project will also promote an expanded role for the private
sector in agricultural services by contracting out research and training activities, and having farmers'
organizations participate effectively in ANADER's managemeni.
21.   Project Benefits. The project will improve agricui,ural productivity, thereby fostering
agricultural growth and improving rural incomes. It will gradually ensure access to improved
agricultural services for the entire population of rural producers, i.e. about 900,000 farm families.
This population comprises several of the poorest segments of the Ivorian population, including rural
women. The project will improve research-extension-farmers linkages, and make -esearch and
extension more demand driven and client oriented. It will ensure greater environmental sustainability
of agricultural practices. On another front, the project will redefine the role of the State and of the
private sector in agricultural development. The role of the State will be limited to policy definition,

monitoring of policy implementation and law enforcement. This will be accompanied by a complete
overhaul of the agricultural administrative and operatidnal support services including the dismissal of
about 3,340 redundant staff. These measures will result in a substantial of annual payroll and other
budgetary costs. The private sector, particularly through empowerment of farmers' organizations,
will gradually increase its control over the delivery of agricultural services and therefore assume
greater finacial responsibility for these services, which is expected to have a beneficial impact on
public finances in the long run.
22.     ika. The two major risks faced in implementing the project are: (a) the Government's
capacity to complete the ambitious restructuring program; and (b) the availability of counterpart
fiunds. A technical risk is the risk of low farmer adoption of the technical messages being extended.
The G3overnment has already given testimony of its resolve to streamline agricultural services through
the dismissal of redundant staff (about 2000) in existing extension parastatals. The creatior. of
ANADER decided by presidential decree of September 29, 1993 and parallel restructuration of
regional services by ministerial decree of March 28, 1994 further testifies to the Governmerit
commitment to fully complete the required restructuring process. To diminish the risks of the
restructuring exercise - arising, in particular, from staff selection and attendant staG disn.ssal (about
3,340 redundant staff dismissed) - the project will encouage, as much us possible, vowintary
departure and early retirement of staff. Dismissed staff will benefit from severance --iwances, in
accordance with Ivorian law, and will be assisted in tneir insertion into the labor market by a special
office (BIC) implemented parallel to the project. Completion of the entire restructuring process is
required for Credit effectiveness, so that the attendant risks will be moved upfront prior to the
operational phase of project implementation. The risk of lack of avaiiability of regular counterpart
funds is mitigated by the assurance obtained at negotiations that the Government will, before January
I of each year, earmark all necessary counterpart funds in National Budget and that, before the
beginning of each quarter, the counterpart funds will be deposited in the, project accounts. To fiuther
decrease this risk, other donors will be invited to earmark, for the project counterpart finds arising
from their balance of payments assistance. The risk of farmer low adoption of the technical messages
being extended will be mitigated, as these messages will be developed in collaboration with farmers
and will be designed so as to minimie amounts of purchased inputs.
23.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit will comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and i5commend that the Executive Directors approve it.

Portofolio Assessment
The portfolio has been affected for some time by C6te d'lvoire's overall economic and financial
difficulties. In particular, due to the absence of a viable medium-tem economic framework, the remaining
tranche of FY92 SECALs - totalling $250 million - have not yet been disbursed.  On the other hand, it has to
be recognized that goverrwnent has made major progress in meeting most specific tranche release conditions.
A country implementation review (CIR) took place in June 1993, during which generic implementation issues,
such as Lack of counterpart funds, audit, disbursement and procurement issues were discussed. Specific
corrective actions in most of those areas have been agreed upon which should help speed up disbursements.

0. Status of Bank Group Operations/Statements of Bank Loans and IVA Credits
Disbursements Status
Total disbursement in FY93 amounted to USS44 million, compared with US$259 milliorn in FY92. During FY92
Bank/IDA committed US$450 million in SECAL lending, of which USS200 mitlion in IDA resources were disbursed
in the same year. in FY93, due to the absence of an acceptable macro-economic framework, no disbursement
under the SECALs took place. As a result, the overall net transfers were substantially negative at USS191
million in FY93 against US$58 million in FY92. A comparison of the number of projects rated 3 and 4 shows a
slight deterioration (5 instead of 4 operations over two years). The overall status of the portfolio is
adequate, with the average overall rating showing a stight decline from 2.1 in FY92 to 2.2 in FY93. However
at the beginning of the third quarter of the current fiscal year (January 12, 1994), the Government took, in
close collaboration with the other Franc Zone countries, the decision to change the CFA parity. To assist in
ensuring the success of that important macroeconomic measure, which will contribute greatly to improve the
economy competitiveness, the Bank set up a first phase of assistance and expected to disburse about US$470
million by mid-FY95. In this respect, the second tranche of two of the SECALs (US$150 million) and half of a
reduction assistance (US$44 million) were disbursed on March/April, 1994.
Imclementation Status
The economic and budgetary crisis prevailing has been primarily reflected in the lack of counterparo funds
which is slowing down project implementation and disbursements. Compliance with audit recuirements has
improved, although oftentimes corrective actions recommended by the audit reports are implemented with a
time lag if at all. Disbursements have been suspended such as in the case of the IDF project, or the
Government was notified that closing will not be extended such as in the case of the urban It project.
Procurement is not a major issue in RCI although, in a number of cases, there have been substantial delays
because of misunderstandings as regards the compliance of RCI's procurement code with the Bank's guidelines.
Disbursements, are a matter of concern, as can be seen from the huge negative transfers. A major factor in
this regard is the fact that USs250 million of the remaining tranche of the three FY92 SECALs are still
undisbursed because of the absence of an acceptable macro-economic framework. But even with the investment
projects disbursement are extremely slow as demonstrated by the 58 percent disbursement tag when compared to
SAR forecasts.  Major improvements occurred in the area of special accounts: in response to our reminders,
the Goverrment has reimbursed the accounts of three IBRD loans with the balance of inactive special accounts
totaling US$4.8 million and has undertaken to provide the Bank with documentation that has resulted in the
recovery of a supplement US$2.5 million. The quality of the submitted withdrawal applications have improved
greatly over time
Actions Taken
Remedial actions were the result of the first CIR which took place in June 1993, others have preceded the
CIR. In order To institutionalize and follow-up the CIR, the RCI Goverrment established, by
Interministerial decree, a monitoring committee consisting of 10 members with representatives from the
Ministry of Finance and key sectoral ministries. The committee will meet on a monthly basis and associate
to its deliberations at least twice a year all project managers. Two items figure prominently on the
comnittee's agenda: procurement and disbursements. As regards Procurement, in preparation of the CIR, the
Direction des Marches Publics (DNP) of the Ministry of Finance, and the national tender board, prepared a
draft document which clearly presents the existing administrative rules, procedures and prerequisites. The
Bank has already commented upon the document. It is currently being reviewed by project managers. It is
hoped that, as a result of the above, the time required to complete the procurement cycle will be
substantially reduced, thus allowing for speedier project implementation. A similar exercise was organized
by the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA), the debt agency of the Ministry of Finance, as regards
disbursement procedures.  Here again, the emphasis is on ensuring a better understanding of the Government's
and the Bank's procedures and to reduce the turnaround time.
On the Bank's side, a RVPPA staff visited RCI twice: during a short mission in March 1993, he Ci) initiated
a review of RCI's new procurement code, and (ii) trained resident mission staff in the use of the Bank
standard procurement documents. In Jure 1993, he organized a procurement seminar for about 40 project and
DNP on the Bank standard procurement documents. In the context of the CIR, a disbursement seminar also took
place. In addition, the disbursement officer discussed with CAA in details the issue of special accounts
which had not been replenished for some time. Most of the outstanding special accounts have since been
regularized. On November/December 1993, a team of CAA spent about two weeks in LOAF staff in Washington and
familiarized themselves more with the Bank's disbursement procedures and organization. During almost the
same period, a high level Ivorian delegation visited Washington and discussed pending issues regarding
procurement and delays with the Bank.

As regards project restructurinr, one infrastructure operation has been the subject of a mid-term review
during FY93: the municipal development project (PQD). An ongoing urban sector review is building on project
results. As to PD0, the action plan aimed at improving project performance was presented by the Government
in June 1993. It was also considered unsatisfactory. This matter was raised with the Minister of Finance
during the Annual Meetings. The Minister requested that another Bank mission visit RCI in November 1993 to
reach final agreement on steps to be taken, short of which the undisbursed amount of US$38 million will be
totatly or partially canceled. The Ilinister of Finance informed the BSank during the Annual Meetings of the
recent estabLishment of an Interministeriat Committee for the Mobilization of External Resources. He
invi.ed the Bank to instruct missions confronting major issues to debrief him personaLly, and he conmitted
himsetf to undertake speedy action if and when their will be justified.  Concerning the PDN resi.ucturing,
two missions were launched respectively on November 1993 and March 1994, and have resulted in effective
proposats for restructure in depth the project, including the design of two new components which 3re aimed
at contributing to the alteviation of the increasing urban poverty alleviation. These proposals are
currently under process for Bank's endorsement and approval   In the context of the forthcoming Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) currentty scheduled to be presented to the Board in early 1994, the Bank wilt
evaluate ways to further improve project imptementation in RCI.
