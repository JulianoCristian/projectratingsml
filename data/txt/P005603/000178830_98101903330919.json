It will mainly consist of constructing\n            and reinforcing water transmission pipelines which will\n            connect existing distribution systems to ground-water\n            resources in the interior of the country. Seventy percent of\n            the project will benefit tourism areas. The internal rate of\n            return of the project is expected to be at least 11 percent;\n            in addition the project will reduce the danger of\n            water-borne diseases.
