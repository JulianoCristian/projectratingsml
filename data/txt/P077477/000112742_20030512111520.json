          Local Government Development Project for Uganda is to\n            improve local government institutional performance for\n            sustainable, decentralized service delivery. The project\n            consists of 5 components.  The first component will support\n            the decentralization process through: supporting the\n            development of a national Local Government (LG) capacity\n            building strategy; strengthening of the human resource\n            development functions in LGs; supporting annual workshops;\n            establishing an analytical and design basis for the\n            development of a decentralization budget support instrument;\n            supporting the national assessment system; operationalizing\n            the planning guidelines and information systems; auditing\n            the accounts of all LLGs for the first two years of the\n            Project; and finally activities supporting the improvement\n            of the LGs planning and implementation of projects which\n            will be funded by the local government development grant\n            (component 2).  The second component, local development\n            grants, will be funded by an IDA Grant (unlike the other\n            components which will come from a credit).  This component\n            will continue and extend the financing of local\n            infrastructure investment through supporting a system of\n            central-local intergovernmental transfers.  The third\n            component, local government capacity building will provide\n            capacity building grants to LGs.  The fourth component,\n            local government revenue enhancement, will finance technical\n            assistance at both the policy and operational levels.  The\n            final component, support to project implementation, consists\n            of activities to support project management, monitoring,\n            evaluation and audits of the accounts of the project."}, "docdt": "2003-05-02T00:00:00Z"}
