in Uganda were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Lessons learned\n            included:  a core of LGDP II focus was on the transfer,\n            monitoring and accounting for regular Local Development\n            Grants (LDG) and Capacity Building Grants (CBG) to local\n            governments. The grants were contingent on the local\n            governments passing an annual performance assessment. LGDP\n            II was designed to fund the two grants and annual\n            assessments for the first three years of the four year\n            project period. It was believed that if the two grants and\n            local government performance were indeed critical,\n            Government of Uganda (GoU) will begin funding and managing\n            them from its own resources. This materialized in the third\n            year of the project when GoU began funding both grants from\n            its own budget, included them in the Medium Term Expenditure\n            Framework (MTEF) and mainstreamed the annual assessment of\n            local governments through its own Inspectorate Department.\n            Building capacity requires much more than providing training\n            and conducting workshops: getting fiscal transfers right is\n            just one part of ensuring effective decentralization.\n            Building institutional and human capacity within central as\n            well as local governments is equally important and which\n            cannot be achieved by depending on training events and\n            workshops alone. LGDP II used multiple approaches including\n            active mentoring of local government staff by senior and\n            more experienced government personnel who provided hands on\n            support to their colleagues, ensuring standardization of\n            information flows through the preparation of handbooks and\n            guidelines with clear instructions on how to implement new\n            procedures, conducting regular assessments to provide follow\n            up guidance and feedback. Of course, training was required,\n            but instead of contracting out training, LGDP II was\n            instrumental in creating a national market for training\n            where the local governments procured training from a list of\n            accredited private and public training providers who had to\n            compete for it. As an unintended consequence, the\n            competitive training providers market has also led to the\n            creation of a growing local pool of consultants who now\n            understand and can respond to the needs of local governments."}, "docdt": "2008-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
