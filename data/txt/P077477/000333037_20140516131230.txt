About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
       To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank. org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives . Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) covers an operation implemented
over the period FY03-FY08. The project’s development objective was to improve the
Local Government institutional performance for sustainable, decentralized service
delivery.

The report presents findings based on review of the Program Documents, the
Implementation Completion and Results Reports, IEG’s Implementation Completion and
Results Report Review, aide-memoires and supervision reports, and other relevant
materials. Stefano Migliorisi visited Uganda for IEG on October 1 – 13, 2012 to
interview government officials, the staff of non-governmental organizations, project staff,
donor representatives, and other stakeholders. Additional interviews with Bank staff
members, donor representatives, and other informants were carried out at headquarters or
by conference call.

The assessment aims, first, to serve an accountability purpose by verifying whether the
operation achieved its intended outcomes. Second, the report draws lessons that are
intended to inform future operations of this nature in Uganda and other low-income
states.

Following standard IEG procedures, the report was shared with the government for
comment. The comments received are included as Annex F.

Summary
The objective of the Republic of Uganda’s Second Local Government Development Project
(LGDP II) was “to improve the Local Government institutional performance for sustainable,
decentralized service delivery.”
At the time of appraisal, the first phase of decentralization—with the establishment of an
enabling legislation, a conducive intergovernmental fiscal framework, and transfer of
competencies to Local Governments—was well under way, and there was a need to support the
central government and local authorities in its implementation. The focus on improved service
delivery, particularly for the poor, was an important step towards achieving the Millennium
Development goals on education, health, and access to water, given the predominant role of
Local Governments in this respect. Project design and implementation was informed by the Mid-
Term Review’s recommendations and the ICR findings and lessons learned from the previous
operation, LGDP I. In particular, LGDP II was designed as an instrument to mobilize broad grant
support to implement decentralization reform with a possible strong demonstration effect for the
future in terms of development partner coordination and harmonization.
Improved decentralized, sustainable service delivery would be achieved by (a) supporting
decentralization through appropriate strategies and institutions (Component 1); (b) strengthening
the capacity of Local Governments to provide better services, administer their resources, and
raise more revenues (Components 3 and 4); and (c) providing direct financial support to Local
Governments through non-sectoral conditional grants on a formula basis taking into account their
needs, capacity, accountability and performance (Component 2).
The project was approved on May 29, 2003, became effective on October 29, 2003 and closed on
December 31, 2007. The total costs at appraisal were US$165 million: US$125 million from
IDA (of which US$75 million as grant), US$15 million from the Netherlands, US$14.8 million
from Government and Local Authorities, US$7.5 million from Ireland, US$1.8 million from the
Danish International Development Assistance (DANIDA), and US$0.3 million from the Austrian
Development Corporation. Actual costs were US$181.7 million and the additional costs were
funded through the appreciation of the XDR against the US dollar, and increased contribution
from Government, mostly in the form of Local Development Grants.
The project was initially successful in building administrative capacity of Local Governments
and supported over 30,000 sub-projects in several sectors. However, such improved
administrative capacity has been underutilized due to substantial policy reversals since 2005.
Institutional performance of Local Government started to deteriorate from 2007, as shown by the
results of annual national assessments carried out by the Ministry of Local Government. The
2008 National Assessment, carried out immediately after project closing, showed that only 84
local governments out of the national total 1105 at the time earned rewards, while 931 were
penalized, due to declining quality of record keeping, meager revenue collection, weak
budgeting and planning, widespread use of force accounts against procurement regulations, and a
more general lack of interest in the national assessment itself.
The policy reversals started in 2005 have included near elimination of local revenue base,
reduction of transfers to Local Governments, increased percentage of conditional grants, and
creation of new districts, mostly for political patronage as shown by several studies on this
                                                      x


topic1. These reversals have been hindering service delivery and value for money, as noted in the
latest Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy, leading to a weakening of Local Governments’
discretionary powers, a centralization of functions and resources, and a reduction of available
financial and human resources at district level. Each new district increases the administrative
costs, takes away staff of existing ones and reduces resources available for service delivery,
creating a high administrative burden at the district level, with wages consuming a large and
increasing share of total expenditures, leaving insufficient funding for non-wage needs.
The combination of these factors has made the progress achieved under the project not
sustainable, and affected the quality of service delivery. As the project’s development objective
was to improve the Local Government institutional performance for sustainable, decentralized
service delivery, this Review concludes that the achievement of objectives was Modest. The
initial improvements in the institutional performance of Local Governments were not sustainable
and are currently at a high risk of being reversed due to the new Government of Uganda’s
attitude towards decentralization, although there have been some positive developments recently
like the moratorium on the creation of new districts decided by Cabinet in March 2013. Lack of
funds for operations and maintenance has subsequently led to the progressive erosion of the
initial improvements in quality of management, and infrastructure.
The project’s efficiency was nevertheless substantial. The sub-projects implemented under
LGDP II were more cost effective compared to those under the LGDP I, even if comparable in
size. Efficiency of sub-projects was relatively good, as the Value for Money Analysis, carried
out by an independent firm, rated the efficiency of the subprojects it analyzed as essentially
‘good’ on a three-point scale.
The relevance of objectives and the project’s efficiency were all substantial, while relevance of
design and efficacy were modest, and the project’s outcome moderately unsatisfactory. The
operation was aimed at supporting the building of capacity at Local Governments and the
establishment of appropriate strategies for decentralization. These enhancements, combined with
direct financial support for investments in social infrastructure through sub-projects, led to a
visible improvement in basic service delivery. However, the GOU policy reversals, during and
after the life of the project, made such results unsustainable in the medium term.
The monitoring framework was sophisticated and included a dedicated Information and
Communications System (LOGICS), designed and piloted during previous project; a financial
information module (LOGICS Plus) allowing Local Governments to report on expenditures and
revenues; annual Local Government performance assessments carried out by a team consisting
of officials from the Ministry of Local Government, sector ministries and a private contractor for
quality assurance; and a "Value for money" audit. However, the M&E design did not adequately
address the multiplicity of monitoring systems, and did not include a systematic beneficiary
feedback loop.
There is a high risk to the limited institutional outcomes achieved. Political commitment has
declined over time, leading to substantial policy reversals from 2005 onwards. It is likely that the
current trend to centralize functions and increase the number of districts, as new ones are
currently being considered, will over time reduce the progress made in building capacity and
accountability of Local Governments.

Bank’s performance was moderately satisfactory. The design of the project was aligned with the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS),
and remains relevant to the latest CAS, and, to a lesser extent, to the latest Government’s
National Development Plan. Project design drew on lessons from LGDP I (i. e. , more
commitment to sustainability of investments, efficiency in utilization of the capacity building
grants and the broadening of Local Government own revenue sources and collection methods),
as well as from the Bank’s and other donors in Uganda and neighboring countries. The design
also draws appropriately on the Bank’s Analytical and Advisory Assistance. The Bank selected
an appropriate instrument, which was part of a long history of support to decentralization dating
back for at least a decade. However, the Bank did not properly react to the GOU policy reversals
that led to a growth in unconditional grants not consistent with the Ugandan Constitution.
Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. The Government’s performance in
particular was unsatisfactory. Prior to the introduction of a multi-party system in 2005, the GOU
had shown strong commitment to decentralization and the project. However, since 2005,
commitment has been declining, leading to a substantial reduction in Local Governments’
mandates, funding, and autonomy. The performance of the Ministry of Local Government was
instead satisfactory, as it led the process of reform and tried to adapt to an increasingly
challenging environment.
The lessons from this operation are that:

      Policy reversals can cause serious damage to otherwise significant project outcomes, and
       are difficult to counter. District proliferation or reduction in un-earmarked funding or
       Local Governments’ rights to raise revenues need to be monitored closely as they could
       be an early signal of policy reversal.
      Monitoring should be focused on outcome in addition to process indicators and unified
       across sectors.
      Decentralization is not a sector, while it was treated as such in Uganda with a Sector
       Working Group, a Sector Investment Plan and specific donor support. Decentralization of
       service delivery affects all sectors of the economy and should be supported in a
       harmonized way across sectors and donor programs.
      Many conditional grants to Local Governments are funded through donor programs. A
       fully decentralized sector allocation, supported through government budgets, requires a
       change in the way donors allocate funds across sectors within a given country as such
       allocations cannot be determined a priori any more if the choice of sectors is truly
       delegated to Local Governments and communities. This is often incompatible with the
       development cooperation frameworks of bilateral donors, or the sector-specific teams and
       earmarked funds of multilaterals, that work in tandem with line ministries in developing
       countries like Uganda.

1. Background and Context
1.1     Uganda was one of the first countries in Africa to embark on decentralization. When
the project was designed, Uganda had already ‘one of the most far-reaching Local Government
reform programs in the developing world’ (Francis and James 2003:325), as detailed in Annex
B. Such program went through two distinct phases as discussed below.

1.2     Phase 1 - Establishment of an enabling legislation, a conducive intergovernmental
fiscal framework, and transfer of competencies to Local Governments (1993-2004). In 1992,
decentralization was formally launched through the decentralization policy pronouncement. This
was followed by Constitutional Reform (1995), and the promulgation of the Local Government
Act (1997). Local Governments were given responsibilities, inter alia, for primary education,
agriculture, water, sanitation, primary health care, and district and feeder roads, and a system of
conditional as well as unconditional government grants was put in place. Development partners
assisted the central government in establishing a strong legal and fiscal framework, and
supported Local Governments in the provision of essential services falling under their new
mandate.

1.3     During this phase, the Bank provided support through the Institutional Capacity Building
Project - ICBP (1995-2002), the District Health Project (1995-2002) and LGDP I (1999-2004).
The Bank in particular supported the Government of Uganda in establishing a more conducive
legal and institutional framework and in experimenting with more discretion over expenditure at
Local Government level and a more rational grant allocation system. Other development partners
(DANIDA, UNDP) provided support on similar decentralization issues during the same period.

1.4     When the project was designed (2002-2003), the Government had just started
implementing its 2002 Fiscal Decentralization Strategy (FDS) which aimed at addressing the
challenges within the existing inter-governmental fiscal transfer system and revenue
mobilization. It had also established by Act of Parliament the Local Government Finance
Commission (LGFC) to advise Government on fiscal decentralization issues, and launched a new
Local Government capacity building framework. The Bank seized the opportunity provided by
this technical entry point, and offered support for its implementation through the project.

1.5     As stated in the Project Appraisal Document-PAD (World Bank 2003a: 6), “through the
FDS, the Government has made the strategic choice to mainstream the LGDP approach to fiscal
decentralization, emphasizing improvement in decentralization of public service delivery through
greater autonomy and downward accountability of Local Governments. LGDP II directly
supports this strategic choice of Government. ” The FDS itself was considered by the Bank
(World Bank 2003a:12) as “the strongest indicator of the Government’s commitment and
ownership. ” During the project, the GoU was supposed to evaluate its pilot phase of the FDS
and mainstream the resulting approach to all Local Governments, with follow-on support from
the Bank through a future decentralization Poverty Reduction Support Credit -PRSC
immediately after the closing of the project (World Bank 2003a: 10).

1.6   When FDS was approved, Local Government grants were above 30 percent of public
expenditure. Support was mainly in the form of conditional grants (68 percent of the total) whose
number had grown to 21 since the establishment of the Poverty Action Fund in 1998. As stated
                                                2


in LGFC (2012), “the key concern, in 2002, was the impact of this growth in conditional grants
on local governance and development, local service delivery and sustainable implementation of
the poverty alleviations commitments under the Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP). Local
governments were experiencing a build-up of administrative costs arising from multiple
procedures, bank accounts and lines of reporting due to the increasing number of conditional
grants. ”

1.7    Phase 2- Transition to a multi-party system, recentralization and proliferation of
Local Governments (2005-2012). In 2005, Uganda adopted a multi-party system, calling
national and local elections for 2006. As noted in World Bank (2010), there have been
substantial policy reversals since 2005 that are hindering service delivery and value for money,
including near elimination of local revenue base, reduction of transfers to Local Governments,
increased percentage of conditional grants, and creation of new districts. Five trends emerged, as
discussed below.

1.8     The first trend was a proliferation of Local Governments. The number of districts, the
basic unit of Local Government in Uganda, has almost doubled over the last ten years (from 56
in 2000 to 111 in 2011). A commission of inquiry in 1987 had recommended a reduction of the
then 37 districts, as many were financially unviable. On the contrary, new districts were created
in 1994, 1997, 2000, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010. By the time the project was designed, the
number of districts had grown to 56 and when it closed there were already 80 districts. The total
number of districts reached 111 in 2010, while the total Local Governments and administrative
units grew from 50,800 in 2004 to 74,800 in 2011, an increase close to 50 percent.

1.9     According to Green (2008), most new districts were not created along ethnic or party
lines. New districts were mostly used as a patronage tool, as they allowed the creation of new
Parliamentary seats, and Local Government posts, each representing a patronage opportunity.
“The creation of the districts did not follow any established parameters, neither was the process
informed by administrative necessity or economic rationale. Instead, the President announced
their creation via presidential decrees, often to reward politicians threatening to withdraw
support for the NRM, or to punish those who had. ” (ARD 2005: 41). Oloka-Onyango (2007)
remarks that “the strategy of district proliferation has been adopted by President Museveni as a
means of dispensing patronage, and ultimately of splintering challenges to the central
government hegemony and control ”

1.10 The second trend was a progressive recentralization of competencies and key
appointments. Centralization of some functions and the reduction of discretion at local level
were used to sterilize the effects of district proliferation, preventing the emergence of local
politicians who could challenge the ruling elite. For example, since 2005, District Chief
Administrative Officers have been appointed by central government instead of district service
commissions with the aim of removing them from “pressure exerted by local politicians”. The
2010 Kampala City Bill placed Kampala under the administrative authority of the Central
Government who appoints its executive director. Universal Secondary Education (USE) in
Uganda was introduced in 2007 as a centrally managed service. In 2009, drug procurement was
also centralized to "fight corruption." Finally, resource allocation for feeder roads has been
managed by the central Uganda Road Fund since 2010.
                                                          3


1.11 The third was a progressive reduction of own revenues for Local Governments. In
2005 the Graduated Tax or G-Tax, the predominant source of local revenue, was suspended in
the run up to 2006 national and local elections, as its abolition was proposed by opposition and
government parties as part of their manifestos. The Graduated Tax provided Local Governments
with 5 percent of their total revenues, was important for discretionary expenditures and has never
been adequately replaced, as all taxes account now for less than 5 percent of Local Governments’
revenues2 whose collection is estimated to be at less than half of its potential (LGFC:2012).
Local governments have become increasingly dependent on non-discretionary central
government transfers, reducing accountability to local citizens.

1.12 The fourth trend was a decline in transfers from central to Local Governments, in
relative and per capita terms. Transfers from central government to Local Governments fell
from 4. 9 percent of GNI and 33 percent of public expenditure in FY01 to 3. 9 percent of GNI
and 19 percent of public expenditure in FY10. The latest PER (World Bank: 2013, p. 20) found
that transfers to local governments continued to decline as a share of central government
revenues and expenditures in FY11 and FY12. In FY12, Local Governments spent almost 60
percent of their resources on non-discretionary expenditures like wages and salaries. In
particular, unconditional and non-wage recurrent conditional grants, both of which are critical to
routine supervision, oversight and management of services, declined in real terms over the period
FY01-FY11 (see LGFC: 2012, p. 24). As discussed in the 2013 PER (World Bank:2013, p. 22),
real per capita recurrent budgets of Local Governments have trended downwards since FY04
from a peak of USh 49,213 to USh 38,838 in FY12 (2011/12 shillings, GDP deflated),
representing a drop of about 21 percent.

1.13 The growth in unconditional grants has not been consistent with the Constitutional
provision (Seventh schedule) requiring that “for a given fiscal year the unconditional grant shall
be equal to the amount paid to local governments in the preceding fiscal year for the same items
adjusted for general price changes plus or minus the budgeted cost of running added or
subtracted services”. If the constitutional formula had been followed, the allocation would have
been at least one third higher in FY10, according to estimates by the Local Government Finance
Commission.

1.14 The fifth trend was an increase in earmarking of funds provided by donors and
government. Tied sector conditional grants have increased as a percentage of total grants, from
72 percent in FY97 to over 86 percent in FY11 and a projected 88 percent in FY12, making it
difficult for Local Governments to plan for and respond to local demand and needs. Donors
contributed to the increase of conditional grants by increasing sector funding. Conditional grants
were first introduced in the late 1990’s through the Poverty Action Fund, growing steadily to 26
in 2002 and 38 today, each with its own formula, and eligibility rules, as discussed in Annex B.
In 2005, after the launch of the Local Government Sector Investment Plan (LoGSIP), donors

  See: (1) LGFC:2012, p. 6. “LG own source revenues have plummeted to below 3% contribution to district budgets
following the scrapping of graduate tax in the 2005/06 FY.” (2) Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic
Development, Background to the Budget FY2012/13, Consolidated Local Government Financial Operations6,
2005/06 - 2009/10 (billion shillings), page A:37. (3) World Bank:2013, p. 8:” In the early years of decentralization,
own-source revenues accounted for 8 to 10 percent of total local government revenues, whereas in recent years this
figure has dipped to 5 percent or less.”
                                                4


established a common basket fund to support LoGSIP, while in other sectors (e. g. , Education)
vertical planning tools were established, reducing Local Governments’ discretionary powers.

2. Objectives, Design, and Relevance
Objectives
2.1    The PAD identified the objective of the Second Local Government Development Project
(LGDP II) as “to improve the Local Government institutional performance for sustainable,
decentralized service delivery” (World Bank, 2003a: 2). The formulation of objectives in the
Development Financing Agreement (DFA) was identical (World Bank, 2003b: 24).

2.2     The project targeted both higher Local Governments (District Councils) and lower Local
Governments (Municipalities, Sub-counties, and Town Councils). The PAD (World Bank,
2003a: 19) clarified that the final goal was “sustainable and decentralized service delivery
resulting from improved LG institutional performance”, with the latter being means to an end.
Performance is defined as fiscal performance (as measured by the percentage of own revenues
over total revenues), and budget performance, both in terms of mid-term planning (measured
through the use of three-year rolling Development Plans), and reporting (measured as timely
submission of accounts to the Auditor General’s Office).

2.3    The development objective was not revised over the life of the project.

Relevance of Objectives
2.4     The relevance of objectives was substantial. At the time of appraisal, the first phase of
decentralization, with the establishment of an enabling legislation, a conducive
intergovernmental fiscal framework, and transfer of competencies to Local Governments, was
well under way, and there was a need to support the central government and local authorities in
its implementation. The focus on improved service delivery, particularly for the poor, was an
important step towards achieving the millennium development goals on education, health, and
access to water, given the predominant role of Local Governments in this respect. The project
was therefore highly relevant and its objectives reflected the Government’s ones spelled out in
the Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) 2004/5 – 2007/8, namely ensuring good
governance, including improvement in public service delivery and decentralization.

2.5     These objectives are less consistent with the Government’s National Development Plan-
NDP 2010/11-2014/15 (launched in 2010), whose theme is “Growth, Employment and Socio-
Economic Transformation for Prosperity”. This theme has eight objectives, including three that
were addressed by the project: improving stock and quality of economic infrastructure,
increasing access to quality social services, and strengthening good governance, defense and
security. However, the new NDP is focusing on the final outcome (improved service delivery)
giving much less emphasis to strengthening decentralization per se (e. g., the word
“decentralization” was mentioned 21 times in PEAP and only twice in NDP). Finally, the
project’s objectives are consistent with the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy FY2011 -2015
whose second objective is to enhance public infrastructure (including roads, water and sanitation,
                                                       5


and delivery of urban services), and third objective is to promote human capital development
through improved access to and quality of education, and strengthened health care delivery.

2.6     However, the GOU de facto policy reversals have not influenced in any way the Ugandan
Local Governments’ responsibilities in service delivery, enshrined in the Constitution. The
Ugandan Constitution (Art 189, 3) in fact states that “district councils shall have responsibility
for any functions and services not specified in the Sixth Schedule to this Constitution. ” Based on
the Constitution, Uganda Local Governments are responsible for primary education, agriculture,
water, sanitation, primary health care, and district and feeder roads. As noted in the Bank’s latest
CAS (World Bank 2010:6), “basic social services are delivered by Local Governments; thus,
weaknesses in decentralization affect service delivery. ”

Design
2.7          The project had the following five components:

          Component 1: Support for the Decentralization Process (appraisal estimate US$23. 8
           million, actual cost US$33. 6 million). This component supported the following sub-
           activities: (i) Fiscal Decentralization Strategy (FDS) implementation and tools to support
           decentralization of the development budget; (ii) institutional structure surrounding
           decentralization; (iii) sector issues related to decentralization, (iv) formulating and
           implementing a national Local Government capacity building strategy; (v) strengthening
           Local Government human resource development function, (vi) audit of the accounts of
           lower Local Governments (LLGs)3; (vii) procurement capacity building at the higher
           Local Government (HLG)4, and (viii) local financial management.

          Component 2: Local Development Service Delivery (appraisal estimate US$107. 5
           million, actual cost US$118. 8 million). This component comprised a non-sectoral
           conditional grant (the Local Development Grant - LDG) distributed on a formula basis to
           all local authorities in Uganda for investment in local infrastructure in accordance with
           local needs as determined through local planning and budgeting processes. Access to
           such funding was determined by capacity, accountability, and performance
           conditionalities which were designed to incentivize improvements in sustainable service
           delivery at the local level.

          Component 3: Local Government Capacity Building (appraisal estimate US$15
           million, actual cost US$14. 7 million). This component provided capacity building grants
           to Local Governments aimed at increasing the quality of training and to help establish a
           national system of standardized training modules recognized by all stakeholders.

          Component 4: Local Government Revenue Enhancement (appraisal estimate US$11.
           9 million, actual cost US$8. 1 million). This component provided support to enhance the
           capacity of Local Governments to administer their own sources of revenue in order to

3
    Municipalities, Sub-counties, and Town Councils.
4
    District Councils.
                                                 6


       achieve and sustain acceptable levels of service delivery. It had five sub-components
       namely: (i) strengthening local revenue policies and legislation, (ii) training of politicians
       and officials, (iii) strengthening local revenue systems, (iv) extension of property tax
       system, and (v) monitoring Local Government revenues.

      Component 5: Support to Project Implementation (appraisal estimate US$6. 8
       million, actual cost US$6. 5 million). This component supported the overall coordination,
       implementation, monitoring and evaluation and auditing of the project.

2.8     The project focused on financial and fiscal management priorities, but tried also to ensure
a balanced sector distribution of investments, by assessing performance through an 85 percent
minimum threshold for investments in Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) focal areas.
Sector specific grants (outside the project) remained the predominant form of Local Government
funding, affecting the discretion of Local Governments and their horizontal accountability.

2.9     Capacity building grants were linked to a pre-set menu of training activities, for non-
sectoral generic training and skills development, and tried to ensure that sufficient resources
were spent to train sub-county staff. There was no link between the transfer of financial
resources and the role realignment of central ministries or the transfer of their staff to Local
Governments. The project legitimately excluded any effort to build sectoral capacity at the local
level. The project focused instead on non-sectoral development and capacity building grants.

2.10   The components were not revised over the life of the project.

Relevance of Design
2.11 The relevance of design was modest. The project had a relatively weak Results
Framework. While the causal chain between inputs (e. g. , technical assistance, training,
unconditional and capacity building grants), and outputs (e. g. , improved Local Government
capacity, improved social infrastructure) was clear, the outcomes identified were mostly process
related (e. g. Local Governments with 3-year rolling plans, final accounts submitted on time to
the Auditor General), and referred to outputs rather than to the project’s PDO (e. g. , improved
Local Government institutional performance for sustainable decentralized service delivery). At
the same time, the demand-driven nature of sub-projects did not allow the definition of credible
service delivery indicators at the appraisal stage.

Design of Monitoring and Evaluation
2.12 The monitoring framework was very sophisticated and captured well all data concerning
the project including those relating to improved service delivery at the local level. The
monitoring framework included: (a) the Local Government Information and Communications
System (LOGICS) which was designed and piloted during the previous project; (b) LOGICS
Plus, a financial information module which allowed Local Governments to report on
expenditures and revenues; (c) annual Local Government performance assessments carried out
by a team consisting of officials from the Ministry of Local Government, sector ministries and a
private contractor for quality assurance; and (d) a "Value for money" audit. The lack of a
systematic feedback loop from beneficiaries was a weakness in the M&E design. Feedback from
                                                        7


beneficiaries was in fact introduced late in the project through a survey to assess Beneficiary
Participation and Accountability under LGDP II and to inform the follow-on project.

3. Implementation
3.1     The project was approved on May 29, 2003, became effective on October 29, 2003, and
had its mid-term review in June 2005. LGDP II's initial closing date of June 30, 2007 was
extended once, to December 31, 2007, mainly because of the long-standing constitutional
requirement of obtaining parliamentary approval for any new credit.

3.2     Project’s costs and funding are summarized in Table 1 below. Project costs were 10
percent higher than planned, and the extra costs were funded through an appreciation of the XDR
versus the US dollar, which increase the US dollar value of the IDA credit denominated in
XDRs, and a contribution from Government, mostly in the form of local development grants,
that was 44 percent higher than planned. The total costs at appraisal were US$165 million:
US$125 million from IDA (of which US$75 million as grant), US$15 million from the
Netherlands, US$14. 8 million from Government and Local Authorities, US$7. 5 million from
Ireland, US$1. 8 million from the Danish International Development Assistance–DANIDA, and
US$0. 3 million from the Austria Development Corporation. Actual costs were US$181. 7
million, of which US$135. 21 million were provided by IDA, US$21. 33 million by Government
and Local Authorities, US$15 million by the Netherlands, US$7. 5 million by Ireland, US$2. 4
million by DANIDA, and US$0. 3 million by Austria.

3.3    Implementation was negatively affected by the reduction in the discretionary powers of
Local Governments, their weakened ability to collect local taxes and user fees, and the
                                                            8


proliferation of districts. Transfers to Local Governments (see Figure 1) and unconditional
grants per capita, and as a share of public expenditures and GNI, declined over time while local
revenues were being reduced. Almost all allocation decisions were made at the center and the
improved planning capacity of Local Governments could therefore be used only in a limited
way. The proliferation of districts, carried out by splitting existing districts into smaller units due
mostly to political patronage, had the dual effect of reducing capacity in these districts, and
increasing costs, as each new district would add capital and operating costs and take staff away
from existing ones. The pool of unconditional grants declined as a share of total grants from 32
percent in FY01 to 10. 5 percent in FY11 and to less than 5 percent in FY13, according to the
latest Public Expenditure Review (World Bank: 2013), and had to be divided among a greater
number of districts, making the funds available to reward performance relatively less significant
over time, while non-wage recurrent conditional grants declined in real terms over the period
FY01-FY11. New districts were initially dramatically understaffed with often less than 10
percent of strategic posts filled (Table 9 in Annex B).

3.4      The effect of the splitting of districts on the sustainability of decentralization is well
exemplified by the case of Bushenyi, one of the best performing districts in Uganda, with
chairmen from NRM both before and after the splitting (see Annex B, Table 9). Before Bushenyi
was split into five separate districts in 2010, the district had a population of 723,427 receiving
government grants of UGX 42,621 per capita, and was 10th in the FY09 Health District League
and 11th in the FY08 Education District League (out of 80 districts) with 91percent of strategic
posts filled. The splitting of the district into five in 2010 led to a reduction of per capita grants
even in nominal terms for 80 percent of the combined population of the five new districts, a
reduction of staffing to 81 percent for what remained as Bushenyi and to 8 percent for the other
four districts. While Bushenyi itself improved its FY11 Health District League position from 10th
to 2nd, the remaining four new districts fell to 61st, 68th, 93rd, and 104th position out of 112
districts, notwithstanding their sanitation rank well above the national average.

3.5     M&E Implementation included: (a) monitoring of sub-project performance that
allowed a comparison of sub-projects implemented under LGDP I and LGDP II; (b) data
collection on physical benefits achieved in the three key services of health, education and water;
(c) a Communities Beneficiaries’ Assessment carried out by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics
(UBoS) with a quantitative module covering a sample of 1,500 Households from 150
communities, and a qualitative one covering key informant interviews with 30 higher Local
Governments, 30 lower Local Governments, 30 private firms and 30 civil society organizations
selected randomly from within the quantitative sample; and (d) a Value for Money (VFM)
Analysis, covering a sample of 1,083 sub-projects out of the total of 8,204 subprojects financed
under the project.

3.6     Fiduciary Issues. There were no financial management or procurement issues during the
project’s implementation. The project contributed to a substantial enhancement of financial
management and procurement capacity in Local Governments.

3.7    Safeguards Compliance. The project had an environmental category of B (partial
assessment) which required the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and Social
Management Framework (ESMF). The ICR (World Bank 2008:15) found that Local
Governments followed adequate environmental screening, but did not make adequate provisions
for implementing environmental mitigation measures during sub-project preparation. MoLG
guidelines now require Local Governments to include funding for environmental mitigation
measures in implementation contracts. The project established an environment and natural
resource (ENR) management checklists for Local Governments and trained technical staff of
higher Local Government in ENR management.

4. Achievement of the Objectives
4.1    The achievement of objectives will be measured first by considering achievement of
PDOs, and then by considering additional evidence. The logic of the intervention was relatively
simple. Improved decentralized, sustainable service delivery would be achieved by

         Supporting appropriate strategies and institutions for decentralization (Component 1) and
          strengthening the capacity of Local Governments to provide better services, administer
          their resources, and raise more revenues (Components 3 and 4); and
         providing direct financial support to Local Governments through non-sectoral conditional
          grants on a formula basis (see Annex B for details) taking into account their needs,
          capacity, accountability and performance (Component 2)

Improve Local Government institutional performance
OUTPUTS

4.2       The project’s support for the Decentralization Process achieved several outputs.

         A Harmonized Participatory Planning Guide (HPPG) was provided to all levels of Local
          Governments (56 districts, 13 municipalities and all lower Local Governments).
                                                        10


         An Urban Planning Guide was printed and distributed to 93 districts and 96 urban
          councils and a total of 189 (95 percent) of district and urban council officials were trained
          in the use of the guide.
         The project supported the preparation of the principles for the revision of the Town and
          Country Planning Act.
         Local Government Public Procurement and Disposal of Assets Regulations were
          developed, published and distributed to all Local Governments.
         370 Local Government technical staff (Chief Administrative Officers, Chief Finance
          Officers, and heads of departments) and 314 members of higher Local Government
          contracts committees were trained.
         A national Local Government assessment manual was developed, published, distributed
          and explained to all Local Government staff; and annual assessments were carried out
          with feedback to Local Governments.
         Three joint annual reviews of decentralization (JARD) were carried out leading to the
          development of the Decentralization Policy Strategic Framework (DPSF) - a one stop
          reference document on Uganda decentralization policy and a ten year Local Government
          Sector Investment Plan (LoGSIP).
         A total of 896 lower Local Governments were audited for FY2002/3 and FY2003/4.
         A national Local Government capacity building strategy was developed, published and
          launched.
         32 standardized generic training modules (GTM) were developed, published and
          distributed to all Local Governments and private training providers.
         A total of 260,089 participants5 were trained under the project. The most relevant training
          topics were: (i) investment appraisal and project planning (19,853 participants); (ii)
          management and leadership skills (16,167 participants); (iii) development planning
          (12,896 participants); (iv) participatory planning (12,611 participants); (v) gender
          mainstreaming (12,621 participants); and (vi) financial management (10,734
          participants).
         District/Municipal resource pool (D/MRP) teams were institutionalized and became
          operational in all district/municipal Local Governments to assist technical planning
          committees (TPCs).
         Over 100 private training service providers for Local Governments were registered by
          MoLG and oriented to decentralization and training of Ugandan Local Governments in
          various fields.

4.3       In addition, the project provided support for revenue raising capacity.

         All higher Local Governments (districts and municipalities) and Town councils prepared
          and implemented annual local revenue enhancement plans.
         Trade licensing reform to simplify and shorten the trade licensing procedure was rolled-
          out to 10 Local Governments.
         A draft Business and Levies Bill was produced to rationalize, consolidate and repeal the
          existing six business and levies acts (trading licensing act, markets act; shoppers act,
5
 Local Governments’ staff (137,609 participants), councilors (63,288 participants), private sector (4,620
participants), CSOs (3,238 participants), women and youth (2,654 participants) and farmers (2,519 participants).

        liquor licensing act, enguli licensing act, and sugar sell act) into one simplified act which
        would promote business start-ups, growth and revenue generation.
       734 Local Government officials were trained in local revenue enhancement and
        sensitized about the constitutional mandate and civic duties for citizens to pay taxes.
       A revenue handbook and a cost/benefit assessment tool were prepared to assist Local
        Governments in appraising local revenue enhancement opportunities
       Seed capital for local revenue enhancement was provided to 170 Local Governments (74
        districts, 13 municipalities and 83 towns).
       25 technical staff from weaker Local Governments were twined with strong Local
        Governments’ staff in revenue generation to have peer-to-peer learning on revenue
        mobilization.
       The Local Government (Rating) Act 2005; Local Government (Rating) Regulations,
        2006; a Property Rating Handbook, and a training module for property rates were
        produced and published.
       Officials from 92 urban councils and 13 municipalities were trained in property rates
        taxation.
       UGX 3. 8 billion were used to assist 60 districts, 13 municipalities and 85 towns to carry
        out valuation of properties and update or develop new valuation rolls which would be
        valid for 5 years after approval.

OUTCOMES

4.4     Supporting appropriate strategies and institutions for decentralization. Given the
numerous reversals since 2005, this outcome was not fully achieved, as key elements of the
Fiscal Decentralization Strategy were not implemented6. By the end of LGDP II (December
2007), the project had financed the first three Joint Annual Reviews of Decentralization which
have resulted in a number of policy reforms - revision of the Local Government Act, the Local
Government Finance and Accounting Regulation, the Town and Country Planning Act, and the
Local Government (Rating) Act). Also, these annual reviews led to the establishment of a
Decentralization Sector Working Group and the development partners pooling their resources
into a basket to support the implementation of the Local Government Sector Investment Plan. A
Local Government Capacity Building Policy Committee chaired by the Ministry of Local
Government was established to guide the process of Local Government capacity building. The
Ministry of Local Government established an in-house Capacity Building Unit aimed at
providing support to all Local Governments in the formulation of their own Capacity Building
Needs Assessments and Capacity Building Plans. However, as discussed later in this section, the
Fiscal Decentralization Strategy, supported under component 1, was not successful.

4.5     Strengthening the capacity of Local Governments to provide better services,
administer their resources, and raise more revenues. The capacity of Local Governments to
better administer their resources was marginally improved, while the capacity to raise more
revenues weakened, due to changes in legislation. Their capacity to provide better services was
instead legitimately not addressed by the project as its capacity building was non-sectoral by

 The first sub-component of Component 1 focused on the “Support to the FDS Implementation and Tools to
Support Decentralization of the Development Budget.”

design. By the end of the project (December 2007), all higher Local Governments had good
quality three year development plans linked to the budget, even though the improvements
achieved up to 2006 started to deteriorate during the last year of the project, due to the policy
reversals started in 2005, including the abolition of two major sources of revenue for Local
Government (i. e. , Graduated Tax and Rates by owner-occupiers). Without the introduction by
law of a new source of revenue to replace the Graduated Tax, the support provided by the project
through the revenue handbook and related training could not achieve tangible results.

4.6     The annual national assessment of Local Governments - with an inbuilt incentives and
sanctions mechanism - analyzed the level of compliance of Local Governments with laws and
regulations governing their operations. After improving up to 2006, when several policies were
reversed as discussed earlier, Local Governments’ performance deteriorated dramatically in 2007
and 2008 (the LGDP project closed at the end of 2007), due to declining quality of record
keeping, meager revenue collection, weak budgeting and planning, widespread use of force
accounts against procurement regulations, and a more general lack of interest in the national
assessment itself. For 2008, the assessment of minimum conditions and performance found that
out of the then national total of 1105 Local Governments, only 84 earned rewards of which only
19 were districts. A total of 46 Local Governments were static while 931 were penalized on the
basis of failure to meet minimum conditions.

4.7    Subsequent annual assessments (see Figure 2 for details) showed a marked improvement
in 2009 and 2010, followed by deterioration in 2011. However, independence of the assessments
had declined after having been fully internalized by MoLG, instead of being carried out by a
team consisting of officials from MoLG, sector ministries and a private contractor for quality
assurance.

4.8     The project improved the degree of participation of beneficiaries in decision making
before the policy reversals mentioned above reduced the discretionary resources to be allocated
at the Local Government level. The Communities Beneficiaries’ Assessment carried out by the
                                                        13


Uganda Bureau of Statistics through a survey of 1,500 households in 150 communities found
that 36 percent of the respondents had participated in identifying development activities under
the project. Of those who did participate, 63 percent reported that their priorities did appear in
the Local Government plans and thereby demonstrate the responsiveness of the LGDP II
planning and prioritization processes. Furthermore, 82 percent of respondents who did
participate go on to report that the projects they selected were actually delivered.

4.9     Such improvements, however, have not withstood the test of time, as the reduced local
discretion over expenditure has reduced the incentive for participation, as highlighted in key
Government studies7. As noted in particular in World Bank: 2013 (p. 9), there has been a lack of
attention in the reform process to building downward accountability and civil society capacity to
interact with local governments, among others. Local revenues declined dramatically after 2005.
The 2006 abolition of the graduated tax or G-Tax, that represented 85 percent of the revenues of
Local Governments, stifled own revenues. While efforts to increase local participation in the
budgeting process at the lower levels of government were better synchronized and integrated
with the national budget planning process as part of the FDS, the substantially reduced discretion
of Local Governments over expenditures and lower funding levels have constrained
participation8. The combination of the centralization of the appointment of the Chief
Administrative Officer (CAO), the re-centralization of district procurement, and the suspension
and later abolition of the G-Tax weakened local accountability and discretionary powers over
expenditure.

4.10 The efficacy of the first PDO is therefore rated as Modest, as the performance of Local
Governments was initially improved, before the significant drop in LG performance measured by
the 2007 and 2008 National Assessments.

Sustainable, decentralized service delivery
OUTPUTS

4.11 The project provided direct financial support to Local Governments through non-sectoral
conditional grants on a formula basis taking into account their needs, capacity, accountability
and performance. A total of 31,832 sub-projects were implemented - the Local Development
Grant were used by Local Governments to invest in roads, education , agriculture extension,
health, water and sanitation, construction of public administration buildings , and solid waste
management . Figure 3 below presents the distribution of sub-projects by sector.




7
  See for example LGFC (2012), p. 6: “There are factors that continue to constrain participation among them: (a) the
low level of financing for this process; LGs at all levels often do not have the financing to enable the levels of
consultations on investment activities and to report back to communities; (b) the limited discretion means that LGs
are constrained to implement priorities and objectives provided by sectors. This provides very limited opportunity
for dialogues at LGs; and (c) delays in issuing budget guidelines and IPFs have often led to a reduction in the
amount of time available for participation and dialogues for LGs.”

4.12 The Value for Money Analysis showed an Overall Value for Money score for all sampled
projects of 4. 99 out of 9, which is very close to rating Good (5 to 7 points = Good)9. Projects in
the education sector were rated to have achieved the highest value for money (5. 68), followed
by health with an average VFM score of 5. 14; water and sanitation with a score of 5. 12;
administration with a score of 4. 90; roads with a score of 4. 59 and lastly production10 with a
score of 4. 51. Infrastructure sub-projects received also the lowest rating in the Community
Beneficiaries Assessment. The better ratings of health and education investments is due to the
fact that under the project, Local Governments were asked to ensure completeness of
investments in the education and health sector, in terms of other complementary infrastructure, to
make them more functional.

OUTCOMES

4.13 The project did achieve important improvements in service delivery, but attribution
is difficult. Based on data collected by MoLG Implementation Unit, towards the end of the
project’s period (2006), residents had to travel an average of around 4. 5 Km to access health
centers (in 1999 they had to travel at least 5. 0 Km). Primary school students had to travel an

 The Value for Money rating was on a 0-9 scale and equal to the sum of the ratings for economy, efficiency and
effectiveness which were on a 0-3 scale each.

  For example, construction of valley dams and animal water troughs, seed multiplication like cassava, vanilla and
colonial coffee, exotic goats, fish farming, and beekeeping.

average distance of around 1. 2 Km to reach their schools (in 1999 the distance was 1. 4Km) and
persons fetching water from safe water points had to travel around 0. 8Km (in 1999 the average
distance was 1. 78Km). Such reductions in distance traveled increased access to vital basic
services and impact poverty reduction. However, there were several projects funded through
sector conditional grants running in the same districts at the same time, and it is therefore
difficult to isolate the impact of the project.

4.14 However, the Fiscal Decentralization Strategy (FDS), supported by the project, did
not achieve its main objectives as sustainability remained low. Sustainability, an explicit
element of LDGP2’s PDO, was low as the inability of Local Governments to increase own
revenues, and the subsequent shift from unconditional to conditional grants for almost all of the
Local Government funding, reduced the ability of Local Governments to adapt the allocation of
funds to meet the most urgent demands of the people they serve.

4.15 The 2002 FDS had set two broad objectives: a) to increase Local Government autonomy
and widening participation in decision making, and (b) to improve the effectiveness of the Local
Government programs through increased effectiveness, transparency and accountability in
expenditures. The main strategy was to streamline the funds transfer mechanisms channeling
grants through two systems; the Recurrent Transfer Budget (RTB) system and the Development
Transfer Budget (DTB) system, to improve the balance between discretion and non-discretionary
financing of Local Governments. The FDS was to lead to an overall reduction in the number of
conditional grants while at the same time providing increased flexibility and the participation of
Local Governments in decisions of allocations of these resources. The Development Transfer
Budget system would have used the LGDP methodology.

4.16 As stated in a study of the Local Government Finance Commission (2012), the Fiscal
Decentralization Strategy failed to achieve its twin objectives. Local government autonomy was
reduced. The grant system was in fact not streamlined. The RTB/DTB mechanism was never
adopted, while the relative importance and number of conditional grants (up to 89 percent and
38, respectively) grew substantially rather than declining. An increased flexibility in sector
allocations was introduced in FY07 and abolished by Cabinet in FY09. There was substantial
resistance from line ministries that limited progress in the early years of the project. For example
the Ministry of Education, which accounted for the largest share of conditional grants, had
become a net loser, falling back on its targets, and the Ministry of Water and Environment had
witnessed a similar trend.

4.17 LGDP grants represented about 36 percent of development transfers to Local
Governments between FY01 and FY07. The project effectively provided sector budget support.
Funds were co-mingled with Government resources and transferred. LGDP grants were based on
independent performance assessments that received strong attention at the local level. Such
assessments were focused on compliance with the Local Government framework and the
improved capabilities benefitted the management of all grants, including conditional ones.

4.18 In 2006 Sector Budget Support was abandoned by donors. Such interruption came at a
time of declining own revenues, and had a strong impact on Local Government funding. While
LGDP grants continued after the end of the project with Government funding, the assessment of
performance was internalized by the Ministry of Local Government, and the relative importance

of unconditional grants declined. Alignment with the country’s intergovernmental fiscal system
was only partial, as the LGDP formula was applied only for unconditional grants.

4.19 The project’s assumption that more capable and better organized Local
Governments will improve basic service delivery, was not proven correct, as little attention
was paid to local accountability systems, particularly at the lower Local Government level,
where most of the funds are spent. There was also evidence that funds could be used locally as a
patronage tool. Reinikka and Svenson (2004), for example, found that the decentralization of
education funds in Uganda allowed rural elites to capture the funds to the detriment of local
schools and used them instead to support local patronage networks.

4.20 Today, funding for service delivery is generally low and current policies do not allow
local revenue generation and contributions from local communities, as exemplified by one of the
health centers supported by the project – see Box 1. Financing gaps vary by district. LGFC
(2012) estimated that districts’ revenues including grants would need to triple to meet national
standards for local government services, given the funding gap currently estimated at 64 percent
(World Bank:2013). The 2013 Public Expenditure Review also found that Local Governments’
real per capita expenditure on education falling from USh 26,000 before FY07 to about USh
20,560 in recent years. Health expenditures have been more stable, but also trending downwards.
The PER (p. 35) concluded that district governments are less able to fund local services than
in the past with a negative net fiscal impact between 2 and 10 percent of district per capita
budgets.

Box 1. If you live in Wakitaka and are pregnant, remember to charge your phone every day
Wakitaka is a village in the sub-county of Mafubira, part of the district of Jinja. The Wakitaka Health Unit, the only
such unit in the sub-county, received project support to build a house for health staff working at the center (on the
right in the above picture).

The unit is headed by a young and energetic nurse and serves about 20-30 patients a day. The main problem is the
sub-county council has not paid electricity bills for a total of UGX1 million and the power company has cut off
power supply several months ago.

The head nurse was able to mobilize support from NGOs to buy solar panels, but could not afford batteries. As a
consequence, there is no power at night or when the sky is cloudy. As a result, pregnant women delivering at night
are assisted under the light generated by mobile phones, and using tools sterilized during the day. Vaccination for
children is usually offered once a week. As the refrigerator cannot be powered and the staff does not want to turn
away mothers that might show up, doses are picked up in Jinja in the morning and unused ones are returned late in
the afternoon, with a trip of about 25 km back and forth.

4.21 The efficacy of the second PDO is therefore rated as Modest, compared to substantial in
the ICR. The achievements of the project in service delivery were not sustainable and are being
reversed due to the new Government attitude towards decentralization. The entire intervention
logic rested on the assumption that service delivery would improve by moving decision making
closer to the beneficiaries. This did not happen, as the discretion over expenditure was reduced
rather than increased. Lack of funds for operations and maintenance has subsequently led to the
progressive erosion of the initial improvements in quality of management, and infrastructure.
According to LGFC (2012), there is currently a 54 percent funding gap for the management
functions of planning, supervision and monitoring of service delivery as well as auditing and
infrastructure maintenance that does not allow Councils to execute their role in this respect.

5. Efficiency
5.1     Neither the PAD nor the ICR calculated an ERR/FRR on the grounds that benefits would
be difficult to quantify. There are, however, a number of observations that can contribute to an
overall assessment of efficiency.

5.2      Cost Effectiveness. The ICR, however, noted that the sub-projects implemented under
LGDP II were more cost effective compared to those under the LGDP, even if comparable in
size. It states that the average cost of the sub-projects financed under the project was 88 percent
of the average cost of sub-projects implemented under the previous project (even without
accounting for inflation) except for education and health sub-projects which were higher (110
percent). This is because under the project, Local Governments were asked to ensure
completeness of investments in the education and health sector, in terms of other complementary
infrastructure, to make them more functional.

5.3    Operational Efficiency. Economy11 and Efficiency12 of LGDP II’s sub-projects,
accounting for two thirds of actual project costs, were also relatively good, as the Value for
11
  Economy in the VFM analysis referred to minimizing the cost of resources used for an activity, with due regard
for appropriate quality - and is audited in terms of deviations between budgeted cost, contract price; actual cost or
market cost and defect cost. “Economy” was rated as: Best (3); Good (2); Fair (1); or Poor (0).
                                                          18


Money Analysis, carried out by an independent consultancy firm, rated the economy of
subprojects it analyzed at 1. 7 and their efficiency at 1. 62 out of 3 (the minimum rating for good
is 1. 67). The project was carried out within the timeframe envisaged at design, as the revision of
the closing date was due to the time needed for Parliamentary approval, which was relatively
fast. Costs for project management and coordination were low at 4 percent of total project costs,
and there was a relatively small cost overrun (6. 25 percent).

5.4      The above findings lead IEG to rate the project’s efficiency as Substantial.

6. Ratings
Outcome
6.1     Several ratings (i. e. , relevance of objectives, and efficiency) were substantial, but the
project’s efficacy and the relevance of its design were both modest. The operation supported the
building of capacity at Local Governments and contributed with direct financial support for
investments in social infrastructure through sub-projects, to visible improvements in basic
service delivery that were not sustainable, due to GOU policy reversals during and after the life
of the project. Due to its modest efficacy, IEG rates the outcome of the project as Moderately
Unsatisfactory.

Risk to Development Outcome
6.2      The risk to the institutional outcomes achieved is rated high. Political commitment has
declined over time, leading to substantial policy reversals from 2005 onwards. It is likely that the
current trend to centralize functions will over time reduce the progress made in building capacity
and accountability of Local Governments. A positive development in this respect is the Cabinet’s
decision (made in March 2013) to place a moratorium on the creation of districts and to
withdraw from parliamentary consideration the pre-existing proposal for the creation of 25 new
districts.

6.3     Patronage was the political economy factor that most influenced project performance.
The proliferation of districts, as discussed earlier, was driven by patronage, and sterilized by
centralization of control and reduction in local discretionary powers, after the introduction of
multi-party politics. The swing in the ruling party attitude towards decentralization of powers
and functions was difficult to foresee in 2003. The 2013 PER (World Bank: 2013, p. 37)
estimated that the impact of the creation of new districts on public expenditures has been low so
far because the number of vacant positions in district governments has been increasing along
with the number of districts, and the real wage bill of district governments has been eroded by a
recent outburst of inflation. However, it concluded that such impact is likely to increase in the
future, making district proliferation a potential “time bomb.”


12
  Efficiency in the VFM analysis referred to the investment processes and was defined in five stages: planning and
approval process; procurement process; implementation process; financial management; and commissioning
/handover process. Efficient execution of a sub-project (“efficiency”) was rated as: Best (3); Good (2); Fair (1); or
Poor (0).
                                                        19


6.4    At the same time, a political economy factor to be considered is represented by the
preferences and modes of operations of donors. Sector approaches can often collide with
decentralization.

Bank Performance
QUALITY AT ENTRY

6.5     The design was aligned with the PRSP and the Bank's CAS, and remains relevant to the
latest CAS. The design drew on lessons from LGDP I as well as from the Bank and other donors
in Uganda and neighboring countries. The design also draws appropriately on the Bank’s
Analytical and Advisory Assistance, although the PAD included no reference to any study made
outside the Bank. The Bank selected an appropriate instrument, which was part of a long history
of support to decentralization dating back for at least a decade. However, the results framework
was focused on process (e. g. , development of 3-year rolling development plans, final accounts
submitted on time to the office of the Auditor General) rather than outcome indicators and the
risk of policy reversal was set as moderate, and therefore partly underestimated, representing
moderate shortcomings in the project design, while the M&E system was strong.

6.6     As noted in the ICR (World Bank 2008:10), project design and implementation were
informed by the MTR recommendations and the ICR findings and lessons learned for LGDP I. In
particular, in line with the MTR recommendations, the project was designed as an instrument to
support the Government’s Fiscal Decentralization Strategy, leading the way towards a more
permanent intergovernmental fiscal transfer system, and to mobilize broad grant support to
implement decentralization reform with a possible strong demonstration effect for the future in
terms of development partner coordination and harmonization.

6.7     The entry point was provided by the approval by Cabinet of the Fiscal Decentralization
Strategy in June 2002. As the project supported a revamping of the intergovernmental fiscal
transfer system, it was not selective in terms of jurisdictions or communities it sought to support.
The project covered all higher Local Governments, and tried to address the issue of Local
Government funding in a systematic way, trying to replace conditional grants funded through
Uganda’s Poverty Action Fund with the LGDP approach, that was supposed to be mainstreamed
for development transfers to Local Governments.

6.8    The Bank sought to use IDA resources to help develop a rules-based, transparent
intergovernmental system (i. e., beyond simply financing local investments)13, but failed to
achieve this objective, even though most local investments were completed successfully.

6.9    Considering the relevant but ambitious design, Quality at Entry is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.


13
   See PAD (p.6): “Through the FDS, the Government has made the strategic choice to mainstream the LGDP
approach to fiscal decentralization, emphasizing improvement in decentralization of public service delivery through
greater autonomy and downward accountability of local governments. LGDPII directly supports this strategic
choice of Government, and other donors are increasingly supportive of this approach.”

QUALITY OF SUPERVISION

6.10 There were ten supervision missions with an input of 152 staff weeks over a 5-year
period. The project had one Task Team Leader for its duration, from preparation to closing with
a second one appointed only at the time of the ICR. ISRs always rated project performance
satisfactory, even after the policy reversals of 2005-2006, a sign that their relevance might have
been underestimated by the Bank team. There was good donor coordination, with several donors
funding LGDP II directly. However, the importance of direct funding of Local Governments by
donors through conditional grants grew over time and undermined some of the project’s
achievements in terms of donor coordination and harmonization.

6.11 The Bank was quick to adapt to the Government’s policy reversal and tried to react to the
abolition of the Graduated Tax by (a) highlighting the need for adequate compensation of Local
Governments by Central Government for the loss of the Graduated Tax revenue; (b) preparing a
note which assisted government to identify alternative own revenue sources to replace the
Graduated Tax; and (c) supporting the Government request to use part of the credit to facilitate
Local Governments to improve their revenue collection efficiency from their own revenue
sources. However, a stronger reaction to the policy reversals and a growth of unconditional
grants below constitutional requirements (as discussed in para 1. 13) could have been possible
considering also the related PRSC operations running at the same time. Overall, the Bank
Supervision Performance was Moderately Satisfactory.

6.12 Taking account of both Quality at Entry and Supervision performance, the Bank‘s
Overall Performance was also Moderately Satisfactory.

Borrower Performance
GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE

6.13 The Government’s performance was Unsatisfactory. Prior to the introduction of a multi-
party system in 2005, the GOU had shown strong commitment to decentralization and the
project. However, since 2005, commitment has been declining, leading to a substantial reduction
in Local Governments’ mandates, funding, and autonomy, even though the recent Cabinet
decision to declare a moratorium on the creation of new districts is an encouraging sign of a
more conducive environment for decentralization in the near future.

IMPLEMENTING AGENCY PERFORMANCE

6.14 The MoLG’s performance was Satisfactory. It led the process of reform and tried to
adapt to an increasingly challenging environment. The Ministry ensured that the grants were
transferred on a timely basis to Local Governments, funds were not diverted and the necessary
policy reforms such as the restructuring of Local Governments, identification of new taxes for
Local Governments, support for urban planning, and support to update Local Governments’
valuation rolls were achieved.

6.15 Considering the importance of the Government’s policy reversals and the moderately
unsatisfactory outcome rating, IEG rates Borrower Performance as Moderately Unsatisfactory.
                                                        21


Quality of M&E
6.16 M&E Design. As discussed in the section on relevance of design, the monitoring
framework was very sophisticated and captured well all data concerning the project including
those relating to improved service delivery at the local level. However, the M&E design did not
adequately address the multiplicity of monitoring systems14, the need for independent impact
assessments and a systematic beneficiary feedback loop.

6.17 M&E Implementation. As discussed in the section on implementation, there was
substantial monitoring of sub-project performance, data collection on physical benefits achieved
in the three key services of health, education and access to water; a Communities Beneficiaries’
Assessment (although only late in the project); and a Value for Money (VFM) Analysis,
covering a sample of sub-projects.

6.18 M&E Utilization. M&E information was used to analyze the performance of Local
Governments and determine their eligibility for grant funding under Component 2. It also
allowed a real time monitoring of project performance. LOGICS, however, did not replace
existing monitoring systems at the sector level but drew from them, leading at times to
duplication of efforts and poor reporting. LOGICS is not effectively used by Local Governments,
and suffers from, inter alia, inadequate funding, poor ICT infrastructure, unreliable power
supply, limited computer literacy, and multiplicity of information systems in Local
Governments. 15

6.19 Considering its sophisticated design, and good implementation and use, partially
counterbalanced by the lack of integration of LOGICS with other monitoring systems, and
limited beneficiary feedback loop, the overall quality of the project’s M&E system is rated as
Significant.

7. Lessons
7.1     The first lesson is that policy reversals can cause serious damage to otherwise significant
project outcomes, and are difficult to identify and counter. Although sometimes harmful, policy
reversals are not uncommon and fall under the sovereign right of nations to determine their own
policies. With local government development projects early warning signals should include any
significant increase in the number of districts, or reduction in un-earmarked funding or Local
Governments’ rights to raise revenues. When early warning signals of major policy reversals
appear, particularly if motivated by political patronage, the Bank should consider whether
withdrawal of support for decentralization could lead to better results than trying to continue to
work with Local Governments under the new policy environment.

7.2     The second lesson is that monitoring should be focused on outcome in addition to process
indicators, and it should be unified across sectors. The project achieved an impressive series of

14
  This issue was highlighted in the Mid-Term Review (p. 13):” There is a need to consider merging MIS systems
that were operating in LGs e.g. LOGICS, IFMS, LOGFIAS, NIMES, FDS.”
15
     See for example http://makir.mak.ac.ug/handle/10570/2284 .
                                                22


outputs at the local level, but was not sustainable. As the vision pursued under the Fiscal
Decentralization Strategy was abandoned, the project continued producing outputs that could not
be adequately maintained over time, rather than being suspended or restructured. The parallel
functioning of the project’s M&E systems and those of other sector programs within the same
Local Governments should be avoided as it duplicates efforts and makes attribution more
difficult.

7.3    The third lesson is that decentralization is not a sector, while it was treated as such in
Uganda with a Sector Working Group, a Sector Investment Plan and specific donor support.
Decentralization of service delivery affects all sub-national units and all sectors of the economy
and should be supported in a harmonized way across sectors and donor programs. Resistance by
line ministries and donors alike, worried about having control of the achievement of key results,
undermined Local Governments leading to a significant missed opportunity. Had
decentralization shown stronger results by 2006, would it have been so easily reversed?

7.4     The fourth lesson is that a fully decentralized sector allocation, supported through
government budgets, requires a change in the way donors allocate funds across sectors within a
given country, often using conditional grants to reach Local Governments. If the choice of
sectors is truly delegated to Local Governments and communities, such allocation cannot be
determined a priori. This is often incompatible with the development cooperation frameworks of
bilateral donors, or the sector-specific teams and earmarked funds of multilaterals, that work in
tandem with line ministries in developing countries like Uganda.

Annex B. Local Governments in Uganda – Overview and
Timeline
The system of Local Government in Uganda is a five-tiered one, consisting of (i) districts,
(ii) counties, (iii) sub-counties, (iv) parishes, and (v) villages (rural) or wards (urban). Only
districts, cities, municipalities and sub-counties are legal persons with capacity to sue and be
sued, and vested with executive and legislative powers. The Constitution of Uganda states
that the district is the basis of the Local Government system and that it is a unit under which
other lower Local Government and administrative structures operate. The autonomy of Local
Government, in other words, finds expression in the powers and functions of districts as the
main unit of local governance. Districts are centers of political and administrative power.

The Constitution provides for a district chairperson as the political head of a district. The
Local Government Act (LGA) confers the title of “mayor” on the district chairperson. The
chairperson is directly elected by universal adult suffrage.

Under Part I of the Second Schedule to the LGA districts are mandated to perform a range of
functions. They provide education services as well as medical and health services by
running hospitals. They are furthermore tasked with the provision of maternity and child
welfare services and the control of communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, leprosy
and tuberculosis. Districts must control the spread of diseases and provide rural ambulance
and primary health care services. Hence districts are important structures in the public
health sector. In addition, districts provide water services, including the maintenance of
water supplies in liaison with the relevant line ministry. Finally, districts are required to
provide road services (Singiza 2010).

Figure 5 shows that the number of districts increased by almost 50% during the life of the
project, and grew by over one third after the project closed. Table 2 shows instead that all
types of Local Government grew by almost 50 percent between 2004 and 2011.

Table 3 shows the distribution of resources among wages, recurrent and development
expenditures. Local Governments are defined here as Districts, Municipalities and Town
Councils, as the Administrative Units receive resources from the respective councils or
divisions. It is clear that Local Governments account for a large share of the wage bill but
have proportionally less resources for development and recurrent costs.

The consolidated financial operations by Local Governments, as shown in table, show a
preponderance of grants. Such grants, as shown in Table 5, are mostly conditional, provided
by various line ministries on the basis of different formulas, some extremely complicated.
There are currently 38 conditional grants given to each Local Government on an annual
basis.

Districts are heavily dependent on government grants representing 95 percent of revenues.
District performance, assessed annually to determine allocations of unconditional grants (a
small fraction of the total), seems to be extremely variable as show in Table 6. The National
Assessment Exercise is carried out once a year to measure the extent to which a Local

Government meets a series of set minimum conditions and performance measures which are
derived from applicable policies, laws, regulations and guidelines. Among others, financial
management, procurement and tendering are extensively examined during the assessment.
Local Governments not meeting such minimum conditions are penalized with a smaller
allocation of unconditional grants, while those exceeding them are rewarded.

Notwithstanding the efforts of the project of increasing unconditional grants, conditional
(earmarked) grants still represent the vast majority of the decreasing grants to Local
Governments. The combination of declining Local Governments’ tax revenues and the
increase in earmarked funding from the center has effectively reduced Local Governments’
autonomy in the country.

The progressive fractioning of districts through the constant creation of new ones make
historical comparison of financial flows and performance at the district level difficult. Table
9 has been assembled as part of this PPAR by combining available information on the
territorial origin of new districts with financial data. Districts and municipal councils are the

highest tier of sub-national governments in Uganda, and, as shown in Table 8 from Green
(2008), among the smallest in Sub-Saharan Africa. It should be noted that since 2008, the
average population per district in Uganda has fallen from 383,071 to 216,315.

How are grants determined?

Unconditional Grants. Between 1993 and 1998, unconditional grants were distributed based
on a formula that considered child mortality (40 percent), school age population (40 percent),
general population (10 percent), and area (10 percent). In 1998 the formula, criticized for
being too complicated was replaced on a formula giving an 85 percent weight to population
and 15 percent to land area, after a constant of UGX 160 million per district had been taken
into consideration to pay for the administrative structures of districts that were essentially the
same. 85 percent of the difference between the total available for unconditional grants and
the constant times the number of district was then allocated based on population and 15
percent on land area. The constant was later removed from the formula.

Conditional Grants. Conditional grants have grown in share (from 62 to 89 percent of all
grants) and in number (from 16 in FY02 to 38 in FY11), and have become more restrictive
over time. Each of the 38 conditional grants has its own allocation parameter, as shown by
examples in Table 10 taken from LGFC (2012).

The initial LGDP allocation (for FY04) was determined as follows:

        LGDP funds would be divided between rural and urban Local Governments on a per
         capita basis: US$2 per capita for urban authorities (including town councils) and
         US$1 per capita for rural authorities, in real terms.
        The amounts allocated to rural areas would then be distributed among districts and
         sub-counties based on population (85 percent) and land area (15 percent), and to
         parishes based on population alone (100 percent). Within each district, funds would
         be further allocated to districts (35 percent) and sub-counties (65 percent). Sub-
         counties would then allocate 30 percent to parishes.
        The amounts allocated to urban areas would then be distributed based on population
         alone (100 percent). Within each City or Municipal Council, funds would be further
         allocated to city or municipal councils (50 percent) and division councils (50
         percent). Division councils would then allocate 30 percent to parishes.
        As part of the performance evaluation system, incentives and penalties would be
         applied wherein those Local Governments that perform adequately would be
         rewarded with access to 20 percent additional funds and those who do not perform
         well would have their allocation reduced by 20 percent.

Access to LGDP grants was open to all Ugandan Local Governments that would meet
minimum conditions and were willing to co-fund 10 percent of the projects supported by
LGDP grants through their own resources.

                            • 1986: NRM gain power in Uganda
                            • Local Resistance Councils (RCs) are very influential in the NRMs rise to power.
                            • The value of local mobilization and organization is strongly appreciated.
                            • RCs become de facto Local Governments.
 Building political support • Decentralization as a politically driven process is established
   for decentralization
                            • Formal adoption of decentralization policy in 1992
        1986-1992


                            • 1993-97: Staff posted from line ministries and introduction of district managed votes and
                              grants

Annex C. Evolution of Bank Portfolio
The First Urban Project (approved 1991, closed 2000) supported the government's efforts to
decentralize the responsibility for the planning, design and management of urban services to
local authorities while assisting with reconstruction of the country after a period of political
instability, social strife and physical destruction. The project objectives were to: (a) improve
living conditions and alleviate poverty in Kampala by restoring key infrastructure services;
(b) support the development of decentralized local urban management by strengthening the
revenue base, financial management and technical capacities of the Kampala City Council
(KCC) and by improving the ability of central government to assist local authorities to
increase their revenue base and strengthen financial management; (c) strengthen the country's
capacity to manage the process of urban land development; and (d) promote sound cost
recovery policies and practices. The project included support for: (a) the rehabilitation of
urban markets, streets and drains, refuse collection and disposal; (b) the servicing of land for
residential development; (c) the preparation of up-to-date mapping and a strategic urban
development plan for Kampala; and (d) technical assistance and training for KCC, the
Ministry of Local Housing and the Physical Planning Department staff.

The Small Towns Water and Sanitation Project (approved 1994, closed 2003) supported the
government's economic recovery program by extending the rehabilitation and upgrading of
water supply and sanitation services to towns that had not been covered before. It aimed at:
(a) improving health conditions through better water supply, excreta disposal, waste water
management, and public hygiene; (b) alleviating poverty and improving the lot of women;
and (c) reducing environmental degradation through better waste management. The project
provided 12 small towns and Jinja with improved and sustainable water supply and sanitation
through: (a) the rehabilitation and/or expansion of water supply and sanitation facilities; (b)
hygiene education related to water supply and sanitation; (c) community participation in
planning, implementation, operation, and maintenance of water supply and sanitation
facilities; and (d) institutional strengthening, technical assistance and training for the
organizations in the sector.

The Institutional Capacity Building Project (approved 1995, closed 2002) aimed to establish
local institutional and human capacity to develop and implement public policy and support
the growth of the private sector through: (a) support for the continuation of the Civil Service
Reform; (b) assistance to the Government of Uganda in its decentralization program; and (c)
strengthening the legal and financial accountability framework and institutions. The project
consisted of five components: (i) central government capacity building; (ii) Local
Government capacity building; (iii) legal sector reform; (iv) accountancy profession; and (v)
training funds.

The District Health Project (approved 1995, closed 2002) aimed at pilot-testing and
demonstrating the feasibility of delivering an essential health services package to district
populations, within a prudent financial policy framework for the sector in order to improve
the efficiency and equity in the provision of health services. The project was designed to
support the Government's strategy of decentralizing health services. It planned to increase the
ANNEX C                                      42


efficiency of the existing health infrastructure and institutions through consolidation and
improved management with increased local accountability, while simultaneously supporting
cost recovery and budgetary policies that will enable the health care system to move toward
long term sustainability. It supported the Government's efforts to reorder priorities within the
existing health care system through efficiency improvements and by reallocating financial
and human resources toward ensuring the provision of a package of essential health services
for all Uganda's citizens. Accordingly, the project included activities to: 1) pilot and test new
sector policies and strategies which will facilitate the implementation of essential health
services; 2) strengthen management and planning capacity at district levels so that they are
prepared to provide essential health services; and 3) restructure the Ministry of Health so as
to build its capacity to provide health policy leadership and to support the Government's
decentralization policy.

The Nakivubo Channel Rehabilitation Project (approved 1999, closed 2004) was aimed at
alleviating the frequent flood incidence on the road network, which affected traffic flows,
with an adverse impact on the economic activity and living conditions in Kampala.
Institutionally, the Project tried to enhance the Kampala City Council (KCC) management
capacity, helping establish the infrastructure investment policies, and ultimately, support
KCC's reform program. The project components included civil works regarding the
rehabilitation of the main channel, construction of auxiliary drains, and, the rehabilitation of
priority drainage. Consulting services for construction supervision were to be financed by the
project, as well as the required program and policy studies, namely the Kampala Drainage
Master Plan Study and the Kampala Urban Transportation Improvement Program Study.
Institutional strengthening was planned for both the KCC reform program under the strategic
framework for reform, and the revenue enhancement program. To facilitate outsourcing of
basic delivery functions, seed funds were made available and training and implementation
support were further provided.

The Second Economic and Financial Management Project (approved 1999, closed 2006) was
part of the assistance strategy for supporting improvements in the public expenditure
management process in Uganda, and the project was aimed at improving the efficiency of
Government planning/budgeting, financial management, and monitoring/evaluation
processes. The components were expected to: 1) support strengthening of central, and Local
Government planning, and budgeting processes, through improved transparency, and
accountability of budget, and public expenditure practices. Fiscal decentralization was to be
expanded, and effective linkages between national, and Local Government planning were to
be strengthened, together with recurrent, and development budget integration; 2) improve
financial and accounting practices, through human resources capacity building, to improve
financial management systems, and information, and enhance external auditing functions; 3)
support capacity building to monitor the performance, and delivery service of public
expenditure on living standards among various groups. This included improved capacity of
the Uganda Bureau of Statistics, and implementation of the National Service Delivery
Survey; 4) test the effectiveness of distance learning, through the construction of a learning
center, equipment supply, and operational technical assistance.

The Local Government Development Program (approved 1999, closed 2004) initiated a long-
term effort, to assist Uganda in the decentralization of basic public services, and in the
ANNEX C                                    43


implementation of Local Governments, and tested alternative services delivery mechanisms,
through the private sector, beneficiary communities, or stakeholders. Given the cross-sectoral
nature of this project, the strategic framework was widely supported, namely, through the
promotion of labor-intensive macroeconomic growth, and increased private sector
investments. The components did: 1) provide technical assistance to the Ministry of Local
Government (MoLG), and the Local Government Finance Commission Secretariat, for
capacity building and policy development, as both institutions strive to become operational.
Under the decentralization policy, MoLG was expected to mentor Local Governments, in line
with the Constitution, and the Local Governments Act of 1997. Computerized databases
provided the required linkages for adequate information communications; 2) finance basic
services delivery investments, and capacity building, through grants from the Central
Government to the Local Governments; 3) support and test, alternative basic services
delivery for the Kampala City Council, implemented through reorganization, private
financing, and improved management practices; and, 4) support program management,
monitoring/ evaluation, and, future program formulation.

The Kampala Institutional and Infrastructure Development Project (approved 2007, it is
scheduled to close by end December 2012) aims to improve institutional efficiency of the
Kampala City Council (KCC) through implementation of the Strategic Framework for
Reform (SFR). The project includes the following components: Component 1 -- support to
KCC and its stakeholders to refine and expand the SFR into a comprehensive approach to
municipal development, consonant with Kampala's central role in the nation's economic and
political life. Component 2 -- provide city wide infrastructure and services improvements.
Component 3 -- support to KCC on project implementation and the establishment and
implementation of a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system.

The Local Government Management and Services Delivery Project (approved 2007, it is
scheduled to close by end December 2012) aims to strengthen the ability of the Ministries,
Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and Local Governments (LGs) to plan and manage
resources in collaboration with communities for service delivery. The project had three
components: Component 1 - Support to the Public Financial Management (PFM) system
reform program - intended to strengthen PFM at central and Local Government levels and to
ensure efficient, effective, transparent and accountable use of public resources; Component 2
- Support to the Local Government Sector Investment plans (LoGSIP) - support Local
Governments infrastructure development through the (a) GoU local development grant
(LDG), (b) professionalization of Local Government staff, and (c) support to Local
Governments in Northern Uganda which were weak and emerging from situation of civil
war.

The Transforming the Settlements of the Urban Poor in Uganda - A Secondary Cities
Support Programme (TSUPU) (approved 2010, it is scheduled to close by end December
2012) aims to strengthen the ability of Local Government (LG's) to plan and manage
resources in collaboration with communities for service delivery. Negative measures include:
air pollution, noise pollution, waste management, water pollution, soil erosion, ecology,
drainage, and natural resources. Mitigation measures include: a) traffic emissions should be
monitored and legally permitted levels should not be exceeded; b) during construction, un-
paved roads should be water sprayed and doused to reduce dust levels; c) employers should
ANNEX C                                    44


provide protective equipment e. g. dust masks and construct well-ventilated workshops as
necessary; d) movement of vehicles and operation of construction machinery should be
confined to daytime; and e) construction should be monitored by local and district public
health officials notably in the siting of these items.
