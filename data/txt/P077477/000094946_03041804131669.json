environmental assessment for\n            Uganda's Second Local Government Development Program\n            Project provides a framework to establish the screening\n            process mechanism that identifies potential environmental\n            and social impacts of sub-projects and to address them by\n            incorporating the relevant mitigation measures into\n            sub-project design. The main feature of this mechanism\n            requires the sub-project implementers to screen their\n            sub-projects at the preparation stage using the screening\n            form in Annex 1 of this report and the revised environmental\n            and social checklist to identify potential adverse\n            effects/impacts. Sub-projects requiring individual\n            environmental and social impact assessments (ESIAs) are\n            those costing US$100,000 and/or sub-projects involving new\n            roads, incorporating use of hazardous chemicals and managing\n            solid, liquid, or medical wastes. The use of the results of\n            the ESIA would be how these sub-projects identify their\n            adverse effects which would then be adequately mitigated in\n            the sub-project designs before submission for review and\n            approval. This Environmental and Social Management Framework\n            (ESMF) report assesses the capacity at the District and\n            Lower Local Governments to implement the proposed screening\n            process and mitigation measures, including the provision of\n            support to communities in cases of community-managed\n            sub-projects, and makes recommendations, including training\n            needs and cost. The ESMF assessed the content, use, and\n            effectiveness of the existing Environment and Social\n            Checklist prepared under the project; and recommended a\n            significant overhaul to make it simpler and easier to use at\n            all levels of the local government system, but especially at\n            the level of the Technical Planning Committee (TPC) and the\n            Project Management Committee (PMC) levels."}, "docdt": "2003-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
