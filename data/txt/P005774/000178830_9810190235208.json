development effort\n            that has ever been undertaken in YAR's fisheries\n            sector. The project will enable YAR to better use its highly\n            valuable but largely underexploited fish and shrimp\n            resources by introducing the infrastructure and technology\n            needed to improve the production and marketing in the\n            fisheries sector, thus increasing the income and improving\n            the economic well-being of YAR's artisanal fishermen\n            and reducing YAR's increasing dependence on imported\n            animal protein. The main project components include: (a)\n            construction of an artisanal fishing port and related\n            facilities in Hodeidah, the center of YAR's fishing\n            industry; (b) Construction of an artisanal landing pier and\n            related facilities at Khawbah. (c) construction of fish\n            handling, marketing and storage facilities; (d) construction\n            of a 32 km road to link Khawbah with the new section of\n            YAR's main highway; (e) provision of credit facilities\n            for fishing vessels, equipment and transport vehicles; and\n            (f) provision of technical assistance and training."}, "docdt": "1980-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
