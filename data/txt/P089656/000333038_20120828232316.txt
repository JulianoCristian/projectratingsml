                       GEF PROJECT
                          P089656

1.     The closing date for Macedonia, FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF,
Sustainable Energy GEF PROJECT, TF05107, P089656 will be extended from
September 30, 2012 until January 31, 2013.

2.     The project has disbursed US$4.2 million out of the US$5.5 million GEF grant
and is well underway to reach its objectives. The project was restructured in 2010 after
which good progress has been made. Phase One of an Energy Efficiency Retrofit
Program has been successfully completed resulting in retrofits of 18 kindergartens and
schools in six different municipalities.

3.     The proposed extension is necessary to complete Phase Two of the above-
mentioned Retrofit Program, which is planned to finance energy efficiency retrofits for
13 schools and kindergartens in five municipalities. Procurement activities for the
implementation of the retrofits are underway and bids have been received for all works.
The estimated value of the works is US$2 million of which $1 million will be paid from
the GEF grant.

4.     This will be the second extension of the project.

5.    The team has agreed an action plan with the Implementing Agency to ensure
completion of all activities before the new closing date
