7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The development objective of the project is to develop a sustainable market for EE and RE by supporting
the development of an enabling framework, institutional capacity, and necessary financing mechanisms.
Specifically, the project would: - Change the current unfavorable investment and incentive conditions and
create an enabling environment in Macedonia that fosters the development of sustainable energy utilization
(in this context defined as efficient use of energy and use of renewable energy sources) through providing
financial, methodological, informational, and institutional support; - Support a large increase in energy
efficiency (EE) investment in Macedonia through development of a self-sustaining, market-based financing
mechanism based on a principle of commercial co-financing.The project's goal is focused on the
development and implementation of financially profitable EE projects, which can provide sustainable and
increasing reductions in GHG emissions without relying on public subsidy; and Increase the availability of
financing for renewable energy (RE) investments, enterprises and intermediaries through the establishment
of a financial facility with a long-term time horizon, which will provide seed capital for debt co-financing
of RE projects.
