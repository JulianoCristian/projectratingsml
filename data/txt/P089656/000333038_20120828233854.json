The closing date for the project will\n            be extended from September 30, 2012 until January 31, 2013.\n            The project has disbursed US$4.2 million out of the US$5.5\n            million GEF grant and is well underway to reach its\n            objectives. The project was restructured in 2010 after which\n            good progress has been made. Phase one of an Energy\n            Efficiency Retrofit Program has been successfully completed\n            resulting in retrofits of 18 kindergartens and schools in\n            six different municipalities. The extension is necessary to\n            complete phase two of the above-mentioned Retrofit Program,\n            which is planned to finance energy efficiency retrofits for\n            13 schools and kindergartens in five municipalities.\n            Procurement activities for the implementation of the\n            retrofits are underway and bids have been received for all\n            works. The estimated value of the works is US$2 million of\n            which $1 million will be paid from the GEF grant. This will\n            be the second extension of the project."}, "docdt": "2012-08-28T00:00:00Z"}
