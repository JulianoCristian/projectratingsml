PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS

2.      Project implementation has improved since the first restructuring and led to
significant progress under the Financial Support for EE in Public Building
Component and completion of activities under the Sustainable Energy Financing
Facility (SEFF) - Credit line for RE/EE Component. Consequently, progress toward
DO achievement is strong. The proposed restructuring aims to ensure sufficient GEF
resources to implement a phase 2 of the financial support for EE in public buildings.

3.      This will be the second project restructuring. As at March 16, 2012, progress on
the project’s three components is as follows:

  i.     Through the Institutional support, technical assistance and project management
         Component the project has supported the establishment of feed-in tariffs,
         legislation and rulebooks on preferred generation from RE and Certificates of

                                            2
        Origin, and energy audits for public buildings. Currently, final activities for
        establishing systematic measurements of wind speeds and a wind data base are
        implemented. Progress has been slower than anticipated, but steady.

 ii.    Financial support for EE in public buildings The first phase of the retrofit
        Program which included 18 schools and kindergartens in six municipalities is
        largely completed. Due to a rather low Special Account ceiling of US$200,000,
        payment to contractors has been delayed. The second phase is about the start,
        with six new municipalities committing to provide 50% co-financing. The first
        tenders for works are expected to be advertised in early May.

 iii.   Sustainable Energy Financing Facility (SEFF) - Credit line for RE/EE. The 1
        MW solar PV plant near Bitola, is operational. Since the MBDP does not have
        any additional project candidates which could be reasonably financed MoE/MoF
        requested the reallocation of the remaining funds available for this component
        (about US$160,000).

4.      The proposed reallocation is necessary in order to address the current fiscal and
payment challenges. The proposed changes for this second restructuring include: (a)
reallocation of US$328,000 from other budget categories in order to ensure a total of 1.0
million US dollars for the implementation of energy efficiency retrofits in the Project's
Phase 2, and (b) increase of the Authorized Allocation from US$ 200,000 to US$
800,000.

5.       As to proposed change (A), the completion of phase 1 of the retrofit Program
involved an overrun of the initially committed amount (US$1.2 million) for energy
efficiency retrofits by US$328,000. The Ministry of Economy is committed to ensure the
initially budgeted amount of US$1.0 million for the implementation of energy efficiency
retrofits on a co-financing arrangement in the Project's Phase 2 and therefore suggested
the reduction in other budget categories and reallocation. The proposed amounts for re-
allocation are proposed in the tables in Annex 1.

6.     The Table below illustrates the indicative reallocations that also includes a
reduction of the allocation:

7.      As to proposed change (B), the current ceiling of the Authorized Allocation (set at
US$ 200,000) leads to delays in meeting payment liabilities, particularly in respect to
disbursements under component 2. The Ministry of Economy currently has about US$1.5
million in construction contracts and will have additional contracts of another
US$500,000 shortly (for the wind and energy auditing). All of these contracts will need
to be paid in full before mid-April. The current ceiling requires too many replenishments
to meet all these obligations, and therefore constrains new contracting and may impact
the ability to disburse the remaining grant funds before the closing date.
