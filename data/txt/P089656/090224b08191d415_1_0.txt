                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the project is to develop a sustainable market for EE and RE by supporting the development of an enabling framework, institutional
                         capacity, and necessary financing mechanisms. Specifically, the project would: - Change the current unfavorable investment and incentive conditions and create an
                         enabling environment in Macedonia that fosters the development of sustainable energy utilization (in this context defined as efficient use of energy and use of renewable
                         energy sources) through providing financial, methodological, informational, and institutional support; - Support a large increase in energy efficiency (EE) investment in
                         Macedonia through development of a self-sustaining, market-based financing mechanism based on a principle of commercial co-financing.The project's goal is focused
                         on the development and implementation of financially profitable EE projects, which can provide sustainable and increasing reductions in GHG emissions without relying
                         on public subsidy; and Increase the availability of financing for renewable energy (RE) investments, enterprises and intermediaries through the establishment of a
                         financial facility with a long-term time horizon, which will provide seed capital for debt co-financing of RE projects.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is well on its way to meet its development objectives. During Phase 1 of a municipal energy efficiency retrofit program 18 schools and kindergartens have been retrofitted.
                         In addition, more than 20 additional schools and kindergartens are being retrofitted on a 50 % co-financing basis during Phase 2, which is due to be completed in February 2013. The
                         retrofits of municipal institutions are demonstrating the benefits and cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency investments. Based on the results of the GEF supported project the

                         Government is preparing a nation-wide program for energy efficiency in public building that will lead to a significant scale-up of energy efficiency investments.

                         The project has supported a regulatory framework for renewable energy (RE) that has led to an expansion of RE installations. The project's Sustainable Energy Credit Line has
                         financed a 1 MW solar PV plant, which is the first large solar photo-voltaic installation in the country. Several similar solar plants and a wind farm have now been constructed or are
                         under construction.
