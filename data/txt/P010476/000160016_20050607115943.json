The lessons the project provided related to\n            the effectiveness of a separate component for land\n            acquisition and economic rehabilitation in economically\n            rehabilitating project affected persons; the contribution of\n            an extended policy dialogue and detailed preparation to\n            project implementation; the need to continue a\n            multi-disciplinary approach to agricultural development\n            including flexible investment in agricultural services,\n            government extension services, and marketing networks. A\n            focus should be put on more efficient procurement\n            organization and procedures, as well as training in them;\n            reconsidering the efficacy of imposing less relevant and\n            difficult to enforce covenants; the need to involve\n            beneficiaries in planning, implementation, and monitoring to\n            improve transparency; engaging more experienced\n            nongovernmental organizations capable of training less\n            experienced NGOs; recognizing the role of water user\n            associations as change agents, especially those involving\n            women farmers; the need to contract reputed firms/make\n            quality-based selection of firms for software development;\n            the importance of drafting more detailed terms of reference\n            for twinning consultancies; and finally, the need to\n            consistently focus on policy issues, institutional\n            restructuring, and cost recovery throughout project implementation."}, "docdt": "2005-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
