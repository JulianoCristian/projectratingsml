PREFACE
1.       This is a Project Completion  Report (PCR) on the Kenya Wild-
life and Tourism Project, involving an IBRD loan in the amount of
US$17.0 million to the Republic of Kenya, with the objective of
increasing visitor capacity while protecting the environment in three
wildlife areas. The loan was approved on July 1, 1976 and became
effective on November 10, 1976. The closing date of June 30, 1982 was
extended to June 30, 1984 and ultimately to June 30, 1985. Final
disbursement was made on December 31, 1985 at which time the remaining
balance of US$0.2 million was cancelled.
2.       The PCR was prapared by Bank  staff in the Africa Region, and
i-s based on the Staff Appraieal Report (No. 1022-KE) dated March 31,
1976, the President's Report (No. P-1878-KE) dated June 15, 1976, the
Loan Agreement (No. 1304-T-KE) dated July 9, 1976, the trnscripts of
the Executive Directors meeting at which the project was considered,
and on a study of Bank files and supervision reports.
3.       Following standard  Operations  Evaluation Department proced-
ures, copies of the PCR were sent to the Borrower on February 9, 1989
for comments. The Borrower's response is reproduced as Attachment I.

KENYA
VILDLIFE AND TOURISM PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SUM(ARY AND CONCLUSIONS
1.1      Kenya's unusual combination of attractions of climate and beaches
with scenery and wildlife together with supportive Government policies and
a dynamic private sector have produced one of the most highly developed
tourist industries in sub-Saharan Africa. Though traffic growth has
fluctuated with changes in economic conditions in the main market
countries, visitors from outside East Africal increased from 65,000 in the
mid-1960s to about a quarter of a million in the mid-1970s and half a
million by the mid-1980s. Visitors from outside East Africa numbered
550,000 in 1986.
1.2      The Bank identified several projects in the tourism sector in
Kenya during the early 1970's. It was finally agreed with the Kenyan
authorities that priority should be given to a project which would focus on
wildlife and on expanding the visitor capacity of three of the parks which
were of particular significance in tourist itineraries within Kenya.
1.3      At. the time of the appraisal the growth of visitor traffic to some
wildlife areas had already resulted in serious cotgestion and environmental
damage. Hence in recognition of the importance of wildlife to the future
of tourism in Kenya and of the need to take measures both to increase
visitor capacity and protect the environment, the project was designed to
achieve these objectives in three areas, in two of which - Amboseli and
Masai Mara - visitor traffic had already reached levals which constituted
an actual or potential threat to the environment, and in a third -
Samburu/Buffalo Springs - where major increases in traffic could be
accommodated without environmental damage were the development of the area
to be properly planned.
1.4      Many game parks and reserves are not self-contained ecological
units. Much of the game disperses to surrounding pastoral areas during the
wet season. Hence continued access to these areas is essential. To give
an incentive for ranchers in the dispersal areas to provide continued
access to these areas, it was intended that under the project arrangements
should be made to enable these ranchers to share in the revenues from
tourism.
1.5      At the time of the appraisal licensed hunting and game poaching
were threatening the survival of rarer species. Subsequently, the Kenya
Government prohibited hunting, and under the project funds were to be
provided to strengthen the anti-poaching forces of the Wildlife Department.
l/Defined as Kenya, Uganda and TAnzania.



v 
1.6      The overall implementation of the physical components of the
project was carried out substantially in line with the description of the
project attached to the Loan Agreement.
1.7      The actual cost of the project totals about Kshs.345.6 million or
about 182 more than the appraisal estimate of Kshs.292.3 million. The cost
of the project in U.S. dollars equivalent, taking into account the effects
of exchange rates changes on project expenditures during the period of
Implementation, amounted to US$32.2 million or almost 121 less than the
appraisal estimate of US$36.4 million.
1.8      Actual costs for individual project components vary greatly from
those estimated at appraisal. The variations result partly from changes in
the scope 6f works and partly from cost increases due to delays in project
implementation.
1.9      At the time of appraisal it was estimated that a period of five
years would be required to implement the project. The actual
implementation, however, required about nine years from effectiveness of
the loan. Reasoas for the delay were mainly late start due to lack of
essential staff; difficult coordination in the appointment of consultants
for preparation of design and bidding documents, which according to
Government structure fell under the responsibility of different ministries,
and, at least at times, lack of local fundin,.
1.10     Procurement was generally carried out according to provisions in
the Loan Agreement and to the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. With the
exception of two or three contracts, all were awarded to Kenyan or Kenya
based contractors and/or suppliers. In some instances work was delayed
because of different views on which authority would be responsible for
implementation, e.g. water supply for park Headquarters. Engineering
Consultants and Quantity Surveyors were selected mostly by the Ministry of
Works in accordance with Government procedures. In retrospect it appears
that the assignment of fewer consultants would have facilitated project
coordination and administration, particularly, in respects of civil works.
1.11     Disbursement of loan funds was much slower than expected at
appraisal, mainly because of delays in project implementation. The Closing
Date of the loan was postponed twice. The original Closing Date of June
30, 1982, was postponed to June 30, 1985, with disbursements continuing to
December 31, 1985. At that time an amount of approximately US$180,600
remained undisbursed and was cancelled.
1.12     The economic evaluation at the appraisal was based on a
calculation of the costs and benefits derived by each 'ecosystema i.e. the
Amboseli, Masai Mara and Samburu/Buffalo Springs parks/reserves together
with the surrounding game dispersal areas. Visitor numbers to the three
areas increased from some 140,000 in 1978 to more than 300,000 in 1986, and
accommodation capacity in the three areas more than doubled to reach 2070
beds in 1986. With an increase in the occupancy rates in wildlife lodges
and campsites, guest-nights in these facilities increased from 203,000 in
1978 to 512,000 in 1986.



- vi -
1013     The economic rates of return as estimated at appraisal and
presently for the three wildlife areas are as follows:
Appraisal    Re-evaluation
(X)              (Z)
Amboseli                         18.6            33.9
Masai-Mara                       15.7            35.9
Sambuuru/Buffalo Springs         16.2            10.1
Combined                         15.6            28.9
1.14     The higher rates of return reflect primarily the faster growth of
visitor traffic than foreseen at appraisal, except to the Samburu/Buffalo
Springs where traffic growth has been below earlier expectations.
1.15     The additional jobs created in the accommodation sector of
approximately 1000 by 1986 compares closely with the estimate made at
appraisal.  The estimate of employees per bed made at appraisal pt. Ved
realistic, while the bed occupancy rates in lodges and camps were l jher
than estimated at appraisal. No other data on employment created ini the
three areas are presently available.
1.16     The incremental gross foreign exchange earnings from the project
are estimated at US$19 million equivalent in 1986. At constant dollars
this is approximately 50X greater than the appraisal estimate of gross
foreign exchange earnings for that year.
1.17     The project has been successful in that physical execution has
been largely completed and the expected benefits in the form of increased
visitor flows have been realized. The expected benefits in the form of
improved visitor management in the wildlife areas, reduced environmental
damage and the wider sharing of revenues from tourism have not yet been
realized or have been realized only in part. With the exhaustion of loan
funds and general budgetary constraints, it appears that inadequate
resources are now being allocated both to park operation and maintenanee
and to the anti-poaching programs of the Government.
1.18     Although the importance of tourism's contribution to Kenya's
foreign exchange earnings is acknowledged and the role of wildlife viewing
in the development of tourism is recognized, the attention given to
improved planning and management of wildlife resources and to the measures
needed for the better conservation of these resources appears to have
diminished with the completion of the project. Hence, consideration might
be given to follow-up assistance focussing particularly on the priority of
wildlife in the context of the development of the Kenyan economy and on the
further measures needed to conserve and manage the county's wildlife
resources in an optimal way. While the success of the Bank supported
Wildlife and Tourism Project in terms of its economic rate of return
substantially exceeds expectations, the earlier concerns about the longer
term future of Kenya's wildlife and its relation to the future of the
tourist industry persist and need to be addressed.



KENYA
WILDLIFE AND TOURISM PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. IrRODUCTION
1.1      Kenya has tourist attractions of climate, scenery, beaches and
wildlife which are matched by few other destinations. These assets have
provided the basis for the development of a tourist industry which has been
an important economic activity for over fifty years. With the fast
development of air transport and the relative reductions in air fares in
the 1960's, a holiday in East Africa came within reach of increasing
numbers of potential travellers in Europe and North America. Thereafter,
despite setbacks following the increases in energy prices in the early and
late 1970's and the consequential recessions in the World economy. travel
to Kenya has continued to increase. The growth in traffic was matched by
the growth of visitor capacity and totrism has for a number of years been
Kenya's second most important source of foreign exchange earnings, after
coffee.
1.2      The Bank identified several projects in the tourism sector in
Kenya during the early 1970's. It was finally agreed with the Kenyan
authorities that priority should be given to a project which would focus on
wildlife and on expanding the visitor capacity of three of the parks which
were of particular significance in tourist itineraries within Kenya.
1.3      The project was appraised in July 1975; the loan for US$16 million
was signed in July, 1976 and became effective in November, 1976.
II. SECTORAL BACKGROUND
2.1      Kenya's unusual combination of attractions of cl. mate and beaches
with scenery and wildlife together with supportive Government policies and
a dynamic private sector have produced one of the most highly developed
tourist industries in sub-Saharan Africa. Though traffic growth has
fluctuated with changes in economic conditions in the main market
countries, visitors from outside East Africal increased from 65,000 in the
mid-1960s to about a quarter of a million in the mid-1970s and half a
million by the mid-1980s. Visitors from outside East Africa numbered
550,000 in 1986.
2.2      Though business traffic is significant and Nairobi has become an
important regional center for conventions and international conferences,
about three-quarters of all visitors are on vacation. Visitors from
Europe, the great majority on holiday, account for nearly 60X of all
visitors.
l/Defined as Kenya, Uganda and Tanzanis.



-2-
2.3      The Kenya coast is the principal destination for vacation visitors
from Europe, and over a half of all hotel bed-nights are spent at the
coast. Nairobi is the main centre for business and conference tourism and
is the principle point of departure for wildlife safaris.
2.4      Although most holiday visitors spend the bulk of their time at the
coast, the great majority of these join a more-or-less oxtended wildlife
safari, and among some national groups (e.g. visitors from North America)
-wildlife viewing is the principal purpose of their visit to Kenya.
2.5      At the time of the appraisal the growth of visitor traffic to some
wildlife areas had already resulted in serious congestion and environmental
damage.  Hence in recognition of the importance of wildlife to the future
of tourism in Kenya and of the need to take measures both to increase
visitor capacity and protect the environment, the project was designed to
achieve these objectives in three areas, in two of which - Amboseli and
Masai Mara - visitor traffic had already reached levels which constituted
an a      or potential threat to the environment, and in a third -
Sam-.4lBuffalo Springs - where major increases in traffic could be
accommodated without environmental damage were the development of the area
to be properly planned.
2.6      Many game parks and reserves are not self-contained ecological
units. Much of the game disperses to surrounding pastoral areas during the
wet season. Hence continued access to these areas is essential. To give
an incentive for ranchers in the dispersal areas to provide continued
access to these areas, it was intended that under the project arrangements
should be made to enable these ranchers to share in the revenues from
tourism.
2.7      At the time of the appraisal licensed hunting and game poaching
were threatening the survival of rarer species. Subsequently, the Kenya
Government prohibited hunting, and under the project funds were to be
provided to strengthen the anti-poaching forces of the Wildlife Department.
III. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
3.1      In November 1970 a Bank mission visited Kenya to help identify
possible projects and assist in the design of preinvestment studies. At
that time the master planning of a major new resort area on the southern
coast of Kenya was seen as the first priority. Consultants were
subsequently commissioned to do the work.
3.2      However, when an agricultural sector mission visited Kenya in the
fall of 1972, the potential of the wildlife resource for tourism, as well
as the ecological problems and inadequate planning which threater.ed it,
were highlighted. The Government then decided that a project to develop
wildlife tourism should assume priority over beach development.
3.3      An inter-ministerial working party was established and prepared,
with assistance from the Bank's Regional Mission in Nairobi, a Project
Identification Report in July 1974. In November 1974, a project
preparation mission reviewed the Report and specific project items were
selected for further preparation.



-3-
3.4      Th. project was appraised in July 1975 by an appraisal mission
consisting five Bank staff members and three consultants, the latter
covering mainly ecological aspects. Benefits were estimated with the help
of a computer model developed by an UNDP/FAO resource economist. The
project's program of works and cost estimates were based on preliminary
engineering studies and were prepared in December 1975 prices. Allowances
were added for physical contingencies and for price escalt ion during the
anticipated period of implementation.
3.5      The project was designed to support Government in implementing its
policies for wildlife-based tourism as described in the Wildlife
(Conservation and Managenent) Act of 1976. These policies are in line with
the recommendations of the Bank's Agricultural Sector Review of 1973.
3.6      As defined at the time of appraisal and described in the loan
documents, the project consisted of the following partss
A. Development of facilities to increase the tourist capacity and
local development impacts of the Amboseli National park, the
Masai Mara National Reserve, Reserves of the Inner Northern
Circuit, comprising Samburu, Buffalo Springs and Shaba National
Reserves, the Marmar Ranch, and Lake Turkana National Park.
The facilities, varying according to project areas, included:
-  establishment and equipping of road constructions units;
-  construction of wildlife viewing tracks;
- provision of vehicles for Park/Reserve staff;
-  construction of entrance gates and related accommodations; and
- construction of Park/Reserve headquarters and community
facilities, e.g. dispensary, primary school, community center,
and vehicle maintenauce facilities.
B. Game-proof barriers, including
- construction and/or reconstruction of moats in various wildlife
area; and
- the erection of high-tensile steel fences of various
configurations and supported in part by electric fences.
C. Establishment of a Wildlife and Fisheries Training Institute
comprising:
- construction and equipping of teaching facilities and related
facilities;
- provision of student hostels;
- provision of staff housing; and
- provision of vehicles.
D. Provision of transport for the Wildlife Clubs of Kenya.
E. Establishment, equipping and staffing of a Wildlife Planning
Unit.



-4-
F. Policy and Feasibility Studies on Wildlife and Tourism
Development.
G. Support for anti-poaching activities, including
- construction and equipping of three anti-poaching unit
headquarters with staff housing, administrative, maintenance,
and community facilities; and
- provision of vehicles, tents etc. for staff of anti-poaching
units.
3.7      The ant'-poaching component of the project could not be determined
in detail at appraisal because the request to finance these activities had
not been made earlier. It was included subject to Government submitting a
detailed program for review by the Bank Agreement was reached in 1977 and
the units set up in 1978.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Effectiveness
4.1      The Loan Agreement dated July 9, 1976, specified October 7, 1976,
as the date of loan effectiveness, and as condition to the effectiveness
the appointment of the Project Manager as head of the Project Management
Unit (PMU) which was to be established under the project. The loan became
effective on November 10, 1976.  The delay was due to difficulties in the
selection and appointment of the Project Manager.
Covenants
4.2      The Loan Agreement included a comprehensive set of covenants and
also of disbursement conditions reflecting the complex nature of the
project and the consequences of the Wildlife (Conservation and Management)
Act, 1976, requiring changes in Government's administration relating to the
protection, conservation and management of wildlife in Kenya. The Act
which became effective on February 13, 1976, provided inter alia for the
establishment of the W- dlife Conservation and Management Department within
the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife. Although Government made
considerable efforts to comply with the covenants, which were based on its
own policies, the results were mixed.
4.3      Problems were encountered mainly in the fulfilment of the
covenants listed in Section 3.07 of the Loan Agreement which required
Government to assume responsibility for the management of those National
Reserves where development was financed under the Project on behalf of the
County Councils in whom the land is vested. In return, the County Councils
were to receive a share of the revenues from their respective reserves.
The County Councils involved were the Narok (Masai Mara National Reserve);
Samburu (Samburu National Reserve); and Isiolo (Buffalo Springs and Shaba
Reserves) County Councils. Long and intensive negotiations were held by
Government with the Councils involved. However, no formal agreements could
be reached. Upon receiving assurances from Government that the



-5-
negotiations with the County Councils would continue and recognizing the
difficult and sensitive nature of the negotiations the Bank agreed to waive
the disbursement conditions relating to expenditures in the Reserves. A
Cabinet Paper was prepared proposing that all National Reserves (not only
those located in Project areas) should be managed by Government, and also
proposing financial arrangements, including provision for operational and
maintenance costs, similar to those reflected in the loan documents. No
final solution has been found so far but efforts are continuing by the
Wildlife Conservation and Management Department of the Ministry of Tourism
and Wildlife and the Ministry of Local Government representing the local
authoritiea. In the interim, Management Committees have been set up for
the Reserves including representatives from the Wildlife Department so that
measures concerning protection, conservation and management of wildlife in
the respective areas can be coordinated.
4.4      Another covenant which could not be fully met is Section 4.03 of
the Loan Agreement concerning insurance of facilities included in the
project with "responsible insurers". It is Government's policy to maintain
insurance policies with outside insurers only in respect of aircraft.
Losses and/or damage in respect of Government vehicles and other facilities
are covered through provisions in the annual budget.
4.5      All other major covenants were reasonably complied with.  Various
deadlines, however, needed to be extended during project ir-plementation.
Planned and Actual Implementation
4.6      At the time of appraisal it was estimated that a period of five
years would be required to implement the project. The actual
implementation, however, required about nine years from effectiveness of
the loan. Reasons for the delay were mainly late start due to lack of
essential staff; difficult coordination in the appointment of consultants
for preparation of design and bidding documents, which according to
Government structure fell under the responsibility of different ministries,
and, at least at times, lack of local funding.
4.7      Under the project a Wildlife Planning Unit (WPU) was to be
established, to be funded initially from loan funds. The Government of
Kenya, however, was reluctant to apply loan funds for the financing of
staff on expatriate terms. As at that time local staff was not available,
the establishment of the WPU was therefore delayed. Finally, it was set up
with the assistance from the Government of Canada through the Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA) providing staff and financial
assistance over a period of four years, starting in 1979. As the
responsibilities of the WPU included the preparation of management and
development plans for parks and reserves, implementation of works financed
under the project slipped. During the period of assistance by CIDA, local
staff was trained and a number of studies in areas where adequate
information and data for planning was lacking, were completed. The unit
continued its work after the departure of CIDA staff in 1983, blat with
constraints with regard to professional staff and finance, the
effectiveness of the unit appears to have declined.



-6-
4.8      The overall implementation of the physical components of the
project was carried out satisfactorily and substantially in line with the
description of the project listed in schedule 2 to the Loan Agreement, with
the exception of development described for the Marmar Ranch. As proposed
under the project the Ranch has been acquired by the Livestock and
Marketing Division of the Ministry of Livestock. Government decided,
however, not to use it for tourism but to continue its use as a holding
ground for livestock to be auctioned. There was, therefore, no need to
carry-out any development there under the project.
4.9      Major studies on wildlife and tourism development carried out
under the project include the Study on Future Management of Very Large
Hervivores (V.L.H.) and the Study on Pricing Policy for the Tourism Sector.
Both were implemented by consultant's and supervised by Steering Committees
appointed by Government. Although the V.L.H. study did not always proceed
without criticism it is generally felt that both studies provide a valuable
input for policy considerations regarding management of wildlife and
pricing, e.g. park entrance fees. Several other studies were done andlor
supervised by the WPU.
4.10     A successful part of the project was the anti-poachint component,
consisting of the staffing, equipping and funding the operation of three
anti-poaching units. As a result, poaching of wildlife was reduced
considerably. Unfortunately, since the completion of the project operation
of the units is seriously hampered by lack of funds to meet running costs
and for repairsireplacements of equipment (vehicles and aircraft).
4.11     Equipment for the three road construction units established under
the project at Amboseli national Park and at Masal Mara and Samburu
National reserves was acquired early.  Its operation, also financed under
the project, was delayed considerably because of the delay in establishing
the WPU (see para 4.07) and the late preparation of park development plans
by the WPU. The lengths of additional game viewing tracks constructed was,
therefore, less than anticipated during appraisal. The following were
completeds
Amboseli National Park - 215 km;
Masai Mara Natl. Reserve - 201 kmi and
Samburu/Buffalo Springs Reserves - 160 km.
The intended purpose of increasing visitor capacities and protecting the
environment has been partly achieved. In particular, at Amboseli,
vegetation has improved since cross-country driving of vehicles was
restricted by the construction of tracks, ditches and similar measures.
Since Project Completion, continuation of the operation is hampered by lack
of funds, as in the case of the operation of the anti-poaching units, and
to some extent also because of the still unsettled issue of the management
of the Reserves (para. 4.03).
Proiect Cost. Procurement and Disbursements
4.12     The actual cost of the project totals about Kshs.345.6 million or
about 18Z more than the appraisal estimate of Kshs.292.3 million. The cost



-7-
of the project in U.S. dollars equivalent, taking into account the effects
of exchange rates changes on project expenditures during the period of
implementation, amounted to US$32.2 million or almost 122 less than the
appraisal estimate of US$36.4 million.
4.13     Actual costs for individual project components vary greatly from
those estimated at appraisal. The variations result partly from changes in
the scope of works and partly from cost increases due to delays in project
implementation. Table 1, and Table 2 below give a comparison between the
estimated and actual cost by components (page 15 of Appraisal Report) and
by items (Annex 1, Table 1.2 of Appraisal Report).

Procurement and Disbursements
4.14     Procurement was generally carried out according to provisions in
the Loan Agreement and to the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. With the
exception of two or three contracts, all were awarded to Kenyan or Kenya
based contractors and/or suppliers. In some instances work was delayed
because of different views on which authority would be responsible for
implementation, e.g. water supply for park Headquarters. Engineering
Consultants and Quantity Surveyors were selected mostly by the Ministry of
Works in accordance with Government procedures.  In retrospect it appears
that the assignment of fewer consultants would have facilitated project
coordination and administration, particularly, in respects of civil works.
A list of major contracts awarded to consultants, civil works contractors
and suppliers is given in Annex 1.
4.15     Disbursement of loan funds was much slower than expected at
appraisal, mainly because of delays in project implementation.  The Closing
Date of the loan was postponed twice. The original Closing Date of June
30, 1982, was postponed to June 30, 1985, with disbursements continuing to
Decembe- 31, 1985. At that time an amount of approximately US$180,600
remained undisbursed and was cancelled.
4.16     As mentioned above delays in implementation occurred partly
because of insufficient budgetary allocations to executing agencies whic.
in turn resulted from other financial cons.raints to Government. Following
extensive discussions with Treasury and Ministry officials, the Bank agreed
in June, 1984, to amend Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement (Withdrawal of the
Proceeds of the Loan). The amendment increased the overall percentage of
disbursement to almost 80 per cent of expenditures, mainly to enable
Government to cope with the increased foreign exchange requirements
associated with the operation of various items of equipment and vehicles,
provision of game-proof barriers (erection of steel fences instead of game
moats), and other items. The amendment was helpful in enabling Government
to complete the project.
Use and Performance of Contractors, Suppliers and Consultants
4.17     Construction work completed by various contractors throughout the
project was generally satisfactory and of good quality. In a number of
cases, however, the time for construction had to be extended. The
construction of the teaching facilities for the Naivasha Wildlife and
Fisheries Institute was interrupted when the contractor died in a road
accident in 1983. Family members continued to run the company, but in 1985
the contract had to be terminated because of poor performance. Much
valuable time was lost. Another contract was then awarded in May, 1985,
and work completed in late 1986.
4.18     Suppliers of vehicles, aircraft and equipment were almost all
based and/or represented in Kenya. Their performance was generally
satisfactory.



- 11 -
4.19     As mentioned earlier a relatively large number of architects,
engineering consultants and quantity surveyors were engaged for the
preparation of design and bidding documents and for the construction
supervision of project facilities. Their performance was generally good.
Some delays, however, occurred in the preparation of design for the
Naivasha Institute, because of frequent change-over of staff involved.
4.20     Except for short periods at the start of project implementation,
the Project Management Unit (PMU), was well staffed and facilitated the
overall progress and coordination of all project activities.
ReDorts and Auditing
4.21     Quarterly progress reports, in a format agreed with the Bank early
in project Implementation, were generally comprehensive and accurate,
although seldom prepared on time. It appears that the preparation of such
reports every six months might have allowed a more timely submission of the
reports.
4.22     Project accounts were maintained by the PMU.  They were to be
j            audited for each financial year, as agreed by the Bank, by the Controller
I            and Auditor General of Kenya, and copies of the audited accounts were to be
furnished to the Bank not later than four months after the end of each such
;            year.  Considerable delays in the auditing of the project accounts were
experienced as the accounts were part of the Ministry's annual
appropriation accounts. By November 1986 certified and audited accounts of
the project had been submitted up to June 30, 1983, only. Accounts ior
1983/84 and 1984185 are under audit and certificates are expected soon.
They will be forwarded when received.
V. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
5.1      The economic evaluation at the appraisal was based on a
calculation of the costs and beuefits derived by each 'ecosystem' i.e. the
Amboseli, Masai Mara and Samburu/Buffalo Springs parks/reserves together
with the surroundings game dispersal areas. A detailed survey of costs and
benefits was made by consultants at that time. No similar survey has been
possible for the PCR but in view of the very limited (and conflicting) data
available from government sources, a survey of investments in, and revenues
and operating costs of accommodation facilities in the three ecosystems was
commissioned from consultants. The following analysis is based mainly on
the data provided in the consultants report together with the data provided
by the Government and limited data available from other sources.
5.2      The project was designed to make possible increased visitor
traffic to the three wildlife areas without further deterioration of the
environment, and to stimulate the expansion of accommodation capacity to
support the increase in visitor flows. Both objectives have been largely
met, though additional investments in game viewing tracks and other
conservation measures are required to avoid further damage to the
environment.



- 12 -
5.3      Visitor numbers to the three areas increased from some 140,000 in
1978 to more than 300,000 in 1986, and accommodation capacity in the three
areas more than doubled to reach 2070 beds in 1986. With an increase in
the occupancy rates in wildlife lodges and campsites, guest-nights in these
facilities increased from 203,000 in 1978 to 512,000 in 1986. The fastest
growth in traffic over the period was to Masai-Mara where guest-nights rose
from 82,00 in 1978 to 267,000 in 1986 and the annual occupancy rate in all
types of accommodation rose from 60% to 69%.  In both Amboseli and Samburu-
Buffalo Springs, guest-nights approximately doubled to reach 180,000 and
62,000 respectively in 1986, while the occupancy rates in all types of
accommodation in both areas remained at about 652 over the period. These
are high average annual occupancy rates for essentially reasonal
destinations, and, in fact, in the high season demand has substantially
exceeded supply.
5.4      The overall financial results, as reflected in the figures of
revenues and operating costs (at current prices) of accommodation units
appear satisfactory. The margin between revenues and operating costs has
varied between the three areas, being lowest in Samburu/Buffalo Springs and
highest in Masai-Mara. In the former, the operating profit (before fixed
charges) was in the range 20x-30% of revenues over the period. At
Amboseli, the operating profit consistently exceeded 30% over the period,
while at Masai-Mara it has been in excess of 50%. The high demand for
Masai-Mara and the high profit rates achieved resulted in a faster
expansion of visitor capacity there than in the other two areas.
5.5      At the time of the appraisal, a detailed survey of expenditures by
visitors to the three ecosystems was made, which evaluated revenues
accruing to accommodation units, and revenues from park entry fees, guide
fees, transportation within the parks/reserves and shopping. As indicated
above, the new survey made for the PCR relates to accommodation units only,
while the data received from Government sources on revenues from entry
fees, rents, etc. are incomplete and not always consistent. Hence the
breakdown of expenditures made for the appraisal has been used, together
with the data from the new survey, to derive the pattern of visitor
expenditures for the PCR.
5.6      The survey made for the appraisal distinguished between two
classes of visitors, those resident in Kenya and non-residents. Spending
by the latter is substantially greater than by the former both because the
latter mostly stay in the higher priced accommodations, and because they
travel in commercial (tour operator) vehicles rather than their own cars.
Comparable figures have been derived for the PCR from the new survey.
5.7       verage daily expenditures in the three wildlife areas included in
the project (at 1986 prices) were approximately Kshl200 for non-resident
visitors and Ksh450 for residents. Approximately 602 of the expenditures
of non-resident visitors 's spent on accommodation with the balance being
spent on game-viewing drives, park entry fees, guide fees, shopping and
incidentals. A slightly lower proportion of expenditures by resident
visitors is spent on accommodation. Based on the cost breakdown derived
from the recent survey made for the PCR and the appraisal survey, gross
operating profits from expenditures on accommodation and other services
have been calculated. Investments in the expansion of accommodation



_ 13 -
capacity were estimated in tha PCR survey. These together with the
investments made in the three wildlife areas under the project have been
re_ated to the incremental net benefits derived from the increases in
visitor traffic to the three areas.
5.8      Based on these data the economic rates of return as estimated at
appraisal and presently for the three wildlife areas are as follows:
Appraisal    Re-evaluation
(Z)              (Z)
Amboseli                         18.6            33.9
Masai-Mara                       15.7            35.9
Inner Northern Circuit           16.2            10.1
Combined                         15.6            28.9
5.9      The higher rates of return reflect primarily the faster growth of
visitor traffic than foreseen at appraisal, except to the Inner Northern
Circuit where traffic growth has been below earlier expectations.
Emplovment and Balance of Payments Effects
5.10     The additional jobs created in the accommodation sector of
approximately 1000 by 1986 compares closely with the estimate made at
appraisal. The estimate of employees per bed made at appraisal proved
realistic, while the bed occupancy rates in lodges and camps were higher
than estimated at appraisal. No other data on employment created in the
three areas are presently available.
55.11    The incremental gross foreign exchange earnings from the project
are estimated at US$19 million equivalent in 1986. At constant dollars
this is approximately 50X greater than the appraisal estimate of gross
foreign exchange earnings for that year. The appraisal report estimated
the net foreign exchange receipts, excluding capital transactions and debt
service, at approximately 801 of gross earnings. While the consultants
study for the PCR did not provide later data on net foreign exchange
earnings, the appraisal ratio appears consistent with other studies of the
net earnings of the tourism sector in Kenya.
Distribution of Benefits
5.12     The appraisal report identified five principal groups of
beneficiaries under the project: (i) the Central Government; (ii) the local
County Councils; (iii) the group ranchers in the dispersal areas; (iv)
private sector investors; and (v) employees in tourist and related
facilities. Data on revenues accruing to these groups are partial and in
some instances conflicting. Official figures show park entry fees of about
Ksh4.7 million annually at Amboseli in 1984 and 1985, and Kshl.3 million
and Kshl.7 millioa at Samburu in the same two years, but only Ksh830,000 at
Masai Mara in 1983 (figures for later years not being available). Given
the numbers of visitors to Masai Mara, the latter figure is unlikely to be
correct. Data. obtained from the PCR survey show total taxes paid by
accommodation units of KshS3.3 million in 1986 of which about half(Ksh25.4



- 14 _
million) was paid to local County Councils. Wages paid to employees in
accommodation units totalled Ksh42 million in 1986, almost three times more
than in 1978. No data are available on the revenues from tourism accruing
to group ranchers (see para 6.5 below).
VI. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
6.1      A basic objective of the project was to assist the government to
improve the management of the country's wildlife resources. The appraiaal
report noted that major ecological problems resulted from the rapid growth
of the country's human population with the consequential pressures on
limited land resources, both in terms of the expansion of land areas under
cultivation and of the increasing numbers of domestic animals competing
with wildlife for grazing.  These pressures appear to have intensified over
the past decade and it is unlikely that the project has had a significant
impact on them.
6.2      In the limited areas on which the project was focussed-the
wildlife reserves of Amboseli, Masai Mara and Samburu/Buffalo Springs- the
project aimed to reconcile increasing tourist flows with an improved
environment by drawing up and implementing physical plans for each area and
introducing improved management systems. The physical plans included the
development of new road networks and look-outs points which would enable
visitors to view game without driving their vehicles across the plains with
consequential damage to the grasslands and increased erosion.
6.3      The physical plan for Amboseli was implemented and with better
enforcement of regulations against off-track driving, an improvement in the
vegetation of the park has been observed. In Masai Mara and
Samburu/Buffalo Springs, the park plans were only partly implemented, as
indicated above (para 4.11) and the improvements in management of these
reserves have not yet been achieved. With the very rapid increase in
visitor numbers to Masai Mara and little control of off-track driving,
deterioration of the vegetation has occurred. Perhaps more important,
however, is the pressure on the Mara ecosystem from the spread of
agriculture on its borders and the increasing cattle populations, which
migrate into the reserve.
6.4      At the time of appraisal, concern was felt about the future
maintenance and operation of the Masai-Mara and Samburu/Buffalo Springs
reserves. As a condition of the loan, the Government undertook to
negotiate with the County Councils in these areas agreements by which
revenues from entry fees and lodge rentals would be shared between the
councils and central government, and the Government would assume
responsibility for the maintenance and operation of facilities in the
reserves (para 4.03). Despite repeated efforts to negotiate such
agreements, none has yet been concluded. One consequence has been that
inadequate funds have been allocated from council revenues for the
maintenance of park facilities, including road networks. Even in Amboseli,
which being a National Park is under the direct control of the Ministry of
Tourism and Wildlife, funds for the maintenance and operation of the park
are currently inadequate, and the substantial revenues from visitor
entries, which become part of the general revenue funds of the Treasury,
are diverted to other purposes.



_ 15 -
6.5      A further concern at the time of appraisal was the need to
maintain access for wildlife to grazing areas outside the parks and
reserves during the wet season.  Access to such areas means that wildlife
competes for grazing with the cattle of the local people, and in order to
provide the people with an incentive to preserve wildlife, it was agreed
that formal arrangements would be made to guarantee to local pastoralists
(group ranchers) minimum returns from wildlife in the form of payments for
grazing rights from government out of revenues derived from tourism. This
approach was in accord with government policy as reflected in the Sessional
Paper on Wildlife of 1975 and the Wildlife (Conservation and Management)
Act of 1976. Agreements were concluded with group ranchers in the
dispersal areas of Amboseli, and payments to these ranchers continued for
five years. At the end of that time Government decided that other revenues
accruing to the local people provided adequate compensation and the
payments for grazing rights ceased. No such agreements were concluded with
group ranchers at Masai-Mara or Samburu/Buffalo Springs.
6.6      As indicated above (para 4.40) the component of the project
designed to strengthen the anti-poaching forcen of the government appears
to have achieved its objectives initially.  As a result of this
strenthening, the activities of poachers were greatly curtailed and losses
of elephants and the rarer species were substantially reduced for several
years. More recently, funds to operate the anti-poaching units appear to
have been inadequate, the activities of poachers have increased and losses
of elephants and rare species, such as rhino, to poachers are again rising.
VII.  THE BANK'S ROLE
7.1      Bank support for the government's plans to develop tourism in
relation to the management and conservation of Kenya's wildlife was in
retrospect appropriate. The emphasis given to improved planning and
management of wildlfe areas, initially in the three parkasreserves
selected, appears to have been correct, and the planning carried out with
Canadian assistance and the support given to strengthen the anti-poaching
programs of the government were positive contributions. The physical
components of the project were implemented satisfactorily, although with
considerable delays, and the timing and frequency of supervision missions
appears to have been appropriate.
7.2      The concerns felt by the Bank at the time of appraisal about the
broader aspects of wildlife conservation and management appear to have been
justified. These concerns were reflected in important conditions of the
loan relating to the disbursements for civil works only after the
conclusion of agreements between Government and group ranchers in the
relevant dispersal areas, and between Government and County Councils for
the management by government of National Reserves included in the project.
In the event these agreements were not made and the Bank subsequently
waived the conditions of disbursement rather than see project execution
come to a stop. However, the problems earlier foreseen appear to persist.
The funds allocated for the management and maintenance of facilities of the
National Reserves by the County Councils from their substantial revenues
from tourism are inadequate, and insufficient attention appears to have



-16-
been given to securing the full co-operation of the local people (group
ranchers) in the conservation of wildlife by ensuring that they receive an
appropriate share of the revenues from wildlife viewing.
VIII. CONCLUSION
8.1      The project has been successful in that physical execution has
been largely completed and the expected benefits in the form of increased
visitor flows have been realized. The expected benefits in the form of
improved visitor management in the wildlife areas, reduced environmental
damage and the wider sharing of revenues from tourism have not yet been
realized or have been realized only in part. With the exhaustion of loan
funds and general budgetary constraints, it appears that inadequate
resources are now being allocated both to park operation and maintenance
and to the anti-poaching programs of the Government.
8.2      Although the importance of tourism's contribution to Kenya's
foreign exchange earnings is acknowledged and the role of wildlife viewing
in the development of tourism is recognized, th' attention given to
improved planning and management of wildlife resources and to the measures
needed for the better conservation of these resources appears to have
diminished with the completion of the project. Hence, consideration might
be given to follow-up assistance focussing particularly on the priority of
wildlife in the context of the development of the Kenyan economy and on the
further measures needed to conserve and manage the county's wildlife
resources in an optimal way. While the success of the Bz,k supported
Wildlife and Tourism Project in terms of its economic rate of return
substantially exceeds expectations, the concerns about the longer term
future of Kenya's wildlife and its relation to the future of the tourist
industry persist and need to be addressed.
