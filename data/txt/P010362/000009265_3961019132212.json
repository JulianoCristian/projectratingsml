The project achieved its major objectives, its\n            impact on institutional development has been substantial,\n            sustainability is uncertain at this time, and the\n            performance of both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First,\n            project design should be fully responsive to government\n            expectations and people's needs by giving priority to\n            actions which ensure quick restoration of economic activity\n            and benefit the largest number of affected people. Second,\n            if certain technical studies are considered crucial to\n            provide updated plans, then special covenants in the\n            credit/loan documents should be included to stipulate a\n            timetable for such things as the preparation of TOR and\n            recruitment of consultants. Third, project procurement\n            procedures comprising LCB and post-qualification for a large\n            number of small contracts minimizes the delays usually\n            associated with ICB procurement of larger packages. Fourth,\n            the establishment of an effective PMU in the Ministry of\n            Finance enhances project performance and the probability of\n            success. Fifth, the establishment of separate\n            project-dedicated wings in the main implementing agencies\n            ensures that project activities are given special attention\n            and kept detached from the routine departmental activities.\n            Finally, firm Borrower's commitment provides a sound\n            foundation for efficient project implementation."}, "docdt": "1995-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
