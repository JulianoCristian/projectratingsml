SUBJECT:  Project Completion Report on Egypt
Vocational Trainine Project (Loan 2264-EGT)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Egypt - Vocational Training
Project (Loan 2264-EGT) prepared by the Middle East and North Africa Regional Office.
Part II was prepared by the Borrower.
The objectives of the project were to increase the quantity and quality of
trained manpower in the construction and manufacturing sectors and to improve planning,
management and evaluation capacities in the training departments of the two relevant
Ministries, viz. of Development, Housing and Land Reclamation and of Industry and
Mineral Resources, respectively.
The larger of the two subprojects (relating to the construction industry) was
implemented as appraised and the relevant training institutions are almost fully utilized.
The subproject relating to the manufacturing sector, however, was abandoned, and the
related loan funds cancelled.
The outcome of the reduced project is rated as satisfactory; it produced a
substantial amount of institutional development. Sustainability is rated as likely.
Compliance with loan conditions was good.
No audit is planned.

PROJECT CONPLETION REPORT
EGYPT
VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT (LOAN 2264-EGT)
PREFACE
1.          This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Vocational
Training Project in the Arab Republic of Egypt (Egypt), for which a Bank loan
2264-EGT, in the amount of US$38.0 million was approved on April 19, 1983. At
Government's request, a total of US$20.38 million was cancelled during the
project's implementation phase. The project closed on March 31, 1993 after
three extensions of the original closing date (September 30, 1990).
2.          The PCR was jointly prepared by the Population and Human Resources
Division, Country Department II of the Middle East and North Africa Region
(Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III), and the Borrower (Part II).
3.          The report is based, inter alia, on information contained in the
Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan Agreement, supervision reports,
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, internal Bank memoranda and
data collected in the field. A project completion mission visited Egypt in
December 1993.

PROJECT C1MPLETION REPORT
EGYPT
VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
(LOAN 2264-EGT)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectives and Scope
i.          The project objectives were to assist the Government in
implementing priority vocational training programs by:
(a)   increasing the quantity and quality of trained manpower in the
construction sector and establishing a new training materials
production center;
(b)   increasing the quantity and quality of trained manpower and
instructors in the industrial sector by improving existing
instructional materials and developing new ones; and
(c)   improving the planning, management and evaluation capacity of
the training departments in the Ministry of Development, Housing
and Land Reclamation (MDHLR) and the Ministry of Industry and
Mineral Resources (MOIMR) by providing Technical Assistance (TA).
MDHLR's training department is known as the Training Organization
of the Ministry of Housing and Reconstruction (TOMOHAR). The
MOIMR's training department is the Productivity and Vocational
Training Department (PVTD).
ii.         To achieve these objectives, the project provided financing for:
(a)   TOMOHAR, to construct, equip and furnish twenty-two vocational
training centers (VTCs) and one instructional materials center;
(b)   PVTD, to construct/extend, equip and furnish six VTCs and one
Instructor Training Institute (ITI); and
(c)   technical assistance (TA) for: MDHLR comprising 199 person-months
of specialist services and 136 person-months of fellowships; and
for MOIMR comprising 93 person-months of specialist services and
266 person-months of fellowships. Specialist services were
provided for institution building, while fellowships were intended
to improve the ministries' capabilities to plan, manage and
evaluate vocational training programs. Six person-months were
also provided for specialists services to prepare studies for
future projects.



-iv-
Project Implementation
iii.        The larger of the two project components (TOMOHAR) was implemented
as designed: all twenty-two VTCs were established as well as an additional
five centers; equipment for the centers (including mobile training units) was
procured; and technical assistance to establish the centers was provided
(para.11). Local budget resources rather than Bank funds, were used to
finance civil works for the TOMOHAR centers, resulting in the cancellation of
US$5.0 million from the loan. Allocations for technical assistance
(fellowship training and consultant services) were also not fully utilized
because of the availability of a grant from the (British) Overseas Development
Agency (ODA), and the Government's reluctance to use loan funds for TA-related
activities.
iv.         The PVTD component, on the other hand, after a substantial delay
(about five years) in obtaining technical experts to assist with the
preparation of training programs, was not completed as the Government decided
to discard its apprenticeship trades program which the project intended to
support (para.16-17). The component was therefore cancelled (US$12.8 million)
without the construction of the new training center envisaged under the
project, or procurement of the equipment for six centers.
v.          The project was originally scheduled to close by September 1990.
The Bank agreed to extend the closing date on three occasions to facilitate
the completion of project components and additional procurement requirements
for the TOMOHAR agency. Specific implementation details are recorded in
paras. 11 through 19 by project component. TOMOHAR had completed all
specified loan covenants (para 18), while covenanted TA programs for the PVTD
component were delayed by five years. PVTD's progress and audit reporting
ceased once the component was cancelled in May 1991.
Proiect Costs and Financing
vi.         Total project costs (US$45.8 million) were 42% less than estimated
at appraisal (US$79.3 million). In part, this is due to the elimination of
most PVTD investments. More importantly, it reflects overestimated physical
and price contingencies (60% of baseline costs) which did not materialize.
The original financing plan had assumed that the Bank loan would cover 48% of
the project costs. However, the cancellation of a large part of the loan (the
PVTD component) and the lower project costs, reduced the Bank's share in
project financing to 39%. When the project finally closed, less than half the
original Bank loan (US$17.6 million out of US$38.0 million) had been
disbursed, to finance mainly the purchase of goods, and to a lesser extent
consulting services and fellowships. A remaining balance of US$2.6 million of
the loan was cancelled when the project closed on March 31, 1993.
Proiect Results
vii.        In view of the Government's decision not to utilize loan funds to
continue PVTD training programs funded under the project, the objectives of



this component were not accomplished. The project's achievements, therefore,
have been limited to the accomplishments of one of its components - TOMOHAR,
which completed its physical targets in providing twenty-seven training
centers. Student enrollments are nearing full capacity and male graduates are
able to secure employment in the construction industry but girls trained at
the centers in non-traditional trades for women have been less successful.
Technical assistance was provided to TOMOHAR by the Swedish firm, Swedec,
which provided training along with expertise to prepare training programs for
six skill areas, utilizing the modular employment skills system.   The
instruction materials center has been established, fully equipped and is
functioning satisfactorily.
Prolect Sustainabilitv
viii.       With the cancellation of the PVTD component, project
sustainability concerns TOMOHAR only, where positive steps have been taken to
improve teacher incentives and increase skill training opportunities. The
Ministry of Education is utilizing TOMOHAR centers to train school maintenance
workers and this is being undertaken through the Basic Education Improvement
Project (Cr. 2476-EGT). Budget allocations for vocational training programs
have been increased to meet the operating expenditures of TOMOHAR's expanded
VTC network of sixty-five construction training centers and also to provide
improved incentives for instructors. Overall, prospects for TOMOHAR's
sustainability are good.
Conclusions and Lessons Learned
ix.         The project's achievements have been limited to the
accomplishments of one of its components - TOMOHAR, which completed its
physical targets in constructing and equipping twenty-two training centers and
providing an additional five mobile centers. Student enrollments are nearing
full capacity and male graduates have little difficulty finding jobs for which
they have been trained. The appraisal team was overly optimistic about the
prospects for successful implementation of the PVTD component, primarily
because it was a follow-up to three earlier projects that had supported the
two agencies (TOMOHAR and PVTD) with some measure of success. The main
lessons learned concern sustainability and relevance of supported programs.
Under the project, females were provided with skills for work which is
culturally unacceptable in the communities in which they live. Likewise, the
PVTD component became irrelevant as the apprenticeship program which it was to
support was discontinued. Both these factors point to the first main lesson:
the need to include flexibility in project design, to closely monitor local
labor demand, and to require formal assessment of training programs and a
comparison of the skills provided with those in demand in order to increase
responsiveness to local industry and other employers. With regard to
sustainability, there are three lessons: (a) Overcentralization of
responsibility for preparation and delivery of training should be avoided; (b)
Adequate incentives to recruit and retain instructors must be ensured; and (c)
Careful monitoring is needed to ensure continuing relevance to local needs.

B.          Proiect Background
1.          Sector Development Obiectives.  The project was designed to
support the Government's main priority for education and training over the
1982-87 period--namely, the rapid development of skilled manpower to meet the
needs of a growing and increasingly diversified economy. Emphasis was placed
on: (i) making training opportunities more available and equitable, with
special attention to regional needs; (ii) correcting the imbalance between the
demand for and supply of manpower, with a major focus on industrial training;
(iii) improving the quality and relevance of the skills of the new and
existing labor force; and (iv) strengthening the institutional base for
manpower development.
2.          Linkages to Macro Obiectives.  The 1982/87 Plan envisaged industry
as the leading sector with average growth targets of 102 a year. To develop
the country's industrial potential, however, existing manpower constraints had
to be overcome. The establishment of an efficient vocational training system
therefore became an essential part of Egypt's industrialization strategy. The
construction sector was also considered vital to economic development, as
other sectors - including industry - depended on a growing volume of civil
works. As in the case of industry, a shortage of skilled manpower was a key
constraint faced by the sector. The Plan therefore promoted a rapid build-up
of training programs for construction and industrial workers as well as
management personnel.
3.          Previous Bank Support.   Between 1977 and 1980, the Bank supported
the Government's efforts to promote human resources development in Egypt, with
particular emphasis on technical and vocational education. The Bank's role in
support of education and training in Egypt was consistent with the
Government's priorities which were primarily to estabish a stock of skilled



2
manpower, a better balance between the demand for labor and its supply, and
equity in the distribution of opportunities. The Bank assisted specifically
with the development of instructor and teacher training facilities under the
First, Second and Third Education Projects (Credits 681, 868 and 1069-EGT).
These projects focussed on expanding and upgrading the training of managers,
technicians, and skilled and semi-skilled workers in industrial, agricultural,
construction and commercial trades; improvements and expansion of teacher and
instructor training in selected areas; education and manpower planning; and
providing limited support for health education. These projects were evaluated
as being well-implemented.   This project (The Vocational Training Project--
Loan 2264-EGT) followed up on the objectives of the first three projects.
C.          Project Obiectives and Components
4.          Objectives.  The project was to assist the Government in
implementing priority vocational training programs that would:
(a)   increase the quantity and quality of trained manpower in the
construction sector by establishing additional VTCs for
construction skills, as well as an instruction materials center to
develop new, and improve existing, instructional materials;
(b)   increase the quantity and quality of trained manpower and
instructors in the industrial sector by establishing one new VTC,
by extending and/or re-equipping five existing VTCs and one
existing ITI, and by developing new, and improving existing,
instructional materials; and
(c)   improve the planning, management and evaluation capacity of the
training departments in the MDHLR and MOIMR through technical
assistance.
5.          Components.  In support of its objectives, the project was to
provide financing for:
(a)   the MDHLR's training agency TOMOHAR to construct, equip and
furnish a nation-wide network of twenty-two VTCs and one
instruction materials center;
(b)   the MOIMR's training agency PVTD to construct/extend, equip and
furnish six VTCs and one ITI; and
(c)   technical assistance for both training agencies (TOMOHAR and PVTD)
through specialists' services and fellowships; some specialists
and fellowships were provided for institution building at the
MDHLR and the MOIMR, to improve their capabilities to plan, manage
and evaluate vocational training programs.

D.          Proiect Preparation and Design
6.          The project was prepared by the Borrower following a Bank
identification mission in 1981 (see Part III, Table 2). An appraisal mission
visited Egypt in May 1982. Negotiations took place in February 1983, and the
Board approved the Loan (US$38.0 million) on April 19 of that year. The Loan
Agreement was signed on June 6, 1983 and became effective five months later.
The project was designed to achieve an equitable distribution of vocational
training centers throughout the regions, to improve the quality and relevance
of labor force skills, and to strengthen the institutional base for manpower
development.
7.          MDHLR.  The project included support for MDHLR through the
construction and equipping of twenty-two vocational training centers
nationwide, in order to complete the ministry's complement of sixty-five
centers envisaged in the 1982-1986 Development Plan for TOMOHAR. The new
centers were to provide urgently needed training opportunities for low income
groups and to reduce regional inequalities in the availability of vocational
training opportunities through the distribution of the training centers in
fourteen governorates. The equipment allocated to the TOMOHAR centers
included thirteen mobile training units to serve as centers.
8.          MOIMR.  The project also included support for MOIMR through the
construction of one new VTC, the extension of five existing centers, and the
equipping and furnishing of these centers which are under the management of
the MOIMR's training agency, PVTD. PVTD's main objective is to provide the
industrial sector with the necessary manpower required at different skill
levels and specialties. At the time of project design, PVTD conducted and
supervised an apprenticeship system and issued a diploma equivalent to the
technical secondary education diploma issued by the Ministry of Education
(MOE). In addition, PVTD assists companies and governmental authorities in
establishing their own training capacities and facilities, and in training
their trainers. Support to PVTD through the project was expected to be
critical to the goal of alleviating the severe shortage of skilled workers in
the industrial sector and upgrading the apprenticeship program which had been
in operation for ten years prior to the project's design.
9.          Technical Assistance.  For the MDHLR, support through TA consisted
of staff development at TOMOHAR headquarters made up of specialists services
(five persons) and six fellowships in the areas of training systems, project
management, administration, financial planning, data systems and instruction
training planning.   At TOMOHAR's instructional materials center, two
specialists and six fellowships were provided in the fields of audio visual
aids and audio visual equipment maintenance. The TA design stressed
curriculum and staff development at the TOMOHAR VTCs, and for this training,
fifteen specialists and sixty-four fellowships were provided in eight skill
areas (of which forty-four were for instructor training and center directors).
10.         For the MOIMR, one specialist was allocated for staff development
at PVTD headquarters to upgrade the ministry's apprenticeship system, while
four fellowships were to be provided for the apprenticeship system and four
others for project management. With regard to the curriculum and staff



4
development at the ITI, the services of eight experts were allocated for as
many skill areas with a corresponding allocation of sixteen fellowships in
each area, along with one for the Director of the ITI. The PVTD VTCs were
allocated three specialists for three skill areas, thirty-one fellowships in
seven skill areas and six fellowships for the Directors of the six centers to
upgrade the curriculum and for staff development. Six person-months of
specialist services were also provided under the project for the preparation
of studies for future projects.
E.          Project Implementation
11.         The larger of the two project components (TOMOHAR) was implemented
as designed: a total of twenty-seven VTCs were established; equipment for the
centers (including mobile training centers) was procured; and technical
assistance to establish the centers was provided. The PVTD component, on the
other hand, was terminated at Government's request when it decided to end the
PVTD apprenticeship training program. This led to the cancellation of a major
part of the loan (US$12.8 million). In addition, local budget resources,
rather than Bank funds, were used to finance civil works for the TOMOHAR
centers, resulting in the cancellation of another US$5.0 million. Allocations
for technical assistance were also not fully utilized because of the
availability of a grant from the (British) Overseas Development Agency (ODA),
and the Government's reluctance to use loan funds for TA-related activities.
In the end, less than half the original Bank loan (US$17.6 million out of
US$38.0 million) was disbursed to finance mainly the purchase of goods, and to
a lesser extent consulting services and fellowships (Part III, Table 8). The
remaining balance, US$2.6 million, of the loan was cancelled when the project
was closed.
12.         The project was originally scheduled to close by September 1990.
The Bank agreed to extend the closing date on three occasions to facilitate
the completion of project components and related additional procurement
requirements for the TOMOHAR agency. The final closing date of the project
was on March 31, 1993. Specific implementation details are recorded below by
project component.
MDHLR (TOMOHAR) Component
13.         Original project estimates envisaged that all construction would
be completed by mid-1989. With the exception of two centers (Edfu and New
Damietta), the TOMOHAR VTCs did begin operations from early 1985 through late
1989. The remaining two centers experienced considerable delays in their
completion due to contractual problems but they were completed in January
1994.
14.         Eguipment procurement progressed satisfactorily with the centers
fully supplied by the completion of their civil works. Tenders were prepared
as early as January 1985 and the first package of goods, in the amount of
US$10.1 million was delivered by February 1988. Subsequent deliveries
followed through March 1993. The Bank approved the purchase of five
additional mobile training centers (eight were acquired originally) for remote



5
areas, as well as some replacement and additional tools and equipment for the
centers that had been in operation since 1984. The agency was not able to
acquire special imported dump trucks for the centers because the Government
procurement agency stipulated that vehicles had to be procured locally.
15.         Table 5 provides a breakdown of the planned and actual utilization
of the component's allocation for technical assistance. Although about U$2.4
million had been allocated for support to the MDHLR and TOMOHAR, only US$1.4
million was utilized for this purpose as, beginning in 1986, the Government
began to discourage the use of loan funds for foreign technical assistance in
favor of grant financing. Nevertheless, 83 percent of the person-months
planned for specialists services under the project and 44 percent of the
fellowships were completed, primarily through a Swedish consulting firm,
financed by the Bank. Twenty-two students and fourteen directors received
fellowships of two months and one month each, respectively. Expert services
were provided by that consulting firm and consisted of twelve experts in
vocational training skill areas who served as instructors to the centers
between February 1985 and August 1987. Some of the specialists were also used
to assist in preparing equipment lists for the VTC equipment. The quality of
the technical assistance provided was satisfactory.
MOIMR (PVTD) Component
16.         PVTD civil works, as envisaged under the project (extensions to
five training centers and one new center), were not completed. Ongoing
training programs were terminated by the Government and Bank funded activities
for the programs were cancelled (para.l1).
17.         Furniture & Eauipment Procurement.  A contract was initiated with
a consulting firm in August 1990 for the procurement of equipment for PVTD
training centers, but was terminated by PVTD before the equipment could be
purchased.   In May 1991, the Government requested that the Bank cancel all
remaining loan funds for the PVTD, US$12.8 million (the bulk of which were for
furniture and equipment). The ongoing VTC and ITI programs, which the project
was to support, were ended.
18.         Technical Assistance.  There was a five-year delay in PVTD's
contracting of expert services to carry out the planned TA. Several bilateral
agencies such as the ILO, GTZ and the British Council made proposals to
provide this assistance, but were rejected in favor of grant assistance for TA
and a preference for using only local experts. During 1987, PVTD succeeded in
securing a grant from the ODA which represented 102 person-months of
fellowships, enabling seventeen engineers and instructors as well as three top
managers, including the PVTD Chairman, to participate in training and study
tours. About 41 percent of the activities envisaged for the fellowship
component for the PVTD was completed. Work under an ILO TA contract began in
July 1990 to provide expert assistance for the ITI programs. ILO provided
this support until May 1991, having completed about 95 percent of the planned
program, when PVTD terminated the contract. ILO's completed work represented
23.5 person-months of international expert services (out of 29 person-months
contracted) and 56.5 person-months of local expert services (out of 57 person-
months contracted).

Compliance with Loan Covenants
19.         As stipulated in the relevant loan agreement sections, TOMOHAR was
able to develop and expand the content of its existing training courses and
increase their duration; new TOMOHAR facilities were established at the Tenth
of Ramadan City with a full complement of qualified staff. TA agreements were
signed and effected for TOMOHAR, but PVTD's TA agreements were almost five
years late in the finalization of their arrangements and only partially
completed as the component was cancelled. Progress reporting from TOMOHAR was
timely and of satisfactory quality and their audit reports (project account
statements prepared by the Government's central accounting agency) were
submitted annually. PVTD progress and audit reporting was satisfactory until
the component was cancelled in May 1991.
Project Costs and Financing
20.         Total project costs (USS45.8 million) were 42% less than estimated
at appraisal (US$79.3 million). In part, this is due to the elimination of
most PVTD investments. More importantly, it reflects overestimated physical
and price contingencies (60% of baseline costs) (see Part III, Table 6). The
original financing plan had assumed that the Bank loan would cover 48% of the
project costs. However, the cancellation of a large part of the loan and the
lower project costs, reduced the Bank's share in project financing to 39%
(Part III, Table 7).
F.          Project Results
21.         In view of the changes made in training for the industrial sector
and the Government's decision not to utilize loan funds to continue training
programs funded under the project, the objectives of the PVTD component were
not accomplished. In retrospect, the responsibility for the sector's training
was over-centralized in one agency (PVTD), which did not benefit from the
expertise provided through the project to assess ongoing training programs and
respond to the needs of local industry. On the other hand, the TOMOHAR agency
did accomplish its physical targets envisaged under the project and five
additional mobile training centers were purchased. Student enrollment and
output levels have been rising and are expected to reach the projected target
by 1995. Male graduates from the centers have no difficulties finding
employment in parastatal construction firms due to the expanded Government
mandate in providing low-income housing. Female trainees were not as
successful in locating jobs in the male-dominated construction industry.
Equipment and furniture procurement was completed satisfactorily for TOMOHAR,
with the exception of some vehicles which were identified as necessary for the
centers but which could not be purchased with project funds due to Government
procurement regulations for foreign vehicles (para.14). Nevertheless,
additional equipment and replacement tools were acquired for the centers as
well as five additional mobile training centers. Technical assistance was
provided to TOMOHAR by a Swedish consulting firm, which provided training
along with expertise to prepare training programs for six skill areas



7
utilizing the modular employment skills system.   The instruction materials
center has been established, fully equipped and is functioning satisfactorily.
22.         The use of mobile centers for training was effective and their
upkeep and overhead costs were low. The mobile units enabled greater outreach
of training programs and are periodically moved to different locations which
lack such training facilities. However, two of them became stationary to the
point that makeshift buildings were constructed around them. Policy and
planning for the movement of these centers is dependent upon the assessment of
needs conducted by local and regional authorities.
G.          Prolect Sustainability
23.         The development of the TOMOHAR training system over the previous
three Bank projects (see Part III, Table 1) and finally through this project,
has been quite successful, to the extent that their centers have been selected
to train local engineers in school building maintenance under the Basic
Education Improvement Project (Cr. 2476-EGT). Training programs,
nevertheless, should be assessed regularly by the agency to ensure
responsiveness to the needs of local industry. Sustainability of TOHOHAR
activities has been facilitated by its management's commitment to the agency's
goals and priorities. In addition, the fact that the agency's leadership, as
well as senior ministerial personnel have remained constant over the past
seventeen years has enabled the agency to sustain the quality of its output
and reach its objectives. Moreover, the incentive structure for VTC
instructors continues to improve and is expected to ensure staff retention and
increase enrollments. Budget allocations for vocational training programs
have been increased to meet the operating expenditure. of the expanded VTC
network of sixty-five training centers.
H.          Bank Performance
24.         The Bank's commitment to continuing its support to TOMOHAR, which
began with the First Education project (Cr.681), was well focused and
supervision of the Vocational Training project was timely and comprehensive.
In retrospect, the appraisal team did not anticipate (a) the Government's
preference for local financing and procurement for the VTC construction and
extension programs; (b) the inefficiency of over-centralizing training in one
agency; and (c) the need to ensure formal assessment of ongoing training
programs to promote responsiveness to the requirements of local industry.
Supervision missions could have identified the lack of access for females to
employment in the construction industry as a problem to be addressed with
project authorities.
I.          Borrower Performance
25.         From the inception of project implementation, there were frequent
revisions of the loan allocation for civil works and technical assistance
under the project, which resulted in the cancellation and reallocation of a



8
sizeable portion of the total loan amount from these categories. TOMOHAR
officials executed their component with considerable efficiency, and were
consistent in their support of the project's objectives. Moreover, the
agency's management, which remained stable during the project's
implementation, sought ways to utilize loan funds expeditiously, especially
when it could not proceed with some of its original procurement needs.
J.          Borrower-Bank Relations
26.         TOMOHAR agency officials were always available to provide
necessary project documents for supervision missions and to facilitate their
visits to project sites. They responded promptly to Bank requests and
recommendations, particularly those outlined in supervision mission reports.
K.          Consulting Services
27.         Foreign experts used by TOMOHAR were fully satisfactory in the
execution of their programs. Swedish experts were used to provide training
and services for TOMOHAR between February 1985 and August 1987. Their support
included expertise in preparing training programs (learning materials) on the
modular employment skills system for six skill areas. These tools were
completed, translated, revised and applied in most of the training centers.
Some German bilateral assistance (conducted by the ILO) was also available for
TOMOHAR between 1980 and 1985, and again between 1989 and 1991.
L.          Prolect Documentation and Data
28.         The relevant data for the preparation and implementation phases of
the project were readily available as well as clear and concise. Both the
staff appraisal report and legal agreement provided the necessary background
material for the project's implementation phase and the preparation of the
project completion report. Progress reporting, particularly by TOMOHAR, was
well-documented, timely and greatly facilitated the work of the supervision
missions whose reports, prepared by Bank staff and consultants during the
project's implementation, were very useful in monitoring the progress of
project activities.
M.          Conclusions and Lessons Learned
29.         The project's achievements have been limited to the
accomplishments of one of its components - TOMOHAR, which completed its
physical targets in constructing and equipping twenty-two training centers and
providing an additional five mobile centers. Student enrollments are nearing
full capacity and male graduates have little difficulty finding jobs for which
they have been trained. The appraisal team was overly optimistic about the
prospects for successful implementation of the PVTD component, primarily
because it was a follow-up to three earlier projects that had supported the
two agencies (TOMOHAR and PVTD) with some measure of success. The main



9
lessons learned concern sustainability and relevance of supported programs.
Under the project, females were provided with skills for work which is
culturally unacceptable in the communities in which they live. Likewise, the
PVTD component became irrelevant as the apprenticeship program which it was to
support was discontinued. Both these factors point to the first main lesson:
the need to include flexibility in project design, to closely monitor local
labor demand, and to require formal assessment of training programs and a
comparison of the skills provided with those in demand in order to increase
responsiveness to local industry and other employers. With regard to
sustainability, there are three lessons: (a) Overcentralization of
responsibility for preparation and delivery of training should be avoided; (b)
Adequate incentives to recruit and retain instructors must be ensured; and (c)
Careful monitoring is needed to ensure continuing relevance to local needs.
PART II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
TOMOHAR
30.         Comment on Part III.  All information, except the number of the
additional new mobile centers,1 is correct, and the analysis is also very
realistic.
31.         Bank Performance.  The World Bank's performance during the project
implementation was excellent, the Bank understood the major reasons for site
changes and the re-allocation of the civil works component. The Bank's
missions were helpful; provided guidance to solve any problems or delays; and
their advice and professional cooperation was important to the success of this
project.
32.         Borrower's Performance.  TOMOHAR's performance was very good in
spite of certain difficulties met during sites selection which delayed the
construction of some VTCs. At the beginning, the Central Auditing
Organization responsibilities were not clear, which delayed the annual
auditing reports. The relationship between TOMOHAR and the World Bank was
very constructive and effective during all project stages. Through the
completion of this project, (in addition to credits 681 and 868), TOMOHAR
completed its National Plan of VTCs all over Egypt.
/  Part I of the report has been amended to reflect that five (and not six)
additional mobile units were procured.

COMMENTS:
1.  At the Goverrnent s request, loan funding for TOMOHAR civil works was
cancelled. Of the 22 centers constructed under the project, 20 were
fully operational by September 1989; the remaining two were completed by
January 1994.
2.  One center at Sohag was to be constructed under the project - this was
cancelled by the Government.
3. The originaL project-financed procurement for TOMOHAR was completed by
December 1987.  Additional mobile units C5) and equipment were procured
through early 1993.
4. No goods were procured for PVTD under the project. An expenditure of
5232,473.59 under the equipment and furniture category of the loan for
this component was utilized, with Bank permission, for goods under the
Third Education Project (Cr.1069-EGT), which also financed the PVTD
agency and closed in December 1987.
5. Fellowships and specialist services were provided by a Swedish consulting
firm through June 1988.
6. ODA fellowships (102 person-months) as well as ILO training (8 person-
months) were completed by PVTD through August 1987.
7. ILO specialist services for the ITI as well as ILO experts for
equipment list preparation were utilized by PVTD through May 1991.

COMMENTS:
1.      Specialist services for TOMOHAR were provided by consultants who assisted with the preparation of
equipment lists and in the training of VTC trainers.
2.       ILO speciaLists were used to prepare equipment Lists for PVTD.  A contract was also wade with ILO to
provide speciaList services for the preparation of the ITI and VTC curricula.
3.       In 1987, PVTD received a grant from the ODA for 102 person-months of feLLowships.  Seventeen
engineers, instructors and 3 managers (Including the Chairman) participated in training nd study
tours arranged by the ODA.
4.      No project preparation studies were prepared.
