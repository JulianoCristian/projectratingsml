Lessons\n            of experience suggest that \"Adaptable Program\n            Loans\" may not be sufficiently adaptable when a project\n            succeeds in convincing policymakers that the project merits\n            replication and expansion. When the pace of change is such\n            that the originally conceived program grows much faster than\n            envisioned, the APL framework may actually inhibit\n            adaptation, versus the use of a series of follow-up\n            projects. Projects that finance small, demand-driven\n            community subprojects through decentralized implementation\n            structures, must greatly simplify financial management\n            processes, especially those related to the validation of\n            disbursements and expenditures. Attention should be given to\n            establishing output/outcome-related approaches, and having\n            as well a capacity building approach for best practices in\n            management, and the administration of inputs incorporated\n            into project and community subproject design. Mainstreaming\n            and scaling-up of projects is extremely desirable from many\n            perspectives. However, from a project management perspective\n            there are risks that must be dealt with in an intentional\n            fashion. Scaling-up too fast, rapidly increases the\n            administrative complexity, and can dilute the administrative\n            and technical capacities directed toward project\n            implementation as well as limit the potential impact, and\n            ability to innovate and learn. Finally, the program\n            demonstrated that technical assistance is a very important\n            factor in triggering and fostering rural development in\n            marginal areas, and that upstream, preparatory work in\n            participatory social diagnosis, and planning are essential\n            tools for reaching the poor, and tailoring actions to what\n            is appropriate to their situation."}, "docdt": "2004-12-13T00:00:00Z"}
