There are four components. The first\n            component finances demand-driven investment sub-projects for\n            agricultural production, natural resources management,\n            processing activities, and minor productive infrastructure\n            through a matching grant system. Sub-projects include\n            farming equipment and tools, inputs for cultivation or\n            livestock, animals, construction material, small works and\n            installations, processing machinery, small irrigation and\n            drainage works and equipment, plantations and nurseries,\n            technical assistance and specialized training, and storage\n            facilities for inputs and products. The second component\n            funds the preparation and implementation of simple plans of\n            community-based natural resources management using\n            participatory rural assessment methods, small projects of\n            indirect benefits related to community activities, studies\n            for the preparation of community development plans and\n            works, workshops and training for capacity building,\n            management of savings schemes, etc. The third component\n            provides extension services, technical support and training\n            of farmers and producers organizations; establishes\n            demonstration plots, and organizes workshops and training.\n            The fourth component finances institutional strengthening\n            and project administration."}, "docdt": "1999-11-24T00:00:00Z"}
