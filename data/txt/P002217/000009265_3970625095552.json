assist the Government in its plan to improve the quality\n            and efficiency of its primary and post-primary education\n            system. The Third Education Project will accomplish this by\n            providing for the supply and distribution of textbooks and\n            other teaching materials, establishing a self-sustaining\n            textbook/teaching materials replenishment scheme, and\n            strengthening the management and planning capacity of the\n            Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education (MINEPRISEC) and\n            the Ministry of Public Service and Professional Training\n            (MINIFOP) through training and studies.  In addition, the\n            project will assist in alleviating shortages of critically\n            needed manpower by providing for a technical secondary\n            school and a national vocational training center."}, "docdt": "1986-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
