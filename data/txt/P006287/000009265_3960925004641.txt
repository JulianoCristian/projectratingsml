PREFACE
This is a performance audit of four projects designed to develop
the rural sector (through credit, extension and integrated activities) in
the Federative Republic of Brazil.   Loan  1317 provided $83 million for on
lending to agro-industry. It was approved by the Board in July 1976, and
was closed in July 1984 with $33.7 million (41%) undisbursed. Loan 1362
provided $41 million for integrated ru.al development of the south-west of
the State of Minas Gerais.   It was  approved by the Board in January 1977
and was closed in December 1984 with $0.95 million (2%) being cancelled.
Loan 1568 provided $100 million to support development of a national exten-
sion service. It was approved by the Board in May 1978 and was closed in
December 1985, having been fully disbursed. Loan 1589 provided $37 million
for integrated rural development in the Paraguacu region of Bahia State.
It was approved by the Board in June 1978, and was closed in August 1986,
with $10.63 million (29%) being cancelled.
This audit consists of a memorandum prepared by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) and four Project Completion Reports (PCRs),
prepared by the staff of the former Latin America and Caribbean Region,
Ag-Aculture Division B. The audit memorandum is based on a review of the
Appraisal Reports (Nos. 974-BR, 1291-BR, 1879-BR, and 2009a-BR), the Loan
Agreements and PCRs.   Correspondence  with  the Borrower and internal Bank
memoranda on the project issues contained in Bank files have been con-
sulted, and relevant Bank staff have been interviewed.
The audit finds the PCRs accurate with respect to the projects'
principal achievements and difficulties.  The points discussed by the audit
have been selected as likely to be of particular importance in the design
of future projects aimed at assisting the Government in the development of
Brazilian agriculture in general and NE Brazil in particular.
Audit findings were discussed with officials in Brazil in May
1988, and the draft report has been modified in the light of these discus-
sions. Project beneficiaries were met, and their experiences with the
project were discussed.    The  Borrowers'  acknowledgement with respect to
Loans 1317 and 1589 are included as an Attachment.
The valuable assistance provided by the Government, its officials
and other individuals met during the preparation of this audit memorandum
is gratefully acknowledged.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
INTRODUCTION
The four loans covered by this PPAR, provide a sample of the
Bank's assistance to Brazil in the deielopment of the agricultural sector
in general, and the Northeast of Brazil (NE) in particular. While Bank
loans represent significant resources, it should be remembered that Govern-
ment supplies substantially more resources than it borrows for these devel-
opmental purposes; which in turn strictly limits the extent to which Bank
assistance can get ahead of current political realities.
These projects should be viewed collectively and in their histor-
ical context, both as important reflections of and influences on, the
development of political  ideas.    For  example,  taken  in isolation, the
modest increase in extension ataffs provided for in the Bahia and Minas
Gerais Rural Development (RD) projects appear less adequate than if seen in
tandem with a significant (US$100 million) effort such as the First Agri-
cultural Extension project, to develop a national extension system. This,
in turn, should be seen in the context of earlier decisions to develop,
with Bank assistance, a world class agricultural research system in Brazil.
The Bank's ability to affect the course of political thinking
through its projects is particularly important in the development of the
Northeast, a region traditionally associated with intractable problems of
poverty, drought and  inequitable  land  distribution.    The issue of land
reform was tackled in a major collaborative research effort between the
Bank and SUDENE (Superintendency for  Development of the Northeast),1/  the
results of which suggested that the absence of significant land reform
placed strict limits on the achievement of higher incomes for the poor. In
the interim, the Bank had continued to press ahead with projects, in the
belief that there were sufficient small farmers without tenure problems,
who could be assisted, and that the projects provided a useful context for
actively continuing to  press  the  case  for  land  reform.   The research
results tended to confirm the Bank's project experience and provided the
analytical underpinnings for the development of a political consensus in
favor of action for land redistribution.

Experience with Bank sponsored RD projects has continued to under-
line the limitations on poverty alleviation in the NE without increased
access by the poor to land and water, as well as small farmer oriented
extension, research and marketing  services.   Thus the joint consideration
of three projects (one to develop the national extension service, and two
RD projects; one Bahia, in the NE, and the other Minas Gerais, close by),
further clarifies their most important impacts and permits a comparative
review of a discrete and manageable amount of the Bank's lending. The
fourth project designed to lend for agro-processing raises some of the same
issues as the credit components of the RD projects, and provides inter-
esting lessons as to the difficulty of ensuring posit'.ve real interest
rates in the face of high inflation.
OBJECTIVES
The Second Agro-Industries Credit Proiect (AW2), was designed as a
follow-on project, to continue support for agro-processing investments
particularly in meat processing, grain handling, milk processing and mis-
cellaneous agro-industries including supply of basic agricultural inputs;
and to ensure positive real interest rates for these types of lending.
This required restricting the project's geographical scope to the South and
South-East, since other areas had subsidized credit programs with which the
Bank had no wish to see the project compete.
The First Agricultural Extension Prolect (AEI) was designed to
support the development of EMBRATER (Brazilian Technical Assistance and
Rural Extension Corporation), the national extension service, through which
Federal and donor funds flow to individual State extension services. The
development of EMBRATER was a logical complement to the Bank's earlier
support of EMBRAPA (Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation), the
national agricultural research organization.
The Bahia Rural Development Project (BRD) and Minas Gerais Rural
Development Projlect (MGRD) were designed to raise the productivity and
standard of living of the rural poor by providing superv-sed and subsidized
credit, and a wide range of other servises to small farmers in the target
areas of Bahia (Paraguacu) and Minas Gerais (Zona del Mata). These addi-
tional services included particularly health, primary education, potable
water, land titling and social extension.
IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE
The projects achieved mixed results, were characterized by sub-
stantial delays, and in the case of agricultural credit components exhib-
ited major problems of disbursements (chiefly due to counterpart funding
disruptions) and design, as they coped with competing subsidized credit,
incomplete monetary correction and a lending bias towards the larger small
farmers. Beyond this, the RD and AE1 projects included more than 16 imple-
menting agencies, with predictable problems of start-up and coordination,
while the BRD project encountered supervision problems especially in the
ability of the Bank to focus the required time and technical expertise on
the range of disparate components.

Monitorina and Evaluations The MGRD project was unusual in pro-
viding some usable farm level data from its M&E (monitoring and evaluation)
contract with the Federal University of  Vicosa.   This data shows (a) that
Assisted farmers had average farm size and income almost three times as
large as the Not Assisted farmers, but (b) that Not Assisted farmers gener-
ally performed better over the project period than the Assisted, perhaps
due in part to project extension services (PPAM para. 88). By contrast the
BRD project has no M&E date which allow project beneficiaries or effects to
be properly documented. The AEI project appears to have had a significant
production impact (PPAM para. 74).
Procurement: Procurement problems were minimal, since the predom-
inant purchases were relatively small and construction contracts were small
and  decentralized.    They  could   be  provided  competitively  by  local
suppliers.
Sustainability: Basic project sustainability appears to be good.
A 202 sample of processing facilities constructed under AI2, was showing
good capacity utilization at the time of the PCR. There was a continuing
problem of recurrent funding for the social sectors, particularly where, in
the face of rapid inflation, delayed disbursements resulted in a reduction
in the real resources transferred.    However, within these constraints the
new facilities were not discriminated  against.    The AE1 project was fol-
lowed by AE2 which continued support  for  the salaries of the extra exten-
sion staff, but provided for a phase  out  of Bank support over the life of
the project.
More fundamentally, the whole idea of providing significant
support services for small farmers has been accepted as an important part
of Government agricultural policy.    This  was reflected in the Government
sponsored study which led to the Pro3eto Nordeste initiative, and is con-
firmed by Government's continued borrowing for a "second generation' of RD
projects in the NE.
FINDINGS AND LESSONS
Credits   The  major  surprise  from  the  audit  is  the inappro-
priateness of the credit components for a country with (a) rapid domestic
inflation, (b) the use of subsidized credit as a major component of agri-
cultural policy, and (c) where incomplete (rather than complete) monetary
correction reduces the real burden of the national debt. The result was
conditionality for AI2 which lead to great difficulty in disbursements
(PPAM para. 8) and in the RD projects, to loans which differed little from
cash grants (PPAM para. 114). The lessons are (a) that any future lending
for agricultural credit should be based on a clear analysis of the ct'trent
weaknesses of the credit system in Brazil, and how the project will con-
tribute to their correction, (PPAM  para.  112)21   and (b) that RD project
2! This has been recognized as an intractable problem for over twenty
years. A quite wide range of unsuccessful approaches to its resolution
are already to hand, starting with the commodity indexed loans used
under the First Livestock Loan (516-BR) approved by the Board in
September 1967 (see also Annex B).

proposals for 'unindexed credit' should be justified in terms of cash
grants rather than as credit (PPAM paras. 32 to 36). Explicit grant
elements are already provided for in the *second generation" of RD
projects. However, it is important to separate the provision of grants and
credit, since the motivation for the two types of assistance should be
quite distinct.
The observed incomplete monetary correction under AI2, poses a
question for the Bank.   Should  it  lend  on terms which are significantly
more attractive than terms available to domestic savers?
Extension: The AE1 project can be characterized as principally
"bricks, mortar and staff". From the long-run view this was probably the
right priority since it established a firm bureaucratic position for the
extension service within the public sector agencies serving agriculture
(PPAM, para.  121).    The  relatively  intensive  service  (leading to the
majority of farmers getting no direct extension) provided for in the super-
vised credit components of the RD projects, emphasizes the need to explore
the 'methodology' of delivering technical (and profitable) information to a
wide audience of small farmers, as provided for in AE1 (PPAM para. 122).
As field staff are added, increasing tension can be expected to
emerge (PPAM para. 123 and footnote 25) between their use as technical
advisory staff versus generalists  av:lable  to deliver and coordinate the
delivery, of all Government assistance at the field level. The Bank should
certainly beware of supporting projects, in RD or elsewhere, which rely on
delivery through the extension service without providing for additional
manpower; and where new programs are designed to be delivered via the
extension service, the   Government  should  be  encouraged to fully budget
manpower requirements for additional staff.
Top-Down:   Overall  the  projects  appear  paternalistic and cen-
tralized.3/ It is Government, not private savers, who is expected to
provide the capital for  agricultural  development; an extension service is
provided in the RD projects chiefly to assist credit applications and
administer them; the Federal, rather than State Governments will provide
the major new funding for extension, etc. Planning and execution has been
essentially top down. There has been little recognition of the incentives
for private sector participation, and no scope for beneficiary initiatives
or participation. Notable exceptions to this rule were a) the evidently
successful private sector participation (banks and sub-project borrowers)
under A12; b) the contracting-out of M&E to Vicosa University under MGRD,
which produced useful data; and c) support for the not entirely successful
cooperative development under AEI and the RD projects. Future project
design could well take up explicitly, the proper balance between Federal,
State and local control, and suitable mechanisms to achieve this.
3/  These   terms   are   not   intended   pejoratively;   paternalism  and
centralization have their place.    Rather  the  intention is simply to
flag an apparent tendency in project design.

Land Redistribution: The very modest progress in BRD in the pro-
vision of land to the landless or farmers with inadequate holdings4l (as
distinct from "land titling", where farmers in possession of state land
without title were provided with official title to their holding), warns of
the difficulty of achieving significant land reform. The "second genera-
tion' of RD projects in the NE, have made significant progress on land
redistribution, and this is viewed as a necessary condition for their
implementation. In its absence the NE will continue to be plagued by the
problem of large amounts of underutilized land, underutilized labor and (in
non-drought years) underutilized water (PPAM par&. 125 to 126).
Agriculture's Role  Within  Regional  Development:    In  the MGRD
project, the Vicosa study shows that though subsidized credit went to small
farmers, the average credit recipients had about three times the initial
farmed area and almost three times the iritial net income of the average
farmer who did not get credit (PPAM para. 88). This poses very starkly the
problem of whether there are farmers who are "too small to help"? It is
sometimes implicitly assumed that with a sufficiently radical land reform,
there would be land (and water) for all, and the poverty problem would go
away.   This  may  be  unduly  optimistic,  especially  since complementary
services and investments are needed. A proper analysis could reveal limits
to the number of poor who can teasonably be expected to get land, even with
major  migratory  movements  within  the  NE.    There  is  a  need  to put
agriculture's contribution to the resolution of the poverty problems of the
NE in the proper context of population planning and the development of the
region as a whole (PPAM para. 132 to 134).
Many Lessons Learnt. Many of the points made in this audit have
long been appreciated by regional management, and have been incorporated in
the 'second generation' RD projects already presented to the Board. In
particular, both Government and the Bank have &greed that action on land
reform is a necessary condition for benefits from complementary initia-
tives.
Though the second generation RD projects have moved significantly
towards including distinct grant and credit components, these should be
completely separated (since the motivation for credit, subsidies and grants
should be quite distinct); and certainly the M&E vacuum which characterizes
BRD and AE1 (and an unfortunately high proportion of all Bank RD lending),
should not be allowed to continue.   It  is not sufficient to budget for an
M&E component. Supervision should require that this component produoe the
needed results. Finally, the Bank shosld perhaps make provision for a
continued serious research interest in the development of the NE, if only
to internalize the work already being undertaken by Brazilian institutions.

I. PROJECTS' BACKGROUND
Context
1.       The four projects were prepared  in the context of very successful
agricultural expansion (5.7Z annually) over the period 1967-74 and renewed
interest in agriculture both on productivity and welfare grounds. Though
agriculture had declined from 13.32 of GDP in 1966 to about 10.02 in 1975,
it continued to provide about 60% of the total value of exports. Agricul-
tural growth had been almost entirely due to area expansion, with rela-
tively little progress in increased agricultural productivity. However, in
the early 19709, the Government embarked on a major reorganization and
revitalization of the agricultural research system,l/ leaving th* way open
for a major  complementary  investment  in  extension.    The Bank had also
assisted with agro--industrial investments, particularly in livestock pro-
cessing.2/
2.       The Government's  National  Development  Plan  (1975-79)  aimed to
increase agricultural output by 402 during 1975-79. This was to be accom-
plished by stimulating increased production for export to continue the
agricultural sector's substantial contribution to foreign exchange earn-
ings, and by providing a means for raising income levels of the rural poor.
To achieve these ends  the  Government:    (a) allocated substantial public
resources to incorporate new areas into production through programs such as
the National Integration Program (PIN) and the new POLAMAZONIA (Development
Program for the Integrated Areas of Amazonia) and POLOCENTRO (Development
Program for the Integrated Central Areas) programs, which were to provide
agricultural credit and financing of transport and rural infrastructure in
the North and Central-West, respectively; (b) promoted a significant expan-
sion in the overall supply of agricultural credit; (c) reorganized federal
research and extension services to intensify efforts to improve produc-
tivity and to serve a broader segment of the rural population; and (d)
introduced special programs such as POLONORDESTE (Program of Development of
Integrated Areas of the Northeast), which was deaigned to improve small
farmers' productivity in the Northeast through the formulation and execu-
tion of integrated rural development projects.

million.
2/ Loan 924-BR, First Agro-Industries Credit Project, for $54 million.



3.       Brazil's economic growth rate was  impressive, and Government was
committed to substantial supportive agricultural interventions including
POLONORDESTE which focussed on the poorest and most economically depressed
large region in the country.   After  the Nairobi speech in September 1973,
the policy climate appeared appropriate for substantial Bank assistance to
agriculture, particularly of the type envisaged in the POLONORDESTE pro-
gram.
Oblectives
4.       The objective of the four  projects  can  be summarized as to con-
tinue support for a successful program of expansion of the agricultural
sector, tempered by additional lending to focus assistance to the rural
poor. The Rural Development (RD) projects zeflected the new Bank initia-
tives promised in Mr. McNamara's Nairobi speech.
5.       The decision to appraise the Second Agro-Industries Credit Project
(A12) followed from the apparent success of the First Agro-Industries
Credit Project, which by the end of 1974 had (a) built up a pipeline of
some 40 sub-projects under consideration with a total value of US$124
million and (b) was lending on the basis of a positive real interest rate
(PCR for First Agro-Industries Credit Project, Loan 924-BR para. 3.10). It
was thus natural to wish to avoid a hiatus when the first project had been
fully disbursed. By the time AI2 was presented to the Board its justifica-
tion was less clear (para. 40).
6.       Satisfactory progress with  the  Bank's  support for revamping the
agricultural research system (Loan -.249-BR) lead naturally into increased
investment in agricultural extension and the First Agricultural Extension
Project (AE1), both of which flowed from the observed relative stagnation
of yields in Brazilian agriculture.
7.       The two RD projects, Minas Gerais Rural Development Project (MGRD)
and Bahia Rural Development Project (BRD) were part of a portfolio of
Brazilian RD projects being designed at the time in response both to the
Nairobi speech and Brazilian concern for the rural poor. The latter was
motivated both by humanitarian considerations, and a pragmatic concern for
the accelerating problems of rural-urban and North-South migration.
DesiRn
8.       The ARro-Industries II Credit  project  was a straightforward con-
tinuation of Agro-Industries I, with some slight redistribution of pro-
jected lending between types of agricultural processing, and focussing on
the Central and Southern states.3/ It was intended to provide for positive
real interest rates (CSAR, para. 5.08) and provided budgets of illustrative
3/  The Northeast was excluded  from  the  project's  scope, because of the
already existing subsidized credit schemes.    Thus at least in project
design, a serious effort was made to avoid supporting the general
policy of subsidization of agricultural credit (CPCR, para. 2.03
footnote).

investments with ERRs in the range 37 to 47%, and financial rates of return
from 13 to 35% (CSAR, paras. 6.08 and 7.04). Though provision was made for
monetary correction of the amount owed, no provision was made for foreign
exchange risk, which was to be carried by the Central Bank. Provision was
made for a wide range of public and private sector banks to participate in
the onlending program, with funds to be provided from the Central Bank
(51%), the Bank (40%), and the onlending banks (9%). An unforeseen result
(para. 62), was that lending could be effectively interrupted by (a) lack
of demand in the light of the current lending terms, (b) unwillingness of
participating banks to lend on current lending terms, and (c) lack of funds
from the Central Bank.    At  least  one  of  these 'vetoes' was usually in
place.
9.       The SAR and President's  Report  for AI2  indicated that the loan
would be  onlent  at  positive  real  rates  of  interest.   In particular,
paragraph 36 of the President's Report states:
"Given the indexing of the outstanding principal of
subloans the 3% and 5% interest rates are positive in
real terms and would correspond to rates of about 9% to
11% in a country which did not practice indexing but
which experienced a rate of  inflation of 6%."4/
However, the Project Agreement only calls for:
"interest at a rate of 3% per annum in Region I and of 5%
per annum in Region II, plus adjustment based on the ORTN
price, as calculated in accordance with the regulations
in force on the date of this Agreement' (Schedule, Part
II para. 9).
Since the ORTN (National Treasury Bond) typically (Footnote 8) has lagged
significantly behind general measures of inflation, the Project Agreement
does not reflect the assurances given in the President's Report.
10.      The Bank did not  obtain  a  copy  of  the regulations referred to
above.  As a later memo said:
"We do not have the regulations on file, and because of
their complexity, it m.ght even be difficult to establish
a clear position as to what represents a valid interpre-
tation." (Memo from Projects, June 20, 1980).
This gap has been remedied.
41 While  9% monetary  interest  in  the  presence  of  6% inflation
corresponds to 2.83 % real rate of interest; 3% in addition to
full indexing of the principal tc account for say 60% inflation
corresponds only to 1.87% real rate of interest; at 300% inflation
it corresponds to 0.75% real interest.



-4-
11.      The term "monetary correction' is  not used in the loan documents,
but Brazilian usage makes "monetary correction' synonymous with changes in
the ORTN, and not with the more objective National Consumer Price Index
(INPC).5/   6/
12.      Peculiarities in calculation of the ORTN have includeds
(i) the purging of "accidentalities" such as massive oil price
increases;
(ii) 20% of the amount corrected to be based on an assumed infla-
tion rate of 15%; and
(iii)  in some cases (e.g., 1980)  pre-fixing the amount by which the
ORTN can change.
As late as 1986 the OTN has lagged the GPI by 28%. The usefulness of an
index subject to the above types of adjustment as a measure of "monetary
correction' remains in doubt.
13.      Project implementation  experience  (paras.  47  to  49), tends to
confirm that tying monetary correction (as understood in the Bank) to an
administratively determined index, the ORTN, was a significant design flaw.
14.      The provision that participating  banks  put  up some of their own
money, was an interesting design feature.    Even more than the agreed pro-
vision for indexing with ORTN (National Treasury Bond), the insistence on
private bank participation probably prevented lending when the prospects
for recovery of the real value of the loan was in doubt. This undoubtedly
slowed down the rate of disbursement, but prevented this credit program
from being transformed into predominantly a grant program.
15.      Any index of inflation will  tend  to  under-correct, in times of
rapidly accelerating inflation.   To  attempt  to overcome this difficulty,
"monetary correction" was tied to the proiected changes in the ORTN index,7/
5/ i.e., "702 monetary correction' means 70% of the change in the ORTN;
which itself may lag the INPC by up to 50%.
6/ The INPC (General Price Index, Global Supply) is also published in
purged and unpurged versions, where the purged version has been
corrected for 'accidentalities" such as the price increase for imported
fuel, the ending of a wheat subsidy, too little or too much rain, etc.
The result is that great care has to be taken to ensure correct
translation from economic concepts to available Brazilian data series.

which proved itself to generally understate likely changes in the ORTN,
which in turn understated the actual changes in the GPI.81
16.      The Agricultural Extension  I  project  was designed to strengthen
the Federal/State extension system, and to increase the services available
to small farmers particularly in the North, North-East and Central-West.
Prior to the innovation of secure9/   federal funding through the EMBRATER-
EMATER system, there had been a loose federation of state extension systems
under ABCAR (Brazilian Rural Credit and Assistance Association), with about
51 of the funding provided by a 21 levy on loans supervised for the Bank of
Brazil, (BB). This form of financing together with an emphasis on increas-
ing production naturally led to an emphasis on the credit and other
problems of large farmers. Secure federal funding was intended to allow an
expansion of extension in improving the productivity of farmers with
special emphasis on small farmers (SAR paras. 3.01 and 3.04). Subsequently,
in 1979, Government policy called for even greater attention by extension
to the problems of small farmers, even at the cost of some reduction in its
attention to the most rapid expansion of total agricultural production.
17.      Economic justification for the  project  as  presented in the ESAR
rested entirely on macro-economic assumptions as to the rate of shift of
the production function for farmers contacted:
Commencing  in  project  year   two,   a  shift  in  the
aggregated agricultural production curve should occur;
this shift will correspond to a shift in the production
functions, i.e., in the  productivity  of all crops grown
by project participants.' (ESAR, Annex 2, para. 5).
"- Extension services benefit evenly all activities
carried out by project participants accepting new agro-
technologies.
-The existing farm types ..... remain unchaned .
-The expected effects (31 increase in agricultural pro-
duction) .... distributed evenly  among  all crops
(ESAR, Annex 2, page 3, emphasis added).
A suitable disclaimer is made as to the impossibility of making detailed
projections for project impact  in  a  country  as  big as Brazil, but this
disclaimer appears to have been used to avoid presenting even one example
8/ Compounded changes in the GPI from 1977 to 1987 were 5,8711, versus
2,238X for the ORTN; i.e., over this period 621 of a loan would have
been 'written off' by the lag between ORTN 'monetary correction" and
the GPI measure of inflation (see inside front cover).
9/ Relatively secure funding; significant delays in the transfer of funds
from the Federal Government to the States, in the presence of high
inflation, was found to produce serious erosion of the real resources
transferred.

of a profitable technology awaiting extension.lO/  No crop budgets are pre-
sented to illustrate with and without extension scenarios, a notable omis-
sion in a project designed to Improve small farmer productivity. This is
not to say there was no technological basis for the project, merely that it
was not presented in the  ESAR.    In  fact, 7,903 demonstration plots were
established under the project, bearing witness that there was some tech-
nology to extend.
18.      The above justification from the  SAR conflicts partially with the
SAR's own description of project objectives as including 'generally raise
the income levels of farmers, particularly small farmers", (SAR, para.
304(e)), which would imply an increase in production, particularly of
subsistence crops on small farms.    Discussion with project staff suggests
that while there was interest in the Bank in redirecting the extension
service to assist small farmers, little progress was made on this until the
Government decided, in 1979, that EMBRATER should give particular attention
to the needs of small farmers.
19.      This decision changed  drastically  the whole  orientation of the
project, and should normally have been accompanied by a formal project
redesign. There was, for instance, no longer any reason to expect la shift
in the  aggregated  agricultural  production  curve'  (para.  17).   In the
absence of a redesign, key questions such as the rapid rise in the cost of
extension per hectare served, the availability of technical packages
suitable for extension to small farmers, and the relative importance of
knowledge versus capital and other constraints for small farmers do not
appear to have been properly addressed.
20.      About half the loan  funds  (46%)  were for additional staff, with
technical field staff to be expanded from 4,400 technicians in 1974, to
7,077 in 1977.  The balance  of  the  loan was for office equipment, audio-
visual and libraries (13%),  civil  works  (7%), vehicles (7%), fellowships
and training (7X), consultant services and contingencies (192). This major
investment in buildings and equipment for the extension service, together
with an annual Federal contribution to recurrent funding, meant that the
10/  In marked  contrast,  the   MGSAR   provides  budgets  for  six  farm
investments, in crops, livestock  and  forestry, to test the financial
rate of return of these investments (MGSAR, para. 7.5); and to the SAR
for Agricultural Extension II (Ln. 2679-BR), where Annex 4 lists
eleven illustrative technologies which promise very substantial yield
increases. The Issues Paper for the Extension project, July 28, 1977
(para. 4) mentions inter alia,  that  "increases  at the farm level of
27% for rice, 252 for beans, 202 for maize, 20% for cotton and 102 for
cassava all seem well within a conservative estimate of results to be
expected  from  sound  extension   policy."       No  basis  for  these
'conservative estimates" is given and it is not clear why similar
estimates do not appear in the ESAR.



-7-
extension service's status within the State public sector was very substan-
tially enhanced, as was its capacity to serve small farmers. In a country
as vast as Brazil, it was not possible for appropriate extension messages
to be developed centrally, thus the speed with which this increased
capacity would be put to use varied significantly between states.
21.      Project conditionality did not include any provision for the State
and Federal Governments to employ the additional extension staff on a con-
tinuing basis. In the event this did not constitute a problem since the
follow on project, Agricultural Extension II (Ln. 2679-BR), provided for
continued employment with gradual phase-out of Bank support for the addi-
tional salaries.
22.      The Minas Gerais Rural Development  project was designed to be in
large measure (73% of allocated funds) a credit project, but supported by
extension (200 additional staff), swamp reclamatioui (8,000 ha), agricul-
tural research (137 experimental and demonstration plots), rural electrifi-
cation (800 km of trunk and distribution lines), health services and educa-
tion. Project monitoring and evaluation was to be carried out by the
Federal University of Vicosa in the form of a survey of project assisted
and unassisted farmers. As an integrated project, it involved 39 Federal
and State agencies in its implementation. The specification of their tasks
is clear, and illustrations of the profitability of agricultural invest-
ments are provided. Provision is made for lending to be on the standard
terms for agriculture in Minas Gerais (i.e., 10-15S nominal plus partial
monetary correction). The problem of negative interest rates is noted, but
rationalized as being tangential when the majority of the credit is to be
provided to low income small farmers (MGSAR para. 1.6), (see paras. 28 to
36).
23.      Two features of the MGSAR which  deserve note are:  (i) provision
for only 80 farmers to be assisted per additional extension field worker
(MGSAR, para. 1.9), and (ii) a proposal to build up the State land clear-
ing authority RURALMINAS (State Rural Development Agency) so that it could
under-cut the price of private contractors by 30% (MGSAR, para.3.14).   The
low ratio of farmers to be served per extension officer, reflected the
orientation of the project towards supervised credit. The extension staff
were to have an important role in the preparation of credit applications
and the associated farm plans, and to assist with their implementation.
New technology would be introduced in conjunction with the supply of
credit, rather than as an activity in its own right. This contrasts with
the design of AE1, which aimed to reorient the extension service from an
adjunct to credit administration, to the provision of technical advice to
larger numbers  of  small  farmers.    In  the  event,  RURALMINAS was very
successful in the development of swamplands,ll/   but by the use of private
sector contractors, rather than by developing an in-house capacity.
24.      The  Bahia Rural  Development  project  design  provided  for  15
federal, state and private agencies and 49 municipal governments to be
involved as direct executors or major collaborators (BSAR, para. 3.03). We

now know that this implied an unsustainable supervision effort for the
Bank, if all project components were to receive proper attention. The
major components are clearly laid out in the BSAR so that viewed in isola-
tion each one is suitably justified.   In contrast to AE1, budgets are pro-
vided to illustrate the profitability of typical investments and hence the
scope for extension (BSAR, Annex 9, and Supplementary Staff Working Paper
No. 14).
25.      Agricultural credit was des>lned  to  be  the largest project com-
ponent (31% net of Contingencies), and extension the second largest (14X)
though described as the 'keystone" of the project (BSAR 4.08). Other
important components were assistance to cooperatives, irrigation, storage,
rural roads, water supply, education, health, land titling and land redis-
tribution. In 1982, after four years of implementation, the State Govern-
ment evaluated the project and requested numerous variations including
halving the number of titles to be granted from 15,000 to 7,500. After
revision, key project components included 7,500 land titles to be distri-
buted, 44,000 ha of land to be acquired and 1,900 small farmers settled,
1,500 small irrigation systems to be improved, small warehouses, rural
roads, health centers and mini-posts, schools construction and repairs, and
support to the State Land Institute.
26.      Provision was made for  a  significant  expansion of the extension
service from 77 technical staff  to  300  12/   (BSAR, Para. 4.08) and some
strengthening of research.   A  curious  omission is any cross-reference to
AE1. Even with AEI in the lending program, the appraisal mission felt the
service continued to be  seriously  under-staffed.    Despite a planned 61X
increase in field staff, the AE1 seems to have left the extension service
understaffed according to Brazilian norms.   Raising these norms represents
a continuing challenge.
27.      The Bahia project aimed at having 174 farmers served per extension
worker, a major increase in farmers served from the earlier ratio of 80
used in MGRD.13/
28.      In 1982, the  Government  began  planning  a major new development
initiative, Projeto Nordeste, which is based on a US$2.4 billion in the NE
for a first stage, with substantial increases in future stages. As part of
12/  Mostly school leavers.    It  is  not  clear why  the project did not
require greater preparation in budgeting, financial analysis and/or
small farmer production technology.
13/ The Audit's preoccupation with increased farmer/field staff extension
ratios reflects (a) the high cost per farmer served at low ratios, (b)
the large number of farmers receiving no service, implicit in low
ratios, and (c) the greater focus on the transfer of technology
associated with higher ratios.   It  is  simply not possible to tailor
information to the exact financial and/or labor and land supply
position  of  individual  farmers,   when   large  numbers  are  being
contacted. This is an advantage, in that the extension worker can
then teach production techniques, leaving it to the farmer to adapt
them to his/her own individual circumstances.

this initiative the Bank reviewed the lessons of the 'first generation* of
RD projects for the NE.    In  general, the second generation projects have
fewer components, are more tightly focussed on agricultural concerns, and
in some cases include specific grant elements.   Most of the lessons for RD
projects suggested by this audit, have already been incorporated in the
second generation projects, all of which have already been presented to the
Board.
29.      Aaricultural Credit.  The  "agricultural credit' components of the
RD projects were de facto grants rather than credit programs. For BRD the
credit terms were:
"Project  credit  terms  and  conditions  would  be those
established by  the   Government  for  the  POLONORDESTE
program, namely interest to the farmer at 1OZ, unindexed,
for both investment credit and seasonal production credit
... with repayment terms for investment credit of up to
12 years including  up  to  6  years' grace" (BSAR, para.
4.15).
The BSAR noted this involves negative real interest rates, but recommended
that:
'Since the  beneficiaries  of  the  proposed  project are
mainly in the lower income classes, and the possibility
of misallocation of resources is greatly reduced by the
proposed project extension and monitoring activities (the
credit extensionist having to report at least once a year
to the local bank on the progress of the individual
financed  projects  and   on   the  technical  assistance
rendered, and the project monitoring work including
annual surveys of sample farms which would help provide
another basis for evaluating the effectiveness of the
credit intervention), the Bank should be prepared to
acquiesce to the Government's position. Hopefully, the
expected positive experience with small farmer repayment
capacity in projects such as the one proposed will help
convince the Government of the viability of adopting an
interest rate policy more closely reflecting real credit
costs." (BSAR para. 4.16).
30.      Similarly in MGRD:
"The unindexed and partially indexed credit would result
in negative real interest rates to the farmer, but the
beneficiaries would be small farmers from the lowest
income groups and the credit would be closely supervised
by ACAR". (MGSAR, para. 5.13).
31.      While the exchange rate provides  an imperfect measure of domestic
inflation, it does allow calculation of  an indicative measure of the grant



- 10 -
element in the RD credit program. The present value to the borrower of 600
Cruzeiros (Cr$) borrowed in 1976 (and equivalent to US$56.07 at the 1976
exchange rate of 10.7 cruzeiros to US$1.00) and repaid under the standard
conditions for Bahia would be US$43.78 if funds were not reinvested/ or
US$45.94 if they were reinvested at 8 1/2S (see Annex A). Thus the grant
element ranged from 78% to 82%, and would have been greater in later years
when inflation was even higher. Thus what the BSAR and MGSAR describes as
supervised credit with (implicitly small) negative real interest rates, was
in reality a supervised grant program.
32.      This has very important implications for project design.  A credit
program, even a credit program with marginally negative real interest
rates, has certain built in safeguards, notably a rational borrower will
only use the credit if he expects to earn a positive real rate of return
(or at worst a marginally negative return). There is no such inbuilt safe-
guard for a grant program. Furthermore, with a positive real interest rate
(and good repayment rates), capital is preserved, and can be relent in
subsequent years. For a grant program, benefits have to exceed costs the
first time the grant is made, since there is no opportunity to repeat the
grant without access to new resources.
33.      This is not to argue that a grant program was prima facie inappro-
priate for the RD projects.   Rather,    the SAR should have justified this
component on quite different grounds. Were the poor better served by
(repeated) once only income grants, or would they have been better served
by investment in rural electrification, small scale irrigation, or the
purchase of large estates for land  reform?    This is not intended to be a
rhetorical question. The correct answer depends, inter alia, on the recip-
ients' consumption pattern, propensity to save and invest, and the form of
any investment.14/   No  attempt  was  made  by  the  SAR  to address these
questions. Similarly, the project design concerned itself with the problem
of security, especially for long  term  loans.    (The longer the term, the
larger the grant element, and the less the need for security.)
34.      While  there  are  serious  conceptual  difficulties  in providing
credit to the very poor, there are no such difficulties in providing
grants. The cumbersome (but latterly more streamlined) procedure of the
Bank of Brazil, could have been avoided if the true nature of the component
had been acknowledged.    The  exclusion  of  low  income families from the
credit program is explained as follows,
"Many sharecroppers and producers in the size category of
less then 50 ha did not attain a net income equivalent to
two and one-half minimum  wages,  which was necessary for
inclusion in the project". (MGPCR para. 7.05).
14/ Given a high propensity to save, and a coheaive community able to
mobilize it's savings, then grant funding of projects may yield
significant benefits over and above a cost recovery approach. See for
instance The ARa  Khan  Rural  Support  Program  in Pakistan, OED, May
1987.

would be explicable if it was a credit program, but for a grant program the
rationale is not clear.
35.      Similar queries arise with respect to the size of the sub-loans or
grants. With a poverty cut-off of US$340, loans of up to $7,800 (MGSAR
para. 5.8), for borrowers with sufficient assets, represented about twenty-
three years or more income for a person in poverty. It is hand to believe
that the SAR would have tried to justify grants of this size.
36.      To the extent that the  credit  program resulted directly or indi-
rectly in increased  demand  for  labor,  it  probably had very substantial
benefits to poor laborers. Much of the short-term credit was expected to
permit farmers to hire labor or, by the provision of consumption credit, to
work on their own  farm.    Both  adjustments  would increase the effective
demand for labor, and assist the poor.
37.      It should be acknowledged that what  the Bank approved as a credit
program might -;ell have been rejected by the Loan Committee or the Board if
described as a grant program.    Since this project component certainly in-
jected funds into the NE, and led to some increased dynamism amongst the
smaller farmers, the lesson probably is that the Bank should consider grant
programs15/ as part ;f a portfolio of ways of stimulating sustainable
productive capacity.  flowever, the  justification for such components needs
to be very carefully documented and argued; and provision of grant
assistance should not be tied to the amount lent.
38.      Credit. Extension and  Others.    Despite  their different titles,
these four projects share  the  ctecacteristics  of making major provisions
for credit and extension, as brought out in Table 1, which shows that 592
of the BRD (86% of the MGRD) net of contingencies was allocated to credit
and extension. Furthermore, the relatively low ratio of farmers to be
served per field worker, reflected extension's key role in providing for
the supervision of the credit component and implied the absence of a broad
based effort to improve small farmer production techniques as a whole.
(See, para. 73 for EMBRATER's argument that high numbers of contacted
farmers is an inappropriate objective.)
15/ As has been done in second generation RD projects for the NE.

Financint Plan
39.      Project financing varied  greatly  between  projects,  as shown in
Table 2.  For MGRD, the State  of Minas Gerais was the borrower (subject to
a guarantee provided by the Federal Government); and for AE1, the States
provided substantial funding in the form of their support for state exten-
sion services. Despite the variety of financing arrangements, no compara-
tive lessons have emerged from the four projects on this issue.

40.      As shown in Table 3, the four projects were appraised between 1975
and 1977, and were negotiated and presented to the Board between 1976 and
1978; they all were effective by the end of 1978.

41.      The AI2 project was first proposed for the NE.  However, the prev-
alence of subsidized credit in the region lead to redirection of the pro-
ject to the South and Southeast, where monetary correction via the ORTN
could be agreed.   Preparation  and  appraisal corresponded to the apparent
rapid uptake of the  AII projact  (CPCR,  para.  2.02).   By August 1975 a
supervision mission for All was reporting a slow down in disbursements due
to potential sub-borrowers turning to other sources of funds. A critical
review of the yellow cover SAR by Central Projects suggested, rightly as it
turned out, that the project was premature. Despite this warning the pro-
ject was presented to the Board in July 1976, but the first disbursements
did not take place until five years later, in April 1981. This represented
a misjudgment as to the demand for credit at positive real interest rates.
It is to the credit of the Bank that it lived with slow disbursement,
rather than transform the project into a fast disbursing grant program.161
However cancellation might have been better since this would have saved the
Borrower five years of commitment fees.
42.      The AE1 project was  a  natural  corollary to the earlier Agricul-
tural Research I  Project  (Loan  1249-BR).    It was  prepared largely by
EMBRATER (the national extension parastatal), with assistance from two Bank
missions. The Bank emphasized the importance of staff training, of techno-
logical transfer, and methods of reaching a wide audience of farmers.
Despite  this  the  SAR  does   not   contain  reference  to  any  specific
technological improvements which are ready to be exploited (para. 17).
EMBRATER tended to emphasize the importance of social extension (home
economics, community development and nutrition), and the physical infra-
structure needed for extension; and these components were given greater
emphasis when the project was redesigned in 1983 (para. 53).
43.      The MGRD was the second integrated RD project appraised in Brazil.
It was prepared by the State  of Minas Gerais, specifically the State Rural
Development Agency (RURALMINAS) and the State Secretariat of Planning
(SEPLAN-MG), with some assistance  from  the  Bank.  Appraisal reduced the
project from an initial proposal for US$360 million to US$139 million, but
the proposal for 39 participating agencies was maintained. Project con-
ditionality focussed on adequate staffing of the extension service; and the
provision of farm plans to (small) farmers applying for subsidized credit
under the project.
161 e.g., by removing the need for bank participation, and delinking
capital payments from the ORTN.    There  is no special merit in rapid
disbursement for uneconomic purposes.



- 14 -
44.      The BRD  project was  the  fourth  integrated  RD  project in the
POLONORDESTE series. It was largely prepared by Bank staff (PCR, paras.
2.01 and 2.02), to apply State and SUDENE (Superintendency for Development
of the Northeast)  ideas  on  education,  production,  health, rural roads,
cooperatives, storage, etc., to the needs of small farmers.
Board Concerns
45.      Board discussion of these  projects  focussed primarily, and as it
proved appropriately, on a criticism of the negative real Interest rates
prevailing in the agrictltural credit  system  (BPCR, and CPCR para. 2.03),
and the need for close supervision of credit to avoid potential misalloca-
tion. The Board was also concerned at the resulting erosion of the capital
of the State Development Banks. These concerns had little perceptible
effect on implementation of these projects, with real interest rates
continuing negative throughout their  lives.17t    Other concerns about AE1
related to its effect  on  native  tribes  and  the  high cost of providing
extension services for sparse populations in remote areas. For MGRD, the
Board's concern was whether the project reflected a substantive plan for
regional development (MGPCR, para. 2.04), especially in the context of
rural-urban, and on- and off-farm employment linkages.
46.      The Bank's emphasis on the  need  to invest in audio-visual equip-
ment and to study ways of increasing the number of farmers who could be
served per field worker, was responsive to the Board's concern. It is less
clear that actions to meet the Board's concern for the effect on native
tribes or a coherent regional development strategy can be identified (see
PPAM para. 100).
II. PROJECTS' IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES
Management
47.      All four projects required  the  cooperation of many organizations
for their success. The AI2 project had the simplest management structure,
with sixteen participating Banks deciding on a decentralized basis, how
much to lend  under  the  program.    As  discussed  earlier (para. 8), the
requirement that participating banks provide some of the funding, served to
17/  There are indicators in the  case  of  AI2 of a split between Programs
and rrojects on this, with Programs eventually over-ruling Projects
and agreeing with Government to disbursement rules which would result
in negative real rates of interest, without direct regard for the
Board discussion (para.  47).    OMS  3.73  is  clear  that the Bank's
concern is that overall interest rate policies be equitable and
conducive to the encouragement of financial savings (para. 25 of OMS
3.73); that interest rates be related to the opportunity cost of
capital, and significantly positive in real terms over the life of the
loan  (para.   26);   and   that   preferential   interest  rates  are
inappropriate for providing regional or sectoral incentives (para.
29). The administration of credit within these three loans thus seems
to have been at variance both with Bank concerns, and Bank policy.



- 15 -
ensure quite limited demands on project funds, and there was no need to
ration funds to individual banks.
48.      Apart  from  routine  concerns   fo- the  profitability  of  sub-
borrowers, the Bank's supervision of AI2 focussed on the vexed issue of
full monetary correction, and the adequacy of the ORTN to ensure a positive
real rate of interest.18/ With one exception,19/ the recommendations for
dealing with the lag between ORTN and the rate of inflation start by ack-
nowledging the basis on which the loan was presented to the Board, and then
propose formulae which would (a) not give a positive real interest rate,
(b) necessitate further government intervention (this time in the "right'
direction) in the determination of the ORTN, and (c) as it turns out, did
not result in  significant  disbursements.    Understandably in the circum-
stances, the rationale for such recommendations is not spelt out.
49.      Implementation of the  Bank-agreed  formula  involved  the Bank in
agreeing with the Government as to how the ORTN was to be administered:
"I wish to confirm Bank's offer to accept new commitments
under Loan No. 1317-BR on tollowing conditions: (a)
subloans will be subject to full ORTN correction and meet
all other conditions specified in loan documents; (b)
from  January  1981  through   June  1981,  monthly  ORTN
adjustments will be not less than eighty percent of the
corresponding movement in the general price index on a
cumulative basis (i.e. for January; for January/February
for January/March; etc.) and (c) from July 1981 onwards,
such adjustments will be not less than ninety percent of
the corresponding movement in the general price index, on
a cumulative basis (i.e. for July; for July/August; for
July/September etc.).... "20/
18/  A debate made no simpler by the fact that "monetary correction  is not
mentioned in the legal documents, but is taken as synonymous in Brazil
with application of the ORTN index; moreover, the Bank had previously
accepted a blending of its money with other highly subsidized funds so
as to achieve an effective interest rate competitive with other
subsidized sources of credit.    In Brazil, 'full monetary correction"
merely means that capital amounts have been indexed in line with the
ORTN; which in most years has lagged, sometimes significantly, behind
the National Consumer Price Index (INPC); an index which is published
in both uPurgedu and "Unpurged" form (see Footnote 6).
19/ "It is our judgement that we should not, at this time, agree to
disburse against any more new sub-loans made under the uncommitted
balance on 1317-BR, but seek cancellation.   The achievement of one of
the main project purposes (i.e., to help develop a system with
positive interest ratas) is simply incompatible with the continuation
of highly regulated and administered financial markets in Brazil."

Brazil.

and, in the process, agreeing explicitly that the index of monetary cor-
rection would be administered in such a wa' as not to keep pace with infla-
tion.
50.      The possibility of using  a  floating  interest rate, lased on the
yield of ORTN five-year bonds, Was explored by Bank staff and their
counterparts, but was rejected by the Bank Management on the grounds that
AI2 would soon be fully disbursed. (A reasonable assumption in the fall of
1982). In the event, lending dried up as participating banks became in-
creasingly reluctant to provide their own capital for a project which was
not fully-indexed against inflation. (i.e., the decision not to use a more
realistic method of monetary correction "because the loan would soon be
fully disbursed", meant in fact that disbursement dried up). In short, the
AI2 loan was not managed in accordance with the assurances provided in the
SAR and Board discussions.
51.      The AE1 project was implemented primarily by 23 state and territo-
rial level EMATERS/ASTERS, which are affiliated with the federal EMBRATER.
The normal project start up delays were compounded by the fact that the
EMATER/EMBRATER system itself was relatively new, and that insufficient
counterpart funds had been budgeted at the time of signing. The Government
was supportive in authorizing some commercial borrowing to help ease this
constraint on counterpart funding.
52.      The RD projects, though administered at the State level, neverthe-
less involved large numbers of organizations (15 Federal, State and private
organizations operating in 49 municipalities in Bahia, BPCR, para. 2.04,
Pnd 39 agencies in Minas Gerais, MGPCR, para. 2.03), which were not
normally  called  on  to  collaborate.    Understandable  difficulties were
encountered in trying to establish the new organizational links.
53.      Redesign.  The AE1  and  BRD  projects were subjected to redesign.
In part this represented a reaction to the slower than expected rate of
implementation and in both cases was undertaken in the context of a request
to extend the project.
54.      The redesign of AE1 was in  response to a request from EMBRATER in
June 1980, on the basis of the first 2 years of project execution and new
government agricultural policies which continued to stress production
expansion. The redesign involved the inclusion of social extension (home
economics, community development, nutrition) workers ur.der the project, and
a switch of funds from consultants, vehicles and office equipment to civil
works and field demonstration plots.    The  result was a doubling of state
and regional office construction and the addition of 354 local offices.
Provision for post-graduate training was greatly reduced (MScs 174 to 100,
and PhDs from 36 to 10), representing a change in the EMBRATER philosophy
o. extension following a change in its administrotion in 1979. Previous
management placed a premium on advanced training while its successors chose
to emphasize a grass roots monitor system to support fewer fully trained



- 17 -
extensionists,  with  greater  use  of  local  consultants.    Despite this
increased emphasis on civil works, incremental salaries for the additional
workers continued to constitute over half the project costs. Though total
field staff hired slightly exceeded appraisal estimates, it is not clear
how many of these were social extensionists, and hence to what extent the
decision to expand social extension eroded the interded expansion of tech-
nical extension services.
55.      The Government's request for  a  two-year extension, and redesign,
of BRD was made in 1983, after a Government evaluation of the first four
years implementation experience (BPCR, para. 2.05). Resource reallocations
reflected principally agreement on the use of the US$19.5 million "unallo-
cated"  at  appraisal.    Principal  beneficiaries  were  extension 1+661);
agricultural research (+52%); land titling service (+46Z); health and water
supply (+96%). Major changes in project scope involved a halving of the
number of land titles to be issued, and the establishment and operation of
a fund for land acquisition.
Start-up
56.      As already  remarked  (para.  40),  the AI2  project was launched
prematurely.   After  an  eight  month  delay  from  Board  presentation to
effectiveness, another four years elapsed before the first disbursement.
This was caused by continued use of funds available from the predecessor
project AIl, together with a lower level of total demand for project
credit, than had-been forecast.   For the other projects, start-up problems
focusing principally on supply of counterpart funds and appointment of key
staff were routine rather than dramatic.
Sequence
57.      No major  problems  were  reported  in  the  sequencing of project
activities.
58.      The AE1 pioject presents an  interesting question as to the appro-
priate balance between hardware, staffing and organization in institution
building. The strategy pushed by EMBRATER was to establish the EMATERS
basic civil works, transport, staffing and audio-visual support, with rela-
tively less emphasis on defining the extension messages to be promoted,211
or the organization to actually carry the message to large numbers of small
farmers. This probably is the correct sequencing since EMBRATER, with the
help of AE1, did manage to establish the EMATERS as a significant
bureaucratic presence in the agricultural administration of the States.
21/ This is in contrast to a strategy which would have put the first
priority on establishing field trials, cooperating with research on
implementable packages, and field activities, possibly from inferior
and  temporary  accommodation.    This  is,  however,  a  question  of
emphasis, and field extension was by no means neglected; 7,903
demonstration plots were grown under the project, and technologies
such as better spacing of manioc, more effective use of pesticides and
improvement in animal traction were promoted.



- 18 -
This still leaves the challenge of inducing the EMATERS to develop and
deliver their state specific extension messages, but it reduces the danger
that some States, for whatever reason, would become disenchanted with
extension and allow their State services to be crippled by inadequate
accommodation, staffing or recurrent funding.
Procurement
59.      Procurement was essentially trouble-free  in  these projects.  The
small size of individual purchases meant that ICB was not called for, and
that even though international companies were eligible to bid for local
procurement, there was little if  any,  interest.   The small farmer credit
components involved individual purchase of small quantities of farm inputs
through standard commercial channels, or payment of hired labor. Civil
works and roads involved quite modest sub-projects in widely dispersed
localities, which local contractors were well equipped to construct.
Borrowers under AI2 were required simply to obtain quotations from at least
three contractors or suppliers and to furnish them to the participating
banks, for review of quality, suitability and price (Project Agreement,
Schedule, para. 14).
60.      Counterpart Funding.    Counterpart  funding was  an intermittent
problem for all  four  projects.    As  already  discussed  (para. 8), some
funding difficulty was virtually  built  into  AI2.    For AEls the funding
problems were more significant In the poorer states of the north and north-
west, but these  problems  diminished  over  time.    The  RD projects also
suffered some shortage  of  counterpart  funds.  In MGRD  this limited the
expansion of the extension staff to 165 (rather than the projected 200),
and from 1978 to 1983 the implementation of the education and social
components were particularly affected.    For  all  four projects, the high
rate of inflation meant that a delay in the provision of counterpart funds,
also reduced the real amount of resources transferred to the project.
Disbursement
61.      The rate of disbursement  fell well  short *f appraisal estimates
for all four projects since they all suffered delays in excess of 60Z of
their appraised duration (See Table 1).   In part this potential short-fall
in disbursements can be traced to slow claims procedure by the Central
Bank, in the presence of a rapid devaluation, which lead to financial re-
imbursement falling significantly behind real expenditure. All projects
benefitted from the Bank's Special Action Program (SAP), which raised dis-
bursements from about 302 of project costs to 67X from March 1983 on. For
AE1 and MGRD the SAP just about compensated for earlier slow claims, and
actual  disbursement  matched,   or   almost   exactly  matched,  appraisal
estimates.



- 19 -
62.      For BRD the devaluation of the  cruzeiro lead to real cost saving,
and there is some suggestion that the low disbursements for agricultural
credit (442 of appraisal) reflected a decision by the BB not to claim for
all small farmer credit disbursed.22f
63.      For AI2  the  almost  mutually  contradictory lending requirements
(para. 8) meant that after an initial spurt between early 198111982, when
these conditions were simultaneously satisfied, the rate of disbursement
fell off to a derisory US$0.2 million per month. After three extensions,
it was agreed with Government that the balance of the loan should be
cancelled.
Reporting
64.      In general, audit and progress  reports were satisfactory and were
submitted in a  timely  fashion.    In AE1,  it was noticed that progress
reports were not being used to flag problems holding up implementation in
individual states. After this was drawn to the attention of EMBRATER, the
progress reports became more useful for problem identification (EPCR paras.
3.16 and 3.18). As discussed under monitoring the reporting system did not
extend to how the extension staff were actually being used (para. 95).
65.      An interesting aspect of the MGRD  project was the award of a con-
tract to the Federal University of Vicosa to prepare an annual evaluation
report, based on updating an initial sample of over 800 producers. Whilst
insufficient to show causation, the resulting data means that for MGRD, in
marked contrast to the BRD and AEl, we know something of the character-
istics of project beneficiaries, and what happened to them. However,
quarterly reports by the project coordinating unit for MGDR failed to iden-
tify the end-use of producer credit and the Borrower did not attempt to
explain the apparent diversions of credit to coffee and sugar in its own
evaluation.
Outcomes
66.      All four projects have  substantial  achievements to their credit.
AI2 supported investments in agro-processing plants, a 202 re?resentative
sample of which at the time of the PCR still continued to have good
capacity utilization and financial results.   AE1 put in place the physical
plant and staff for a nationally coordinated, but state based, extension
service. It also refocussed extension from credit and technical assistance
to large farmers, to the provision of technical advice to large numbers of
small farmers, and provided the physical and institutional base for this
new focus (para. 57). The two RD projects distributed significant amounts
of credit (albeit de facto grants) to farmers with up to 100 hectares, and
financed a range of other  infrastructure  and social investments for which
221 BW's record keeping procedures were primarily oriented to loan size,
and project conditionality also related  to  size of holding and total
borrowing.



- 20 -
the states are continuing to provide recurrent resources; and MGRD had one
of the most effective M&E components of Bank supported RD projects.
67.      The large credit component in  MGRD  is difficult to evaluate.  It
went predominantly to the larger small farmers (para. 88), and as such
missed being of direct assistance to farmers falling within the Bank's
poverty classification (while staying within the limits laid down by the
Loan Agreement).   It  is  also  difficult  to  identify  from M&E data any
differential impact in favor of project assisted farmers (para. 90).
Nevertheless, it is the subjective judgement of involved project staff that
the relative dynamism of agriculture in the Zona del Mata, as compared to
the rest of Minas Gerais, can be attributed significantly to project
impact. A Scottish verdict of "not proven' is perhaps the best conclusion
at this time, as to the benefits from the credit component of MGRD. For
BRD there may have been similar problems with the credit component, but M&E
data required to even argue a position, is lacking.23/
68.      Even with hindsight, the  Government  was probably not ill-advised
to borrow for these projects.   Indeed,  if the lessons (paras. 102 to 136)
of these projects are effectively incorporated in future projects, then the
audit would strengthen the above judgement, to say the Government was well-
advised to borrow. However, given (a) the lack of knowledge of the impact
of the credit component in BRD, (b) the documented failure of the MGRD
credit component to reach the poor directly in MGRD, and (c) the Bank's
official support for negative real interest rates under AI2, it is much
less clear that the Bank was well advised to lend for the credit components
of the relevant projects.
69.      From a more mechanistic  viewpoint,  all four projects encountered
significant delays (60+%) in their implementation, and while AE1 and MGRD
were essentially fully disbursed, the other two projects involved substan-
tial cancellations.    In  BRD,  (US$10.5  million),  this represented cost
savings and so should be regarded as a plus, but in AI2 (US$33.7 million)
it represented a lack of commercial demand for credit under the terms
specified for the project.
70.      Afro-Industries II.  If  the AI2  project  is  viewed simply as a
subsidized credit project to support investment in agro-industries, the
project was moderately successful. A majority of the firms in a 20% sample
were operating at or close to full capacity (CPCR para. 4.03), and
operating results were satisfactory. In large measure this may be due to
the final borrowers being the private sector, who have their own incentive
to avoid investment in unprofitable  ventures.    This is a markedly better
outcome than the under-utilized plants which have resulted in other
countries from some direct Bank lending to parastatals for agro-processing.
231 Though the fact that the average investment credit of US$1,027 was 88%
above the BSAR estimate of US$546, suggests that here too, the credit
component may have deviated from the (Bank) target (BPCR, para. 3.10).



- 21 -
71.      If,  however,  the  policy  objective  of  assuring  positive real
interest rates for investment in agro-industry projects is given the pre-
dominant weight, then clearly the project was less successful.
72.      If the AI2 project  provides  the  Bank  with  an insight into the
provision of i long term capital market in the presence of high inflation,241
it will have been worth  its  cost.    The practice of providing additional
long-term capital to a market which is fundamentally flawed suggests an
incomplete analysis.   Far  from  focussing  primarily  on  the terms to be
offered to Brazilian borrowers, it appears to the Audit that first priority
should be given to ensuring that Brazilian lenders are given terms which
reflect the true value of  their  savings.    With this reform in place, it
would then be possible to come to a realistic judgement as to the value of
the Bank, or the Government, providing some incremental resources to the
capital market (see paras. 106 to 113).
73.     AMricultural Extension I.   The  AE1 project slightly exceeded its
appraisal staffing targets (3,887 additional field staff, versus 3,734
projected), and as a result of redesign (para. 53) greatly exceeded its
construction targets, (23 state offices versus 16; 16 in place of 8
regional offices and an additional 336 local offices). The target ratio of
farmers served to incremental field staff rose to 313, up very considerably
from the ratios of 46, used principally for credit supervision, which was
one of the motivations for the project (Issues Paper, July 28, 1977, para.
32). This is indicative of significant progress in refocussing extension
onto  the  service  of  large  numbers  of  (small)  farmers.    Though the
refocussing has undoubtedly taken place in accordance with Government
policy (para. 16), extension is still  carried out in a one-on-one context,
so that actual farmers helped (directly) per extension officer still
approximates 120, up from the Issues Paper but still well short of the
redesign target.  EMBRATER  is  conscious  of  the  UlowA number of farmers
served, but argues that  (a)  most  small  farmers have individual problems
extending beyond technology,25/    which  if  not  addressed will make the
technical advice superfluous, (b) that there is an annual turn-over of
clients so that they may help almost as many farmers over a decade as a
system which has annual contacts of  500  but  low turn-over, and (c) it is
241  The Bank's record of problem recognition  on this issue goes back more
than twenty years (Attachment  B).    Its  success in dealing with the
problem has been much more modest.
25/  EMBRATER staff argue  that  the  importance  of non-technical problems
(access  to  credit  and   more   competitive  markets,  formation  of
bargaining groups, etc.) means that the time of extension officers can
be used productively on non-technical  matters.    This is very much a
policy matter. The key issues being (a) the extent to which non-
technical extension either increases the effectiveness of technical
extension, or competes with it, and (b) the extent to which non-
technical extension be addressed to problems soluble at the micro-
level.



- 22 -
better to give relevant advice to 120 farmers than irrelevant advice to
360. This latter point is valid, but should not prevent a continued search
for ways in which extension staff can reach a wider audience, while
continuing to provide relevant advice.    It also raises directly the cost-
effectiveness of one-on-one extension advice to small farmers. Can Brazil
afford one extension officer to 1,30a ha (if small farmers average 10 ha,
and 650 ha if they average  five  ha)?    How does this compare with a cash
grant, or the purchase of additional  land?   It may be that extension will
only become cost effective for small farmers when (a) other restraints have
been  relaxed,  and  (b)  effective   group  extension  methods  have  been
developed.  The undocumented redesign of the project (para. 19), means that
this question appears not to have been posed directly to date.
74.      What  is  missing  is  any  reference  to  the  technologies being
extended or their profitability; or to the proportion of staff time avail-
able for technical extension.   The  data  presented in the PCR, suggests a
significant production impact, however the impact on total production
appears to have been less than expected at appraisal.26/ The adverse
effect of the 1978 to 1983 drought would in any case make It unlikely that
SAR production estimates would be  fulfilled.   Table 4 shows that assisted
producers had  substantiall,  higher  yields  in  1984/85  than unassisted.
Survey data is being collected to relate yields to years of assistance, and
to distinguish farmers who have ceased to be contacted (but presumably
continue to employ profitable practices) from farmers who have never
received extension.   This  shows  a  healthy  interest  in EM3RATER in the
evaluation of the impact of extension, and will reduce the inherent
ambiguity of Table 4 as to how much of the higher yield is due to extension
per se, and how much to more efficient farmers "self-selecting" themselves
fot extension advice. The yield differences in Table 4, are large enough
for extension to appear a good investment, even if some self-selection has
taken place.
26/  Export  value  and  volume   data   suggest   that  the  expansion  of
agricultural production fell well short of 72 p.a.

75.      Bahia Rural Development.   Apart  from  attempting to get too many
agencies to do too many things the BRD project misjudged the difficulty of
improving the lot of small farmers.   The Bahia State Government proposed a
project redesign in 1983, which was accepted by the Bank. It reduced the
number of small farmers to be provided with titles from 15,000 to 7,500 (in
the evenu 8,281 were  provided).    However  this  was good compared to the
redistribution of land. Land acquired and distributed to small farmers was
2,208 hectares as compared to 44,000 hectares in the redesigned project,
and the number of small farmers actually settled was 78 as against 1,900
proposed in the redesigned project (or 820 in the BSAR). Even if fully
achieved, the targets in BRD would not have made a significant impact on
the land distribution problem in Bahia.
76.      Thus the project  was  much  more  successful  in the provision of
titles, to (small) farmers currently occupying land without secure title
than in the  redistribution  of  land.    It  appears  that  there was real
commitment to land redistribution in the State public service. However, at
the level of state politics, there was effective opposition. In these
circumstances, progress was made on titling, which was less disruptive of
established land owners, and as such less politically sensitive. At the
same time, support for the State Land Titling Service was increased in the
project revision. Support for the land titling service could be expected
to better document the need for land redisvribution and thus change the

basis for the domestic political  debate.    The Bank also returned to this
key developmenta'. qlvestion in  subsequent  lending.27/   It is important to
recognize that progress on land reform in the NE, simply cannot be judged
on the basis of the outcome of a single project.
77.      The 25% of the project  funds  reserved  for on lending was to 'be
provided exclusively to small-scale farmers (including sharecroppers and
tenants) in the Project Area", (BLA, Schedule 5, para. 1). In practice
non-owners were eligible only for working capital, and were unable to
obtain investment credit.28/
78.      The audit concurs with the BPCR in that for BRD:
'The project did generate social and economic benefits
for its target population.    Some  of these benefits are
difficult   to   define,    either   because   they   are
unquantifiable,  or   because   the   project  lacked  an
efficient monitoring and evaluation system and therefore
did  not  register   them.      Nonetheless,  the  project
succeeded in increasing education and health services
where none existed prior to the project, and despite a
lower than expected rate of return, farmers assisted
increased their income  substantially.   In addition, the
experiences of the Paraguacu and other POLONORDESTE
projects  helped  the   Government   to  focus  increased
attention on small farmer development in the Northeast by
approving in April 1985 a new multi-billion dollar
15-year development program which emphasizvs investment
in agriculture and places priority on increasing small
farmer production, productivi$y and access to land."
(BPCR, para. 7.04).
79.      Minas  Gerais   Rural   Development.        The   MGRD  project  was
predominantly (73%) a  credit  project.    This  was  designed primarily to
assist farmers owning less than 100 ha, and sharecroppers operating less
than 20 ha.  Not less than a  third of the amount lent under the credit was
to be lent to farmers having less than 50 ha and to sharecroppers (MGLA,
Schedule 4, Para. 2). While the credit component was fully disbursed, it
is not clear that the above lending policies were followed, especially
since a minimum income limit for credit eligibility appears to have been
established:
27/ In particular, the Bank is now supporting a Northeast Region Land
Tenure Improvement Project (Ln. 2593-BR).
28/ Despite the explicit provision in the BLA (Schedule 5, para. ') that
no real security would be required for loans under 50 times the
highest valor de referencia, (about US$55.00 in 1978, or a maximum
loan without security in 1978 of US$2,750).



- 25 -
'Many sharecroppers and producers in the size category of
less than 50 ha did not attain a net income equivalent to
two and one-half minimum wages, which was necessary for
inclusion in the project". (MGPCR, para. 7.06).
80.      Such a limit, if  introduced,  does  not  seem  to follow from the
requirements of the SAR or LA.   Indeed, it appears to run directly counter
to the intentions of the MGSAR (para. 5.4), to 'ensure that proper partici-
pation of the smallest amongst the small farmers will be addressed'.29/
81.      Data collected by  the  Federal  University  of Vicosa for project
evaluation purposes shows that assisted farmers had higher incenes and
larger land holdings on average than the unassisted farmers. This data
also suggested that in order to achieve an income of two and one-half times
the basic wage, at least 24 ha. were needed, thus excluding most share-
croppers from consideration, since maximum sharecropper area was set at 20
ha. (MGLA, Schedule 4, para. 2).
82.      As the MGPCR points out:
"because of the application of negative real interest
rates, the original resources applied to the short-term
credit component have by now ceased to exist". (para.
4.07).
This point is returned to in the section devoted to lessons (paras. 114 to
120).
83.      The educational component  seems  to  have  had  the rather modest
achievement of  preventing  the  situation  getting  worse.    About 202 of
children remained out of school, because of the absence of schools beyond
the 5th grade, both before and after the project. However, this leaves the
drop-out rate in Minas Gerais better than (i.e., below) the national
average.
84.      While there  had  been  little  improvement  in  the indicators of
infant mortality at the time of the PCR, a significant decline at one of
the earliest health centers,30/ provides promise that there will be real
improvement generally in the near future.
85.      The calorie  intake  for  project  participants  (i.e., larger and
better off small farmers) increased over the project period, while the
intake of non-project participants (small small farmers, sharecroppers, and
landless) declined (MGPCR, para. 5.05).
29/ As the MGSAR (para.  5.4)  rightly warned  "...  since this is a field
where there has been only limited experience in Brazil and where a
number of bureaucratic obstacles to implementation of policies of this
nature exist, close supervision of progress in this direction and a
firm Bank policy would be required to ensure participation of target
beneficiaries."

to 1983.

Economic Performance
86.      An ex post estimate of the  ERR was  included in only the PCR for
for the BRD project.  The estimate fell from 15Z at appraisal to 11 at the
time of the PCR. It has already been argued (para. 67), that even in the
light of project delays, and less evident impact than projected at
appraisal, the Government was justified in borrowing for these projects,
with the probable exception of MGRD (para. 88).
87.      Information on ERRs is presented in  Table  5.  The absence of ERR
estimates in the PCRs for AI2 and MGRD projects would seem to indicate
inadequate monitoring and evaluation (M&E) processes within the project. A
soundly based M&E program should be able to provide evidence of project
impact which could be used, at the very least, to provide illustrations of
the ERR of sub-components (as was done in the SARs for all projects except
Extension).311 In the case of AE1, the ERR was recalculated for the PCR,
but was dropped from the final draft in the light of a comment by higher
management on a similar projectt
none has to make a judgment on whether the project is
worthwhile. But when the whole assessment rests on a
series of unverifiable assumptions we can save ourselves
a lot of time by accepting reality and forego the quite
spurious  mathematics.    The   same  applies  to  health
projects,  research,   education,   training  and  family
planning."32!
This comment seems to miss the point that the purpose of the ERR (or better
still the present value of benefits minus costs) is to reduce to a single
figure the implications of the wido range of assumptions (verifiable or
unverifiable) underlying the project proposal or performance, and thus to
assist the Bank in distinguishing projects worthy of support from less
worthwhile projects. If the 'verifiability' of assumptions is taken as
crucial, the list of projects for which the ERR can be used with confidence
may need to be reduced further. Since other quantitative tools for project
appraisal, such as cost-effectiveness rely on the same basic data, this
directive would appear to have created a significant range of project types
for which the Bank has no clear methodology for the selection of those
suitable for presentation to the Board. The ERR assumes that costs and the
value of benefits are known, so that the rate of interest can be treated as
the uunknown" and projects can be evaluated in terms of the cost of capital
consistent with project  viability.    Cost-effectiveness acknowledges that
the value of a human life or an agricultural graduate may be even less
certain than the rate of interest, and hence expresses project viability in
terms of a life saved or  graduate  trained.   These points are returned to
under Lessons (para. 131).
311 The ESAR (paras. 7.04 to 7.06) notes the difficulties of illustrating
ERR for a  first-stage  institution-strengthening  project.   The audit
does not find this apology altogether convincing, since a discussion of
illustrative ERRs would have usefully highlighted the proposal to
concentrate initially on providing a firm physical and staffing base
for the extension service.

88.      Information on the incomes  of  farmers  Assisted (by provision of
supervised credit), and Not Assisted under the MGRD project is provided in
Table 6. Salient features of this table are:
i) Assisted farmers' average incomes in 1976/77 (i.e. at the
outset) were about three times higher than Not Assisted
farmers.
ii)   Average income of  Not  Assisted  farmers  during the project
period grew significantly faster in percentage terms than
Assisted farmers; and for net income, the Not Assisted
farmers even grew faster in absolute terms.
89.      With  hindsight,  the  apparent  low  return  from  credit  to the
Assisted farmers may perhaps be explained by the use of much of it for
cattle purchases in the face of an unusually prolonged drought.33/
331 The Audit does not have data on end use of credit either in MGRD or
BRD; but the study "The Integrated Rural Development Project of the
Paraguacu River Basin in Bahia (PIDERP) - The Credit Component", LCAPB,
January 1978 mimeo, documents that the predominant use for agricultural
credit in the area of the BRD is for livestock purchases, and that
banks regard livestock as good security.

90.      The MGPCR reports  that  credit  valued  at US$120 million (MGPCR,
Table 3' was distributed to 27,764  farmers,  or an average of US$4,322 per
farmer.  With an exchange rate of  CrS4,024 - US$1 (1,848 in December 1984,
6,200 in December 1985) this translates to Cr$17.4 million per farmer.
Tkere is little evidence of  any  measurable benefit from the credit eompo-
nent of the MGRD project, which leaves us with just the costs. It is thus
concluded that the actual ERR for MGRD was negative.
91.      As already noted  (para.  82),  the  negative  real interest rates
characteristic of the RD projects means that these credit funds have been
exhausted. The nature of the actual investments, if any, made by credit
recipients is not known, though in Minas Gerais there are indications that
some of it went into coffee34J   and  sugar cane which could be expected to
have longer term benefits to farmers than the intended increase in annual
targeted crops, and might hell explain the lack of increased income for
Assisted farmers.
Sustainability
92.      As already  noted,  negative  real  interest  rates  converted the
credit components of the RD projects into de facto grant programs. As
such, the credit components of the projects were unsustainable. (Though

able.) Operations and maintenance funding was incorporated in Federal and
State budgets to ensure good sustainability of the social investments made
under the RD projects. The "bricks, mortar and staffing" emphasis of AEl
(together with Bank support for a follow-on project), suggest. that the
extension project will have good sustainability.
93.      More  fundamentally,  the whole  idea of  providing  significant
support services for small farmers has been accepted as an important part
of Government agricultural policy.    This was reflected in the Governmenc
sponsored study which led to the Proieto Nordeste initiative, and is con-
firmed by Government's continued borrowing for a "second generation' of RD
projects in the NE.
Monitoring and Evaluation
94.      The Minas Gerais RD  project  provided  for  a M&E contract to be
awarded to the Federal University of Vicosa.   This studied a sample of 800
farmers, who were reinterviewed annually.    The survey was unusual amongst
Bank projects in providing  some  useful  information.   In particular, it
clearly identified that the project assisted the larger small farmers. For
other projects M&E appears to have been essentially non-existent.
95.      Improved M&E would have  been particularly  useful in AE1.  While
the number of farmers contacted was recorded and consolidat,d, this about
exhausts the available information on the use of the extension staff. It
would have appeared important to know such things as (a) the amount of time
being spent on technical, social and other extensions, (b) the time on
groups versus individual counselling, (c) the subject matter of technical
extension, (d) calculated profitability of practices being extended, (e)
adoption rates amongst farmers, (f) reasons for adoption and non-adoption,
(g) estimated on-farm yield and profit increases, etc.351
351 Unfortunately this poor M&E performance is not atypical, of Bank
projects. In a recent unpublished study, OED reviewed 104 projects
with built-in M&E components.   It  revealed that only 152 showed good
M&E results, 392 had seriously deficient M&E systems, and in 46Z the
M&E  system   either  was   not   implemented   or   performance  was
unsatisfactory.    There  was   no   significant  difference  in  the
performance of M&E between  rural  development  and other agriculture
projects. There was a strong link between general project quality and
M&E outcome.

Environmental Effects
96.      The BRD and MGRD projects incorporated a small component for agro-
forestry, and the A12 project incorporated conditionality to ensure that
existing Brazilian health/sanitation regulations would be applied. No
adverse environmental effects are noted in Supervision Reports or the PCRs.
However, the swamp reclamation component of the MGRD project, though it
only covered 10,771 hectares, presumably had some environmental impact.
Human Resource Development
97.      As already noted, the  RD  projects  had  explicit human resource
development components in the form of primary schools and health clinics.
The AEl project was largely motivated by a desire to refocus extenslon from
the supervision of credit, to transfer of technology to small farmers, an
almost "pure" human  resource  development activity.   Adequate recurrent
funds were provided from State sources for these services to b-e sustained.
98.      The predominant use  of high  school leavers  for the extension
service, while adequate for credit supervision, probably delayed the rapid
development of a technologically oriented service.
99.      As originally designed the  AEI project had a large post-graduate
training component  (36  PhDs  and  174 M.Scs).    In  fact,  a  change in
EMBRATER's administration early in 1979, led to a c'mplete redesign of this
component, reflecting a different extension philosophy, which downgraded
graduate training to 10 PhDs (1 delivered) and M.Scs to 100 (97 delivered).
Native People
100.     The issue of special concern  for  native  people arose only in the
Board discussion of the AE1 project (EPCR, pars. 2.03). There is no indi-
cation that the promised close collaboration between FUNAI and the exten-
sion services was developed. However, neither is there evidence that more
should have been done.
Women
101.     Both RD  projects  provided  for social  extension,  focussing on
nutrition, domestic sanitation, and child care. This component was intro-
duced during redesign at the insistence of the Brazilians. Most of the
social  extensionists  were women.   The  social  extension  program  was
basically an educational and diagnostic program, rather than an action
program, since few, if any, funds were available for demonstrations or
physical investments. Despite this limitation, it was felt to be an Impor-
tant and worthwhile project component.

III. LESSONS
Pro ect Complexity
102.     The RD  projects  confirm  the  new  conventional  wisdom36/  that
implementation and supervision of multi-component projects tends to be
extremely difficult.
103.     Single Purpose versus Multi-Purpose  Proiects.  The above observa-
tion might be expected to lead logically to the dictum that single com-
ponent projects are to be preferred to multi-component projects. While the
Bank should provide supervision missions with the appropriate technical
expertise, the lesson is a little more complicated. Clearly, the extension
project could not have been used as a substitute for the RD projects; there
would still have been a need for farm credit, schools, health clinics,
water and irrigation development, etc.   Equally, no one technical skill is
sufficient to provide sound advice on roads, schools, agricultural exten-
sion and policy. The option of delivering rural development via a series
of complementary agricultural, road, education, health, etc. projects needs
also to be considered.    The  key  lesson  is  the need for an appropriate
management style, one which (a) tries to keep things simple by eliminating
from the project design components that do not have the 'critical mass' to
be effective, and (b) achieves both a national and a regionallstate
perspective. The Bank needs to be able to advise Government (and the
Board) as to how sector support systems (research, credit, extension, input
supply etc.) are functioning on a country wide basis but also how well
these systems are complementing each other on a regional or state basis.
104.     Recently the Agricultural Operations Division has initiated super-
vision missions of the RD (and other) projects with respect to a single
function, say research, credit or extension, across all relevant projects.
This permits a national view to be  reported to Brasilia or the Bank, while
at the same time identifying actions needed with respect to this one aspect
of individual projects.   By  analogy, a  country with several single com-
ponent projects could often benefit from 'cross-sectional" supervision
missions which would examine how each of these projects was performiag in a
single state or region.
105.     Provided simplicity is striven  for,  and provided that management
balances its concerns with national strategies and regional complimen-
tarities,  there  is  probably  considerable   scope  for  a  diversity  of
approaches to project design.    Depending  inter  alia upon the countries'
federate   or   centralized   administrative   structure,  regional multi-
componenv or a series of complementary national single component projects
may be apiropriate.

Credit
106.     Foreign Exchanae Risk:   The  Loans  were manifestly unsuccessful
either in ensuring or requiring positive real interest rates, (paras. 47
and 48). The provisions for monetary correction in the covenarts of AI2
were tied to an inappropriate, administratively determined, index. In the
BRD project, the Bank merely required that "each loan shall bear interest
at the rate applicable to POLONORDESTE loans for similar purposes" (BLA,
for BRD, Schedule 5, para. 4), or for MGRD, "terms and conditions would be
similar to those prevalent in Minas Gerais', (MGSAR, para. 3.8), thus
supporting the Government's policy of concessional credit to small farmers.
107.     Bank policy specifies that  foreign exchange risk 'should normally
be assumed by sub-borrowers, just as they would when borrowing from abroad"
(OMS 3.73, para. 27). This policy was not followed for AI2. The likely
effect of stricter adherence to Bank guidelines is unclear. Demand for
sub-loans would probably have been reduced and the higher cost of credit
would have  led  to  a  better  screening  of  sub-projects.    The rate of
disbursement would also have been even slower. Designing developmentallv
sound credit projects in the context of a system of high inflation and
generally negative real interest rates presents difficult conceptual
problems.
108.     It is a valid principle that borrowers should pay the full cost of
their borrowing (otherwise, they may make investments with lower return
than the full cost of  the woney  borrowed).    But  it is also a relevant
principle that all borrowers should face the same costs, for credit of the
same maturity, and for projects with the same risks. (Otherwise, those
with access to lower cost credit will accept investments which other
borrowers would reject leading to the choice of a sub-optimal portfolio of
projects.) Thus the demand that agricultural borrowers bear the foreign
exchange risk, would logically be accompanied by a requirement that all
borrowers of Government funds (agricultural, industrial and parastatal
borrowers alike) bear the foreign exchange risk, since all are drawing
resources from Government, some of which are being replaced by Government
borrowing abroad.
109.     Perhaps more  importantly,  it  is  also  a  principle that savers
should be offered rates of return on their savings (net of transaction
costs), equivalent to the charges being levied on borrowers. (Since, if
savers are offered much less than borrowers have to pay, borrowers may have
to forgo investments, that savers would gladly have financed). This then
brings us to the nub of the phenomenon of negative real interest rates.
Brazilian economic policy under many regimes, has not given savers access
to financial instruments which retain their real value. Monetary correc-
tion has lagged inflation, and hence savers have seen their real savings
eroded. This is a problem for poor savers, at least equally with the rich.
To Government this has been seen as a reduction in the real cost of the
public debt. Government, as a major borrower, has had an incentive to let
monetary correction lag, even at the expense of drying up the supply of
domestic savings. Farmers, and other borrowers from the public sector have
benefited (partly incidentally, and partly as a matter of policy), from the
tendency of Government influenced indices of monetary correction to lag
behind inflation.



- 33 -
110.     The challenge in  designing  an  (agricultural) credit project for
countries with high rates of domestic inflation is thus nots How to get
(agricultural) borrowers to pay the full cost of their borrowing? But
rather: How to get all borrowers to pay the full cost of their borrowing?
And: How to reward all lenders for the full value of their savings?37/
111.     Government resistance to proposals  to  make all borrowers pay the
full cost of their borrowing, is to be anticipated, where Government itself
is a (or the) major borrower.
112.     The Board could  advantageously  have  questioned  the proposal to
lend for AI2 on the twin grounds (a) Why should other sectors of the
economy (including Government) be excused from paying the full cost of
their borrowing? and (b) Why should the Bank lend for this purpose, when
domestic savers would be only too pleased to lend on the terms to be
offered to the Bank?38/
113.     Where a Government  does  wish  to  borrow  externally rather than
domestically, it is appropriate for Government to bear the foreign exchange
risk, charging the borrower an interest rate which is equitable and
"conducive to the encouragement, and efficient mobilization and allocation
of financial savings" (OMS 3.73, para. 25). The Bank's legitimate concern
that its resources not be squandered on ill-advised investments is best
met, in this context, by the general questions posed in the last paragraph.391
37/  If the Government has the political  will  to do this, then the design
of appropriate financial instruments should not be difficult. One
could,  for   instance,   relate   monetary   correction   (a)  to  an
independently calculated consumer price index (appropriately corrected
for any items not freely available), or (b) to a foreign currency, (or
basket of currencies) evaluated at a market determined exchange
rate(s).
38/  The recent, 1987, introduction  of  Caderneta  de Ponpanca Ouvo by the
Bank of Brazil for small savers, which yields OTN correction plus 6%
has resulted in a net flow, in excess of what could be relent to the
rural sector, of small savings from the rural sector to the Central
Bank.
39/  While OMS 3.73  (that  foreign  exchange  risk  be  faced  by the sub-
borrower) is appropriate for situations where the decision to borrow
overseas is a micro-economic decision, the audit would suggest that
this is less clear where foreign borrowing is basically a macro-
economic decision.

114.     Subsidized Credit.  AI2 differed  from  the RD projects in that It
made a serious, if not entirely successful, effort to ensure that onlending
interest rates were positive in real terms. No such effort was made in the
RD projects. Indeed, (paras. 28 and 29), the CSAR reconmended that current
(subsidized) lending rates be accepted since the majority of the borrowers
were expected to be small farmers and share croppers. As shown in Annex A,
the resulting onlending conditions were such that the grant element in the
RD loans was in the range of 50 to 902, and often 802 or more. As
discussed under project design (para. 32), the inclusion of a grant
component in RD projects should  not  be  rejected  a priori.  In the right
circumstances, there may well be a place for direct grants.  However, it is
misleading to present a  de  facto  grant  program  as  if it were a credit
program.
115.     The non-recognition of the grant  element  in the RD projects lead
to at least three deficiencies:
i)   Delivery through the normal credit channels, directed the
component towards the larger and more financially secure
small farmers,41/
ii)   Description as  a  credit  component  freed  the SAR from
providing the detailed and rigorous justification for
this component that the Board and Bank management would
have required for a grant program, and
iii)   Larger grants resulted (up to 23 times the basic wage and
an average of about 10 times the basic wage) than would
appear justifiable on welfare grounds.
116.     The "second  generation' of  RD  projects  (para.  27)  in the NE
already includes a grant component.   It  is worth noting that the Bank has
little experience in the supervision of grant programs, which would appear
41/ As brought out very clearly in the evaluation data collected by
Vicosa University for MORD (see Table 6).



- 35 -
more difficult to manage than  even  credit  or  subsidy programs.42/   431
The value of grant programs has already been suggested by the Aga Khan
Rural Support Program,441 which is not the same thing as saying the Bank
is well-prepared to  deliver  such  programs.    It may  require having to
disburse a relatively large total sum as many small amounts for a range of
different purposes through a large number of NGO and local institutions
without destroying their grassroots nature.
42/ In theory, credit programs, with positive real interest rates, should
be largely "self-policing", since borrowers will only invest in
projects which are financially  profitable.    It was the simultaneous
requirement in AI2 that lending be profitable both to the lender,
e.g., the participating banks, and the borrower which prevented the
project from  being  a  fast-disbursing  debacle.    Subsidy programe,
justified by the  desire  to  get  participants  to engage in socially
profitable  activities  (such  as   adoption  of  new  technology,  or
reforestation) which might not otherwise be financially profitable,
are also relatively easy to supervise, at least in theory. This is
because clearly defined actions are expected of project participants.
Grant programs can be expected to be more difficult to supervise since
one wishes to (a) keap administrative costs low, (b) to have the
expenditures responsive to individual or community defined needs, and
(c) to achieve a permanent improvement (i.e., not to have the grant
diverted into consumption).
43/ The second generation of RD projects in the NE have both grant and
credit components.    Part  of  the  grant  program  is  used  to fund
community initiatives for economic projects and infrastructure such as
a cassava mill, a brick kiln, a sewing center, small scale irrigation,
potable water, etc. A second part of the grant program is used to
assist agricultural production, by writing off half the loans made
under the  cred -  component  of  the  project.    This  has  the twin
advantages of (a) making it clear  to  the farmer how much he is being
granted, and how much lent, and  (b) hopefully leading to the recovery
of the 502 of the money lent.    There is, however, no a priori reason
to tie the grant and lending programs together. Tying them is likely
to again lead to the wealthier (small) fermers qualifying for credit,
and hence for the bulk of the grant program. As an official observed,
"cheap credit can lead to use of capital for project with low
productivity."  There is no reason  t- ew,ct- 'h' ~^V41!4v4ee M"'     Mui
be willing to provide  grants  for  to  be  highly correlated with the
effective demand for credit; indeed, tying a grant to credit runs the
danger that the real justification for a grant program will not be
clearly  thought  through.    'Need' would  be  one  basis,  but this
motivation would certainly not suggest tying the size of the grant to
ability to borrow.

117.     Recommending the separation of  credit and grant components, where
a credit component is expected to pay a 'positive real rate of interest",
still begs the question as to how the real rate of interest should be cal-
culated; and whether farmers would be able to hedge the risk that agricul-
tural price movements will diverge substantially from the index used to
correct for inflation.
118.     A "first best" solution to the  problem of risk reduction would be
to institute a futures market in the difference between the economy wide
index of inflation used to correct all loans, and a suitable index of agri-
cultural commodities in the NE.    Government could even provide seed money
for such a market, by speculating on the difference (thus providing
liquidity for farmers wishing to hedge).  For small borrowers, bark's could
'retail" fractions of a  future  contract,  thus putting small borrowers on
roughly the same footing as large.
119.     In the absence of  this  first best solution, agricultural lending
in the NE (or elsewhere) could be correctly indexed by an index of agricul-
tural prices in the NE  (or  elsewhere).    This would transfer the risk of
price divergence to the lender, for which a suitable fee could be charged.
This  fee  should  be  small,44/    unless  there  is  an  expectation that
agricultural pricing lags consistently behind changes in the index of
inflation used to  correct  loans  generally.    If  there  is a systematic
tendency for agricultural prices in the NE to lag behind general inflation
then this would suggest a structural problem which deserves analysis in its
own right.
120.     Use of OTN.  With  the  introduction  of the Cruzado Plan in 1986,
the ORTN index was replaced by an index OTN (with Reajustaveis removed from
the title, since the heart of the Cruzado Plan was the removal of the
causes of underlying inflation) for the same purpose. The OTN is no better
protected against administrative adjustments (para. 112) than was ORTN.
OTN is the legally mandated basis for monetary correction in Brazil, and
the Government's policy is to adjust OTN in line with domestic inflation.
However, if past experience is any guide (footnote 8 and inside the front
cover), there is a risk that full monetary correction based on the OTN may
lag behind domestic inflation in the future. The use of the OTN as a basis
for monetary correction does not therefore necessarily guarantee that Bank
loans would be on-lent at positive real interest rates in accordance with
OMS 3.73, para. 26.    Compliance  with  this  OMS  in Brazil could only be
assured ifs (a) the OTN is replaced by an objective index and/or (b) banks
are allowed to use a variety of indices to protect the real value of money
lent and/or (c) lending is denominated in foreign currency.
44/ Profits, or losses, from this fee could be paid into, or taken out of,
a stabilization fund, with the fee reset each year so as to pay off
any losses (or distribute profits) over a few years, according to a
suitable mathematical formula. (Discretion should be avoided lest the
correction be used as a politically determined way of taxing or
subsidizing agricultural borrowers.)

Institution Building
121.     The AEl  project  can  be  characterized  as  principally 'bricks,
mortar and staff". Despite the hiring of 3,887 additional staff (taking
54% of project expenditure), there was little evident attention to the
specifics of the technological messages to be extended. From the long-run
view this was probably the right priority. 'Institution building" involves
not only staff training and organization, but also building the reputation
and image of the institution.    Buildings  and  staff may well have been a
necessary condition for extension to gain its needed weight within the
bureaucracy serving agriculture. Certainly, in the course of project re-
design, EMATER argued to increase the scope of the civil works program so
that every state would have a headquarters building for its extension
service, and 354 local offices were added.   The SAR for the follow on pro-
ject, AE2, gives appropriately, much more attention to the technologies
ready ior wide adoption.
122.     The relatively  intensive  service  (leading  to  the  majority of
farmers getting no direct extension) provided for in supervised credit
components of the RD projects, emphasized the need to find more effective
ways of getting technical (and profitable) information to a wide audience
of small  farmers.    AE1 was  intended  to  examine  the 'methodology' of
reaching increased numbers of small farmers; it appears that there is a
continued need to pursue this vital topic.
123.     As field staff are  added,  increasing  tension can be expected to
emerge between their use as technical advisory staff versus generalists
available to coordinate all Government assistance at the field level.45/
The Bank should beware of supporting projects, in RD or elsewhere, which
rely on delivery through the extension service without providing additional
manpower; and where new programs are designed to be delivered via the
extension service, the Government should be encouraged to fully budget
manpower requirements for additional staff and their support.
Public versus Private Sector
124.     Overall, the  projects  appear  paternalistic  and centralized.46/
Planning and execution were from the 'top downU with little community
participation and few incentives to the private sector (with the exception
of AI2). It is Government, not private savers, who is expected to provide
the capital for agricultural development. An extension service is provided
in the RD projects to assist write credit applications and administer them,
and the Federal, rather than State Governments will provide the major new
451 See for instance Supervision Report of May 30, 1986, for the Sergipe
Northeast I RD project (Loan 2523-BR) which reports agricultural
extensionists being used as multipurpose workers, including the
distribution of food for the World Food Program, with predictable loss
of effectiveness in their communication of agricultural technology.
46/  These  terms   are   not   intended   pejoratively;   paternalism  and
centralization have their place.    Rather  the intention is simply to
flag an apparent tendency in project design.

funding for extension.    Support  for  cooperative  development provides a
notable, though not very successful, exception to this rule (as does the
more successful contracting out of M&E to Vicosa University). Participa-
tion of the private sector under AI2 helps explain why borrowing was held
back in the face of unattractive lending conditions. Future project design
could well take up explicitly, the proper balance between Federal, State
and local control, and suitable mechanisms to achieve this.
125.     Land Reform.  The very modest  progress in BRD in the provision of
land to the landless or farmers with inadequate holdings47/ (as distinct
from uland titling", where farmers in possession of state land without
title were provided with official title to their holding), warns of the
likely difficulty of achieving significant land reform. Originally, the
existence of a large number of small farmers with secure title, and many
more small farmers without title suggested that there was considerable
scope for poverty alleviation, before the structure of land ownership
barred further progress.481    Project  experience,  however, reinforced by
Bank sponsored research,49/    has  tended  to  emphasize the difficulty of
making more than a tactical reduction in poverty while the vast bulk of
unemployed or under-employed labor is unable to get access to land.
126.     In agreeing to support the Government's renewed efforts in Proieto
Nordeste to improve the economic prospects for the NE, the Bank has made it
clear that it sees land redistribution and improved titling as a necessary
condition for the effectiveness of other policies directed towards poverty
alleviation. This is being supported by the Northeast Region Land Tenure
Improvement Project (Ln. 2523-BR). Thus it appears that the lesson of the
Bank's project experience, the Government's policy review, and the joint
SUDENE/Bank research project, summarized in Kutcher and Scandizzo as
'Without (progress on land redistribution) the analysis
reveals little hope for solving the problem in a region
where up to 10 million people remain near absolute
poverty while agricultural land the size of France lies
idle or greatly under-used", (p. 30)
is being learnt.
127.     Technical Extension.  Three of the projects provided very substan-
tial support for extension, but the supervision reports are remarkably
silent on the nature of the extension message being conveyed to farmers;
the time devoted to this activity; adoption rates and yield increases.
47/ Only 78 farmers affected, versus a BSAR target of 820, raised to 1,900
during project redesign.

Report No. 665a-BR, June 1975, p. ii, para. 6.

Pasquale L. Scandizzo, Johns Hopkins Press, 1981.

This suggests that greater priority is needed for the technical supervision
of extension components. As a "soft" area, it is important not only to
provide the resources necessary for an effective extension program, but
also to check that these are being used effectively for their intended
purpose.
128.     Monitoring and Evaluation.  The M&E results reported in the MGPCR,
throw more light on the differences in characteristics and performance of
Assisted and Not Assisted farmers, than they do on the reasons for
differing performance, and as such have limited usefulness in improving the
efficiency of interventions. However, the M&E results reveal very clearly
that the MGRD project assisted predominantly the larger small farmers.
Without the M&E results there would be no clear basis for this finding.50/
129.     In BRD and AE1 there  is  no  comparable data as to the character-
istics of the project beneficiaries, or the changes which took place over
the life of the project.    This  should be simply unacceptable.  Unfortun-
ately, it is characteristic of the Bank's RD lending, that more attention
is given to who the SAR intends should be helped, than who actually is
assisted.511 Given the M&E results, it is moot as to whether MGRD can be
regarded as a RD project, since it almost certainly failed to have over
half its actual  beneficiaries  even  in  relative  poverty.   (Average net
income for Assisted farmers was US$9,520 in 1976/77, in 1985 dollars.)
130.     In the absence of M&E data for BRD and AE1,521 there is no possi-
bility of giving more than impressionistic information on the character-
istics of project beneficiaries, which leaves the Bank's management
undesirably exposed in the event that skeptics wished to question the
actual effect of the US$252 million disbursed for the first generation of
RD projects.
50/ Since much of the Bank's supervision activity can be described as
'informal M&E", Bank staff get a variety of useful insights into all
aspects of project performance from this activity. However, they may
occasionally miss important issues, such as degree of penetration of
the  target  group;  but   more   importantly,  it  is  difficult  for

borrowers, and their projects are presumably documented in the files
of participating banks.

131.     Economic Rate of Return.    Despite  the internal economic rate of
return's well known deficiencies as a measure of project success,531 its
preparation does provide an orderly way of examining intended and likely
project costs and benefits. If some project components have no measurable
benefits, the ERR can still be applied to illustrative sub-components, to
give a feel for the rate of return and the assumptions needed to achieve
this rate of return. A decision by Management not to offer an ERR estimate
as part of the project justification for certain project categories should
prompt the question: How does management propose to identify poor projects
in these categories? This question is particularly pertinent in the case
of AEI, which would appear to have been effectively completely redesigned
in the course of implementation (paras. 18 and 19).
132.     Strategy for Poverty Alleviation.    The marked difference between
farmers Assisted and Not Assisted by the MGRD project, poses very starkly a
question as to whether there are farmers who are 'too small to help"?541
If not, then why did the project so significantly miss assisting the
smallest farmers?
133.     It  is  sometimes  implicitly  assumed  that  with  a sufficiently
radical land reform, there would be land (and water) for all, and the
poverty problem would go away.55/ Is this true? If not, then what is the
53/  Principally (a) that in  the  absence  of  an underlying critical path
analysis, it tends to give the most optimistic rate (i.e., if
everything goes right) rather than the expected rate, and (b) that the
price of capital is only one of the infinite number of prices
affecting project success.    For  many  of  the Bank's borrowers, the
price of foreign exchange (i.e., exchange rate) should probably be
thought of as even more Important than the price of capital,
suggesting a break-even exchange rate, rather than interest rate
analysis. If the Bank were willing and able to lend all that a
country wished at a 102 rate of interest, then the (expected not
optimistic) ERR with a 102 cut-off would be appropriate. In the face
of capital, and foreign exchange rationing, it is suspect.
54/ A  question which  also  follows  from  the  1975  strategy  report's
observations: "While, on equity grounds, rural development programs
should probably be aimed at the landless population and the very small
landowners, since these groups constitute the core of the rural
poverty  problem  in  the   Northeast,   the  greatest  potential  for
improvement of production lies in the group of small- and medium-
landowners and the sharecroppers with more secure tenancy, which
already have some degree of access to and control over use of land."
Rural Development Issues and Options in Northeast Brazil, World Bank
Report 665a-BR, June 1975, p. ii.
55/  The Kutcher Scandizzo study (op.cit.)  concludes inter alia:  'Even if
a reform of the existing estate sector were supported by a subsidy on
wages,  more  than   one   million   families   would  remain without
entrepreneurial access to land and water and near absolute poverty."

Bank's overall strategy for poverty alleviation in the NE? Should the
Bank's very significant lending for RD in the NE be set in the context of a
wider program of general economic development for that region that includes
population planning, education (to make migrants more employable), rural
electrification (to assist small scale rural industry), off-farm employ-
ment, intra-regional migration, etc.?
134.     In this connection, it appears significant that after sponsoring a
major agricultural survey and modeling effort in the mid 19708 (footnote
50), the Bank has withdrawn from substantive research on the intractable
development problems  of  the  NE.    Since  there  seems  to  be a general
consensus amongst those practically involved with the development of the
NE, that "the answers are not all in", this absence of a research dimension
to the Bank's support is hard to explain.
135.     Many Lessons Learnt.  Many of  the  points made in this audit have
long been appreciated by regional management, and have been incorporated in
projects already presented to  the  Board.   In particular, both Government
and the Bank have agreed on a "second generation' of RD projects for the
NE, which see action on land reform as a necessary condition for benefits
from complementary initiatives.56/
136.     Though the "second  generation' RD  projects  have moved signifi-
cantly towards including distinct grant and credit components, these need
to be completely separated (since the m^tivation for credit, subsidies and
grants should be quite distinct); ^and certainly the M&E vacuum which
characterizes BRD and AE1 (and ei unfortunately high proportion of all Bank
RD lending), should not be allowed  to  continue.   It is not sufficient to
budget for an M&E  component.    Supervision  should require that this com-
ponent produce the needed results.    Finally, the Bank should perhaps make
provision for a continued serious research interest in the development of
the NE (i.e. at least $0.5 million p.a.) if only to internalize the work
already being undertaken by Brazilian institutions.

CALCULATION OF PRESENT VALUE OF SUBSIDIZED CREDIT
BRD: 'interest to the farmers at 10%, unindexed, ... with repayment terms
for investment credit of up to 12 years with 6 years grace". (BSAR, para.
4.15).
Calculation of the present dollar value of a loan under these
conditions is given in Table 1. Reading along the row for the fourth year,
we see that there was still 600 Cr$ of capital outstanding, no capital
repayment was made, interest at 10% cost 60 Cr$, and there were no loan
receipts, result'-ng in an outflow of 60 Cr$ in the fourth year. The ex-
change rate was Cr$52.7 - US$1, so that the $ value of this outflow was
$1.13, which, takan from the previous cumulative balance of the loan eval-
uated in dollars would have left a balance of $45.15, as shown in column
(9).
Reading down column (9) we have the balance of the loan, in
dollars, if no interest was earned, (i.e., as if the bnrro-er had converted
it immediately into dollars, and held it in a non-interest bearing account,
only paying out the amounts of dollars needed to meet the loan payments).
At the end of the period, after all commitments had been met, $43.78 would
remain in the  account.    Alternately  expressed,  the borrower could have
spent $43.78 (or 78Z of the loan proceeds) and still have had sufficient
funds to meet repayment requirements.
Columns (10), (11) and (12) carry out essentially the same calcu-
lation assuming that interest was earned (equivalent to the purchase of a
World Bank bond) on the  outstanding  balance.    In  this case 82% of loan
proceeds could have been spent, whilst still retaining sufficient funds to
service the loan.
In this case we can say the grant elemnt in the loan f*s from 78X
to 82%, depending on our calculations.
For loans taken out later, the grant element (due to inflation)
would have been larger; for annual loans It would have been less (though
with inflation at 400X per year, the grant element for an annual loan
reaches 80%);  with  partial  monetary  correction,  but lower nominal in-
terest, as in NGRD, the effect is indeterminate, but the grant element
would still have been substantial.

ONLENDING TERMS UNDER VARIOUS BRAZILIAN LOANS
Over the years the Bank has used various loan terms for onlending
in order to maintain  the  value  of  repayments  in  real terms.  The most
comon lending terms have included  100% correction of outstanding balances
by the ORTN,1/ with foreign exchange risk borne by the Central Bank.  Other
arrangements have included:
i)  Monetary correction of outstanding  balances using a composite
index of cattle and wool prices (First Livestock Project, Ln.
516-BR, September 1967).
ii) Monetary correction fixed at 10% p.a.; but foreign exchange
risk  borne  by   sub-borrower  (Northeast  Industrial  Credit
Project, Ln. 656-BR, January 1970).

857-BR, September 1972; Interim Second Livestock Project, Ln.
868-BR, December 1972).

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The capacity and efficiency of agro-industries is of considerable
importance to the Brazilian economy. In recent years, roughly half of all
export earnings and perhaps 10X of total GDP (about equal to the value
added on-farm) derive from this sector, which, broadly defined, includes:
(a) the processing of agricultural raw materials, including drying,
grading and packaging;
(b) the production of agricultural inputs, such as fertilizer,
balanced feed, improved seeds and implements; and
(c)  the storage, marketing and distribution of agro-industrial
products.
In addition to its importance in the economy as a whole, the
agro-industrial sector is of particular importance to agriculture: it
provides the improved seeds, chemicals and other inputs necessary for
efficient production; it provides a market for agricultural products and,
at the same time, a powerful stimulus to improving their quality.
Nonetheless, the sector has been handicapped by Government restrictions on
imported goods and services, export and value added taxes, and
interventions in the financial markets.
1.02      The Bank has long recognized the importance of the
agro-industrial sector in Brazil. The First Agro-Industries Credit Project
(Loan 924-BR) was appraised in 1973 and closed in 1980. This first project
was directed mainly to beef processing. The two principal objectives were:
(a) to introduce, for the first time in a Bank-financed project In Brazil,
on-lending that was subject to full monetary correction; and (b) to
increase beef exports by 140,000 tons a year by 1978. Government policies,
however, were not conducive to the success of the project. Manipulation of
the correction index used (ORTN) led to interest rates becoming
increasingly negative in real terms. At the same time, competing lines of
more highly subsidized official credit made the project virtually
inoperative for substantial periods. Also, largely as a result of
Government restrictions, total national beef exports in 1978, far from
having increased, had declined to less than half the pre-project figure at
63,000 tons. Nonetheless, some sound investments were financed and, in
particular, a contribution was made to the development of cold storage in
Brazil.
1.03      As will be seen, a further result of the difficulties of the
first project was a long delay in the start of disbursements under the
Second Agro-Industries Credit Project, the subject of this report.

II. PROJECT FORMULATION
Identification, Preparation and Appraisal
2.01      The first reference on files, on April 27, 1972, is to a possible
agro-industries project ia the Northeast of Brazil. A feasibility study
was prepared by consultants in 1973 and pre-appraisal and preparation
missions visited Brazil in the first part of 1974. Throughout, there was
concern in the Bank about the Government's policy of providing credit at
subsidized interest rates in the Northeast. After a series of discussionn
with the Brazilian authorities, some at ministerial level, It proved
impossible to reach agreement on this issue and the idea of an
agro-industries project in the Northeast was abandoned in December 1974.
2.02      It was rapidly succeeded in January 1975 by a proposal for a
Second Agro-Industries Project in the South and Southeast. A feasibility
study was prepared by April 1975 and the project was appraised In
May/June. Duriag the processing of the appraisal report there was concern
over the pace of commitment of the First Agro-Industries Project. A
critical review of the yellow cover SAR by a Central Projects economist
said, correctly as it turned out, that the project was premature. This
view did not prevail, however, and the project went forward with no
substantive comments from the Loan Committee and only minor changes in the
loan documents at negotiations.
Board Approval
2.03      The Board discussion focussed largely on the general direction of
Bank leading in Brazil, whether the balance of operations between the
Northeast and the rest of the country was appropriate, and how the Bank
compared with the Interamericaa Development Bank in this regard.1/
Concern was also expressed by the Board about the erosion of the capital of
the State Development Banks, which were expected to do the bulk of the
lending. In one respect, this concern was well founded: the financial
difficulties of these banks have persisted and worsened over the years;
there is, however, no evidence that they had any significant direct impact
on the project.
Objectives and Description
2.04      The project was to be a continuation of the First Agro-Industries
Project (Loan 924-BR) referred to in para. 1.02 above. It was ta cover the
nine central and southern states of Brazil. Over a period of three years,
it was to help finance facilities for meat processing (estimated at 46% of
total investment), grain handling (19%), milk processing (10%), and
miscellaneous agro-industries, including some engaged in supplying basic
1/   Subsequently, Mr. McNamara asked the regioa about its decision not to
proceed in the Northeast because of the interest subsidies prevailing
there. A detailed justification of the decisioa was set out in the
memorandum from the Regional Vice-President dated July 28, 1976.

agricultural Inputs (23%). The relative size of the project components was
based on an analysis of subprojects financed or under consideration for
flanacing under the first project.
2.05     *The 110 to 130 firms expected to be financed would r:ange la size
from medium to large and would be owned mostly by private entrepreneurs and
investors or cooperatives. The Bank loan funds were to be channelled
through the Central Bank to the participating banks (PBs), which would have
primary responsibility for the appraisal of subloans. The Central Bank was
to be responsible for the overall coordination and implementatioa of the
project. The PBs were expected to include the Bank of Brazil (BB),
regional and state development banks, along with two state commercial banks
with development portfolios, and a number of private investment banks,
provided that these were found suitable by the Central Bank.
Project Costs and Financing
2.06      Total project cost excluding taxes were estimated at US$260
million (CrS 2,130 million), of which US$83 million (Cr$ 681 million), or
32%, represented the foreign exchange requirements. The main elements of
project costs and financing were estimated as follows:
Costs                                   US$ million       %
1.  Meat processing                          120          46
2.  Grain processing                           50         19
3.  Milk  processing                          25          10
4.  Miscellaneous                              65         25
Total Project Cost                           260         100
Financing
Subborrowers                                   52         20

Working capital requirements were normally to be financed separately by the
PBs. In special cases, however, if no other sources were available,
permanent working capltal up to an amount not exceeding 30% of the fixed
investment cost of the related subproject would be eligible to be financed
by the project. The Bank loan was expected to be committed over about
three years and disbursed over about five and a half years.
2.07      Subloans were to be limited to 80% of the total cost of fixed
investment (excluding the cost of land) plus permanent working capital;
they were to have a maturity of up to ten years, including a maximum grace
period of three years. Loan balances were to be subject to full monetary
correction, based on the ORTN index. Interest rates on the adjusted
balances were to be 3% in the states of Espirito Santo, Mato Grosso, Golas,
Santa Catarina and the region north of the 18th parallel in Minas Gerais,
and 52 in other states.

III. IMPLEMENTATION
General
3.01      Loan 1317-BR was approved by the Board on July 15, 1976, was
signed on September 22 of that year and became effective on March 25,
1977.  It was to be four years, however, before the first disbursement was
made in April 1981. This long period of inactivity was due to the slow
pace of commitments and disbursements under the first project (para. 1.02),
which in turn was essentially due to the availability of competing
subsidized lines of credit from the National Economic Development Bank
(then BNDE, now BNDES).  In addition, in mid-1978, for reasons of monetary
policy, all subloan approvals under the first project were temporarily
suspended; the second and third projects were to be similarly affected some
years later (para. 3.10).
3.02      At the end of 1980, the first loan was closed and the outstanding
undisbursed balance was cancelled. The credit line in the Central Bank
known as PAGRI, which the first loan had helped to finance, continued to be
financed by the second loan. This enabled the financing of subpro4acts
that were still in progress at the end of 1980 to be completed.
3.03      For a short time the project progressed well, but then slowed
down to a negligible rate, as shown by the following figures of annual
disbursements from the Bank loan:

3.04      By 1981 competing long-term funds at lower rates of interest were
no longer readily available. At the same time, a number of quantitative
controls on exports and price controls on agricultural products (both
processed and unprocessed) had been largely abolished or relaxed, and there
was a substantial devaluation of the cruzeiro. By the early part of 1982,
indeed, the pipeline of subprojects under consideration was sufficient to
absorb the remainder of the loan and the evidence of future demand from PBs
was strong enough for the Central Bank to propose a third agro-industries
project (para. 3.09).
3.05      In the early months of 1982, however, monetary correction based
on the ORTN index began to lag behind inflation. This threatened the
project's ability to comply with the amendment to the loan documents set
out in Mr. Lerdau's letter of January 13, 1981, which provided for
suspension of disbursements if the three month rolling average of the ORTN
index fell more than ten percentage points behind the comparable inflation
figure.
3.06      A supervision mission discussed this issue with the Central hank
in May/June 1982. In their letter dated June 11, 1982 the Central Bank
(which could control neither the ORTN index nor inflation nor, as a result,
compliance with the amended legal agreement) proposed the introduction of a



- 55 -
floating interest rate, based on the yield of five-year ORTN bonds.
Acceptance of the proposal was recommended in the supervision mission's
Backr-to-Office Report dated June 1982.
3.07      The Bank did not agree to this proposal (Mr. Lerdau's letter
dated September 13, 1982) since the loan was nearly entirely committed; it
did, however, make the existing arrangement somewhat more flexible by
changing the three month rolling average referred to in para. 3.05 above to
a 12 month rolling average (a market determined floating rate system was in
fact adopted in the third project). The interest rates of 5% and 3% after
monetary correction were now substantially subsidized and this was
reflected in the project pipeline, which had expanded significantly in
response.
3.08      Unfortunately, the investment climate deteriorated and in 1983
Brazil was in its most severe recession of the post-war period. In
addition, interest rates on CDs had reached 20-25% in real terms, so that
PAGRI became unattractive to PBs which had to provide 10% of the financing
from their own funds at 3% or 5%. By the same token, of course, the PAGRI
rates had become attractive to potential subborrowers. In September 1983,
therefore, the Central Bank agreed that the rates on the PBs own funds
should be based on the average cost of funds to the major ("first line")
domestic banks. This, together with some hopes of economic recovery,
created renewed interest in the program.
3.09      Meanwhile, in June 1983 the Board approved the Third
Agro-Industries Credit Loan for US$400 million, including a working capital
facility of US$100 million under the Special Action Program. The interest
rate was fixed at four percentage points above the average yield on five-
year Government bonds, after full monetary correction, and readjustable
six-monthly.  As noted above, there were at the time some hopes of economic
recovery and the Bank was concerned to give all possible help to Brazil,
which was facing acute foreign exchange difficulties. Nonetheless, even
though the Staff Appraisal Report emphasized the risk that economic
conditions might delay disbursements, it is clear in retrospect that the
Third Loan (like the Second) was premature and that, in any event, a
smaller loan amount would have been advisable.
3.10      Evidence for the above was soon forthcoming.  In 1984 the
Government's policy, in accordance with its agreements with the
International Monetary Fund, was to contain monetary and credit expansion
within strict limits. Early in the year disbursements from all official
credit lines through the Central Bank, including PAGRI, were frozen.
Moreover, the allocation for 1984 in the monetary budget for both the
second and third projects was in the order of US$10 million equivalent.
Faced with this situation and a high degree of uncertainty about the
future, PBs and potential subborrowers lost interest. Only eleven subloan
contracts were signed in 1984 and none thereafter. In retrospect, it would
have been appropriate to close the loan at this stage and it is not clear
why this was not done.
3.11      In 1985 disbursements fell to a level of about US$200,000 a
month. With no new contracts being signed, the cancellation of the
undisbursed balance of the loan became inevitable. However, the Central



- 56 -
Bank was reluctant to request this, in the hope that economic activity
would pick up, and with it the demand for loan funds. Nonetheless, in
October 1985, the project officer proposed cancellation, and on January 6,
1986 the Bank sent a telex informing the Brazilian authorities of its
intention to cancel. The Brazilians were still reluctant, and during the
course of the project implementation review in January 1986 It was agreed
to reconsider the situation once more. This was done during a supervision
mission In April 1986, when agreement to cancel was finally reached with
the Central Bank. The outstanding balance of some US$33 million was
cancelled on July 9 and the loan was closed following a final disbursement
on July 24, 1986.
Compliance with Loan Covenants
3.12      There were temporary failures to comply with the following:
(a)  Section 3.01 of the Loan Agreement, concerning the provision of
funds in a timely manner to enable the Central Bank to carry out
the Project. In the early part of 1984, funds were not provided
in a timely manner; but the problem was subsequently resolved.
(b) Para. 6 of Part 1 of the Lending Policies Schedule to the Loan
Agreement, as amended by Mr. Lerdau's letter dated January 13,
1981 concerning the relationship to be maintained between
monetary correction and the general price index. The
manipulation of the monetary correction (ORTN) index in
June-November 1983 led to the loan falling into default early in
1984. A number of other loans were similarly affected. The
Government gave assurances that the situation would be corrected,
and, from December 1983 to March 1986, monetary correction was in
line with the index.
IV. FINANCIAL IMPACT
Agro-Industries
4.01      The application of loan funds to the different categories of
agro-industrial enterprises is shown below, compared with the estimates
made at the time of appraisal:
Actual        Appraisal Estimate
-U    S millions -
Meat               14                   38
Grain             11                    13
Milk               3                     8
Miscellaneous     21                    24
Total        49                    83
The cost of the investments which the project helped to finance totalled
US$154 million, as compared with an appraisal estimate of US$260 million.



- 57 -
4.02      The Central Bank estimates that the financial rates of return
obtained by the subborrowers were mostly in the range 13-152, with some
higher, so that incremental annual gross profits would be some US$22
million equivalent. The increased productive capacity increased both
domestic and export sales. Because of the variety of industries and
regions involved, the changes in economic conditions and the last of
reliable shadow prices, it has not been practicable to calculate an
economic rate of return.
4.03      The program was responsible for the direct creation of some
12,000 new jobs. A review of a representative sample of subprojects (about
20% of the total) by the PBs shows that-the majority of firms are
operating at or close to full capacity, with and showing good financial
results. Overdue loan repayments have been negligible in the sample of
firms chosen. The firms financed ranged from small operations with a dozen
or so employeea to large agroindustrial groups and cooperatives. The
activities financed covered, among others, cold storage, animal feeds,
grain procesaing, textiles, poultry and meat production, packaging
materials and dehydrated food products. A number of firms financed more
than one investment project through PAGRI. It is to be feared, however,
that the generally good results so far achieved may be jeopardized by the
current economic crisis.
Participating Banks
4.04      Sixteen banks were included in the program.  Most of these were
regional and state banks, with the Regional Development Bank of the Extreme
South (covering Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul) and the State
Development Bank of Parana participating the most. Private banks were also
represented, however, and included Bamerindus, Citibank and Unibanco.
4.05      The total amount of PAGRI financing was, of course, negligible in
relation to the total credit portfolios of the PBs and so its impact on
their financial position was very modest indeed. The spread allowed the
PBs was 2-2*%, which was somewhat low in view of the fact that the
administrative costs of appraising and supervising PAGRI subprojects were
much higher than for routine credit operations. On the other hand, PAGRI
subborrowers seem to have been good credit risks for the most part. The
results of a sample subprojects have beeu noted in para. 4.03 above. The
overall figures show most PBs with no overdues at all, although two of the
state development banks had overdues in excess of 20% in 1986.
4.06      The real test of PAGRI's financial impact on the PBs is the
extent to which they were prepared to participate in and promote the
program. Given the economic conditions for most of the project period, the
frequent and unpredictable Government interventions in the markets for
agro-industrial products, and the uncertain availability of counterpart
funds, it would probably be unrealistic to expect more than was achieved.
It is worth noting, however, that more than 60 banks have sought
accreditation under the third project, as compared with less than 20 under
the second.



- 58 -
Central Bank of Brazil
4.07      In its brief report on the results of the project, the Central
Bank says th-t during the period 1981/1985 PAGRI produced income of some
US$22.6 million equivalent and expenses of about US$16.7 million, leaving a
net income for itself of US$5.9 million. When'the accounts of the project
are finally closed and the subloans and the Bank loan all repaid, the
Central Bank expects to be left with a positive balance of US$33 million.
4.08      The PAGRI balance sheets (Annex 2) for the years 1981 through
1986, prepared by the Central Bank, do indeed show receivables of some
US$48 million equivalent at October 31, 1986, as compared with US$15
million due to the Bank. This gives good coverage for the servicing of the
Bank loan. The picture is much less favorable, however, if full inflation
correction is applied to the Central Bank's cash flow over the period
covered by the balance sheets.
4.09      The results of such a calculation are shown at Annex 3.  These
show an erosion of Central Bank and Government counterpart funds of about
US$22 million (this figure will not be quite accurate, because annual
rather than monthly inflation adjustments have been made, but the order of
magnitude is almost certainly reliable). This erosion has been due to:
(a)  the monetary correction index having been adjusted by less than
50% of inflation (as measured by the Getulio Vargas IGP/D1) over
the last ten years; and by about 75% of inflation over 1981-86;
and
(b)  the negative spread on Bank loan funds.  The Central Bank's
on-lending rate to PB's averaged a little under 3% after monetary
correction; the Bank loan was at 8.85% with exchange correction.
4.10      These losses of the Central Bank were, of course, gains in the
hands of the subborrowers. This does not, of course, mean that the impact
on the economy was neutral: first, the public sector deficit was
increased albeit by a relatively very minor amount; and second, although a
projected 12% financial rate of returu was required for the approval of
subprojects, the low or negative real rate of interest may have encouraged
investments whose return may have been less than the cost of the Bank loan.
Performance of the Central Bank and the Bank
4.11      The performance of the Central Bank, the executing agency, was
generally good. In the early years of the project, there were some
difficulties with the formalities required and the time taken to approve
subprojects. Procedures were gradually streamlined, however, and good
working relationships established with PBs. Shortages of counterpart funds
and interruptions in disbursements resulted from macro-economic monetary
and credit policies and were beyond the control of the project.
4.12      The Bank's supervision of the project was regular and there was
good continuity of staff. The handling of project difficulties was in
general pragmatic and helpful. In retrospect, however, it seems clear that
the start of the project was premature and its final closure unduly
delayed. In addition, the Bank's unwillingness to adopt variable, market
based interest rates in 1982 (paras. 3.06, 3.07) is difficult to
understand.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS
5.01      The main conclusions to be drawn from the long and for the most
part uneventful history of the project are that:
(a)  the project went forward too early, as pointed out by a reviewer
of the SAR (para. 2.02). The abandonment of the Northeast
project (para. 2.01) may have been a factor here;
(b)  during its brief active life the project financed some sound
investments and laid the basis for a broader acceptance by the
Brazilian banking system (especially in the private sector) of
Bank operations in the sector;
(c)  in the early years, the project interest rates were
significantly, but not heavily subsidized, with an average
project rate of about 40% comparing with ORTN bond yields in the
range 6% to 8%; the project rates became heavily subsidized in
the later years, however; and
(d)  given the long 7e:iod covered by the project, the existence of
competing and more heavily subsidized lines, the rapidly changing
conditions in the Brazilian economy and financial markets, and
unpredictable and frequently disruptive Government interventions,
it was inevitable that the terms and conditions (and especially
the fixed interest rates) of the project would render it
inoperable from time to time.
5.02      There are, perhaps, two main lessons to be drawn from the
project.  The first concerns the broad context for credit projects.  There
may be periods when the Bank for compelling reasons, is willing to help
economic adjustment by increasing the transfer of resources to a country.
During these periods, however, there is often great economic uncertainty,
an unfavorable investment climate, and a need for the Government to pursue
restrictive monetary and credit policies. In such circumstances, credit
programs may not be the best vehicle for large scale Bank operations.
5.03      The second lesson may be that, since financial markets are
constantly changing and evolving, Bank financed credit operations need to
be designed in a way that makes them adaptable to varying circumstances;
they should ensure that sub-borrowers bear the full cost of Bank funds,
including a reasonable spread for the financial intermediaries. The
foreign exchange risk should either be passed on direct to the
sub-borrowers, or borne by the participating banks who would pass on to
sub-borrowers the cost of hedging the risk. For this purpose, a planned
series of smaller operations, with disbuirsement periods of 12-18 months,
might be more easily kept up to date and improved than one or two large
operations with disbursement periods of around four years.

BRAZIL
MINAS GERAIS RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1362-BR)_/
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This project was the second integrated rural development project
appraised in Brazil. It was implemented in the Zona da Mata, situated in
the eastern part of the State of Minas Gerais, as part of a State Program
of Integrated Rural Development. The project was prepared by the State of
Minas Gerais, with the assistance, of two Bank missions.
1.02      Due to good climate and its proximity to large consumer centers,
agriculture in the Zona da Mata flourished during the 18th and 19th
centuries, particularly the production of coffee, dairy products, and
sugar. Over the last 50 years, however, development of lands in southern
Brazil through mechanization and large-scale production, and the effects of
a coffee eradication program, brought about a steady decline of agriculture
in the region. The Zona da Mata became a depressed area, with considerable
chronic poverty, and a substantial emigration of people in search of work
and better opportunities elsewhere in Brazil.
1.03      Partially as a result of the earlier predominance of coffee, the
Zona da Mata has a reasonably equitable distribution of land holdings,
with about 57% of the land concentrated in holdings of not more than 100
ha.  A large number of farmers are engaged mainly in seasonal cattle
fattening or small dairy operations, coupled with the production of
subsistence food crops. Rural income per capita for the area was estimated
in 1975 at about US$250, well below the national average for the rural
sector of US$340.
1.04      The goal of the development program in the Zona da Mata was to
link productive support components with social infrastructure to promote
balanced social and economic development of the -agion. The justification
for the project matched the Bank's growing emphasis on rural development
and the improvement of living standards of small farmers.
1/ The project has usually been known under its Brazilian denomination,
PRODEMATA.

II. PROJECT FORMULATION
A. Identification, Preparation and Appraisal
2.01      The State Govor:nment recognized the extent of absolute poverty of
the region and believed that a high rate of growth was necessary to
increase the income of the poor. However, it did not believe that the
"trickle down' effects of rapid growth would be sufficient without a
concentrated regional development effort and the provision of social
services for the poor.
2.02      The project was prepared with these goals in mind, and its
concepts and operating policy were developed by the staff of the State
Rural Development Agency (RURALMINAS) and the State Secretariat of Planning
(SEPLAN-MG). The State Government sought the assistance of the Bank in
preparing and financing the project.
2.03      The Bank preparation and appraisal missions of 1975 scaled down
the size of the project. While none of participating agencies (39) could
be eliminated, the Bank was able to reduce total costs from US$360 million
in the original proposal to US$139 million. Post-appraisal missions
continued the efforts of earlier missions in reorienting the credit program
towards reaching more sharecroppers and small farmers. It was recognized
that more work was needed to develop appropriate technological packages.
Refinements in project design were expected to evolve in the course of
implementation.
B. Board Approval
2.04       The Board approved the project on January 11, 1977.  During the
discussion, the Board raised the following concerns: (a) the extent to
which the project emphasized regional development and linkages between
urban and rural areas and between on- and off-farm employment; and (b) the
negative real interest rates at which the credit would be on-lent to
subborrowers.
2.05      In general, it was understood that while the project did not
focus directly on increasing employment and promoting regional development
goals, it was intended to be a first step in achieving them. Regarding the
issue of negative real interest rates, the Board was satisfied that the
credit would be directed towards small farmers and that it would be closely
supervised to reduce dangers of misallocation and slippage.
C. Obiectives and Description
2.06      The objectives of the project were to improve living standards
and Incomes of small farmers in the Zona da Mata through: (a) increasing
farm production by expanding the area under cultivation and raising yields;
and (b) expanding and improving social services to farmers and the general
rural population.



- 67 -
2.07      These objectives were to be achieved by an integrated project,
Including:
(a) agricultural credit for the production of crops, livestock,
reforestation, swamp reclamation and rural electrification;
(b) agricultural support services such as extension, agricultural
research and development of cooperatives;
(c) social infrastructure for health and education; and
(d) arrangements to coordinate, monitor and evaluate the project.
D. Project Cofts and Financing
2.08      Total project costs at appraisal were estimated at US$139
million. Of this total, the Bank was originally expected to finance US$42
million, or 30%. Because of a delay in the flow of state counterpart
resources at the start of the project, the Bank agreed in 1978 to increase
its reimbursement percentage from 30 to 35%. Later, as the Borrower
continued to experience counterpart funding difficulties, the reimbursement
rate was raised in December 1983 to 67.5% for an 18-month period (Special
Action Program). Subsequently, this rate was extended through the end of
the project. At completion, total project costs were US$137,993,000, and
of this total the Bank had financed US$41,052,817 (29.7%). This
percentage, below the weighted average of the rates applicable over the
period of project implementation, resulted from the inflation rate which
increased rapidly during the last years of the project. Because of long
delays in processing claims, refunds to the project account from the
Central Bank of Brazil represented, in US dollar terms, much less than the
value of the expenditures effectively incurred. Project costs by
categories are shown in Table 1, and Withdrawal of Loan Proceeds in
Table 2.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
3.01      Project implementation started on June 1, 1976 under the State
Secretariat of Planning (SEPLAN-MG), with the State Rural Development
Agency (RURALMINAS) as the policy planner and coordinator of the 39
individual institutions participating in the project. Following Board
approval in January 1977, the Loan Agreement was signed in February
and became effective in June 1977. The first supervision mission took
place in April 1977. After three extensions of the Closing Date, the
project was terminated on December 31, 1984. Euitimated targets and actual
accomplishments by project component are shown In Table 3.



- 68 -
A. Project Components
Agricultural Credit
3.02      Based on information communicated by the banks on the use of
agricultural credit, the lending targets in crop areas were exceeded;
financed crop areas in fact doubled over the appraisal estimates.
The demand for credit was high until 1982, almost the end of the project
implementation period. This high demand coincided with a period of sharply
negative real interest rates. In 1983, when a countrywide squeeze on rural
credit resources occurred, and interest rates were sharply increased,
credit activities in the project were severely curtailed. ts a result of
inflation, no difficulties in loan repayments were identified. Indeed,
inflation sharply reduced the value of outstanding balances with interest
rates negative in real terms.
3.03      Most of the credit (78%) went to beneficiaries with less than 50
ha. The bulk of the credit (79%) was used to finance short-term working
capital (custeio) allegedly for foodcrops (corn, beans, rice) and dairy
operations, but probably much of this credit was diverted to coffee
production; the balance was used for investment (rural electrification,
reforestation, swamp reclamation). The average loan per beneficiary was
around US$400 per year.
3.04      Through the credit component, improvements were evident in
decision-making and in organizational and institutional attitudes at local
and state levels. Moreover, the rural extension service (EMATER) improved
its focus and surpassed its target number of credit beneficiaries (27,760
actual versus 25,000 at appraisal). Installed electrical trunklines and
reclaimed swamp (varzeas) also exceeded the appraisal estimates. On the
negative side, some difficulties occurred with the credit component, as
follows: (a) delays in providing credit because of poor communication
between local agencies of participating banks and EMATER, as well as
between the headquarters of participating banks and their local agencies;
(b) inadequate bank procedures; (c) lack of well-prepared farm plans; and
(d) lack of interest by farmers in reforestation.
Agricultural Services
3.05      Although impaired by the State of Minas Gerais' financial
difficulties, most of the goals the project set for the agricultural
services component were attained:
(a)    EPAMIG's research was reoriented towards small farmers.
Moreover, the results from the 160 experiments (104 at appraisal)
and 221 field trials (33 at appraisal) demonstrated that it was
possible, within the limited resources of small farmers, to
achieve a real increase in productivity ranging from 80 to 255%
for staple crops, primarily through the introduction of superior
varieties and better use of modern inputs.



- 69 -
(b)    By developing community groups, EMATER reached 9,400 new
farmers. It also increased the frequency of farm visits,
developed a strategy focused on small farmers, and improved
integration with other agencies participating in the project.
(c)    SUDECOOP promoted informal group activities, developed 204
small-farmer groups in coordination with EMATER, established a
training program for pre-cooperatives, and trained community
leaders. Also, SUDECOOP reached 8,700 new cooperative members
(5,800 at appraisal) and assisted 24 cooperatives (30 at
appraisal); in addition, it built 23 km of feeder roads (134 km
at appraisal) and constructed three marketing posts (13 at
appraisal).
3.06      The following problems delayed the implementation of the
agricultural services component:
(a)    General problems that affected two or more components:  During
the first five years of implementation, coordination was poor
between EMATER and RURALMINAS, the state agency responsible for
swamp reclamation, as well as between EMATER and EPAMIG. This
situation contributed to the lack of promotion of swamp
reclamation and reforestation. The cost analysis for
electrification, reforestation, cooperatives and swamp
reclamation was inadequate, making targets for these components
unrealistic. Training for reforestation and cooperatives was
inadequate, and monitoring and evaluation activities were
insufficient.
(b)    Problems specific to EMATER: Lack of resources forced the
project to reduce its goals. (EMATER hired 165 extensionists
instead of 200, the appraisal target.)
(c)    Problems specific to EPAMIG: A significant disparity was evident
between the high level of technology used in EPAMIG's applied
research program and the rates of adoption of this new technology
by small producers. EPAMIG maintained an inappropriate one-crop
orientation ia its research instead of developing an integrated
systems approach (technological package).
(d)    Problems specific to SUDECOOP:  While SUDECOOP's work to
strengthen existing cooperatives was satisfactory, expectations
for creation of new cooperatives were not fulfilled. The
shortfall reflects the resistance of small farmers to cooperative
activities. The original target was unrealistic and did not take
into account physical and marketing constraints and the legal and
administrative problems in establishing cooperatives. In
addition, the feeder roads target was not achieved because
SUDECOOP had insufficient technically qualified people to
implement the program.



- 70 -
Education
3.07      The implementation of the education component came to a
standstill at the end of 1978 for several reasons, including shortages of
funds, a change of the State Secretary of Education, and the strains
created by significant institutional changes advocated by the project. In
addition, other problems delayed the implementation of the component
throughout the project. These included: (a) indecision at the
administration level; (b) inadequate coordination between local and state
officials; (c) poor analysis of training needs and lack of promotion of
community centers; and (d) an excessive emphasis on quantifiable targets
(construction) rather than on quality goals (training).
3.08      Until 1983 a shortage of funds hampered the education component's
implementation. However, because the funding situation improved in 1984
and the project wPs extended to mid-1985, the revised targets for the
component were successfully met by the end of the project (Table 3): (a)
well-developed, non-formal education and training programs in the areas of
health, credit, agriculture and community development became operational;
(b) all 13 community learning centers (CACs) were constructed, remodelled
and became fully operational; (c) improvements were made in the curriculum
of 375 rural primary schools; (d) school gardens and canteens were
established in 320 schools, exceeding the original targets; (e) the number
of teachers trained and number of courses for supervision staff also
exceeded the revised targets; and (f) good local coordination between
EMATER, SUDECOOP and SEE was established.
Health
3.09     *The general performance of the project's health component has
been satisfactory. The physical targets were met and often exceeded the
appraisal targets (Table 3): (a) 113 health posts were constructed, 45
upgraded, and 224 posts are now in full operation; (b) the installation of
latrines and distribution o0 water filters increased, especially during the
last two years of the project; (c) selection, training and supervision of
health attendants and the supply of drugs improved in the last years of the
project; (d) significant improvements occurred in the integration of the
health system at the state and local levels; and (e) the communities became
more directly involved in the construction of health posts.
3.10      The monitoring of the quality targets was based on changes in the
indicators of services provided by the project to the project area
beneficiaries as shown:  (a) the number of beneficiary families
attending health posts increased from 29% in 1979 to 35% in 1984; (b) the
number of women delivering their babies in hospitals increased from 42% in
1977 to 72% in 1984 (however, only 25% returned to health posts for post-
natal care); (c) the proportion of children under six years attended by the
health posts increased from 32% in 1978 to 47% in 1984; and (d) vacci-
nations increased from 17% in 1977 to 44% in 1984.



- 71 -
3.11     Problems which delayed the implementation of the health component
were: (a) at the regional level: (i) lack of clearly defined channels of
authority and technical leadership; (ii) poor coordination and teamwork;
and (iii) poor and sporadic supervision; and (b) at the state level:
(i) lack of monitoring and evaluation as well as training and supervision;
(ii) underfinancing and understaffing; (iii) poor planning with unclear
objectives., and inadequate coordination between state and local levels; and
(iv) lack of supervision on the utilization of the resources destined to
the health posts and centers.
Project Administration
3.12      Integration of the project into the State operational structure
was reasonably successful, with administration carried out by executing
agencies under the coordination of RURALMINAS. The executing agencies,
including project coordination, performed well to the extent that some
agencies redefined their general institutional priorities towards small
farmers. Community development mechanisms were established, and good use
was made of consultants in credit, marketing, cooperatives and project
administration.
3.13      However, project administration was not without problems.  For
example, inadequate interagency coordination for the social components
(health and education) and between cooperatives and extension caused delays
in the implementation of these components. Also, monitoring of the
project's progress (and evaluation of its subsequent impact) was difficult
because of inadequate data.
3.14      EPAMIG did not receive proper guidance during project implementa-
tion. It was initially reluictant to work at the farm level (due to its
inexperience in this type of work) and to cooperate closely with EMATER in
the design of an adaptive research program.
3.15      Institution building at the local level suffered from excessive
concentration of authority at the central level. Government intervention
tended to be heavy-handed, not allowing for adequate community participa-
tion. Municipalities lacked the necessary staff to deal with the expecta-
tions of the rural groups or to develop appropriate plans and services for
small farmers. Finally, the community groups showed little self-reliance,
being excessively dependent on project funding and ENATER's technical
support.
B. Disbursements
3.16      In general, disbursement rates were satisfactory.  They were
considerably above the rates of the other rural development projects in
Brazil. Total disbursements amounted to US$41,052,820, corresponding to
97.71 of the original loan amount (Table 2). The undisbursed balance of
US$947,180 was cancelled.



- 72 -
C. Procurement
3.17      There was no evidence of procurement problems.  Farm inputs were
procured by individual farmers through local trade channels. Other
components, such as swamp reclamation, expansion and improvement of
education and health infrastructure, and strengthening of productive
support services, which involved minor construction works, were contracted
on a local competitive bidding basis that was satisfactory to the Bank.
Vehicles and other equipment were also procured on the basis of
local competitive bidding. Since most of the civil works were small in
size and the equipment was produced locally and readily avaiiable, foreign
contractors were not active participants ir the project.
D. Reporting and Auditing
3.18      Project reporting was the responsibility of the coordination
unit, while annual evaluation reports were prepared by the Federal
University of Vicosa. These were based on an annual update of an initial
sample of over 800 producers and provide much quantitative data and
qualitative comments on project issues. The project quarterly reports
failed to ascertain the end-use of credit on-lent to the producers;
these monitoring reports were based on bank records, and the Borrower made
no attempt to explain the discrepancies identified by its evaluation
reports.
3.19      Audit reports prepared by the Secretariat of Internal Control of
the Ministry of Finance reported favorably on the financial performance of
the project. However, they failed to comment on the end-use of resources
under the credit component, since they were satisfied with the auditing
procedures adopted for the banks' internal control.
E.  Adherence to Loan Covenants
3.20      Loan compliance by the Borrower was generally satisfactory.
However, the Borrower did not fully comply with the loan covenants in areas
pertaining to EMATER's staffing, the provision of farm development plans
for farmers involved in the credit program, and the funding and hiring of
consultants. In recognition of the practical difficulties involved in
1979, the Bank waived the condition concerning the provision of farm
development rlans. In 1982, the incremental hiring of EMATER staff was
changed from 200 to 168. Shortfalls in funding prevented the project from
hiring as many consultant services as expected, and many consultants were
hired on a monthly basis instead of a longer-term basis as originally
envisioned.



- 73 -
IV. ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL IMPACT
A. Production
4.01      Data from field surveys (Table 4) among small assisted producers
during the period 1976-1984 indicate an increase in the production of corn
and commercial crops (coffee, sugarcane) but a decrease in the production
of rice and beans. The same trend is evident for crops produced by small
non-assisted producers, with the exception of sugarcane, the production of
which, among non-assisted farmers, dropped sharply. For all producers
(assisted and non-assisted), areas planted under rice declined, while areas
for the other foodcrops remained unchanged. The productivity (yield/ha) of
foodcrops showed little change, except for corn, which increased
significantly for assisted and non-assisted producers alike.
4.02      For coffee, assisted and non-assisted producers increased their
areas at the same rate, but the assisted ones achieved higher increases in
productivity than the non-assisted ones. The development of coffee
production among all producers was in response to coffee's attractive
prices on the world market in the late 1970s, which resulted from the
disastrous frosts that destroyed the plantations in southern Brazil.
The faster rate of growth in productivity for coffee among assisted
producers could probably be attributed to their greater access to credit
and technical assistance, though coffee was not among the priority crops
financed by the project. A similar case may be made for sugarcane, the
area and productivity of which declined among non-assisted producers but
rose among assisted ones.
4.03      From the data summarized above, it is extremely difficult to
determine the precise productic impact of the project. Such impact as
there was, was clearly concentrated on three crops: coffee, sugarcane and
corn. Of these three, only corn was specific4lly a target crop for the
project, and for this crop, productivity rose as fast among non-assisted as
among assisted producers. There may be a case to be made that, without the
project, the advances in corn technology ahich were occurring throughout
Brazil would not have reached the project area as rapidly as they did.
However, any precise quantification of benefits along those lines is
virtually impossible.
B. Income Levels
4.04      The conclusions reached above on the impact of the project on
physical output are broadly reflected in the survey of income levels in
Table 5.  The average incomes of all farmers, assisted and non-assisted,
rose during the project period, but there was no significant difference in
the relative position of assisted and non-assisted at the beginning and end
of the project.
4.05      The largest increases in incomes (gross, net and agricultural)
occurred in the first years of the project, througn 1979; thereafter,
incomes decreased to little more than the levels prevailing at the



- 74 -
beginning of the project. Between Year 0 and Year 8, the average net
family income of assisted producers increased by 23%; however, a comparison
between the average net family income during the two first and last project
years shows an increase of 5%. The available data suggests that, although
assisted farmers developed their coffee and sugarcane production more than
the non-assisted farmers, they did not really benefit significantly in
terms of income. This could be explained by the declin'.ng net returns
available from commercial crops, especially coffee, relative to food crops
which occurred afcer 1980.
4.06      The major problem concerning income levels was the failure of
producers with farms in the categories of less than 50 ha to attain a
level of net income equal to 2.5 minimum wages that was envisioned for the
project. Analysis during project implementation suggested that at least
24 ha were needed to eventually attain this standard. Sharecroppers and
landowners with less than 24 ha were therefore unable to attain this level
through agricultural activities alone. Perhaps, with better applied
research and higher rates of technology adoption, the number of hectares
needed to achieve the minimum income level could have been reduced.
C. Economic Rate of Return
4.07      In view of the difficulties described above in attributing
production benefits to the project, no meaningful rate of return can be
calculated. The project permitted a flow of subsidized credit and
technical assistance towards the assisted producers, and those resources
were to a significant extent invested in coffee and sugarcane production.
To the extent that these assets are maintained in future, they may
represent a long-term benefit, though this will depend on a reversal of the
adverse price trends which have affected these crops in recent years. In
the case of food crops, the advances in corn production were made through
the application of technical assistance. The project probably, therefore,
provided for a more rapid transfer of new varieties into the project areas
than would otherwise have occurred and this produced some short-term
economic benefits. The application of short-term production credit,
however, seems to have had no direct impact on food crop production. This
represented about 80% of all the credit resources applied to the project;
because of the application of negative real interest rates, the original
resources applied to the short-term credit component have by now ceased to
exist as an asset for future application.
V. QUALITY OF LIFE AND SOCIAL IMPACT
5.01      The project had a positive impact on the quality of life,
especially in the areas of health, nutrition and farmer training. However,
in education, the impact was more limited.



- 75 -
5.02      Because the institutions developed their focus on small producers
and their families, the project led to a considerable increase in the
number of families participating in the activities of the training centers
(CAC) (from 6% in 1982 to 10% in 1984). In 1984, 21% of husbands and 14%
of wives participated in at least one professional training course.
Moreover, 32% of the families with children aged 14 to 25 had at least one
child participating in a course.
5.03      The evaluation of the effect of the education component in the
project area shows that there was no change in the growth rate of school
registrations. About 20% of the children still remain out of school
because of the absence of schools beyond the fifth grade, the necessity to
work, and the lack of incentives for a better education. Although this
average is relatively lower than the national average (34%), the stagnation
in the registration growth rate reflects the magnitude and complexity of
this problem and the limitations of the project in this sector.
5.04      While the indicators of infant mortality did not show
improvements in most of the project area (a consequence of the slow start
in improving the health posts and centers), the data collected in the well
developed health center of Lima Duarte show t'hiat the infant mortality rate
declined from 100 per thousand in 1975 to 40 per thousand in 1983. This
suggests that, with the improvements occurring in the health services of
the project area, the health situation will improve significantly in the
near future.
5.05      In the region, the data on food consumption and diet composition
show a general deterioration during the years 1977-83, with a small
recovery in 1984. However, levels of nutrition calculated for the project
beneficiaries showed that caloric intake increased. Food consumption among
project beneficiaries appeared higher than among non-beneficiaries,
probably because their per capita incomes were higher from the start.
VI. BANK PERFOiMANCE
6.01      Overall, Bark performance was satisfactory.  During
identification and preparation, the Bank managed to identify and match
State Government goals with the agricultural potential and demographic
structure of the project area. The Bank also succeeded in convincing the
State Government to reorient extension and research away from large farmers
and to develop a better monitoring and evaluation system. More than
expected, or to the credit of Bank persistence, state agencies and banks
did a good job in directing their efforts towards small farmers.
6.02      The appraisal mission, however, underestimated the extent to
which the macroeconomic environment (commodity prices, input prices,
marketing) could deteriorate, and thus the impact on project performance.



- 76 -
During appraisal, the Bank did not fully assess the institutional/
organizational problems associated with reforestation, swamp reclamation
and social infrastructure development.
6.03      The Bank also failed to identify the extent of the diversion of
credit resources to coffee and (possibly) to non-agricultural uses,
especially in the early stages of the project. It belatedly recognized the
negative impact of this diversion on the attainment of project
objectives, but it was too late to correct past implementation weaknesses.
6.04      Otherwise, Bank supervision reports satisfactorily identified and
provided solutioxis for most project implementation problems. Early on, the
Bank concentrated on achieving quantifiable targets (health posts/centers,
school centers) and gaining the necessary State support. By mid-1980, the
Bank missions had correctly focused on developing the qualitative aspects
of institution building. Throughout, the Bank acknowledged the importance
of including consultants and specialists in components such as project
administration, extension and cooperatives. The Bank also showed
flexibility in introducing new components such as non-formal educatiua.
One area where there should have been more emphasis was in the financial
analysis and design of technical packages. Even though increasing
productivity and technology adoption was a major goal, the project never
fully succeeded in ensuring a high adoption rate, partly because economic
policies did not provide sufficient incentives for farmers to undertake
the additional investment.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.01      The project started in a climate of optimism with all the
indicators suggesting eventual success. However, basic economic conditions
changed in such a way that, overall, the success of the project was
jeopardized. During its eight-year implementation period, the country
underwent a considerable number of changes which affected the continuity of
policy and public support. The country also experienced severe economic
difficulties. Despite all this, the project closely adhered to its initial
objectives. In the project's last years, because of a reduction in both
the supply and demand for credit resources, decreases in prices of
agricultural products and a reduction in the supply of counterpart funds,
the level of operations was reduced, and the implementation period had to
be extended to attain appraisal targets. Representatives of State and
local institutions, as well as Bank supervision missions, worked hard to
resolve problems throughout project implementation.
7.02      The total project cost was approximately US$140 million
equivalent. Project implementation lasted eight years, exceeding the
appraisal estimate by three years. During these last three years, the
project benefited from the Special Action Program (SAP), which increased
the rate of Bank disbursements. While this program had a positive effect
on implementation of the social infrastructure, it had little impact on



- 77 -
credit availability, which by then was minimal. Overall, loan disbursement
was satisfactory; by the end of the project, 97% of the loan had been
disbursed.
7.03      All quantitative targets for the social components of the project
(education, health and sanitation, community centers) were met. Credit
resources were entirely disbursed, mostly for short-term investment and
seasonal lending; crop areas financed under the project exceeded original
targets.  However, there is some evidence that the credit resources
intended for food crops under the project were in fact used for coffee and
sugarcane. Government counterpart funding channeled from the State
budgetary resources was normally available, although in the last years of
the project, only recurrent costs could still be funded, and investments
became severely constrained by lack of funds.
7.04      The project had a limited economic impact on its beneficiaries
and on the Zona da Mata as a whole. With the exception of corn, no general
increase in foodcrop production, or productivity-one of the basic
objectives of the project--could be identified. Corn production did rise
significantly, among assisted and non-assisted producers alike. The
availability of credit and technical assistance in the area probably
contributed to the aaoption of n w high-yielding corn varieties which were
becoming available throughout Brazil during the project period. However,
it is difficult to be precise in attributing this benefit to the project as
such. In contrast, there does seem to have been a real difference in the
productive impact of the project between assisted and non-assisted farmers
in the production of both coffee and sugarcane. This suggests that
short-term and heavily subsidized credit provided under the project for
food crop production was to a considerable extent diverted to the
development of permanent crops.
7.05      Incomes of assisted producers did not increase at a higher rate
than those of non-assisted producers. There is even an indication that
non-assisted producers were somewhat more resilient to adverse economic
conditions than the assisted ones, because they rely more on family labor.
Many sharecroppers and producers in the size category of less than 50 ha
did not attain a net income equivalent to two and one-half minimum wages,
which was necessary for inclusion in the project.
7.06      The project implemented an ambitious program of health
posts/centers construction and reform, and built a large number of
community learning centers. In the field of staff training, recruitment of
technical personnel and non-formal education, the project also reached its
objectives. Despite its budgetary constraints, the State of Minas Gerais
managed to keep the new social infrastructure reasonably well staffed and
supplied.
7.07      Throughout the project, the State maintained its stated policy of
assisting small producers and improving their social conditions. Being the
first project of this nature, the project experienced many institutional



- 78 -
difficulties.  Coordination between the numerous institutions involved had
to be slowly developed. Excessive centralization of the executing
agencies, repeated changes in policy and staffing, and insufficient
commitment to project objectives were problems which the project had to
overcome.
7.08      Some lessons can be drawn from this experience:
(a) a serious mistake was made in focusing a high proportion of
loan resources on short-term credit at a time of sharply
negative real interest rates. The incremental credit base
provided by the project was rapidly eroded in real terms;
therefore, such benefits as may have been attributable to
them were at best only short-term. Some long-term impact
from these resources seems to have been made io the planting
and production of coffee.  Though coffee was not officially
assisted by the project, farmers receiving subsidized credit
probably wisely managed to divert its use into the
development of this more permanent asset;
(b) projects of this nature should draw more on community
participation and rely less on the role played by the
centralized bureaucracies which tended to be heavy-handed and
unresponsive to small producers' priorities;
(c) in projects of this nature, it is very difficult to
differentiate, ex-ante or ex-post, between the benefits
accruing directly from project intervention from those
accruing from general technological change; and
(d) a quick pace of loan disbursements is not necessarily a
reliable indicator of good project performance or impact.
In this project, disbursement on subsidized credit was not
matched with commensurate increases in output, while
investments in physical and social infrastructure were not
fully supported by current expenditures to maintain the
quality of services for which they were intended.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Although early efforts to provide technical assistance to farmers
began in Isolated and sporadic fashion much earlier in Brazil, it was not
until the decade of the sixties that these efforts were coordinated on a
national scale. In 1961 several agencies were organized to collaborate
with the federal Ministry of Agriculture to provide such services; by 1964
these extension services were formed under a loose association called the
jAssociacao Brasileiro de Credito e Assistencia Rural" (ABCAR).  This
association of state agencies provided services to 15 states, had some 370
field units, and 794 technicians were providing technical assistance to
some 466 municipalities.  By 1966 all such federally-sponsored functions
were officially integrated under the ABCAR system, under the coordination
of the Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) by Decree No. 58.382.
1.02      Some ten years later (1975), the ABCAR system was again legally
transformed (Law 6.126) into the National System for Technical Assistance
and Rural Extension (SIBRATER) and a new entity, the Brazilian Technical
Assistance and Rural Extension Company (EMBRATER) was formed to stimulate,
promote and coordinate agricultural extension efforts at the federal
level. State level companies (EMATERs) wera formed to actually carrv out
the functions in the 22 individual states and in the Federal District.
Extension duties in the tuo territories were incorporated under territorial
ASTERs. These 25 associate companies were authorized to function within
the overall coordination of EMBRATER. However, the agricultural extension
services in Sao Paulo state, are executed by the Office of Coordination for
Integrated Technical Assistance (CATI), and CATI is not a part of the
national (SIBRATER) system of associate companies.
II. PROJECT FORMULATIWi
A. Identification, Preparation and Appraisal
2.01      Close collaboration between the newly formed research and
extension entities (EMBRAPA and EMBRATER) during the period 1972-76 had
created an awareness of the need to strengthen the extension services so
that they might be entirely compatible with a similar development of the
agricultural research services, which was occurring as a result of the
Agricultural Research I Project (Loan 1249-BR). A formal request for such
assistance was received from Brazil's Miaister of Agriculture (January 21,
1976), and a Bank mission identified the project in June of that year. The
project was essentially prepared by EMBRATER, with assistance from two Bank
missions. Appraisal took place during June-July 1977 and was followed by a
post-appraisal mission in November of that year in order to accommodate the
revised development plans being proposed by the new government.
2.02      During project preparation and appraisal, the Bank encouraged
EMBRATER to include greater emphasis in the pro4ect for: (a) staff
training; (b) methodology studies; and (c) audio-visual aids. EMBRATER
requested greater emphasis on social extension (home economics, community
development and nutrition), but the Bank believed that there should be
exclusive emphasis on improving agricultural nroduction through technology



- 90 -
transfer by field extensionists. The EMBRATER plan for a four-year
implementation period was not questioned and the Bank assumed that the
SIBRATER system codld absorb funding at the rate of about US$25.0 million
per annum. For the first four years of project implementation, this goal
proved to be highly optimistic (Annex 1, Table 1).
B. Board Approval
2.03      No serious issues were raised during negotiations.  However, the
Board, in approving the project expressed concern in two areas. One was
the possible effect the project might have on native Indian tribes. Staff
replied that these matters were the responsibility of the Indian Foundation
(FUNAI) but that close collaboration with EMBRATER and the EMATERs/ASTERs
would be maintained to permit technical assistance, as and when requested,
for the more broadly acculturated tribes. The other concern expressed by
the Board was regarding the high cost of providing extension services,
economically, in sparsely populated remote areas. The staff responded that
this was indeed seen as an acceptable risk and that the per unit cost of
extension services would be monitored in rrder to encompass the advantages
of scale and population density.
C. Objectives and Description
2.04      The main objective of the project Tas to strengthen the extension
system in Brazil by providing: (a) capital investments for basic
infrastructure; (b) technical assistance; (c) extension methodology
studies; (d) equipment to improve communications; (e) the organization of
producer groups and cooperatives; and (f) incremental staffing.
Specifically, these means would permit EMBRATER to:
(a) provide the SIBRATER system with the financial strength and
long-term security necessary to improve and expand the coverage
of extension services to farmers;
(b) improve the efficiency of these services; thus helping to raise
farm incomes, particularly for small farmers; and
(c) strengthen the administrative, planning, monitoring and
evaluation capabilities of EMBRATER and EMATER/ASTER staffs.
2.05      Project administration and coordination was to be the sole
responsibility of EMBRATER. Responsibility for civil works and field
extension operations at the state/territorial level would be assumed by
the EMATERs/ASTERs under the guidance and coordination of EMBRATER, which
would set up a special unit in Brasilia to handle such functions. This
unit was eventually called the Nucleus for International Projects (NUPIN).
D. Project Costs and Financing
2.06      It was agreed that the Bank would finance 35% of total project
costs of US$284.9 million. The loan, therefore, amounted to US$100.0
million, of which $40.4 million com1rised the foreign exchange component.
Local cost financing, therefore, amounted to $59.6 million. In 1983 the
project was included under the Special Action Program (SAP). This program,



- 91 -
which became effective on October 14, 1983, was made retroactive to March
1, 1983; under SAP, Bank participation was raised to 67.5% of project
costs. This higher disbursement percentage remained in effect until
December 31, 1984, when, at the request of EMBRATER, it reverted to 35%.
The higher level of disbursement, for a 21-month period, had the effect of
raising overall Bank participation in project costs from 35% to 4;%. Total
project costs amounte' to US$212.7 equivalent, of which the Bank loan of
US$100.0 million was fully disbursed as of July 30, 1986 (Annex 1, Tables 2
and 3).
III.  IMPLEMEtTATION
3.01      The loan was approved May 16, signed May 22, and became effective
September 22, 1978. The project was completed by December 31, 1985.
Although a four-year project had been visualized at appraisal (para. 2.02)
the project was actually completed about 7.5 years after the date of Board
Approval. Estimated targets and accomplishments by component are showa in
Annex 1, Table 4.
A. Project Components
Capital Investments - Basic Infrastructure
3.02      At appraisal, ten state headquarters offices were scheduled for
construction. This was amended to 23 (December 18, 1981), and all were
finished at project coimpletion. In addition, 336 local offices, 95% of the
revised (December 18, 1981) target, were built under the project.
Originally, eight training centers were plcuned. This was subsequently
amended to 16 and 100% of the revised target was constructed and fully
equipped under the project* Twenty-five libraries were completed, or 104%
of the original target. The amended program for civil works reflected an
overall increase in costs fox this item of 65% above the total estimated
cost.
3.03      In addition to civil works, the project provided capital
investments for equipment. Vehicle purchases (4,036 units) represented 77%
of the revised target. Practical training ut.its numbered 102, or equal to
100% of the revised tarvet. Nineteen fisheries colonies were established
(100% of target) and the farm and fisheries equipment required to equip the
training units (102) and fisheries colonies (19) was fully provided.
Training and Technical Assistance
3.04      The project provided pre-service and in-service training for
3,887 incremental staff. In-service training for all technlzal staff
averaged 1.4 courses per year, as compared to the one course per year
estimated at appraisal. In contrast the original targets for post-graduate
training were amended downwards from 174 MSc and 36 PhD to 100 MSc and 10
PhD graduates; the final result was only 97 MSc and 1 PhD graduate. All
post-graduate training was provided by Brazilian universities. The
decision to reduce the scope of post-graduate training reflects a much
different EMBRATER philosophy concerning the specific need for post-



- 92 -
graduate training for extension staff. The project was prepared, and
appraised at a time when EMBRATER's management considered advaneed degree
training necessary for subject-matter specialists. The new administration,
which took office on March 16, 1979, did not share this view. Instead, the
training of farm monitors, i.e., selected farmers with the capacity to
influence their neighboring farmers and to assist the field extensionist to
reach a larger number of farmers, was judged as having more immediate
impact and was introduced during project implementation. Nevertheless,
monitor training was actually provided to only 14,175, or 68% of the
estimated target of 20,750. The use of consultants, originally estimated
at 75 staff-years was also given much greater emphasis under the new
EMBRATER administration, and actually 84 staff-years were utilized.
However, as most of these services comprised short-term consultancies with
Brazilian nationals, the overall average cost (US$9,726 per annum) was well
below the original estimate of US$75,000 per annum.
Extension Methodology Studies
3.05      One of the premises of the project was that EMBRATER would seek
new ways to improve the ratio of field extensionists to farmers (para.
2.04). This was to be done by adopting the group approach to extension,
wherever possible, and by conducting a series of studies to determine how
this group approach could be adapted to the northeast, north and
center-west regions which had extension services severely lacking in
scope. These studies were designed to test methods of greater efficiency
and effectiveness in technology transfer. Three states: Rio Grande do
Norte, Paraiba and Sergipe participated in these studies. By 1985 requests
had been received from several more states which wanted to test out the
group or "convivencia" method of field extension.1/ As part of this
system the use of field demonstration plots was emphasized and almost 8,000
of such plots were prepared during the seven-year project period, or some
56% above the original estimate. Field days and group visits by farmers
were more difficult to organize, however, and only reached 16% of target.
3.06      Other results of these studies were the beneficial changes in the
system of field supervision, in five states, i.e., Sergipe, Alagoas,
Paraiba, kio Grande do Norte and Ceara. The organization of groups in
rural communities and a system of evaluation to measure the effects of
alternative methods of field extension practice were also among the
significant results from these methodology studies.
Equipment to Improve Communication Methods
3.07      With the possible exception of more widespread and innovative use
of audio-visual aids (particularly video-taped programs for use with TV
monitors) the major contribution of the project in this area was an
upgrading of the more traditional methods. These improvements comprised
provision of 2 large printing presses and the upgrading of 14 smaller
1/ Under the Agricultural Extension II Project, the method is to be
gradually introduced to all states/ territories within the SIBRATER
system. However, its application will be modified or adapted to suit
local needs within the states.



- 93 -
(off-set) plants; the provision of 12 production units for radio programs
and 7 cameras for video cassette production; and improvements to EMATER
print-shops. The output from these units was as follows: over 550,000
posters; 1,700 technical albums; over 6 million leaflets and folders; 354
video cassette programs; 8,000 (taped) radio programs and about 45,000
color slides. In general, the amount of printed and photographic materials
produced, however, was substantially below the ambitious estimates made at
appraisal.
3.08      In the area of communications, the project also completed the
telephone network within the system (400 telephones and 24 automated
exchanges), Incorporating 15 radio or radio-telephone networks as necessary
in remote areas. The use of computers for standard administrative tasks
(payroll, inventory, statistical data presentation) was also enhanced by
the project. Pre-project computer use had been limited to two states in
the southeast, Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina. Under the project,
the availability of computer terminals in an additional 13 EMATERs/ASTERs
and at EMBRATER headquarters has led to standard administrative practices
and quick access to statistical data generated by the SIBRATER system.
Similarly, the use of telex terminals in most states has improved
communications between the EMATERs/ASTERs and EMBRATER headquarters.
Currently, there are 40 telex terminals in the SIBRATER system.
Organization of Cooperatives
3.09      There were delays in making this component effective because
there was a lack of specialized staff and interest on the part of the
EMATERs/ASTERs to participate. In 1980, following lnitial delays, a strong
program was built up based on intensified activities to form producer,
women's and youth groups. By the final year of project implmentation
(1985), a total of 680 pilot agricultural cooperatives were being directly
assisted by their participation in project-related activities including the
training of social and field extensionists in community development
activities. This compares with the estimate of 220 cooperatives to be
assisted under the original project description. The use of consultants to
provide technical assistance for this component exceeded, by 9 man-years,
the original estimate of 75 man-years. Consultant use was particularly
heavy in the later years (1982-85).
Incremental Staffing
3.10      The project proposal was that, to achieve a rapid expansion of
the extension coverage (from 565,000 farmers in 1977 to 1.3 million farmers
by project completion) an additional 3,734 extension staff would be
required. Despite an extremely slow start in this area, i.e., a two-year
time lag, by December 1984 1.2 million (92%) farmers were being assisted
and 3,887 (104%) incremental staff were hired. The increase in staffing
reflects the greater emphasis now being placed on social extension.
Originally, the project did not support the field work in this area (par&.
2.02). However, at the request of EMBRATER, the Bank authorized an
amendment to the loan documents (December 19, 1981) to permit entry of 500
social extension workers under the project. In 197?, the total number of
agents working in this area of social extension, in SIBRATER was 1,210; by
December 1985 this number had increased to 2,253. Details of pre- and
post-project staffing levels are provided in Annex 1, Table 5 and 6.



- 94 -
3.11      As a result of the project, overall SIBRATER staffing was
expected to increase from 14,760 (1977) to 18,494 (1981); the actual 1981
data are comparable to that estimate. By 1985 total staffing had grown to
22,768. The significant increase during the years 1981-1985 is almost
entirely due to increased tasks being allotted to the system under specific
projects, such as: (a) the Assistance Program to Small Producers (PAPP) in
the northeast; (b) Rural Development Programs in the Northwest under
Superintendency for the Development of the Center-West (SUDECO); (c) Land
Distribution and Settlement Programs under INCRA; (d) Enlargement of the
Program to Recover Riverine Flood Plains (PROVARZEAS); (e) Development of
Cocoa Production (PROCACAO); and (f) Development of Rubber Production in
the north and northwest and east under PROBOR. This rapidly expanding
SIBRATER staff also reflects the need to improve, i.e., lower, extensionist
to farmer ratios as quickly as possible. This rsttern of higher
extensionist to farmer ratios is not uncommon during periods of rapid
agricultural development where sudden high demand for extension services in
remote areas, with widely scattered holdings and poor infrastructure, tends
to lead to higher staffing at least in the short-run. Much can be learned
from more efficient use of mass media and group extension methods currently
in use in the south and south-east. By adopting these methods to the
developing regions of the north, northeast and center-west, these ratios
can be lowered to provide greater efficiency within the system.  The
follow-up project also seeks to *ncourage such efficiency in these less
developed regions.
3.12      During the period of project implementation, the additional field
staff made possible increased extension services from a total 2,973
municipalities in 1977 to 3,177 in 1985, or 90% of all municipalities.
Small and medium farmers account for 98% of this coverage and large farmers
essentially provide their own technical assistance or seek help directly
from the private sector, research stations of EMBRAPA and/or faculties of
agronomy at the universities, as the case may be. Details of the staff
distribution and extension coverage under the SIBRATER system, with a
comparison of pre- and post-project data, is provided in Annex 1, Table 7.
B. Disbursements
3.13      When compared to the original estimates at project appraisal,
disbursement performance was initially poor. During FY79 to FY81, it was
lower than 21% of the estimate. By end of FY83 it had reached only 43%.
However, from that point onwards progress was much more rapid, i.e., from
July 1983 to December 1985. As noted in para. 2.06, the better
disbursement performance during this period owed much to the higher
disbursement percentage (67.5%) under the SAP, which was in force for 21
months during FY84/85. The loan of US$100.0 million was totally disbursed
by June 30, 1986 (Annex 1, Table 1). The following were considered to be
the major constraints affecting disbursc-nent performance, particularly
during the first two years of project implementation:
(a) political uncertainties and policy changes;
(b) shortfalls and delays in counterpart funding, particularly at the
state/territory or associate (EMATER/ASTER) level;



_ 95 -
(c) high inflation rates combined with slow reimbursement procedures;
from EMATER to EMBRATER to Bank, which produced a lower dollar
value of the reimbursement request; such erosion of dollar values
was estimated to be between 15% and 25% over the period; and
(d) frequent staff changes, particularly at the federal
(EMBRATER/NUPIN) and state (EMATER) administrative levels which
delayed project implementation and frequently nullified, or
seriously modified, the Annual Plans and Budgets (PROATERs)
(para. 5.02).
3.14      In addition, because of the constant devaluation of the cruzeiro
and some real cost savings, unit costs on many items were much lower in US
dollar terms than those estimated at appraisal. This was particularly true
of staff and local consultants' salaries which dropped by about 50X in US
dollar terms. Also, Bank and Government expectations concerning execution
capabilities for some components may have been overly optimistic (para.
3.07). As a result, disbursement took place over a period of seven and
one-half years, as opposed to the four years estimated at appraisal.
C. Procurement
3.15      Procurement, in general, was as agreed upon at negotiations and
was satisfactory to the Bank. The only comment made by Bank supervision
missions was in the area of civil works contracts where rapid inflation
required a price adjustment clause in construction contracts. This
required careful monitoring as did the review of contract work "add-ons" to
amended contracts. These were also influenced by the rapid price
adjustments on long-term construction contracts and adequate monitoring of
such "add-ons' was difricult to achieve. EMBRATER's civil engineering
unit, within NUPIN, was advised of these potential dangers; as a result
contract monitoring was tightened.
De Reports and Audit
Reports
3.16      EMBRATER was required to submit progress reports every six
months. In all, 14 such reports were received by the Bank. The final
report also served as a completion report and recapitulated the data for
the full project implementation period to project completion. The format
&aLx oresentatinn of the reports varied, following frequent changes in the
project coordinator. However, the factual content of the reports followed
an adequate pattern which was useful in comparing the progress of
implementation from one year to the next. The due dates for presentation
of these reports as specified in the Project Agreement were found to be
impractical; i.e., 30 days after the close of the reporting period.
EMBRATER/NUPIN, as the project coordinating unit, had first to receive the
basic data from the 25 state/territory executing agencies and then compile
a composite report. In 1981, it was agreed that submission to the Bank
would occur no later than six months after thne close of the period under
review. This arrangement worked reasonably well during the years 1982-85.
On the planning side the Work Program and Budgets (PROATERs) for the coming
year, which were presented by each state and then submitted to the Bank by



- 96 -
EMBRATER, were received on time or within acceptable delay limits. These
planning documents were instrumental in enhancing the value of the progress
reports as they provided a basis for monitoring the expected target against
actual accomplishments.
Audit
3.17      The seven audit reports for the years 1978-85 were duly received
by the Bank. In most cases, the auditing agency, the Secretaria de
Controle Interno (SECIN), provided an unqualified audit report, and no
serious discrepancies on procedure or content were noted. Delays in
submitting these audits seldom exceeded 30 days.
E. Adherence to Covenants
3.18      In general, adherence to the Loan and Project Agreements was
satisfactory, with the exception of the three minor discrepancies outlined
below:
(a) Post-Graduate Training. Due to changes in EMBRATER's
administration in early 1979 (para. 3.04), t!'- ---A for
post-graduate training, particularly at the PhD level, was
de-emph.asized. As a result of this change in policy, there was a
shift of focus to training at the MSc level, also to specialized
short courses, pre-service training and training of monitors
(PA Section 2.01).
(b) Project Guidelines. Although the project coordinating unit
(NUPIM) did its best to keep up with the frequent staff changes
at the state/territory (EMATER/ASTER) level, it was not always
possible for these state units to be adequately informed,
promptly. Following discussions with the Bank, a series of
revised guidelines, concerning the specific purposes and aims of
the project, were issued to ameliorate this situation (LA Section
3.02).
(c) Reporting of Adverse Conditions. The EMBRATER administration and
its project coordinating agency NUPIN, frequently failed to
report conditions which were interfering with executioa of the
project in some states (PA Section 2.11 (b)). This was brought
to their notice (August 6, 1981) and remedial action was taken.
IV. AGRICULTURAL IMPACT
Agricultural Impact
4.01      The major impact of the project was expected to be on total
agricultural production, chiefly through the improved efficiency of



- 97 -
production methods.2/ In retrospect, and based on EMBRATER records
(Annex 1, Tables 8-10), these expectations would appear to have been met.
However, changes in the area under production, both increases and
decreases, led to significant shifts in the national production figures
(Annex 1, Table 11). Based on the eight crops used here as a proxy for the
calculation of the agricultural impact due to the project, we find that
significant yleld increases in rice, cassava and potato were largely offset
by even greater downward trends in the area under production. For two
export commodities, cotton and soybeans, the higher yields further
increased national production well above that attributable to the increased
production area. Similarly, maize ane tomatoes with are increases of 4%
and 0% respectively, show significant overall production increases due to
better production systems.
4.02      The impact of incremental production on markets was negligible,
with the possible exception of soybeans where exports increased
significantly and export controls were imposed sporadically. For the basic
food and feed crops (rice, beans, cassava, maize and potato), domestic
demand continued to outpace supply and imports of rice, beans and maize
were even more frequent during the 1980-1986 period. Processed tomatoes
also found increased domestic demand with limited periodic surplusses
available for export.
4.03      No attempt has been made to calculate the ERR for the project, in
view of recently expressed views of Bank management3/ concerning the
difficulty of precise analysis of benefits in research and extension
projects.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
5.01      One federal agency (EMBRATER) and 25 state/territorial
(EMATER/ASTER) associate companies were responsible for execution of the
project. In addition, EMBRATER was responsible for the overall
coordination, monitoring and supervision of project components on a
national scale. Project accounts, which originated mainly in the
state/territorial companies, were consolidated by EMBRATER's project
coordinating unit (NUPIN) and all claims for disbursement and project
progress reports, etc., were submitted to the Bank by NUPIN/EMBRATER.
A. Federal Level
5.02      Despite significant delays during the first two years of project
implementation, mainly due to political and finencial (counterpart funding)
constraints (para. 3.13), EMBRATER was always dedicated, energetic and

this subject.



- 98 -
consistent in its efforts to ensure that project objectives were achieved.
This required numerous issues of the guidelines to ensure that the other 25
associate companies remained aware of the project's objectives, description
and goals. Despite these efforts, lack of continuity at the state level
reflected negativel; on efforts to execute the project within the original
four-year time period. The reporting of project progress, procurement and
disbursement matters were all handled well by the project coordinating
unit. While continuity of the coordinator position was also difficult to
achieve (five coordinators in seven years), the institutional
administrative capacity was such as to maintain an adequate level of
EMBRATER/Bank coordination. One negative result of these frequent
administrative changes was the failure to always report constraints to
project implementation in the narrative section of the report and to inform
the Bank promptly of such delays (para. 3.18). Given the complexity of
project implementation with 25 implementing agencies, it was expected that
a high degree of coordination would be difficult to achieve over the entire
implementation period. In practice, this proved to be the case, but to a
relatively small degree, given these administrative complexities. In
general, EMBRATER and its project coordinating unit (NUPIN) maintained a
very satisfactory level of communication with the Bank throughout the
seven-ycar implementation period.
B. State Level
5.03      Sporadic, but quite serious, problems arose with about one-third
(8) of the 25 state/territory implementing agencies. Most of these
occurred in the poorer states of the north and northeast, and generally
concerned the flow of counterpart funds to enable these agencies to fully
implement their PROATERS at the projected level. Some of these
difficulties were also political in nature, and the state level support of
the project frequently fluctuated as a result of these political changes.
Over time, however, it must be said that performance evened out
considerably. Generally, it was a lack of clear institutional leadership
and adequate understanding of the project and its objectives that tended to
create these inefficiencies.
VI. BANK PERFORMANCE
6.01      Overall, Bank performance was satisfactory.  One contributing
factor was the high level of project staff continuity. One project officer
dealt with the project from project identification until completion. There
was also consistency in the monitoring of the large, complex and widely
scattered civil works component for which the Bank used the services of
only two consultant architects in two distinct periods: 1978-80 and
1981-86. Supervision missions were also carried out at regular six-month
intervals, and there was considerable Baak input in the mid-term review
(Jan.-June 1982).
6.02      The Bank was also responsive to EMBRATER's requests for
adjustments to the project content and design, e.g., although not included
in the original design, changes were made to include: (a) social extension
workers (home economics, community development, nutrition);



- 99 -
(b) construction of 354 local offices; and conversely (c) reductions in the
consultants and post-graduate training budgets.
6.03      Despite close and consistent supervision: (a) the level of
effectiveness of some project-related extension services in the northeast
did not improve significantly (the PAPP continues to experience
difficulties in this area); and (b) some opportunities for further
institutional strengthening, particularly at the state level, may have been
missed due to the emphasis on technical assistance for civil works. This
emphasis, while essential, tended to exclude the provision of further
technical assistance to such areas as extension methodology and rural
administration.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.01      The size, scope and complexity of the project created start-up
delays which were greater than anticipated. This was the first such
national agricultural extension project in Brazil, and it dealt with a
newly formed corporation (EMBRATER), as were the coordinating agencies or
associate companies (EMATERs/ASTERs) or 25 implementing agencies in all.
This problem was exacerbated by political changes during the 1978-79
period. Such changes invariably brought about significant upper-level
staff changes and the early project delays were partly due to the executing
agencies' lack of administrative experience with such a large enterprise.
The original four years designated for project implementation was also
optimistic, but, had the initial start-up delays been avoided, it would
still have been a fair estimate of the time required, i.e., five years at
mtost.
7.02      In retrospect, and despite these delays, the project was
successful and largely achieved the physical and numerical goals initially
set at appraisal. Many of the targets were adjusted upwards in light of
the longer implementation period (Annex 1, Table 4). More intangible, but
nevertheless important, has been the development of relatively strong
federal and state agencies. Here,infrastructure, staff training,
improvements in extension methodology and facilities to assist in the
transfer of new technology to the farmer, have all had a marked, positive
impact on the national extension system (SIBRATER) as a whole.  As part of
the project preparation exercise for the second phase project (Agricultural
Extension II - Loan 2679-BR approved in FY86), five regional meetings  t..re
held with representation from all che associate companies (EMATERs/
ASTERs). At these meetings, extension staff were also asked to evaluate
the positive and negative aspects of the first project and their views are
summarized below:
7.03      Positive aspects of the project were: (a) improved
infrastructure; (b) better staff training, especially pre-service courses;
(c) improved communications methods and equipment, specifically
audio-visual aids ant reference library services; (d) increased level of
available technology; (e) opportunity to test new methodology; and
(f) greater stability due to more assured financing over the extended
period of the project (sevca -lears).



- 100 -
7.04      Negative aspects of the project were: (a) lack of consistent
knowledge of project goals at the state level due to frequent
administrative changes; (b) restrictions as imposed by EMBRATER on free use
by the state (EMATERs) of some components, i.e., pre-service and
post-graduate training and the use of consultants; (c) state-level
preferences for infrastructure (bricks and mortar) components as opposed to
institutional improvements when counterpart funding was inadequate; (d) a
few components were only marginally effective and should not be repeated,
i.e., (i) cooperatives; and (it) artisanal fisheries; (e) project
coordination/planning meetings between EMBRATER and state EMATERs were too
infrequent; (f) little or no priority given to research/extension linkages;
and (g) social extension (para. 2.02) was only included in the last three
years of the project, following the specific request of EMBRATER.
7.05      Lessons learned are basically those derived from the two
previous paragraphs, i.e.:
(a)  EMATERs should be kept fully aware of project components and
ample opportunities provided for their participation in all of
them;
(b)  the communications system of EMBRATER/EMATER for project-related
matters should be further improved;
(c)  closer collaboration between research and extension services
through short courses for technical matters is essential and
specific funding should be provided as needed;
(f) more attention should be paid to the administrative and staff
development aspects of institution building, i.e., in comparison
to investments in buildings.
7.06      In large measure, these concerns were addressed during
preparation and appraisal of the second (follow-on) project.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Since the late 1800s, the Northeast has been viewed as Brazil's
foremost "problem area." The country's wealthiest region during the sugar
boom of the colonial period, the Northeast subsequently lagged behind as
industrial, agricultural and commercial activity shifted to the South. The
severe droughts periodically affecting the region (which have been
registered as far back as the sixteenth century), combined with pe-snstent
widespread poverty have been responsible for the creation of numerous
government programs.  Until the 1950s most federal interventions were
limited to drought relief works, short-term drought emergency programs and
crop-specific policies aimed at supporting export crops grown on large
farms. A severe drought in 1970 and its devastating impact on the rural
population demonstrated that little had changed despite past development
activities, and a major reformulation of regional development policy was
undertaken. In 1973, the Bank and the Government initiated a dialogue on
rural development issues and strategies for the Northeast. In October
1974, the Program for Development of Integrated Areas of the Northeast
(POLONORDESTE) was created. It sought to increase the production,
productivity, incomes, and standards of living of small farmers and their
families in selected micro-regions. The Bank, over the next decade,
cofinanced ten POLONORDESTE projects in eight Northeast states.
1.02      The POLONORDESTE projects represenlt the first generation of rural
development projects in Northeast Brazil. Reviews of POLONORDESTE and
other Northeast rural programs were carried out 1-v the Government and the
Bank during the 1980s. Drawing on these interim assessments, a second
generation of projects began in April 14Q5 with the signing of the first
two loans for the new Northeast Rural Development Program (NRDP) in the
states of Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe. Subsequently, additional loans
to the states of Bahia, Ceara, Piaui and Pernambuco states were approved
and loans for the remaining States are expected to be approved shortly. In
October 1986, a regional land tenure improvement project was signed aimed
at providing secure land tenure to a large number of small farmers and
improve the Government's ability to administer land resources and formulate
land sector policies.
1.03      The Bahia Rural Development Project - Paraguacu (Loan 1589-BR)
was the fourth Bank-assisted integrated rural development project in the
POLONORDESTE series. Basic completion information is given in Annex 1,
Table 1.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION
Identification, Preparation and Appraisal
2.01      The Paraguacu project originated in 1973/74 when the State and
SUDENE (Superintendency for the Development of the Northeast), with the
assistance of consultants, prepared a general plan for improved utilization
of the region's water resources. This study, together with the seriousness
of the economic conditions in the area and the creation of the POLONORDESTE
program in late 1974, encouraged the state to proceed with the preparation
of a special program of investments to help increase productivity in the



- 116 -
region's  agricultural sector.  The state contacted the Bank office ia
Recife in 1975, requesting Bank collaboration in project preparation and
financing. Several Bank preparation missions followed. The ilitial state
proposals focussed on a few irrigation schemes, livestock and fruit
plantation programs and a small program for small-scale producers in
isolated areas all or partly in the Paraguacu Basin. With further study,
and state interest in broadening project impact and in sharpening its focus
on small-scale farmers, as well as Bank assistance in preparation, the
project area became the core of 49 municipalities of the Paraguacu Basin
covering an area of 60,764 km2. Original state proposals for project
interventions in cooperative societies, mechanization, marketing and
storage services were later tailored to small farmer targets and farmer
traditions, and included the construction and staffing of some schools and
health mini-posts, some road work, and improvements to agricultural
services and cooperative societies begun with POLONORDESTE funding in late
1976.
2.02      A relatively high level of Bank staff input was necessary in the
preparation and appraisal stages. This can be partially attributed to the
multi-sectoral nature of the project and the need for a variety of
specialists. The first identification/preparation mission was carried out
in January 1976 and appraisal in October 1977. The proposed project was
scaled down substantially during appraisal. Nonetheless, during the
appraisal review process several observations were made concerning the
over-optimistic targets of each component and especially the anticipated
yield increases and uptake of agricultural practices in the agricultural
extension component. In addition, it was expected that the credit aspects
of the project would draw criticism from the Board as they amounted to
34.9% of project base costs and carried heavily subsidized interest rates.
During the Loan Committee's review of the project, similar reservations
were registered.
Board Approval
2.03      As expected, the Board strongly criticized the highly negative
interest rates prevailing in the credit system for agriculture. Interest
rates for rural credit continued to be negative (to a greater or lesser
degree) throughout the life of the project.
Objectives and Description
2.04      The project aimed to (a) increase productivity and incomes; (b)
broaden economic opportunities; (c) improve the standard of living of
17,000 small farmers in 49 municipalities; (d) raise the contribution of
the Paraguacu Basin agricultural sector to meeting local and state food
demands; and (e) develop further the technical and administrative capacity
of institutions involved in agriculture and rural development in Bahia
(specifically in the Paraguacu Basin). The project, which was to be
imp-lemented over a period of five years, consisted of fifteen components
and sub-components to be implemented by fifteen federal, state and private
agencies. These included agricultural extension and research, land titling
services, assistance to cooperatives, irrigation, mechanization and input
supply, multipurpose dams, storage, rural credit, feeder roads, health,
water supply, education and project administration.

2.05      In 1982, after an implementation period of about four years the
State Government carried out an evaluation of project performance and
impact and in 1983 requested a two-year extension with some modifications
to the project. The changes introduced, at that time and in subsequent
amendments, included the following:
(a) a reduction from 15,000 to 7,500 land titles for small-scale
farmers, discrimination of about 100,000 ha and acquisition and
distribution of about 44,000 ha to 1,900 small-scale farmers;
(b) the cancellation of funds for the construction of twelve
multi-purpose dams, and the construction and equipment of six
storage units of about 700 tons each and 150 community storage
sheds of about 20-200 tons each;
(c) the construction of about five small-scale irrigation schemes;
(d) an increase of water supply systems from 70 to 100 villages;
(e) the introduction of a non-formal primary education program for
about 1,700 youths and adults, including the training of staff
and provision of equipment and materials;
(f)  a program to provide technical assistance to the POLONORDESTE
administration group within the Superintendency fcr the
Development of the Northeast;
(g) establishment and operation of a special land fund by CAR
(Company for Development and Regional Action) for purposes of
financing land acquisition (the fund itself was financed by
Government sources) and;
(h) the introduction of a small social forestry component in August
1984.
2.06      During appraisal, there were four POLONORDESTE projects in
preparation or implementation in the state. Day-to-day management and
supervision of the projects was shared by the Secretariats of Planning and
Agriculture through Technical Units. However, with a change of the state
governor in 1979, CAR (Development Company for Regional Action), was
established within the Secretariat of Planning and eventually given
responsibility to coordinate all POLONORDESTE and other rural development
projects in the state. Execution of the project continued to be with
federal and state agencies and subject to regional and federal norms and
procedures for POLONORDESTE.
Project Costs and Financing
2.07      Initially, the Bank was expected to finance 36% (net of taxes) of
project costs. In 1983, the project was included in the Special Action
Program (SAP) for agricultural projects in Brazil. Under the SAP, the
disbursement percentage for the project was increased to about 672 of
project costs. At the close of the project, project costs amounted to
US$70.52 million, or about 662 of total costs estimated at appraisal.
Overall Bank financing amounted to 37.4% of total costs.

III. IMPLEMENTATION
3.01      The project was approved in July 1978, and became effective in
December 1978. After a five-year implementation period, the project was
extended for a two-year period and closed on August 15, 1986, about eight
years after B.)ad Approval. Estimated targets and actual accomplishments
by component are given in Annex 1, Table 1.
Issues
3.02      There were three main issues which affected the implementation of
all project components. These included: shortage and late arrival of
coanterpart funds, shortage of rural credit and poor achievement of land
titling services. In order to avoid repetition of the above issues
throughout this chapter, a summary of their influence on project
implementation is given below.
(a)  Counterpart Funding.  From the start, and throughout project
implementation, the project suffered occasional budget cuts by
the federal government, and late arrival of funds.  This not only
disrupted the work of agricultural extension and research (where
investments are seasonal and therefore funds are required on
time), but also disrupted the implementation of other project
activities which relied on a planned schedule for the use of
equipment, materials and staff.  In addition, the late arrival of
counterpart funds often resulted in the late payment of salaries
(often two to four months late), which did not improve morale
among field staff.  This was one of the main factors which
triggered a general paralys's of the extension service during the
seventh and eighth years of project implementation.
(b)  Agricultural Credit.  A shortage of agricultural credit to small
farmers, especially during the last four years of project
implementation, caused a certain amount of frustration among the
extension agents and farmers. Farmers who had delayed planting,
pending receipt of credit funds, then had to go ahead with
traditional means of land preparation and inputs, lost confidence
in the extension service and the project. There was little the
farmer could do to increase crop production or productivity on
their small holdings without credit. Moreover, the prolonged
drought (from 1979-1983) and later shortage of agricultural
credit dampened much of the enthusiasm of extension agents who
witnessed the gradual decline of agricultural yields in their
project area. After 1983, little progress was achieved in
project implementation (para. 5.01).
(c)  Land Titling Services.  A high priority was placed on land
titling since 60Z of project beneficiaries were not legal
holders, including 25Z who were landless. The failure to acquire
sufficient land for distribution, the continued annexation of
small farmers' land by large landown-ers, and the slow pace in the



- 119 -
issuing of titles had a detrimental effect on the remaining
components and reduced the impact of the project.
ProJect Components
3.03      Agricultural Extension.  The extension service succeeded in
reorienting its strategy by working with small farmer groups, rather than
the principally credit-supervision approach exercised prior to the project,
aimed predominantly at individual medium and large farmers. During the
first five years of project implementation extensionists periodically
provided technical advice to small groups of farmers organized around
contact farmers and demonstration plots. Through visits and
demonstrations, extensionists promoted improved cultural practices and use
of inputs. Extensionists also assisted farmers in preparing and processing
credit proposals and helped banks supervise execution of financed farm
development. Social extensionists were involved in the promotion of home
economics, health, and nutrition education through women and youth groups.
3.04      In 1981, a farm survey was carried out by the state to evaluate
progress in project execution and to justify :n extension of the Loan
Closing Date. The survey showed that some 20,000 farmers (3,000 more than
targeted at appraisal) had been assisted. Until 1983, about 472 of farmers
had received credit. After 1983, the number of farmers receiving credit
dropped dramatically to 14% and farmers assisted, dropped to 22% of the
targeted farmers in 1985. In 1986 no credit was available, and the
extension service was inoperative for the better part of 1985 and 1986
(para. 3.02(a)).
3.05      Overall, the agricultural extension service succeeded in
introducing imrroved cultural practices with varied success. The most
widely adopted cultural practices were innovations that required the least
cost, such as spacing, weeding techniques and ploughing. The application
of fertilizer was used principally by farmers who irrigated and tobacco
farmers who received credit independently from the banking system.
3.06      The effects of the above innovations on production were difficult
to assess since the prolonged drought and shortage of credit affected
yields especially for rainfed crops. The trends in yields were difficult
to determine since the yields varied from year to year depending on the
availabiliLy of water and rainfall, which again varied considerably within
the project area. In addition, neither the Extension Service nor the
Project Coordination Unit monitored agricultural yields throughout the
project period. However, it is generally assumed that average yields
decreased for almost every crop compared to those registered in 1977, at
the time of appraisal. Nonetheless, within these constraints, farmers
assisted by the project generally fared better than those without the
project, and those farmers receiving credit and with legal title to their
land, had higher yields than those farmers who were not assisted or who did
not receive credit. In summary, the agricultural extension service up to
1983 performed reasonably well; however, its agricultural impact would have
improved if regional adviso7y staff could have better responded to
agricultural problems faced in the field and if extensionists had been
provided with better technical direction by management. In this respect,



- 120 -
training of agricultural extensionists was not geared to serve farmers'
needs adequately.
3.07      In general, the social extension program achieved poor results.
This was due to the inadequate training of social extensionists, a large
turnover of staff and a lack of a clear policy for implementation. The
work was carried out in a piece-meal fashion with little or no coordination
with health staff. Social extensionists spent most of their time paying
house calls (when transport was available) to discuss with women social
problems, child care, nutrition and matters related to general health and
hygiene. These activities suffered from a lack of concrete action when
further discussion became useless and the time for implementation became
necessary. No funds were available to social extensionists for
demonstration or community-level projects.
3.08      Agricultural Research and Seed Production.  Unfortunately,
research activities were mainly confined to research stations since EPABA
(Bahian Agricultural Research Company) was delinquent in providing the
Project Coordination Unit and the Agricultural Extension Service with a
listing of useable results. This was a classic example of poor
coordination between the execution agencies. However, some useful results
were obtained in research stations and field trials such as: (a) testing of
crop varieties of beans, tobacco and maize, in drought conditions,
intercropping of castor with cowpeas and beans with maize; and (b) in
irrigated areas, testing of rice, groundnuts, beans, soya, maize and
horticulture crops such as garlic, onions, carrots, tomatoes, cabbage and
pepper. In addition, EPARA successfully tested and introduced sorghum for
human consumption and hay for animal feed. It also tested new cultural
practices, such as spacing and double row planting for manioc, which
permitted intercropping with beans. These practices were widely adopted in
the region. Although some of the above technical packages were developed
in the state's research centers only a few were disseminated in the project
area. With reference to seed production, EPABA failed to produce any seed
for distribution to farmers.
3.09      Agricultural Credit.  Credit was one of the most problematic
components after 1983. As long as funds were available, about 47% took
credit during the first five years of implementation and only 14% during
the remaining three years. The ever-increasing subsidy implicit in the
differential between interest rates and inflation rates resulted in the
rationing of credit by the Central Bank. The lowest in the priority list
to receive credit were the poorer farmers. The number of farmers receiving
credit stabilized at about 8,600 farmers in 1980 and 1981, then went down
to 6,800 in 1982 and from 1983-86 went further down to an annual average of
2,430 farmers.
3.10      The results of the 1981 farm survey showed that of those farmers
who received credit, 74% obtained it for the first time under the project.
The items most frequently financed were (a) hired labor; (b) seeds and
planting stock; and (c) family consumption. Within investment credit, the
Items most frequently financed were equipment and tools and construction
improvements. The average investment c-edit loan was US$1,027. This
amount was 88% above the average (US$546) for investment credit estimated



-121 -
at appraisal. However, at appraisal it was estimated that 100% of working
capital recipients would also take investment credit. In actual practice
only about 25% did so, the reason being that about 63% of the farmers
assisted were non-owners. Therefore, the majority could not qualify for
credit, and of those, 23% were sharecroppers. The average working capital
loan was US$725, 29% higher than appraisal estimates.
3.11      The relative abundance of highly subsidized credit until 1983 and
the scarcity of credit thereafter clearly distorted farm investment and
influenced farmers' willingness to adopt technical innovations. Throughout
the project period there was a lack of systematic monitoring which resulted
in poor, untimely allocation of funds within the banking network. Also,
given the highly subsidized rates for small farmers and high administrative
costs for each loan, local bank managers were reluctant to increase small
farmer lending.
3.12      Mechanization and Input Supply.  CAMAB (Bahia Fertilizers and
Agricultural Equipment .ompany) achieved the poorest results in the
project. CAMAB was required to open and maintain some 20 input supply
stores in the project area, and to offer mechanized services to farmers for
land clearing, land levelling, drainage works and construction of watering
points for livestock. The network of 20 input supply stores was gradually
reduced to two. The majority of the stores were never adequately supplied
and poorly administered. After 1983, no funds were allocated in the annual
operating plans for CAMAB operations. With reference to mechanized
services to farmers, 130 farmers were assisted out of 2,595 targeted for
1978, and in 1979 only 29 farmers were assisted. In addition to poor
management, CAMAB's agricultural equipment was mostly idle due to lack of
spare parts and shortage of funds for operation and maintenance. In
retrospect this component should have been cancelled in 1983 during the
project review and not a.xtended for an additional two years.
3.13      Irrigation (Technical Assistance) and Multipurpose Dams.  Through
a combination of factors this component produced poor results. TMe
component was designed to provide technical support for irrigation
activities, but not to finance off-farm or communal irrigation works and
equipment, which would be financed through the investment credit
component. However, when the project was amended in 1983, the Bank agreed
to finance five small irrigation schemes. Firstly, in attempting to
structure these small irrigation schemes, the project faced difficult
political and administrative issues in relation to expropriation and
redivision of land holdings so that benefits could be equitably
distributed. Secondly, the State Engineering Company (CERB), had little
experience in implementing irrigation, and although some feasibility
studies were undertaken, none of the irrigation schemes were constructed.
3.14      With reference to multi-purpose dams for human consumption and
small irrigation, none were constructed. The dams, which were intended to
be of simple design and built with local materials, were overdesigned and
much larger than foreseen at appraisal. Construction prices escalated
rapidly, and this activity was finally dropped from the project prior to
construction.



- 122 -
3.15      Rural Water Supp 1.  The main problem in the execution of this
component was the total la   of community participation by beneficiaries in
the construction phase and ia the operation and maintenance of the water
systems. Some 115 rural water supply systems were constructed by CERB la
two-thirds of the project municipalities. However, the component failed to
establish water users associations or collect charges from their users.
Training of system operators was carried out by CERB, a number of whom were
paid by the municipality. Currently, the municipalities are covering the
costs of operation and maintenance when funds are available. When funds
are not available, the water systems remain inoperative.
3.16      Land Titling Services and Land Acquisition. With the exception
of the land  tilng services, the achievements of the land institute were
very disappointing. Although targets had been reduced during the project
review only 2,200 ha of land were acquired and distributed to 78 farmers.
In addition the land institute achieved its land titling target only
because it had been reduced to 50% of the original appraisal target. The
absence of trained staff, modern equipment, political will and the
irreconcilable differences between CAR and the land institute delayed
project execution. From 1983 onwards the pace picked up with the
introduction of the aerophotogrammetric system, though the new techniques
adopted were mainly carried out by outside consultants. Given the
importance of land regularization and titling and the need to improve land
acquisition and distribution to small and landless farmers, the Bank has
financed a regional land project which became effective in March 1986.
3.17      Assistance to Cooperatives.  As a result of project activities,
the cooperatives became more active and membership increased by some 40%.
Seven of the eight cooperatives started to market farmer produce, such as
beans, maize and manioc flour. The two main activities of the cooperatives
in the region were retailing of agricultural inputs and small marketing
operations of farmers' produce. The main constraints to their activities
were the non-availability of working capital and good management. When
both were available, excellent services were provided to farmers, as was
the case with Ipira and Castro de Alves Cooperatives.  However, aot all
coopera:ives performed equally well: for instance, the Riachao do Jacuipe
went bankrupt and the one in Feira de Santana was reluctant to work with
small farmers. Nonetheless, the Department of Cooperatives did a good job
in providing training to cooperative managers in management and accounting
techniques, cooperative philosophy and in the type of services which
cooperatives could provide to its members. During an eight-year period the
cooperatives marketed some 11,300 tons of agricultural products for 6,400
of its members.
3.18      Marketing and Storage.  Although the Bank did not finance any
direct marketing activities, almost all project components had some impact
on the marketing system. For instance, the strengthening of cooperatives,
construction of roads and warehouses and price information to farmers, all
helped to improve the farmers' access to markets. However, the government
financeed some marketing activities related to CAP (Advance Production
Purchasing Program) and CEP (Surplus Purchasing Program). Both programs
achieved only limited success since they both suffered from a lack of
working capital.



- 123 -
3.19      With reference to storage, although the initial construction
program of six warehouses was completed on time, it was evident that these
warehouses proved to be unsuitable to small farmers and uneconomical to the
State Warehouse Company operating them. During the project review, an
additional 150 smaller community warebouses were planned, though only 25
were constructed. If there is one lesson which the Bank has learned
regarding storage activities in the Northeast, it is that storage programs
cannot be based only on absolute storage needs, that is, on volume of
production versus storage space available. Other issues, such as proximity
of the warehouse to farmers, administrative and managerial competence of
the operating agency and viability of warehouse services for small farmers,
should all be taken into account when planning crop storage programs. In
the case of Paraguacu, these issues were not sufficiently considered.
Currently, some of the warehouses are used as schools and community
centers, others are used for crop and input storage, while others remain
empty.
3.20      Education.  This component achieved most of its physical
targets. Some 12,000 children had, for the first time, access to primary
education. In addition, the project successfully introduced a system of
education and training supervisors to give guidance and support to
teachers. A new curriculum and teaching materials were developed for
grades 1-4 and some 88 % of teachers confirmed that the new teaching
materials greatly facilitated their work.  However, it is difficult to
evaluate the quality of education given in schools since no survey was
carried out among school leavers or children at school. Nonetheless,
drop-out rates were registered and these are quite high. Out of 1,000
children entering Grade I, 278 progres;ed to Grade II, and only 3 reached
grade VIII, compared to 182 who reached Grade VIII in urban areas. Another
factor which may reflect the quality of education is the education level of
the teachers. The majority had not finished primary school and some not
even Grade IV. It is difficult to determine whether teachers' salaries
were a reflection of their education level or a deliberate policy to
recruit a maximum number of teachers within the limit of financial
resources available. Whatever the reason, it is quite evident that
teachers were poorly paid compared to the official minimum salary scale
fixed by the Government. It is doubtful whether more qualified teachers
could be recruited at the average wage of US$10.00-17.00 per month. The
Bank is currently focussing attention on these issues, and a regional
education project addressing these problems is under preparation.
3.21      Health.  Whereas most construction and training targets were
achieved, there was little community support generated for the operation of
health posts. Most health post attendants were nominated by local
politicians rather than selected by the community and found it difficult to
work and obtain community cooperation for improvements in health and
hygiene practices. In addition without transport facilities and per diems,
health visitors found it difficult to carry out their outreach program.
The health posts were not functioning at full capacity either because they
were badly located or because they lacked vital supplies such as vaccines
or medicines. The identification of these issues eventually led to their
being addressed in a more comprehensive fashion in the recently approved
Northeast Basic Health Services Project (Loan 2699-BR).



- 124 -
3.22      Feeder Roads.  This component, which consisted of the design and
construction of 1,140 km of feeder roads to facilitate access to markets
and transport of goods, achieved some 73% of project targets. Major
problems included drastic cuts in budgetary allocations from 1983 onwards
and political interference in the selection process of municipalities which
were responsible for road improvement and maintenance. Unfortunately
little maintenance was carried out due to shortage of funds.  On the
positive side, some of the roads which were maintained or repaired by the
Inter-Municipal Road Consortium of Bahia, did noticeably improve access
throughout the project area.
3.23      Social Forestry.  This component introduced in August 1984, was
not implemented due to a shortage of funds.
Disbursements
3.24      The total amount disbursed amounted to US$26.37 million, or 71%
of the loan amount (Annex 1, Table 4). Although most physical targets have
been achieved, unit costs on many items were lower in US dollar terms than
those estimated at appraisal because of the constant devaluation of the
cruzeiro and some real cost savings. Also, Bank and Government
expectations concerning execution capabilities for some components were
overly optimistic. After 1983, disbursements improved with the
establishment of the Special Account and a Central Bank advance system to
pre-finance the Bank's share of project costs, improvements in funding
channels, and an increase in the disbursement rate to about 67%.
Procurement
3.25      There were no procurement problems.  International competitive
bidding was not used because investments were generally too small, too
diverse, and too dispersed. Nearly all goods and services were procured in
accordance with local competitive bidding procedures, reviewed and found
generally acceptable to Bank staff. Civil works were carried out through a
combination of self-help and force account.
Reports and Auditing
3.26      Reporting.  This was generally carried out quarterly, though at
times on a six monthly basis. The reports were generally too long and
contained mostly physical and financial data and little information on
quality of services or inputs delivered to farmers (para. 5.06 below).
3.27      Accounts and Auditing.  Separate project accounts were maintained
by each executing agency. the audits were performed by the Secretaria de
Controle Interno (SECIN), the Federal Government's internal auditors.
Although audit reports were generally found to be satisfactory, the Bank
sought to improve auditing procedures.  In this respect, a Bank review of
Brazilian auditing procedures has taken place, and the Government and the
Bank have discussed ways of improving the quality, independence, and
timeliness of the audits.



-125-
Adherence to Covenants
3.28      In general, adherence to the Loan and Project Agreements was
satisfactory, with the exception of the following major areas related to
(a) provision of counterpart funds; (b) availability, lending policies and
procedures for rural credit; (c) the establishment of water users
associations; (d) allocation of sufficient funds to municipalities for road
maintenance and; (e) payment of salaries to teachers appropriate to the
teacher salary scale of the state. In addition to these major areas of
non-compliance, a number of specific covenants lost their initial relevance
due to changed circumstances during project implementation.
IV. ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL IMPACT
On-Farm Benefits
4.01      The lack of an efficient monitoring and evaluation system
throughout the project period, has made it difficult to estimate farmers'
benefits. However, it is well known that the prolonged drought from 1979
to 1983 resulted in sharp area and production declines for all crops. The
only yield estimates available are those based on a farm survey carried out
in 1981 and therefore, the conclusions regarding project impact are drawn
from that survey.
4.02      The weighted average income from on-farm agricultural activities
at full development of rainfed farmers who received project services was
about US$719 per annum, about half the income estimated at appraisal.
However, the overall weighted average income including off-farmer income,
was about US$1,300 per annum, almost equivalent to the appraisal estimate.
Income from on-farm agricultural activities for farmers without project
services was only US$144 per annum. Total income for farmers without
project services was estimated at US$720 per annum, 71% of which was
off-farm earnings. The proportion of farmer's income obtained from
off-farm sources decreased rapidly to 19% for farmers who received credit
and technical assistance, dropping still further to 4% for those who
received title.
Rate of Return
4.03      The overall rate of return for the project has been estimated at
about 11% over a 15-year period, which is lsGer than the original appraisal
estimate of about 15% (Annex 1, Table 5). However, this rate is only
indicative since benefits were derived from eata obtained during the farm
survey carried out in 1981. Incremental benefits were estimated for all
farmers assisted by the project on the assumption that they reached average
levels of incremental production as shown in the farm survey. Their
benefits remain at those levels throughout the project period, since credit
availability was severely reduced by government during the last three years
of project implementation, and the situation remains uncertain. Actual
project costs were included for years 1-8, except for those costs related
to social components (19% of total costs) for which benefits cannot be
readily estimated. It was also assumed that costs for extension, research
and administration would gradually decline over seven years until they
reach 10% of year 8 costs.



- 126-
Other Benefits
4.04      A number of project benefits are not reflected in the economic
rate of return analysis. Road transport, basic health and education
facilities, and safe drinking water became much more accessible in the
project areas, either because they were directly financed by the projects
or because the projects attracted complementary investments. In addition,
the project was responsible for the development of an institutional
framework which should result in the increased efficiency of future rural
development efforts.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
General
5.01      Overall institutional performance was mixed.  Numerous federal,
regional and state agencies were involved in the planning, execution,
coordination and supervision of the project. The second year of
implementation coincided with a change in the administration of the state
Governor and this led to a large-scale replacement of state employees,
including the project manager and many who worked in the various
implementing agencies. Again, in 1985/86 during the seventh and eighth
years of implementation, a political crisis developed and the extension
service was inoperative for more than one year, which resulted in project
management being replaced. These abrupt changes combined with a shortage
of agricultural credit and late arrival of counterpart funds contributed to
the poor performance in project implementation after 1983. Project
coordination and cooperation between the various implementing agencies was
never smooth and at times led to periodic paralysis in project
implementation. In addition, competition and duplication among the various
levels of government and among agencies at each level and the rapid
expansion and large turn-over of staff hampered efficiency and continuity
in project implementation.
Federal Level
5.02      The project was subject to a number of different coordinating
arrangements at the federal level. Responsibility for major program
decisions remained diffuse, involving a number of different ministries.
The lack of clear institutional leadership at the federal level was at
least partially responsible for the persistence of several major project
problems, including those related to credit, land acquisition and
counterpart funding.
Regional Level
5.03      The POLONORDESTE unit within SUDENE provided regional
coordination and supervision for the entire POLONORDESTE program, including
the Paraguacu project.  Although the unit managed to perform necessary
i          administrative tasks, such as budget consolidation, which allowed program
implementation to proceed, it was never able to fulfill its technical
assistance and quality control roles.  SUDENE's overall institutional
difficulties, coupled with .the unit's lack of status within SUDENE, created
permanent shortages in financial and human resources. In particular, the
shortage of trained, motivated personnel was acute. As a result, the
POLONORDESTE unit at times was perceived by both federal and state agencies
as little more than an additional layer of bureaucracy.



- 127 -
State Level
5.04      Project Organization and Administration.  The most glaring
deficiencies in project organization and administration were: (a) the
heavily centralized structure of the project; and (b) independent nature of
line agencies wbich made coordination extremely difficult. However, within
these constraints the project's unit performed satisfactorily.
(a) A centralized structure. It is difficult to see how the project
unit could have improved the organization and administration of
the project, as long as it was politically impossible to
decentralize either the decision making process or transfer some
other responsibilities to its regional offices in the project
area. This was especially important given that there were 18
different components covering an area of more than 60,000 km2.
The heavily centralized nature of the project often caused delays
in project implementation since regional managers could not make
any decisions without first obtaining approval from management in
Salvador.
(b) Lack of authority. At the same time the independent nature of
line agencies meant that some of them were not obliged to
cooperate with the project unit especially when their interests
did not coincide with the project's philosophy or program of
activities. This often undermined the unit's authority
particularly in the field, and in turn did not particularly
enhance the efforts of regional managers to coordinate project
activities in their areas.
5.05      Among line agencies, performance was mixed.  For some activities,
such as land services, water supply, irrigation, storage, multi-purpose
dams, mechanization, agricultural research and input-supply, the executing
agencies performed poorly. For others, such as health, education,
agricultural extension, assistance to cooperatives and roads, the project
succeeded in improving institutional capacity. However, the absence of
beneficiary participation in project planning and implementation resulted
in poor performance where beneficiary cooperation was required for
operation and maintenance of public works.
5.06      Monitoring and Evaluation.  he lack of a consistent, well
designed monitoring and an on-going evaluation system seriously affected
the performance of project implementation and unfortunately, has meant that
not enough is known about the impact of project activities on the target
population. Monitoring activities were mainly oriented toward financial
and physical progress rather than towards measurement of benefits or of
services delivered to farmers. Moreover, monitoring was seen as a data
collecting system for reporting rather than as a management tool for
planning and correcting implementation problems. Occasional visits to the
field by staff from the project coordinating unit to investigate issues and
problems merely aggravated the situation since field staff from other line
agencies considered them as intruders who did not understand their problems
and who merely came to visit them for a change from their urban
environment. Evaluation was conceptualized in an overly sophisticated



- 128 -
academic way by carrying out one detailed farm survey during the project
period; this was of little use either to management or field staff, since
many of Lhc problems identified were ignored or had changed several times
during the first four years of implementation.
5.07      Uader the Northeast Rural Development Program, efforts are being
made by SUDtNE and the Bank to improve monitoring and evaluation systems
throughont the Northeast by providing regional training courses and
technical assistance to states.
I                          VI.  BANK PERFORMANCE
6.01      Bank performance was mixed. Its main flaw was that it
oveiestimated the institutional capacity of several state agencies and
their implementation capabilities. The most notorious were the State
Engineering Company which had no expertise in irrigation, the Land
Institute, and the State Fertilizer and Agricultural Equipment Company
which accomplished little during the life of the project. The Bank also
overoptimistically assumed that participation by project beneficiaries
would be so easily forthcoming, when social extensionists and other field
staff were insufficiently trained to do the job. Hence, the assumption
that water users' associations would be established by social extensionists
proved to be totally erroneous. In 1983, prior to the extension of the
project, and after the state had carried out an evaluation of the proje-t,
the Bank could have introduced substantial changes. At that time it could
have eliminated some components and reduced targets of others because the
mid-term review had revealed the weaknesses in project implemeatation.
However, the Bank did introduce some changes to project design, but this
was insufficient (para. 2.05). Indeed, the extension of -he project
resulted in increasing the number of project components from 15-18 instead
of reducing them.
6.02      Many of the project's supervision problems were caused by the
excessive number of components. However, many of the problems would have
prevailed even with fewer components. For instance, in those cases in the
Northeast where the Bank tried to limit components (most notably in Rio
Grande do Norte), the Brazilians financed excluded components (e.g.,
education and roads) with their own resources because they firmly believed
that the various interventions were essential to resolve development
problems in the microregions concerned. Wkere the Bank's responsibility
lies is in the insufficient allocation of supervision time. The number of
manweeks per project allocated to supervision was subdivided among many
components. This resulted in less time being devoted to each component and
therefore supervision became less effective and, in some instances, a
contributing factor to the implementation problems. Therefore, the answer
is not only to reduce the number of components, but also to provide
adequate time for supervision.
6.03      During the last three years of the project, time allocated to
supervision decreased since the Bank devoted much of its time to the
preparation and appraisal of Northeast projects. For example, supervision
of the Paraguacu project varied from 20-40 staff days per mission up to
1983, and from 1983-86 supervision was reduced from 7-13 staff days per



- 129 -
mission. All this meant that the Bank focussed less attention on concrete
technical issues and ways of improving delivery systems. Nonetheless, on
the positive side, Bank missions have done a good job in identifying and
analyzing some major implementation problems, and although many of these
could not be resolved, they helped to focus on some priority issues which
formed the basis for the preparation of the Northeast Program.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      The POLONORDESTE projects including the Paraguacu project were
the first of a series of projects which were based on an integrated
development approach for specific target groups of small farmers in the
Northeast. Given the paucity of educational, health and agricultural
services for small farmers and the lack of infrastructure in rural areas,
these projects attempted, for the first time, to provide development
packages which included a wide range of infrastructural and technical
services to a target population which had, for the most part, been
neglected except for the occasional drought relief emergency program and
small resettlement scheme.
7.02      Unfortunately, although the Paraguacu project was far too
ambitious both in design and scope, other important issues were not given
sufficient attention such as: (a) whether there existed a substantial
political commitment to the development of small farming families in the
Paraguacu area; (b) an over-optimistic view that state agencies had the
institutional and technical capacity to implement all project activities;
(c) an assumption that farmer participation would be easily forthcoming
since project inputs and services were supposed to satisfy farmers' needs;
and (d) an over-optimistic view of the willingness of state agencies to
cooperate with each other and with project management in the implementation
of project activities.
7.03      The issues mentioned above are reflected in one way or another in
the non-performance or poor performance of several Federal and State
agencies, such as: the shortage and late arrival of counterpart funds; the
shortage of rural credit after 1983; and the poor performance of the State
Land Institute, the Agricultural Research Company, the State Mechanization
and Input Supply Company and State Engineering Company.
7.04      However, the Paraguacu project did generate social and economic
benefits for its target population. Some of these benefits are difficult
to define, either because they are unquantifiable, or because the project
lacked an efficient monitoring and evaluation system and therefore did not
register them. ikonetheless, the project succeeded in increasing education
and health services were none existed prior to the project, and despite a
lower than expected rate of return, farmers assisted increased their
incomes substantially.  In addition, the experiences of the Paraguacu and
other POLONORDESTE projects helped the Government to focus increased
attention on small farmer development in the Northeast by approving in
April 1985 a new multi-billion dollar 15-year development program which
emphasizes investment in agriculture and places priority on increasing
small farmer production, productivity and access to land. In this respect,
it may also be said that as a result of a change in the political climate
in the country, Federal and State agencies have come to realize that small



- 13n -
farmer development is no longer a fad, as it may have been in the
mid-seventies, but a major issue in the development of the Northeast which
cannot be ignored. This has required a change in institutional policies
and strategies to better respond to increased pressures from small farmers
and their leaders, who are no longer satisfied to remain mere spectators
while others make decisions for them, but will want to participate fully in
matters that concern their livelihood and welfare.
7.05      A number of lessons can be drawn from the Paraguacu project.
Many of these lessons have been incorporated to the "second generation" of
Northeast Rural Development Program which began in 1985, and are summarized
as follows:
(a) In rural development projects which aim at poverty alleviation,
agricultural investment and increased food crop production, these
should also include concrete measures for dealing with insecure
land tenure, the development of water resources and farmer
participation in the decision making process.
(b)  In projects which rely on the creation of water users
associations, there is a need to provide a step by step
implementation strategy for their gradual establishment and the
necessary resources for institution building at the grassroots
level.
(c) There must be a political commitment to decentralize
organizational, administrative and planning functions to the
regional and micro-regional level, if farmer participation in the
decision making process and execution of project activities is to
become a reality. In this respect, monitoring and evaluation of
project activities should be strengthened and decentralized to
the regional level since it is an essential tool of the planning
and organizational process.
(d) Whereas institutional development is an essential process for
ensuring better delivery of .nputs and services to project
beneficiaries, it should also be recognized that some
institutional constraints would be more efficiently addressed in
a sectoral project (e.g., education and health), where a more
comprehensive and technical approach can be adopted to deal with
fundamental issues.
(e) In rural development project design, there is a need for
increased "built in" flexibility, through the establishment of
indicative targets and explicit recognition of the project as a
"time slice" in a long-term investment program; equally, similar
flexibility could be maintained in the legal documents through
fewer detailed covenants.
(f) Supervision of multi-sectoral projects is complex, since these
projects include several different disciplines and therefore
require different subject matter specialists. In this respect
sufficient supervision time should be provided to focus on common
problems of a regional or national scope, as well as those that
are project specific.
