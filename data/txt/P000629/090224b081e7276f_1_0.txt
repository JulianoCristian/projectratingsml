ARTICLE III
Other Covenants
Section 3.01. (a) It is the policy of the Bank, in making
loans to, or with the guarantee of, its members not to seek, in
normal circumstances, special security from the member concerned
but to ensure that no other external debt shall have priority over
its loans in the allocation, realization or distribution of foreign
exchange held under the control or for the benefit of such member.
To that end, if any lien shall be created on any public assets (as
hereinafter defined), as security for any external debt, which will
or might result in a priority for the benefit of the creditor of
such external debt in the allocation, realization or distribution
of foreign exchange, such lien shall, unless the Bank shall other-
wise agree, ipso facto and at no cost to the Bank, equally and rat-
ably secure the principal of, and interest and other charges on,
the Loan, and Uganda, in creating or permitting the creation of
such lien, shall make express provision to that effect; provided,
however, that, if for any constitutional or other legal reason
such provision cannot be made with respect to any lien created
on assets of any of its political or administrative subdivisions,
Uganda shall promptly and at no cost to the Bank secure the prin-
cipal of, and interest and other charges on, the Loan by an equi-
valent lien on other public assets satisfactory to the Bank.
(b) The foregoing undertaking shall not apply to: (i) any
lien created on property, at the time of purchase thereof, solely
as security for payment of the purchase price of such property;
(ii) any lien arising in the ordinary course of banking transac-


﻿-5-
tions and securing a debt maturing not more than one year after
its date; and (iii) any charges on the General Fund of the East
African Community (hereinafter called the Community) securing
debt of the Community where the amount of the debt service on such
other debt in any financial year together with other debt service
on other debt of the Community payable from such General Fund in
such financial year does not exceed 2% of the average of customs
duties and excise duties collected by the East African Customs
and Excise Department in the three financial years preceding such
incurrence. For the purposes of this paragraph, "debt service"
shall include payments of the principal of, and interest and other
charges on, debt; and any r erence to incurring of debt shall
include the assumption and guarantee of debt and any renewal, ex-
tension or modification of the terms of the debt or of the assump-
tion or guarantee thereof.
(c) As used in this Section, the term ""public assets" means
assets of Uganda, of any political or administrative subdivision
thereof and of any entity owned or controlled by, or operating
for the account or benefit of, Uganda or any such subdivision,
including gold and other foreign exchange assets held by any
institution performing the functions of a central bank or exchange
stabilization fund, or similar functions, for Uganda: and the term
"external debt" means any debt payable in any medium other than
currency of Uganda whether such debt is or may become payable
absolutely or at the option of the creditor in such other medium,
save that in the case of a debt of the Community, the term external
debt means any debt payable in any medium other than in local
currency.

Section 3.02. Uganda covenants that it will not take, or
cause or permit any of its political subdivisions or any of its
agencies or any agency of any such political subdivisions to take,
any action which would prevent or interfere with the performance
by the Borrower of its obligations contained in the Loan Agreement
and will take all reasonable action necessary or appropriate to
enable the Borrower to perform such obligations.
