CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS
The official unit of currency in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda is
respectively the Kenyan, Tanzanian, and Ugandan Shilling. All
these currencies are officially valued at a fixed rate of
Shs 9.66 to the SDR. The US Dollar/Shilling exchange rate is
therefore subject to change. Conversions in this report were
made at US$1 to Shs 8.o5.
US$1.00   =   Shs 8.o5

SUMKARY
i.        The East African Development Bank (EADB) is one of the institutions
of the East African Community. It was created in 1967 when the Treaty for
East African Co-operation was signed by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. EADB's
objectives include attempting to redress industrial imbalances between Partner
States by investing more of its resources in Tanzania and Uganda and also
attempting to achieve the complementary development of the Partner States in-
dustrial sectors.
ii.       In recent years ideological and political differences have resulted
in tensions between the Partner States as a consequence of which some of the
Community corporations have encountered difficulties particularly with regard
to the transfer of their funds between Partner States to meet corporation
liabilities. The Member Governments have indicated that they clearly differ-
entiate EADB as a community bank from the corporations; at the next Treaty
Review probably the only revision of EADB's Charter will be a relaxation of
the differential investment formula which prescribes that 38.75% of EADB's
operations should be in Tanzania, 38.75% in Uganda and 22.5% in Kenya.
iii.      Although industrial investment in Kenya and Tanzania may have declined
in real terms over the last two years due to balance of payments problems, the
Governments are taking measures to stimulate the level of industrial investment,
and EADB has a sizable project pipeline in both countries. In Uganda, the
Government has recently taken steps to rehabilitate the industrial sector by
the formation of parastatal organizations from the companies acquired in 1973
from non-citizens by Ugandan nationals; regular allocations of foreign exchange
are also going to be made to priority industries. Thus, there is scope for
further industrialization of the Community.
iv.       Although there are financial institutions in all three Partner States,
EADB has played a significant role in financing industrial development both
independently and on joint financings. EADB has the staff and resources to be
able to undertake independent studies of potential investments and, because of
EADB's multinational ownership, its findings have been considered independent
of national bias.  Operating in all three Partner States, EADB has been able
to assess the situation in the industrial sectors of the other Partner States
to assist in designing and sizing of projects. The experience and expertise
of EADB's appraisal staff has been of benefit to the newer national institutions
on joint projects, as has its higher investment capacity per project. EADB's
research staff have also made contributions through their studies for rehabili-
tating parts of the Ugandan industrial sector.
v.        EADB has recovered very rapidly from the disturbances in Uganda in
1973 which caused the disruption of its operations and the decentralization
of its organization. All three regional offices have been fully operational
since early 1974. The staff, which is almost completely African, is highly
competent and has been ably led since inception by its Director General,
Mr. I. Simba. EADB's operating procedures and appraisal methods are good,
particularly with regard to measuring the economic impact of projects. EADB
has taken significant steps to reduce its portfolio affected by arrears of
over three months from the level of 41% as of March 31, 1975; many of these



- ii -
projects having fallen into arrears during the Ugandan disturbance period.
Despite the high level of arrears, EADB remains financially sound and credit-
worthy.
vi.       EADB is forecasting a significant growth in its operations.  As the
Ugandan industrial sector recovers, EADB, as the sole independent source of
foreign exchange for industrial investment in Uganda, will be able to identify
and finance projects to reduce industrial sector imbalances. Through its in-
dustrial knowledge and independent resources, EADB will continue to directly
influence the complementary industrial development of the Partner States; this
role will be enhanced by the agricultural processing projects, that EADE is
currently researching and promoting. Additional foreign exchange resources of
$28.6 million are estimated required to cover the import component of projects
EADB expects to commit by December 31, 1977. A recommended Bank loan of $15
million would fill half of this gap with the balance being sought from other
aid sources. 1/ EADB's free limit for individual subproject should be raised
from $300,000 to $650,000 and the aggregate free limit to $5,000,000. Other
terms and conditions of the loan should be those normally applied to develop-
ment finance companies.
1/   In June 1975, EADB signed an agreement with SIDA for a second loan of
Shs 60 million.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The East African Development Bank (EADB) was established under the
1967 Treaty creating the East African Community. It commenced operation in
July 1968 and entered into its first commitment in 1969. The World Bank's
contacts with EADB date back to its inception and Bank staff have from time
to time and upon request of EADB, giveni advice on its organization and operating
policies. The Bank made a first loan of $8 million to EADB on June 28, 1972.
By early 1975, this loan had been entirely committed. EADB has requested
further assistance from the Bank. This report appraises EADB and recommends
a Bank loan of US$15 million.
1.02      The main objectives of the proposed loan are:
(i)  to provide term financing on appropriate terms to medium- and
large-scale industrial projects in the East African Community,
which have been well-conceived on economic, financial, and
technical grounds; and
(ii)  to enhance EADB's role as a development institution with
Community wide knowledge and perspective, able to assist
the three Partner States in the complementary development
of their industrial sectors.
II. THE EAST AFRICAN COMMUNITY
Background
2.01      The East African Community was created on December 1, 1967 to
stimulate economic growth in the three Partner States by facilitating their
economic integration. To achieve this objective, the three Governments
established the following institutions:
(a)  a common market:  the Partner States agreed to establish a common
customs and excise tariff, abolish internal trade restrictions, 1/
retain freedom of payments between them, and effect the necessary
harmonization in monetary and industrial policies to ensure the pro-
per functioning of the common market;
1/   The only exception to this principle was the creation of a system of
transfer taxes by which a Partner State having a negative trade balance
in manufactured goods with another Partner State may impose a transfer
tax on imports of goods from the state with a positive balance, provided
the state imposing the tax manufactures, or plans to manufacture, the
goods in question. The transfer tax rate can amount to half the common
external tariff.



-2-
(b) four corporations administered on a regional basis; they are the
E.A. Railways Corporation, the E.A. Harbors Corporation, the E.A.
Posts and Telecommunications Corporation, and the E.A. Airways Cor-
poration;
(c) the General Fund Services, which include all the common services of
the Community such as the Central Secretariat in Arusha, the
Directorate of Civil Aviation, the Meteorological Department, and
the Natural Resources and Medical Research Institutions; and
(d) the East African Development Bank to finance industrial development
in the Community while helping to redress industrial imbalances
between the Partner States.
Performance
2.02      In recent years, the EAC and its institutions have been facing
serious political, financial and institutional difficulties. The Authority,
i.e., the chief excutive body of the Community, composed of the heads of the
three Partner States, has not met since September 1970, due to political
tensions between the Partner States. Although each Partner State readily
recognizes that the Community has made a significant contribution to the
development of its economy, each is concerned that it may be deriving fewer
benefits from the Community than the other two, while supporting more than
its share of the costs. As costs and benefits are difficult to measure, not
much progress has been made in the search for a compromise solution. In 1973
and 1974, these problems were compounded by balance of payments difficulties
in each of the Partner States. The various institutions of the Community were
affected in the following way by these events:
(a) The economic integration of the three countries suffered a severe
setback in 1973 as the Partner States reverted to exchange controls
and quantitative restrictions to protect their respective balance
of payments positions; moreover, the measures envisaged in the
Treaty to foster economic integration such as harmonization of the
fiscal incentives to industrialists and coordination of industrial.
policies among the Partner States have proved very difficult to
implement.
(b) Difficulties with transfers of the Community Corporations' funds
between the Partner States began in late 1973; this interfered
considerably with the functioning of the Corporations and further
lowered their efficiency, particularly that of the E.A. Railways
Corporation.
(c) The General Fund Services were not affected by the problems mentioned
above. Their need for transfer of funds is limited by the fact that
the various services are dispersed among the three countries and



-3-
their financing is ensured by receipts of the E.A. Customs and
Excise Department which is a Community institution.
(d)  Finally, EADB as a development finance institution was less affected
by the problems of the Community for a number of reasons. First,
EADB is welcomed by the Partner States as a net source of foreign
exchange. Second, the repayment schedule of EADB's sub-loans is
individualized by country and therefore there is no room to
argue about the sharing of benefits and costs. Third, as a result of
the decentralization of EADB's activities in each of the Partner
States, the need for transfer of funds has been kept to a minimum.
Fourth, EADB as an institution is highly regarded by the Partner
States who have relied on it for technical advice. These factors,
coupled with the fact that EADB is directly responsible to the
Authority of the Community rather than to the Legislative Assembly,
differentiate EADB from the other Community bodies, particularly the
Corporations.
Future
2.03      The Partner States, recognizing past benefits from the Community,
are committed to maintaining it in a decentralized form. To address problems
flowing from political changes, they have agreed to review the Treaty in order
to improve the functioning of the Common Market and the Community institutions
and increase their benefits to the Partner States. The Commission reviewing
the Treaty should take approximately one year to submit its conclusions to the
Authority.
2.04      Even in the event that most of the Community institutions should be
dissolved, it is likely, in the opinion of several senior Government officials
in the three Partner States, that EADB would be maintained for the reasons men-
tioned in para. 2.02(d). In summary, there is little reason to believe that
the problems which affect the EAC institutions at present would put in danger
the operations of EADB.
III. THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
Economic Structure and Growth
3.01      The combined population of the three countries forming the East
African Community is about 37 million, almost equally divided among the three
Partner States and growing at about 3% p.a. Per capita GNP in 1970 was $170,
$130, and $120 in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania respectively. The economy of
the three countries is dominated by agriculture, which accounted for one-third
(in the case of Kenya), 38% (Tanzania), and one-half (Uganda) of GDP, more
than 80% of overall employment, and 60% (Kenya), 79% (Tanzania), and 93%
(Uganda) of foreign exchange earnings from trade in 1972. 1/ The industrial
I/   More recent figures are not available for the three countries, but the
orders of magnitude are believed to have remained the same in the past
two years.



-4-
and mining sectors represented 9.5% (Uganda), 10% (Tanzania) and 12.5% (Kenya)
of GDP in 1972 and accounted for less than 4% of employment in each of the
three countries.
3.02      Kenya.  The rate of growth of GDP in Kenya averaged about 7% p.a. in
real terms between 1964 and 1972. This rate is estimated to have declined to
about 6% in 1973 and 3.6% in 1974, mainly as a result of drought conditions in
the agricultural sector. This overall impressive record is attributed to a
generally favorable investment climate, the achievement of a high savings ratio
(about 20% of GDP), and a substantial increase in the rate of investments which
reached 23% of GDP in 1972 from 12% in 1964. In 1974, external reserves de-
clined by an estimated 20% as a result of a further worsening in the terms of
trade, following the rapid increase in the price of petroleum and other major
import commodities. This led the Government to take a number of restrictive
measures, particularly with respect to import controls (para. 3.11).
3.03      Tanzania.  The growth rate in Tanzania was about 5% p.a. between 1968
and 1972 in real terms. In 1973 and 1974, although official statistics are
not available, this rate if likely to have fallen somewhat as a result of the
drought and a tightening balance of payments situation. For the same reasons
as in Kenya, the country's terms of trade deteriorated sharply from the
beginning of 1974, which led to a rapid decline in foreign exchange reserves.
As imports of consumer goods were already at a minimum level, shortages
of foreign exchange affected directly the productive sectors of the economy
through a shortage of spare parts and raw materials and a cutdown in invest-
ments.
3.04      Another reason for a deceleration in the rate of growth is the
gradual transition of the Tanzanian economy towards a centrally-planned
economic system, which at least in the short-run, has resulted in some delays
in decision-making.
3.05      Uganda.  Between 1965 and 1970, the Ugandan economy is estimated to
have grown at 4-5% p.a. By contrast, the economy practically stagnated during
1970-71 mostly as a result of adverse weather conditions which led to a decrease
in the production of the main cash crops: coffee, cotton, and tea, and the
corresponding processing industries. The period 1972-75 is dominated econo-
mically by the declaration of the "economic war" of August 1972 and its con-
sequences. This refers to the package of measures taken by the Government
aimed at eliminating the predominance of non-citizens in various sectors of
the economy particularly in commerce and manufacturing. The Ugandanization
process involved the departure of non-citizens from Uganda and the transfer
of manufacturing and commercial enterprises which used to be held by non-
citizens to parastatals and Ugandan nationals. The loss of managerial and
technical skills, and transport equipment resulted in a substantial disruption
of the modern sector of the economy and a decline in real output in 1973 (in
spite of a record coffee crop) and in 1974. Foreign exchange reserves at the
end of 1971 fell to the equivalent of less than 1 month's imports (as compared
to more than 3 months' imports in 1970). Since then, they have remained at a
very low level.  Private capital flights in 1972 and 1973, and a marked decrease



-5-
in foreign aid in 1973, forced a sharp cutdown in imports. Thus imports
in 1972 and 1973 were 10% below those of 1969 and 1970 in current prices.
This corresponds to a decrease of about 40 percent in constant terms, which
affected all sectors of the economy, and resulted in a lack of raw materials,
spare parts and renewal investments. Although no official data are available
for 1974 the same situation is believed to have prevailed.
The Industrial Sector
3.06      Growth record and structure.  Value added by the manufacturing sector
in the three Partner States amounted to about Shs 3,300 million in 1972, about
half of which originated in Kenya, 30% in Tanzania, and slightly more than 20%
in Uganda. Tanzania's share remained the same between 1968 and 1972. The
share of Uganda decreased steadily (from 27% in 1969) for the reasons given in
para. 3.05, while Kenya's manufacturing output was growing at a rate of more
than 9% p.a. in constant terms, as compared to 7% for Tanzania. In 1973 and
1974, the gap in industrial production between Kenya and Tanzania, on the one
hand, and Uganda, on the other, further widened, as industrial production in
Uganda declined during these two years.
3.07      Industrial investments in Kenya increased more than five-fold from
1964 to 1972, i.e. a rate of increase of about 20% p.a., to reach a level of
Shs 600 million in 1972. The increase in industrial investments in Tanzania
between 1966 and 1970 was no less impressive, although some slow-down took
place from 1970 to 1972. Total industrial investments in the East African
Community were broadly estimated at Shs 1,000 million in 1972.   In contrast
to the Kenyan case, most industrial investments in Tanzania and nearly all
in Uganda are now undertaken by the public sector.
3.08      Kenya's industrial sector comprises the main following sub-sectors:
food processing (26% of total value added in the industrial sector), equipment
and machinery (19%), chemicals and oil refining (14%), textiles (10%), and
transport equipment repairs (10%). In 1972, about 80% of the industrial labor
force was employed by the 380 firms with 50 or more employees. The industrial
structure in Tanzania and Uganda is less diversified and concentrated in fewer
firms, with processing of food and agricultural products and beverages accounting
for about one third of the total in Tanzania and probably more in Uganda.
The rest is primarily concentrated in import-substitution industries such as
textiles, chemicals, building materials, wood products and metal products.
3.09      Export of Manufactured Goods and Industrial Coordination.  Exports
of manufactured goods by the East African Community increased only very slowly
in real terms between 1971 and 1974 as the increase in Kenyan exports outside
the EAC was offset by a decline in Ugandan exports. In current terms and for



-6-
the Community as a whole nearly 60% of the increase in manufactured goods
exports during this period is accounted for by an increase in Kenyan petroleum
exports 1/ (mostly due to the 1974 price increase). EAC exports are summarized
in Table 1 on the following page.
3.10      Intracommunity trade of manufactured goods increased at about 6% p.a.
between 1971 and 1974 in current terms, but probably stagnated in real terms.
This rather low performance is mostly the result of a 75% decline in Ugandan
exports toward Kenya and Tanzania, which offset a 40 percent increase in Kenyan
exports to Tanzania and Uganda during the same period. As shown by Table 2,
about 80% of intracommunity trade is accounted for by manufactured products,
of which over 80% originated in Kenya. Although it is difficult to quantify,
there is little doubt that the Kenyan manufacturing sector benefitted substan-
tially from its access to the Tanzanian and Ugandan markets in spite of the
transfer tax (which affects only 13-14% of the goods imported by Tanzania from
Kenya) and other trade barriers. In 1974, exports of manufactured goods to
the EAC represented 45% of Kenya's total exports of manufactured goods; this
ratio is only 22% in the case of Tanzania.
3.11      Nevertheless, much of the rapid growth of industrial output in Kenya
and Tanzania in the past few years is in import-substitution industries which
grew behind a number of trade barriers which have superseded the transfer tax
authorized by the 1967 Treaty. The Industrial Licensing Bureau of the Community,
responsible for coordinating industrial development among the Partner States
in five industries (mainly textiles), exercised little control over the
establishment of manufacturing enterprises, and stopped functioning in 1973.
At present, intracommunity trade is primarily determined by quotas and ad hoc
import decisions by the respective trade control authorities. This issue will
be dealt with at the time of the review of the East African Community Treaty
which could take place in 1976. 2/
3.12      Problems.  Now that import substitution possibilities become more
limited, future industrial growth in Kenya will have to depend more on exter-
nal markets. However, the Kenyan manufacturing enterprises are for the most
part not yet ready to confront the export market (although it must be pointed
out that Kenyan exports of manufactured products outside the EAC have increased
markedly in 1973 and 1974). This, and a relative shortage of skilled labor,
are probably the most serious problems of Kenya's industry at present.
1/ Reexports of refined products.
2/   The Common Market Council in collaboration with EADB has recently
prepared a paper on the "Strategy for Industrial Development" which is
now being studied by the respective Governments and the EAC authorities.

3.13      The same problem is facing the industrial sector of Tanzania. 1/
Another serious problem in Tanzania is the gradual bureaucratization of the
decision-making process and the lack of clear performance incentives. About
75% of industrial output is controlled by the public sector, in which enter-
prises have little or no control over prices, marketing and transfer arrange-
ments, import licenses, senior personnel and management recruitment, and wage
policy. This has resulted in lower productivity in many cases.
3.14      The industrial sector in Uganda is facing the same problems as
confront the economy as a whole (see para. 3.05).
Government Policies Towards Industry
3.15      In Kenya, a number of favorable fiscal and other investment code
provisions have attracted local and foreign promoters who have the option to
apply to a New Projects Committee for a Certificate of Approved Enterprise
which facilitates a project's application for benefits including refunds of
import duty on intermediate and capital goods, guarantee of foreign exchange
availability for repatriation of profits, and, most importantly, tariffs or
other types of protection. The common external tariff of the community pro-
vides for import duties which average 30% of the c.i.f. value for most consumer
goods, and higher duties for luxury goods. Local enterprises also benefit from
direct import controls, mostly applied to imports originating outside the
community, although, as already mentioned, these have also been applied recent-
ly to intracommunity trade.
3.16      The Government is aware that import-substitution possibilities are
becoming limited, and is now studying ways of promoting exports, including a
selective reduction in import taxes and other protective measures. In June
1974, the Government also introduced a manufacturers' export compensation
scheme which provides for the payment to the local manufacturer of 10% of the
value of the manufactured goods exported.
3.17      In Tanzania, because public investments predominate, the role of the
incentive system is not as significant as it is in Kenya. Nevertheless,
the private investor benefits from a number of provisions which are similar
to those applied in Kenya, particularly with regard to protection. The Govern-
ment strategy aims at a gradual structural transformation of the economy by
giving priority to industries that process domestic raw materials for consump-
tion in the home market and by requiring that traditional exports are locally

report No. 647-TA: "Tanzania: Industrial and Mining Sector Survey,"

processed as far as can be economically justified. The 1973 decentralization
of the State Trading Corporation and other trading organizations should grad-
ually resolve the distribution problems which have also disrupted supplies in
the past. The Government has also intensified its efforts to train Tanzanians
at home and abroad. The Institute for Finance Management, established in 1972,
has undertaken a variety of urgently needed training programs including an
accelerated training program for managers of all parastatal institutions.
3.18      In Uganda, the 1964 Industrial Charter and Investment Protection Act,
although still in force, is no longer being applied. All important investment
decisions are made by the Government.  Recently, the Government has given some
recognition to the problems facing the economy in general and the industrial
sector.  First, the Government has set up a number of parastatal organizations,
covering the most important industrial sectors, to be responsible for identi-
fying the major problems pertaining to each sector and for making recommenda-
tions to the Government regarding solutions. Second, the Government has
recruited a large number of foreign staff (about 300 at present), primarily
from Pakistan and India, to occupy key advisory positions in public enterprises
and enterprises recently allocated to nationals. In addition, the Government
has requested UNDP to provide experts to assist the government in economic
planning. The Bank has been requested to act as executing agent. Finally,
the Government has also decided to make regular allocations of foreign exchange
for raw materials and spare parts for priority industries which include food,
jute, hides and skins, oil milling and textile industries.
Prospects
3.19      In view of balance of payments constraints on the one hand, and the
fact that import-substitution possibilities become more limited, on the other,
it is unlikely that industrial growth in Kenya and Tanzania will continue at
the high rates achieved in the late sixties and early seventies. At the same
time, measures taken by both Governments to stimulate industrial growth and
exports (para. 3.15-3.17) are expected to lead to continued growth in this
sector in both countries of perhaps 52 p.a.
3.20      In Uganda, assuming that the Government will continue in its effort
to review systematically the problems facing each industry, as it did in the
case of the sugar industry, to make adequate allocations of foreign exchange
to the directly productive sectors and to implement the recommendations of the
technical assistance advisors recently recruited, there is substantial poten-
tial for recovery in the industrial sector from its presently very depressed
level. Nevertheless, as these measures have only been taken recently, it will
take time for the industrial sector to show real signs of recovery.
3.21      In their attempt to relieve the constraints to industrial development,
the governments of the three Partner States can be significantly helped by the
local and regional development finance institutions, through their mobilization
of local and foreign exchange resources, technical advice, and knowledge of the
business community. These institutions are reviewed below.

IV. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
Commercial Banks
4.01      The banking and financial system in the three East African countries
is summarized in Table 3.  The different economic systems of Tanzania and
Uganda, on the one hand, and Kenya, on the other, is also reflected in the
commercial banking sector, which is dominated by the National Bank of Commerce
(NBC) in Tanzania, and the Uganda Commercial Bank (UCB) in Uganda. The
Tanzanian National Bank of Commerce, created in 1967 as a result of the nation-
alization and merger of all commercial banks, is now the only source of short-
term credit in Tanzania. The Uganda Commercial Bank's deposits now represent
more than 60 percent of total commercial banks' deposits in Uganda (as com-
pared to 22% in 1972) as a result of a Government directive of December 1972,
that Government departments, parastatals, other public entities, and insti-
tutions receiving grants from the Government should transact their banking
business with UCB. The Bank of India, and a number of branches of other
foreign commercial banks, closed down in the past three years as a result of
decreased operations. By contrast, the largest commercial bank in Kenya, the
Kenya Commercial Bank (60% Government-owned, 40% Grindlays Bank) accounts for
only 20% of total assets and liabilities of the commercial banking system in
that country. The commercial banks have provided predominantly short-term
local currency finance to the industrial sector.
Development Finance Institutions 1/
4.02      The major long-term finance institutions in the three countries are
Government-owned. In the industrial financing sector, they are ICDC 2/ and
IDB in Kenya, TIB in Tanzania, and UDB in Uganda.
4.03      Kenya.  ICDC, 100% Government-owned, was created in 1955 to promote
and assist industrial and commercial activities, with emphasis on facilitating
the transfer of business from non-Kenyan to Kenyan ownership. In June 1974,
ICDC's portfolio amounted to Sh 335 million, slightly more than 50% of which
consisted of small loans, granted largely for this purpose. Although ICDC
has been primarily involved with financing smaller-scale enterprises, its role
in providing mostly local and some foreign currency financing to larger-scale
industrial enterprises through equity and some loans has gradually increased
to where 38% of its total portfolio is comprised of large-scale projects.
The largest two holdings of ICDC are in IDB (51% owned by ICDC) and DFCK (25%),
the other two long-term industrial financing institutions in Kenya. ICDC's
statutes do not impose any limit on its financing. ICDC's largest investments
in a single undertaking have amounted to about Sh 20 million.

4.04      IDB 1/ was created in 1973 with a share capital of Sh 40 million
(ICDC 51%, Government 49%) to provide local and foreign currency for medium
and large-scale industrial projects. In May 1975, IDB's share capital was
increased to Sh 80 million. Its total loan and equity portfolio, which
amounted to Sh 12 million in March 1975, is expected to reach Sh 50 million
by the end of the year. IDB's maximum investment in a single venture is
Sh 12 million.
4.05      The Development Finance Company of Kenya 2/ was set up in 1963 to
promote and finance medium- and large-scale industrial projects. The loan
and equity portfolio of DFCK amounted to Sh. 80 million by mid-1974. Annual
commitments amounted to about Sh. 20 million and the maximum investment in
a single enterprise is limited to Sh. 6 million. DFCK is presently negotiat-
ing with its four shareholders to obtain new resources.
4.06      The merchant banking subsidiaries of Kenyan commercial banks, whose
resources are primarily term deposits from large depositors and commercial
banks, have provided medium-term local currency finance to the industrial
sector. However, their role as a source of such finance has been constrained
in the recent liquidity squeeze by the difficulty of their parent banks to
attract deposits above 18 months.
4.07      In addition to the foregoing, there is a Nairobi Stock Exchange in
which about 70 companies are registered, half of which are traded regularly.
Since the introduction of exchange controls in the EAC, only Kenyan securities
have been traded on the Stock Exchange. The registered Kenyan firms are mostly
those who have maintained a policy of steady dividend payments; current
dividend yields range generally between 5 and 15% p.a.
4.08      Tanzania.  The Government established the Tanzanian Investment
Bank 3/ (TIB) in 1970 to finance public and private enterprises in the indus-
trial, agricultural processing, tourism and transportation sectors. TIB's
operations have increased rapidly and TIB is now the major medium and long-
term financing institution in the country, with total approvals during FY
1975 of Sh 130 million. As of March 1975, TIB's portfolio amounted to Sh 87
million. TIB's maximum investment in a single enterprise is Sh 17 million.
4.09      The Tanzania Development Finance Company was created in 1962 with
the same objectives as DFCK in Kenya. By mid-1974, the loan and equity
portfolio of TDFL amounted to Sh. 60 million. Annual commitments now average
1/   The World Bank made two loans to IDB, one in November 1973 of $5 million,
and the other in July 1975 of $10 million.
2/   DFCK's share capital is held in equal shares by three bilateral donors
(U.K. Federal Republic of Germany, and the Netherlands), and the Kenyan
Government. The share capital structure is the same for TDFL and DFCU.
3/   The World Bank Group made a credit of $6 million to TIB in February 1974
and a loan of $15 million in October 1975.



- 14 -
about Sh. 10 million and the maximum investment in a single enterprise is
limited to Sh. 6 million. TDFL's role has decreased in importance over the
years due to resource constraints, the declining role of the private sector,
and Government's restrictions.
4.10      Uganda.  UDB started its activities in 1972, following the departure
of the non-citizens. In its first years of operation, UDB made mainly short
(working capital) and medium-term local currency loans to commercial,
agricultural and industrial enterprises. Its resources consist of its paid-
up capital of Sh. 47 million, which is entirely committed at present. There
is a possibility that the Treasury will make a loan to UDB of Sh. 20 million
in 1975. Short of this, the committable resources of UDB will be about
Sh. 15 million in 1975/76, financed by expected repayments to UDB.
4.11      DFCU was created at about the same time as DFCK and TDFL and with
the same objectives. However, for the last two years, due to lack of resources,
DFCU has not been operational. Commercial banks' subsidiaries in Uganda have
provided medium-term local currency financing to a few projects but have
played a very limited role in the industrial sector.
V. EADB'S ROLE
Objectives and Role
5.01      The basic objectives of EADB according to its Charter are to provide
financial and technical assistance to promote industrial development in the
Partner States in such a way as to correct the imbalance in industrial develop-
ment between the States and also to make industrial investments which would
make the economies of the three States increasingly complementary in the
industrial sector.
5.02      To correct the imbalance in industrial development between the Partner
States, the Charter included an investment formula which stipulated that 38.75%
of total investments should be made in Uganda and Tanzania respectively and
only 22.5% in Kenya; compliance with the formula was to be examined every
five years.  On the basis of loan approvals at March 31, 1975, Tanzania had
received 35.7% of total investments, Uganda 33.9% and Kenya 30.4%. However,
on the basis of disbursements at the same date, Tanzania had 43.9% of total
investments, Kenya 32.5% and Uganda 23.6%. The low level of disbursements
in Uganda 1/ was due to the deferment and indefinite postponement of some
1/   A joint committee was formed between EADB and the Ugandan Government to
review the reason for EADB's low level of operations in Uganda. The
findings of the committee which included the above comments, were accepted
by the Ugandan Government.



- 15 -
previously approved projects due to shortages of adequately trained manage-
ment following the departure of the non-citizens in 1973; the lack of raw
materials also caused the postponement of some expansion projects. EADB was
not questioned on its distribution of investments at the EAC review of
operations in 1973; the next review will be in 1978 and EADB considers that
as the Ugandan economy recovers, further investment opportunities will arise,
allowing it to comply with the formula nearer the review date.
5.03      EADB has been able to play a significant Community role in attempt-
ing to achieve the complementary development of the industrial sectors in the
Partner States: (i) Because EADB operates in all three States, it has been
able to provide intelligence on sectoral developments in other Partner States
to assist in the design and sizing of a particular investment project and to
avoid duplication of productive capacity; (ii) EADB has provided finance for
many projects which were designed to utilise EAC sources of raw materials or
service more than one national market within the Community; (iii) At Govern-
ments' requests EADB has continued to research major industries which would
require regional co-investment by two or more Partner States; EADB having
the staff and resources to undertake such studies. Because all three Partner
States equally hold equity in EADB and because it has sources of finance
external to the Community, its advice and proposals are respected by the
member Governments as being independent of national bias.
5.04      The Board of Directors of EADB whose members have involvements at a
national level on either financial or industrial policies, is the only body
closely involved in the business of the Community which has direct access to
the member Governments at a senior level; it can therefore act as a forum
for the discussion of the Partner States financial/industrial policies. It
was able to meet and be effective throughout the Community's problem period.
Project Work
5.05      EADB has also played a significant role in the selection, analysis
and financing of projects in East Africa. Each regional office has a fully
qualified appraisal team (each team includes an economist, engineer and
financial analyst) and all projects are reviewed at head office by senior
management. EADB's appraisal experience and expertise is of assistance to
the newer national development banks on the many jointly financed projects
undertaken. Because of its independent resources and a single project invest-
ment limit above those of the national development finance institutions, it
has influenced the design of large, jointly financed projects. Also because
it has the staff and resources to undertake studies on behalf of both client
and government, its recommendations have resulted in the postponement of
national projects which were not viable. Although EADB's disbursements in
1974 represented only 3-4% of the total industrial investment in the Community,
the funds were invested in projects representing some 12-13% of total Community
industrial investments.



- 16 -
5.06      EADB's supervisory staff have also had an influence in initiating
recovery programs of jointly financed projects experiencing serious operating
difficulties. Regional managers sit on the boards of EADB financed projects
and supervisory officers make regular visits to projects in their regions.
In 1974 in Tanzania, EADB supervisory teams visited four projects encountering
major operating problems. Written reports analyzing the problems and making
recommendations for their resolution were sent to co-investors resulting in
remedial action being initiated.
Operations
5.07      As shown in the Basic Data summary, the volume of EADB's operations
has fluctuated considerably during the last four years. Loan approvals
increased through 1971 and 1972 reaching Shs. 73.1 million in 1972 before
declining in 1973 to Shs. 39.2 million due to disruptions of EADB's operations
at the head office in Kampala during the political changes in Uganda. In
1973, the decision was taken to decentralize EADB's operations by the forma-
tion of regional offices with complete appraisal and supervision staff at
Kampala, Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. By 1974, all the regional offices were
operational and the volume of loan approvals steadily increased as regional
appraisal teams became familiar with standardized appraisal procedures. Loan
approvals in 1974 increased to a total of Shs. 57.7 million and during the
first quarter of 1975 loans totalling Shs. 38.5 million had already been
approved. Because of both delays in project implementation and the indefinite
postponement of some approved projects, particularly in Uganda, commitments
and disbursements have lagged considerably; disbursements reached a peak in
1973 at Shs. 44.7 million before falling in 1974 to Shs. 35.7 million.
5.08      Annex 4 provides as at December 31, 1974 a breakdown of EADB approvals
since inception by industrial sector. Approvals in the textile sector repre-
sent 25.5% of total approvals and EADB intends to curtail future investments
in textiles to limit the exposure of the portfolio in any one sector. Ten
other sectors account for 62% of cumulative approvals ranging from iron and
steel (9.4%) and aluminum (4.6%) processing and fabricating, to wood industries
(9.1%), food and beverages (8.1%), paper and pulp (8.1%), plastics and rubber
(6.7%), cement (6.7%), salt (4.9%) and sugar (4.6%); EADB's portfolio is
therefore quite well diversified.
5.09      Annex 5 provides an analysis of loans approved to March 31, 1975.
Approximately half the loans approved by number, representing 70% by value,
have been loans above Shs. 5 million.  Seventy five percent of EADB's lending
by number and value, has been for manufacturing projects and 21% for proces-
sing projects. The loans have been made equally in both number and value to
new and existing enterprises.  Since inception two thirds of all loans were
in foreign exchange and one third in local currency; however, in 1974 this
ratio changed with 80% of EADB loan approvals by value being for foreign
exchange and only 20% local currency, reflecting increased demand for EADB's
foreign exchange resources.



- 17 -
5.10      Annex 6 shows the estimated economic returns for fourteen EADB
projects approved between early 1974 and March 1975. The projects, repre-
senting 28% of the total number of projects approved since inception and
involving a total fixed capital cost of Shs 364 million, had attractive
economic rates of return ranging from 12% to 65%. Thirteen of the projects
not involving renovation or modernization created approximately 1970 jobs at
about US$22,000 per job. Of the nine projects being financed under the first
Bank loan, three utilize raw materials from other Partner States and three
others have their production capacity sized to service more than one Partner
State market. One other project had its proposed production capacity reduced
because of possible Community oversupply. Seven of the nine IBRD approved
projects are being financed by EADB in conjunction with one or more of the
national development finance institutions; in the majority of cases the
investment would have been too large for a single national institution. The
Ugandan match manufacturing project is being financed solely by EADB and the
company. Whilst these projects were being approved, the EADB management and
appraisal staff were rejecting 9nother twelve projects involving an approxi-
mate total investment of Shs. 450 million on a number of grounds including:
insufficient raw material supply, inadequate market for projects output, poor
management, adequate existing production capacity and poor equipment.
VI. ORGANIZATION OF EADB
Ownership, Board and Management
6.01      Ownership.  The paid-in share capital of EADB was increased during
1974 to U.A. 130.1 million following the subscription of U.A. 0.5 million by
the Post-Och Kredit Banken of Sweden (see Annex 1). The three Partner States
remain the major shareholders with 30.75% of the paid-in share capital each.
The remainder of the equity is held by six banks and a consortium of Yugoslav
institutions.
6.02      Board of Directors.  Annex 2 identifies EADB's directors as at
March 31, 1975. There have been three changes since December 31, 1973.
Mr. Ng'ang'a, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance has replaced Mr. Ndegwa
as the Kenyan Director. Mr. Kabetu, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Commerce
has replaced Mr. Matheka as the Kenyan Alternate Director. Dr. A. K. Malima,
Principal Secretary, the Treasury, has replaced Mr. Byabato as the Tanzanian
Alternate Director.
6.03      The Board takes an active interest in all EADB's operations and has
been meeting at least quarterly.
6.04      Management.  Mr. Iddi Simba, a Tanzanian, has been the chief execu-
tive (Director General) of the bank since its inception. The appointment
is made by the East African Authority for a period of five years; Mr. Simba's
current term will expire January 31, 1978. He had previously been an Alternate
Executive Director of the World Bank, Acting Permanent Secretary of Planning
and Assistant Commissioner of Planning in the Government of Tanzania.
Mr. Simba is highly competent and experienced, and has provided EADB with
exceptional leadership through a difficult period.



- 18 -
6.05      The other executive directors of the bank include Mr. Gachecheh,
a Kenyan, who is Director of Finance, Mr. Ngatunga, a Tanzanian, who is
Director of Operations, and Dr. Oksal, a Turk, who is Director of Research
and Project Promotion. They complete a very competent senior management team.
Departmental Organization and Staff
6.06      Annex 3 shows EADB's organization.  The decentralization process
undertaken during 1973 involved the enlarging of the regional offices in
Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam and the creation of a Ugandan regional office in
Kampala.  Each regional office has a regional manager, a three man appraisal
team consisting of an economist, engineer and financial analyst plus one
supervisory officer. The offices have been fully operational on a regional
basis since the beginning of 1974. The regional office managers report
directly to the Director of Operations at head office in Kampala, under whom
are also staff managers of appraisal and supervision. These managers operate
in an advisory capacity to the regional appraisal and supervisory officers.
6.07      The Research and Project Promotion department in Kampala has two
divisions - one for research and planning to assist in EADB investment policy
determination and the development of sectoral investment critieria; the other,
a project planning and promotion division, to identify and promote new investment
projects for EADB.
6.08      The Finance and Administration department staff are all based in
Kampala and report to the Director of Finance and Administration. The depart-
ment is responsible for the company's accounts, financial planning, proces-
sing loan contracts, disbursements and collections. The internal auditor
reports directly to the Director General and is independent of the finance
department as is the legal counsel department.
6.09      The total staff of the bank numbers 84 of which 36 are professionals.
With the exception of the Director of Research and Project Promotion, all the
staff of the bank are East African. The professional staff are all well
educated; the new staff acquired during the decentralization in 1973 have
now had time to become familiar with operating procedures and gain experience.
A number of the staff have attended E.D.I. courses, including the Director
of Operations (who subsequently spent some six months with the African DFC
division) and the three Regional Office Managers. EADB has itself provided
training to staff members from UDB and TIB. Personnel turnover has been very
low and morale within the bank is excellent.  EADB's management and staff
constitute a very competent professional group.
Procedures
6.10      Appraisal.  Projects accepted for appraisal at the regional offices
are referred to the Director of Operations for his advice as early as possible
in the appraisal process in order to ensure that the regional office analysis
will meet with the Appraisal Committee requirements even though appraisal
criteria have been standardised. All project appraisals are reviewed by an
Appraisal Committee consisting of the Director General plus heads of Depart-
ments before presentation to the Board. There were some delays in approving
projects in early 1974 due to the new regional office appraisal teams not



- 19 -
being fully familiar with EADB appraisal procedures: by mid-1974 these
problems had been resolved. The quality of EADB appraisals is very good
and the appraisal staff are capable of undertaking in depth financial and
economic analyses. The three regional appraisal teams have the capacity of
appraising a significantly larger number of projects than that undertaken in
1974.
6.11      Supervision.  Monthly written reports are required from clients by
regional supervisory officers as well as annual financial statements plus
interim statements where available. Written quarterly reports by regional
supervisory officers are forwarded to Kampala and reviewed by the Management
Committee (same staff as the Appraisal Committee) who may decide, as necessary,
to organize special supervision missions to projects encountering serious
difficulties. During the disruptions in 1973, EADB tended to focus its
attention on the Uganda portfolio whilst a number of projects in the Tanzanian
portfolio were encountering serious operating problems. Major supervisory
missions were made in 1974 to these projects and remedial action subsequently
initiated. The quality of EADB supervision is quite good.
6.12      Procurement and Disbursement.  EADB normally requires its clients
to invite quotations from different suppliers and all tenders are closely
reviewed. Disbursements under contracts can only be made on certificates
signed by Board appointed Engineer/Surveyor and final certification for
disbursement are not made until the terms of the financial settlement have
been examined by the Director of Finance.
6.13      Accounting and Auditors.  The accounting work undertaken by EADB
staff is satisfactory. The auditors of EADB are Lawrie Prophet & Co. who
were appointed by the Board for the 1974 audit following the departure of
EADB's existing auditors, Peat Marwick and Mitchell from Kampala. Lawrie
Prophet is now the only private Kampala-based auditing firm. The 1974 audit
only partially met the Bank's requirements outlined in the long form audit
brochure and was particularly deficient in that no independent review was
made of problem projects to determine the appropriateness of the provision
level. The Bank has agreed to the appointment of Lawrie Prophet as auditors
to EADB for a further year subject to the auditors:
(a) undertaking the full "scope of work" outlined in the long form
audit brochure;
(b) presenting fully audited annual statements as outlined in the
long form audit brochure to the Bank;
(c) having agreements with auditing firms in Kenya and Tanzania
who would, on Lawrie Prophets instigation, undertake indepen-
dent reviews of EADB's problem projects and provide reports
directly to Lawrie Prophet thereby offering an independent
basis of assessment.
6.14      Legal.  The legal work undertaken by EADB's Secretary/Counsel
department is satisfactory.



- 20 -
Policies and Lending Conditions
6.15      EADB's Charter states that EADB will be guided by sound banking
principles and that it shall finance only economically sound, technically
feasible and properly appraised projects. It is prohibited from engaging
in refinancing operations. It is required to utilize its funds with due
attention to economy and efficiency.
6.16      In addition to general guidelines, the Charter contains a number
of operating limitations designed to safeguard EADB's financial soundness;
the limitations are prudent and reasonable. They are complemented by an
additional Statement of Operating Policies (Annex 7)initially proposed by
the Bank which includes limitations for EADB's exposure in a single enterprise
and exposure to foreign exchange risks.
6.17      In October 1974, EADB reduced the maximum investment in any single
project from 20% to 15% of unimpaired paid-up capital and reserves, to
further limit EADB's risk exposure in any single investment. In May 1975,
EADB raised the limits on total equity investments from 10% to 50% of the
unimpaired equity of the bank as the existing limit could have become a
constraint on EADB's ability to make equity investments in the near future)
and on the debt/equity ratio from 3/1 to 4/1.
Interest Rate
6.18      EADB currently charges an interest rate of 10% p.a. on all new
loans, with a commitment fee of 1% and a one-time service charge of 1% on
the total loan amount. The foreign exchange risk is passed onto the borrowers.
EADB has not so far applied different onlending rates to loans in foreign
exchange and in local currency. These rates are in line with rates charged
by other long-term lending institutions to the industrial sector in East
Africa. For example, IDB's interest rate ranges from 10 to 11% p.a., DFCK
charges 9-1/2 to 11%, TIB charges 10% and UDB charges 9 to 10% with similar
commitment and service charges.
6.19      EADB's onlending rate in real terms remained positive during the
period 1969-72, when EADB was charging 8-1/2 to 9% on its loans while the
estimated rate of inflation ranged from 5 to 7% in Uganda and Tanzania,
and was below these levels in Kenya. In the past two years however, following
the increase in the price of petroleum and other internationally traded
commodities, drought conditions in Tanzania and Kenya, and a marked decrease
in industrial activity in Uganda, the rate of inflation jumped to an estimated
12 and 15% in 1973 and 1974 respectively in Kenya, 14 and 24% in Tanzania,
and probably more than 25% in Uganda. As a result, EADB's real interest
rates were negative during this period.
6.20      As far as the future is concerned, although inflation rates are
expected to decrease following a slowdown in world inflation and an increase
in agricultural production after two years of drought, it is likely that a



- 21 -
rate of interest of 10% would be only marginally positive (i.e., about 1 or
2%), during the 1976-85 period when most of the proposed loan would be outstand-
ing. Moreover, the rates charged by commercial banks' subsidiaries making local
currency term loans range from 10 to 14% 1/ as of June 1, 1975 as a result of
the difficulty in obtaining term deposits, indicating that EADB's rates do not
currently reflect the conditions of the market.
6.21      Under these circumstances, EADB's management has recently requested
Board approval to increase its interest rate to 11% in a first phase and
12% later on if circumstances warrant it. The Board has requested further
information to support such an increase. However, it is likely that this
attempt by EADB to raise its interest rate will be resisted particularly by
the Tanzanian Government, although the Bank of Tanzania has indicated that
it would be prepared to consider allowing higher interest rates on projects
that could afford such rates to allow the development finance institutions
an adequate spread; also, the Government is now in the process of reviewing
the adequacy of the interest rate structure in Tanzania. An onlending rate
of 11-12% would correspond to a real positive interest of 2-3% on the local
currency component of EADB loans in Kenya and Tanzania (the Ugandan case is
more difficult to estimate), and to a somewhat higher rate on the foreign
exchange component, as a result of the foreign exchange risk supported by
the borrower. We support the effort of EADB's management to increase EADB's
interest rate to these levels.
Resources
6.22      EADB's paid-in share capital as of December 31, 1974 amounted
to Shs. 132.6 million. Only half the issued capital has been paid-in; the
other half is callable only to repay borrowings or to honor guarantees. The
Partner States disbursed half their paid-in capital subscriptions in foreighi
currencies and half in their national currencies.
6.23      EADB's sources of foreign currency for industrial lending have been
the African Development Bank (ADB), SIDA and IBRD. The ADB loan was for
US$2.0 million of which only Shs. 5.4 million has been drawn down due to the
loan being tied to the gold standard 2/ which has proved to be an unacceptable
risk to clients. The US$5.2 million loan from SIDA has a 2% per annum
interest rate with a 10 year grace and 25 year repayment period. Gross
income on this line of credit above 4% per annum is set aside by EADB in a
special fund to finance technical assistance on EADB projects or to make
loans or other forms of assistance to small scale industry. In June 1975,
a second SIDA loan for Shs. 60 million was agreed with EADB; the interest
rate and term are as for the first loan but the funds should be committed
by EADB equally over a three year period. Up to 50% of the funds can be
denominated in local currency. In 1972, IBRD made a loan of US$8 million
1/   According to commercial bank sources, these rates are expected to ease
slightly in the coming months.
2/   Loans from ADB are denominated in Units of Account whose value is tied
to the official price of gold.



- 22 -
at 7-1/4% interest rate - the loan maturity to match that of the sub-projects
to which the funds were on lent. EADB has three other small term finance
loans outstanding amounting to Shs. 14.66 million as of March 31, 1975. The
local currency resources of Shs. 81.2 million are predominantly made up of
initial equity subscriptions plus free reserves.
VII. FINANCIAL CONDITION
Portfolio Evaluation
7.01      As of March 31, 1975 loans totalling Shs. 156 million and equity
investments totalling Shs. 6.8 million were outstanding. Provisions totalling
Shs. 5.6 million were made against the loan portfolio in 1972 and 1973.
Annex 8 shows that approximately 41% (Shs. 64 million) of EADB's loan port-
folio (Shs. 156 million) were loans affected by arrears of over three months
at March 31, 1975; the total principal and interest overdue more than three
months was Shs. 9.8 million, or 6.3% of the total portfolio outstanding.

7.02      In Uganda the arrears-affected portfolio amounts to Shs. 23 million
from six projects (see Table 4); five of which have arrears in excess of one
year. The Uganda Cement Industry project accounting for Shs. 14.5 million of
the arrears is held up because the company is in financial difficulties
and unable to pay the suppliers of new equipment in full; the suppliers
refuse to commission the plant until full payment is received. The African



- 23 -
Ceramics project is no longer operational and EADB is seeking recovery of
the loan outstanding of Shs. 2.0 million plus accrued interest, on a Ugandan
Government guarantee. The remaining four projects with arrearages of Shs. 6.5
million were taken over by Ugandan nationals in 1973 following the departure
of the non-citizens. The Ugandan Government decreed that the new owners of
these projects should have no liability for outstanding debts and that
creditors should not approach these companies for the recovery of such funds
but seek recovery from the Uganda Valuation Committee. 1/ A fifth project,
Musicraft Manufacturing was also taken over by Ugandan nationals but is
making repayments to EADB.  The Ugandan Building Society in which EADB had
Shs. 3.0 million on deposit, was also taken over. EADB reached agreement
with the Committee that it was owed on the five projects plus the deposit,
the sum of Shs. 11.66 million as of the end of 1973. Interest has continued
to accrue on these projects. In October 1975, a written understanding was reach-
ed between EADB and the Ugandan Government for the repayment of all EADB loans
outstanding on projects taken over by Ugandan nationals, plus the deposit with
the Ugandan Building Society; the sum amounts to approximately Shs 16 million
and will be paid in three installments through to mid-1976. The first install-
ment of Shs 3.6 million was paid in October 1975.
7.03      In Tanzania the arrears-affected portfolio amounts to Shs. 34 mil-
lion from four projects. In the last year, major supervisory missions have
been undertaken by EADB to all four projects and recommendations made. In
only one case, Nyanza Salt Mines (EADB loan outstanding Shs. 14.2 million),
are the future prospects uncertain and EADB has agreed to provide for this
project if no significant progress has been made as of December 31, 1975.
7.04      In Kenya, the arrears affected portfolio amounts to Shs. 7 million
on three projects. All three projects are expected to recover from their
current operational problems.
Provisions
7.05      The total provisions as of March 31, 1975 amounted to Shs. 5.6
million on a loan portfolio of Shs. 156 million. Provisions were not made
in 1974 although the problem projects in the Ugandan portfolio were discussed
at some length between the auditors and EADB. However, no visits were made
by the auditors to any of the problem projects in 1974, to form an independent
judgement. The current level of provisions may not therefore adequately
reflect the true state of the portfolio. Both EADB and the auditors have
agreed to rectify this situation at the end of 1975 by the auditors reviewing
problem projects in all three countries (see para. 5.18), and making provisions
where appropriate.

determine liabilities outstanding on projects assumed by Ugandan nationals
following the departure of the non-citizens.

Financial Results
7.06      Annexes 9 and 10 present EADB's audited Income Statements and Balance
Sheets respectively for the period 1971-1974. Although EADB's total income
increased through this period by 57% to Shs. 16.2 million in 1974, expenses
also increased by 94% to Shs. 9.5 million resulting in net profit before
provisions only increasing 24% to Shs. 6.7 million.  In 1974 EADB earned
nearly 6.0% on liquid funds. The net profit in 1974 as a % of average total
assets was 3.3% (see Annex 11); the net profit as a % of average net worth
was 4.4%. The growth in expenses was mainly due to increased financial costs
which rose from 0.2% of average total assets in 1971 to 1.2% in 1974; admin-
istrative costs increased from 3.1% to 3.5% in the same period due to the
decentralization of EADB. The income from loans rose from 6.4% in 1971 to
9.4% in 1974 as interest rates were raised; the cost of debt rose from 3.3%
in 1971 to 6.0% in 1973 before falling in 1974 to 5.1% following the disburse-
ment of the lower cost SIDA funds (2% interest rate). The net loan portfolio
outstanding increased from Shs. 55.5 million in 1971 to Shs. 146 million in
1974 with approximately half of the increase being financed out of term debt
resources, resulting in term liabilities increasing from Shs. 9 million to
Shs. 52 million. However, as of December 31, 1974, the term debt/equity ratio
was still only 0.33:1.
Financial Position
7.07      EADB's financial position is basically sound due to the large equity
base of the bank (Shs. 158 million at December 31, 1974). Although total
provisions of Shs. 5.6 million or 3.5% of the loan portfolio may not be fully
adequate even after the recent Uganda understanding, making provisions for
the two major projects experiencing serious problems (i.e. Uganda Cement
Industries (Shs. 14.5 million) plus Nyanza Salt Mines (Shs. 14.2 million)) would
only reduce the equity base by 18% to Shs. 129 million. The term debt/equity
ratio would increase to 0.4:1 which is still well below the 4:1 limitation.
Thus, although parts of the loan portfolio, particularly in Uganda and
Tanzania, are cause for serious concern, they do not threaten the financial
viability of EADB. The bank has also remained highly liquid with working
capital as of December 31, 1974 of Shs. 19.4 million. The low debt/equity
ratio and high liquidity of EADB as of December 31, 1974, are due to the slow
disbursement of funds in 1973 and early 1974 following the disruptions to
operations.
VIII. PROSPECTS
Forecast Operations
8.01      The short term strategy of EADB includes:



- 25 -
(i) continuing the development of its appraisal and supervisory
skills;
(ii)  further assistance to Uganda to rehabilitate the industrial
sector and to identify bankable projects in order to try and
meet the differential formula requirements;
(iii) undertaking detailed analysis of project proposals to assist
in the design and sizing of projects as well as identifying
and promoting new projects to further the complementary
development of the Community's industrial sector.
In this last respect, although EADB is precluded by its Charter from making
direct investments in the agricultural sector, it is attempting to identify
and promote projects in the agricultural processing sector. Three main
projects are under consideration - a Lake Victoria fisheries complex, a
beef ranching complex and a fruit and vegetables complex. EADB considers
that discrete investments might be made in all three countries in these
projects allowing complementary development in all three States. The
Tanzanian Government has already expressed interest in the Lake Victoria
fisheries complex whereby a fishing fleet on a joint or national ownership
basis might service fish canning and processing plants in any individual
or all three Partner States. F.A.0. in conjunction with EADB has undertaken
an initial study and further studies are envisaged. Fish breeding, fishery
research, and other institutions might also be needed to provide support to
these businesses. EADB is also reviewing certain multinational industries,
in particular a wood, a pulp/paper and a steel complex.
8.02      EADB's project pipeline at March 31, 1975 includes sixteen project
proposals under appraisal or accepted for appraisal involving a potential
EADB investment of some Shs. 170 million. Projects of a regional nature in-
clude manufacturing telephones, textile mill bobbins and electrical conductors
and cables, all substantially for the East African market. EADB has also
influenced a Kenyan based food manufacturer to site a plant to serve the
Tanzanian market in Tanzania as opposed to expanding the existing Kenyan Plant.
EADB is also proposing to finance a brewery project in Tanzania in conjunction
with the NDC and the privately owned Nairobi-based East African Breweries.
Four projects involving an EADB investment of approximately Shs. 50 million
are in Uganda and include a new salt processing project, an expansion project
for electrical cable manufacture, an expansion of a printing and press shop
plus an expansion to an existing bottling plant. The Ugandan Government recom-
mendations based on the EADB review of the Ugandan sugar industry, which are
expected in the near future, may result in further projects in the sugar mill-
ing sector. As noted in para. 3.18 the Ugandan Government has only recently
taken steps to improve on the deficiencies in the Ugandan industrial sector
with regard to management, spares and raw materials and, consequently, the
recovery of the industrial sector will be gradual. However, EADB through its
Ugandan regional office, is working closely with the Ugandan parastatal
institutions to develop new investment opportunities and as the industrial
sector recovers, so will opportunities for making bankable investments. The



- 26 -
project pipeline in Tanzania and Kenya includes a range of projects in both
industrial and agribusiness sectors covering maize milling, building block
and tile manufacturing, cement production, meat processing, car battery manu-
facture, textiles, etc. Many of the above projects will be undertaken in
an association with the national development finance institutions. Project
proposals involving further EADB investment of above Shs. 100 million have
been received although not yet accepted for appraisal.
8.03      EADB's financial projections and the assumptions behind them are
included in Annexes 12 through 16. In the first quarter of 1975, EADB has
approved three projects for loans totalling Shs. 38.5 million and based on
the project pipeline, a figure of Shs. 90 million has been forecast to
December 31, 1975. Thereafter loan approvals are assumed to grow in real
terms by 10% per annum with inflation adjustments falling from 10% in 1976
to 7% by 1979. The level of approvals forecast is well within the approval
capacity of EADB's three regional appraisal teams. The two possible constraints
to EADB's growth in lending will be availability of foreign exchange resources
for EADB and the rate of recovery of the Ugandan industrial sector.
Resource Requirements
(a) Local Currency
8.04      In the forecasts, a ratio of foreign to local currency requirements
of 4.5:1 following the 1975 devaluation has been utilized in contrast to the
historic average since inception of 2:1. EADB considers that the 4.5:1 ratio
reflects the probable future financing requirements and would preclude projects
being rejected because of local currency shortages. 1/  The local currency
commitment resource gap to December 31, 1977 totals Shs. 47 million and can
be adequately financed from local currency repayments plus net cash generation.
If additional local currency resources were required, up to 50% of the second
SIDA loan of Shs. 60 million may be used for local currency financing.
(b) Foreign Exchange
8.05      Based on the assumptions mentioned in paragraph 8.03, EADB will
have a foreign exchange resource requirement to December 31, 1977 of Shs. 230
million (US$28.6 million). During this period there will be net foreign ex-
change repayments of Shs. 18 million; in June 1975, EADB signed an agreement
1/   In Uganda, there is excess liquidity of local currency in the banking
system and UCB has indicated a willingness to consider term financing.
In Tanzania, although local currency resources are tight, the Minister
of Finance indicated that no suitable project would have to be rejected
for lack of local financing. In Kenya, although credit is also tight,
it was considered that promoters of financially sound projects should
be able to find adequate local currency financing.



- 27 -
with SIDA for a second loan of Shs. 60 million to be committed over a period
of three years. Apart from IBRD and SIDA, discussions on loans from other aid
institutions have not progressed very far although EIB and ADB have indicated
they might be in a position to make loans to EADB in the second half of 1976.
The proposed Bank loan of US$15 million would meet approximately 50% of EADB's
foreign exchange needs and 40% of its total resource gap to the end of 1977.
Forecast Financial Results
8.06      Gross income on average total assets is projected to increase from
8% in 1974 to 10.2% in 1979 (see Annex 11) whilst financial expenses would
increase from 1.2% to 4.3% in the same period as the higher cost IBRD funds
are disbursed. The average spread between income from loans and cost of debt
which was 4.3% in 1974 due to disbursement of SIDA money at 2% interest rate,
falls in 1975 to 3.4% as the first IBRD loan is disbursed, before rising to
more than 4% through 1976-1979 as the average interest rate charged by EADB
to its borrowers increases to 10.9% in 1979. Administrative expenses on
average total assets should fall from 3.3% in 1975 to 1.9% in 1979 due to the
EADB organization in 1975 being capable of a larger volume of business. The
net profit as a % of average net worth grows steadily from 3.8% in 1975 to 9.5%
in 1979 reflecting the increased earnings from an expanding loan portfolio.
Provisions through the projection period have been maintained at approximately
3.5% of the loan and equity portfolio outstanding. By 1979 provisions and
reserves will be equal to approximately 19% of the outstanding portfolio
which should provide ample cover to preclude any erosion of EADB's capital.
The expansion in the net loan portfolio outstanding from Shs. 146 million in
1974 to Shs. 536 million in 1979 is financed from an expansion in medium and
long term borrowings. However, because of EADB's large equity base the debt/equity
ratio is expected to only reach 1.9:1 in 1979 - still leaving a large debt
capacity available for further expansion of borrowings and hence loan portfolio.
The debt service coverage falls from 2.8 in 1975 to 2.2 in 1979 but will still
be ample. With expected maturities on borrowing being at least as long as on
sub-loans, EADB should have no problems servicing its debt in the life of the
proposed Bank loan. Thus the projections indicate that EADB will be finan-
cially sound for further Bank lending.
IX. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      Over the last three years EADB has been operating in a very difficult
environment. The disruptions in Uganda in 1973 resulted in EADB having to under-
take a major reorganization of operations. EADB was able to quickly form complete
new regional office teams, competent to deal with all aspects of development
financing operations. Despite this reorganization, EADB has already been able
to play a significant role in the development of the Tanzanian and Kenyan
industrial sectors particularly in 1974 after the regional offices had became
fully operational.



- 28 -
9.02      The basic objectives within the EADB charter were for it to finance
projects designed to make the industrial sectors of the three Partner States
increasingly complementary and at comparable stages of development. Although
the large scale Community projects (i.e., steel, petrochemicals, vehicle
assembly, etc.) originally envisaged have not yet materialized, through its
knowledge of the three national industrial sectors EADB has been a direct in-
fluence toward complementary industrial development. Further, under its
current short term strategy, EADB proposes to enhance this role by promoting
agricultural processing projects (see para. 7.01). The situation in the
Ugandan industrial sector since 1973 has prevented EADB from achieving any
significant reduction in the imbalance between the three Partner States in-
dustrial sectors; however, as the Ugandan industrial sector recovers, EADB
as the sole independent source of foreign exchange for industrial invest-
ment in Uganda, can play a major role in reducing industrial sector imbalances.
Because of its independent resources, EADB should continue to exercise a
significant influence on industrial development within the East African
Community.
9.03      The two major constraints to the future growth of EADB, remain the
uncertainty of the situation in Uganda and the tensions within the Community
particularly with regard to Community corporations. Over the last twelve
months the situation in Uganda has become more stable and the fact that steps
have been initiated recently by the Ugandan Government, for the recovery of
the industrial sector is significant. The recovery process will take time,
and EADB can play an important role in it. EADB does not suffer from the
same operating problems as the Community Corporations. The Governments of the
three Partner States have indicated that they clearly differentiate EADB and
consider it is unlikely to be significantly affected in the event of a breakup
of the Community Corporations.
9.04      Because of the disruptions of 1973, it is important that over the
next few years EADB be able to show sustained growth in its operations and
earnings, so that it may be able to attract additional sources of external
finance possibly from commercial sources. It is also important that EADB
have adequate funds in order to maintain leverage on the many jointly financed
projects with the national development banks who are themselves showing high
growth rates in the volume of their investments. In view of both EADB's
institutional strengths and role within the Community, and of its credit-
worthiness, a Bank loan of US$15 million is proposed to help meet EADB's
financial requirements to December 31, 1977.
9.05      The terms and conditions of the proposed Bank loan should be those
generally applied to recent Bank loans to development finance companies includ-
ing standard commitment fees. The foreign exchange risk would be taken by sub-
borrowers. The amortization of the loan should be the aggregate of EADB's sub-
loans, with a maximum maturity of 15 years from date of approval by IBRD of
individual subprojects.
9.06      Recognizing the improvements made in EADB's appraisal work, the
free limit on individual projects should be raised from $300,000 to $650,000
and the aggregate free limit to $5,000,000. This should allow the Bank to
review about 40% of projects by number and at least 65% by value of the amounts
to be financed.

ANNEX 12
EAST AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
Assumptions for Financial Projections 1975-79
A. Approvals, Commitments and Disbursements
1. Approvals
Loan approvals in both foreign and local currency for 1975 are
based on the project pipeline. Thereafter there will be real growth
of 10% per annum plus inflation adjustments of 10% in 1976, 9%-1977,
8%-1978 and 7%-1979. The approvals are net of cancellations. The
loan ratio of 4.5:1 following devaluation,between foreign and local
currency will be maintained.  Equity approvals are constant and all
in local currency.
2. Commitments
The 1975 loan commitments include uncommitted 1974 approvals of
Shs 6.4 million local currency and Shs 45.3 million foreign currency.
All other loans are committed six months after approval. Seventy-
five percent of equity approvals are committed in the year of
approval and 25% in the following year.
3. Disbursements
The 1975 loan disbursements include 1974 undisbursed commitments
of Shs 0.3 million local currency and Shs 18.6 million foreign currency;
30% of commitments are disbursed in the year of commitment, 50% in the
following year and 20% in the third year. Equity investments are
disbursed 70% in the year of commitment and 30% the following year.
B.  Resources
There will be no increases in share capital. The second loan from
SIDA amounting to Shs 60 million post devaluation, will be available
from mid-1975.
C.  Financial Operations
1.  Interest charged by EADB is currently 10, per annum plus 1,6 commit-
ment fee on undisbursed amounts plus 1% initial service charge. As
EADB is seeking a rate increase; an 11% effective rate is assumed
on new lending and 9.3% on existing loans.
2. Average loan term: nine years with two years grace.
3. Cost of borrowings: 2% for SIDA money and 9% for all other borrowings.
4. Yield on short term investments: 6% per annum.
5. Dividend income from equity portfolio: Year of investment - none;
Year 2 - none; Year 3 - 2%; Year 4 - 5%; Year 5 - 6%.
6. Provisions for Bad Investments: approximately 3% of annual disburse-
ment starting 1975.
7. Administrative Expenses excluding staff costs will increase at 15%
per annum through the projection period: Staff costs will fall in
1975 and 1976 when employees will occupy EADB-owned houses (EADB
was previously paying rent for certain employees accommodations);
thereafter growth in costs will be 10% per annum.
8. No dividends will be paid in the projection period.
9. EADB is tax exempt.
