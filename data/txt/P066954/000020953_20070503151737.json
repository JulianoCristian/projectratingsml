Lessons learned included: 1) In instances\n            where projects are managed by line managers, as was the case\n            in this project where the Director, Petroleum Division was\n            designated as the Project Manger, provision needs to be made\n            for support throughout the project implementation period as\n            there may not be constancy of appointment; 2) The use of PTF\n            ensured that each implementation activity is properly\n            conceived, pursues the hierarchy of project objectives and\n            is amenable to accounting; 3) The project management\n            reporting (PMR) as required by the Bank's Project\n            Financial Management Manual dated February 1999 was more\n            exhaustive than was suitable to a technical assistance (TA)\n            project such as this with no major goods and works\n            procurement and relatively few transactions per year; 4) In\n            the implementation of TA projects that are seeking to\n            enhance staff capacity in the context of uncertain and\n            changing sector development, rigidity of project design\n            should be avoided; 5) The uncertainty of petroleum sector\n            developments arises from price, politics and markets all of\n            which are intrinsically uncertain in themselves; 6) In TA\n            projects such as this where the enhancement of staff skills\n            is sought, it is difficult to reconcile and measure the\n            advancement of skills during the implementation period and\n            the consequent improvement in performance; and 7) In the\n            conduct of the Institutional Studies and the subsequent\n            follow up study great emphasis was placed on consultation\n            with the staff. This provided valuable input and heightened\n            the sense of ownership of the strategy developed."}, "docdt": "2007-03-26T00:00:00Z"}
