"The Gas Development and Utilization\n            Technical Assistance Project, will strengthen the\n            Government's capacity, to efficiently manage the gas\n            sector development in Papua New Guinea. The components call\n            for: 1) enhanced skills within the Petroleum Division's\n            expertise in gas resource evaluation, market assessment,\n            processing, and distribution. Skills will be upgraded\n            through a needs-based training program, consisting of\n            on-the-job training, short courses, industrial know-how, and\n            post-graduate studies. Management training will be provided\n            to cover project management, and implementation, while other\n            Government departments will also participate in relevant\n            courses, and training assignments, to promote coherent\n            policies, and understanding of the petroleum industry, to\n            enable consistent, sector management practices within the\n            government; 2) studies, to be undertaken in-house, by the\n            Petroleum Division staff, under experts supervision,\n            covering liquid petroleum gas (LPG) policy, and utilization;\n            gas-based industrial development, and power generation\n            opportunities, and gas transportation and export, as well as\n            gas pipeline, and facility regulations. Institutional\n            studies will address the transition of the Petroleum\n            Division into a Statutory authority; 3) promotion of\n            investment opportunities for gas export, and domestic\n            utilization, through seminars, and public awareness campaigns."}, "docdt": "2000-05-02T00:00:00Z"}
