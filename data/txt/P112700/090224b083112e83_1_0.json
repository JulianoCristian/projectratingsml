safety net, and\n            competitiveness in Georgia. In 2008\u201309, Georgia was hit with\n            the dual shocks of the August 2008 conflict with Russia and\n            the global financial crisis. The authorities were faced with\n            the dual challenges of mitigating the impact of the economic\n            downturn in the short term, and facilitating recovery and\n            preparing Georgia for post-crisis growth in the medium term.\n            The Development Policy Operations (DPO) series was formed by\n            World Bank which supported a macroeconomic and fiscal\n            framework to restore confidence and mitigate the downturn in\n            2009, followed by quality fiscal adjustment to safeguard\n            sustainability as economic recovery took hold in 2010\u201311.\n            The social safety net was strengthened to support poor and\n            vulnerable segments of the population during difficult\n            economic times. The DPO -supported reforms provided\n            financial and medical aid to thousands of poor and\n            vulnerable Georgians while the economy regained its footing.\n            Around 440,000 people received targeted social assistance in\n            2011 and roughly 900,000 people received targeted medical\n            insurance. The reforms have also bolstered investor\n            confidence and improved competitiveness by reducing business\n            costs and making it faster and easier to move goods in and\n            out of Georgia."}, "docdt": "2012-04-17T06:20:02Z"}
