Loan Project for Georgia were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the strong focus of the Government on\n            outcomes was vital in driving implementation of the reform\n            agenda. The authorities were sharply focused on achieving\n            specific development outcomes and the Development Policy\n            Operations (DPO) team supported the authorities in\n            developing a detailed set of monitorable outcome indicators\n            to track results from implementation of the reform program.\n            The focus on results and outcomes not only helped track\n            implementation, but also helped to more sharply define and\n            formulate the reform triggers necessary for achievement of\n            the desired results. The set of monitorable indicators went\n            beyond specifying end-program status and value targets by\n            specifying intermediate target values for each operation.\n            This helped track the pace of achievement of results along\n            the course of the programmatic series. The programmatic\n            approach afforded important flexibility to advance and\n            deepen reform implementation in several areas and reduce the\n            scope of or provide additional time for implementation in\n            other areas. This approach allowed the program to maintain\n            its relevance to country circumstances, reinforced\n            government ownership, and contributed to a strong\n            relationship of trust between the Bank and the Government.\n            The flexibility was particularly appropriate in light of the\n            Government's sharp focus on achieving results, which\n            allowed the Bank to be flexible in supporting the path\n            followed in arriving at the desired results."}, "docdt": "2012-12-26T00:00:00Z"}
