Second Mae Moh Lignite Project forms\n            part of a national development strategy to reduce the\n            country's high dependence on oil imports by developing\n            indigenous energy resources such as natural gas, lignite and\n            hydropower. The expansion of lignite production at Mae Moh\n            mine is required to meet the incremental demand of the Mae\n            Moh power generating facilities up to and including the 150\n            MW Unit 4 scheduled to be commissioned by January 1984.\n            Production will need to increase from 1 million tons of the\n            run-of-mine lignite in 1979 to 2.8 million tons per year in\n            1984. The project scope for the Mae Moh lignite mine\n            includes the engineering, procurement and erection of mining\n            and related equipment, technical assistance, training and\n            civil works. The mining equipment comprises four 15 cu yd\n            electric rope shovels, thirty four 85 t rear end dump\n            trucks, one coal crushing, conveying, stacking and\n            reclaiming system, and ancillary equipment. The project also\n            includes expansion of the maintenance workshop and office\n            and the mine power supply system."}, "docdt": "1980-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
