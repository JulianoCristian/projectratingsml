providing in a\n            cost-effective manner more services of better quality to\n            residents, especially those in low-income areas, of Cotonou,\n            Porto Novo, and Parakou. There are three project components.\n            The first not only strengthens municipal management but also\n            improves municipal support capacity of line ministries and\n            implementing agencies, privatizes urban services, prepares\n            historic preservation activities, establishes the local\n            information/communication system, and supports reform of the\n            urban management regulatory framework. The second component\n            supports basic infrastructure by improving the urban road\n            network through paving and drainage; funding technical\n            studies, civil works supervision, and financing\n            technical/financial audits of works; and strengthening small\n            and medium enterprises. The third component strengthens\n            community participation by building basic neighborhood\n            infrastructure, funding community-based activities, and\n            supporting community initiatives."}, "docdt": "1999-05-13T00:00:00Z"}
