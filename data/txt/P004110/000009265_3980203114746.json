knowledge and technological\n            requirements for the 1980s and beyond. The sector program\n            includes policy and institutional changes and selective\n            investments. They are designed to: (a) control the quality\n            of graduate- and college-level education; (b) concentrate\n            graduate education in a few key institutions; (c) strengthen\n            an institution for research funding and promotion; (d)\n            improve collaboration between academic institutions and\n            research institutes; (e) establish an institution for\n            advanced training and research and development in science\n            education; (f) adjust the college admissions procedures to\n            reward student achievement in school, including performance\n            in laboratory-based assignments; (g) introduce new secondary\n            science courses with a greater emphasis on practical work;\n            (h) strengthen monitoring and evaluation procedures; (i)\n            recruit and upgrade teaching staff; and (j) improve\n            facilities and equipment."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
