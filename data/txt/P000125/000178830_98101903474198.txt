APP.A_SAL OF A -UMtMIAY PROtECT
SU1M4ARY
i.        The Bechuanaland Protectorate has asked the Association to finanice
part of the cost of (i) construction and reconstruction of three roads totaling
355 miles in length, (ii) betterment of the main north-south road, and (ii.i)
the strengthening and expansion of the Iiighway maintenance organization.
ii.       The total cost of the project is estim-ated at US$4.6 million eqliv-
alent of which US$3.6 million is recommended for financing by the Association
and would partly cover the foreign currency expenditures for the project. The
cost estimate is based on detailed surveys, on the construction of experimental
road sections and on costs of similar work in the adjoining Republic of South
Africa. The estimate includes a reasonable allowance for contingencies.
iii.      Design and supervision of about tw.o-thirds of the road construction
will be carried out by the Public Works Department which will be adequateLy
staffed for this purpose.  On one road, which represents a difficult problem,
a consultant has been used on the survey and design work and will be engag-ed
for supervision of construction.   The Government has agreed to engage consult-
ants  on additional work if unanticinated difficulties are encountered.
ivb       The road construction part will be carried out by contractors selactad
on the basis of international competitive bidding.   Large  works in the better-
ment sclheme will be executed by local contractors while the Public lIorls 'Depsrt-
merit will be responsible for the remainder of the betterment scheme and f:r the
maintenance part.
v,        The project is essentially the transport sector of Liechuanaland's
1963-68 Development Plan and was given the highest priority by a recent FAQ
mission. It will assist very materially in the developrent of the livestock
industry and also reduce transport cost,s. The average rate of return on the
investment will exceed 15% from the benefits which can reasonably be expressed
in monetary terms; this is a satisfactc,ry return.,
vi.       The maintenance part of the rroject iwill assist Bechuanaland in
improving and expanding existing maintenance facilities and equipment, and
thus enable the Public U.orks Departments to better meet its maintenance re-
sponsibilities for both the existing and the proposed roads. Ihile the Gov-
ernment has indicated its intention of continuing to increase maintenance al-
locations in future annual budgets, the amounts are barely adequate. The
Government has given assurance that it will provide any additional funds re-
quired to enable it to properly maintain the road system.
vii.      The Government will finance its share of the project expenditures froii,
its own budget which is supported by grants in aid from the TJnited Kingdom, and
from United Kingdom Colonial Development and Wrelfare funds.  Confirmation has



becn obtained from th,e Governnent and the U.K. that (i) funds will be r2adel avai'.-

6.        Beclhuanaland (see map) is bounded on the south anc southeast by the
Reoublic of South Africa, on the northeast by Sout'ier-n Rlodesia and on the
west and northwest by Southwest Africa.   It has an area of about 222,000
square miles and a populat2ion estimated at 450,0CO of whichi over 96' are
Africans.
7.        The Protectorate, a British Dependency, is administered by Her Maj-
eoty's Corai!ssioner wAho is directly responsible to the Secretary o' State for the
Colories.   The capital and headquarters of the Government are at 1vJafekin,7 in
the Republic of South Africa, but will be moved slortly to C;aberones in tihe
Protectorate.  All land in Bechuanaland is either tribal territory, croWn
land, railway reserve or European settlement area.

8.        Thle Protectorate is a vast arid tableland with an average altitude of
3,300 feet.  It has an average aral r      in oI 19 ih0  -r-in-g fro     12
inches or less in the drier regions to 27 inches in the extreme north. Thne
iroter' &- r f the _rea consis ts of the --lahari -Devt A -1 is   - iel, un=
inhabited. The population is concentrated in the sub-tropical to temoerete
eastern region which is better watt ered and ront,`ins aa  of hig-her elovwition-
9.        The economv of RechIanala;nnnd is b)ased on nari r1ill -hire ,nr1 1; n vnnd
The main crops are maize and sorghuim wh-ich are the stanle food of the Ifrican
population. The livestock industrvy whlich  s by far the most important source
of income, is canable of considerable e:pansion. Mineral exports include
asbestos anc3 manganese.
B. Th e Transnortatinn onvtem
l0t       The eastern region- which contains most of the nopulat-on of
Bechuanaland, is served by a railway which extends from the Republic of
South Africa nortihwrard to Southern Rhodesia anc a main road whiclhi uaral].e!s
the railway. This road servres a number of branch roads whic!i extend from
the railway to neighborinlg townis and vi7lla,es. Two of the latter cross the
Kalahari Desert but after 50 to 100 imi:Les frorm the railway thney b)econe sandy
traclks and are often impassable.
11.       At; present there are h.600 miles of roads in Pechuanaland; they
are classified as main ('1,200 miles), secondary (520 miles) and tracks
(2,830 miles). The latter are further classified as graded and ungreded,
and in sand7r areas their use is mainly restricted to snecial vehicles. Ihost
of the existling roads have been cheaply bulilt  The,r are somer;mecs below
the level of the sur rounding terrain, drainage is inadequate, and only some
of the primary and secondary roads have been graveled.  ;one of th-ie roacs,
has been paved. There were   bout 2,9C0 Vehicles in Dechuanaland in 1952
of which over half were comniercial. however, this figure does not include
the laLrge nwu-ber of vehicles from South Africa w-hich use the territorial
road system,
12.       Construction and maintenance of the highwayr system are -the responsi-
bility of the F-JD which has been under<staffed in the recent past. Additional
staff l-as been obtained, including an experienced chief engineer, and the
technical competence of the rl.V has been strengthened. Because of the remote-
ness of the Protectorate and the small size of highway works, contractorEs
have not been attracted and the practice has been to construct roads with
departmental forces.
13.       A considerable effort is made to maintain the road system, but
Lecause existing roads have been built to low design standards, road surfaces
do not s-tand up.  .laintenance has also been greatly hampered by lack of funds.
The allocation for 1963-64 is US"'224,000 equivalent. The central repair shop
is well equipped and managed, and field forces are we'l trained, but field
facilities should be expanded and riore maintenance equipmiient is needed for
routine gradiing and graveling.

A. Description
14.       The project consists of three parts:   (i) the design, construction
and reconstruction of three roads totaling 355 miles in length, (ii) bettjer-
ment of the main north-south road and (iii) the strengthening and expans'ion of
the maintenance organization (see Table 1 and map). Tw,ro of the roads in Lhe
first part of the project are relatively sthort sections in the eastern part
of the territory.  The first will improve the road from Vleischfontein on the
border of the Repub:Lic of South Africa to Gaberones, the proposed capitaL,
whlle the second wiLl replace the existirg road between the town of Serowe
and the r9ilheacd at Palapye.
15.       The third road will imorove the existing connection between Francis-
to7Tn a.nd. Maun, the main east-west link across the territo7r. This work wTill
include the paving of the two-mile sections from Francistown to the airport,
the reconst;L.uction of the present gravel road frorm tne airport to Nata, and "he
construction of a new road from Nata to Iiaun on 'oractically a new alignment.
As the latteBr sect-on consists only or a graded track, there will be litlle or
no loss in abandoning it.
16.       Tile three roads will be built to the design standards shown in Table
2. These standards have been selected on the basis of the traffic densities
anticipated for each road over the forieseeable future. While it is not pos-
sible to predict traffic densities accurately a long period ahead at the ver-y
early stage in the develonment of a country such as B_chuanalnnd. the figures
shown in Table 3 indicate the order of magnitude of trafi'ic anticipated ioon
comlpl etion of the proj.ect.  The project roads n tri11 be bui' lt w.^.ith all-weather
gravel surfaces, The Gaberones-border road in the area of Gaberones and the
Franc-istowan~-arport section of the prarncisto w-MIun road Twi ll he paved, l;he
justification for which is the anticipated traffic for the forrmier and actlual
traffic for the latter. *From the +lrporttoNata, the existing road .-1:L be
rebuilt to a standard two-lane width, whi'le from NIata to ivaun the road will be
built to lower s    aue               t'e  o  inL +raf  r' afte  at\n  The

19.       The last IDA mission to Bechuanal.and particularl.y noted the large
number of deficiencies in the main north-south road, and the betterment so-heme
was prepared at its suggestion.  A list of needed improvem1ents was drawn up on
the basis of a detailed survey by thLe PWD. Improvements were divided into three
categories, and only the top category has been included in the project.
20.       The third part of the project is designed to strengthen the exiSting
maintenance organization by expanding the existing facilities, purchasing ad-
ditional equ:ipment, and training field personnel. The Aork will include the
expansion of rcad maint,enance depots to provide living quarters where none
presently exist and to install service station facilities for RID equipmenat.
Some houising and other building structures will be provided from stocks a:L-
readv eydstin^g within the Territory, .with any shortfall being met from budget
funds.
21.       Maintenance equipment to be purchased will include trucks, loaders
and graders to permil; morefrequent grading, shaping and. resurfacing of gravel
roads. The training program is already in operation with exnatriate staf; and
is designed to train maintenance personnel and thus insure that the new roads
will be properly maintained. The final item in the maintenance part is the
drilling of about 50 bore-holes alongside the project roads and the provision

and maintenance parts ,  s TU'T.6 AmilliJon e.-J-ven     -A i       -A
given in Table 4.
23.       The estimate incl.udes an allowance of about 15% for design and super--
vision oL the constr-Uction par-t.  This alowanUce is sJieliat Jarger tILan Usual
because of the need for extensive field surveys and investigations particularly
on the Nata-1Haun section of thte road. .Also on low-standard roads the engi.reerui
cost tends to be a la.rger proportion of overall cost than on roads built to
higher standards. An additional allovance of l0iv has been added to the Iho'le
iroject for contingencies.  This amount is considered adequate in view of the
advanced stage of preparation of pians which nas permitted a mare accurate
estimate of quantities and costs.
24,       The! cost estimate is considered to be sound. It was prepared partly
by consultants and partly by the PND an(i is based on information obtained in
the fie'Ld.  Unit costs were obtained for si.milar work in the adjoining Repub]ic
of South Africa and in somne cases derived from construction of experimental
sections in Bechuanaland.  Construction costs per i-dle for the gravel roacs in
the project range from about US$,00U to utU$l3,50t equivalent.
25.       The fcreign. component of the total cost of the project is estimated
by the PWD at, aDproximately 35%.  It is based on the necessity of impurting
all equipment and supplies, employing expatriate staff to design and supervise
the work and importing skilled labor to operate construction equipment.  The
supporting data on which the estimate iis based are considered reasonable



- 5 -
because of the low common labor content in the construction Dart of the project
as the type of work involved calls for the almost ex;clusive use of equipment.
26.       The Goverrment's contribution will be provided from the territorial
budget, which includes grants-in-aid from t,he United Kingdom, and by the Uinited
Kingdom's Colorlial Development and Uelare (CD&W) allocations. It is proposed
that the corbined contributions to project financing from these sources should
amount to U'$1 million ($0.7 million f:rom the budget and $0.3 million from
CDi&W)), representing about 22% of the total project costs, and that the Aasso-
ciation provide the balance with a crediit of US$3.6 million equivalent.  The
Government and the IJ.K. have confinned that (i) funds will be made available
as reciuired to meet nontrantorq' 2nn supl>r:liers' hillings and (ii? any ad--
ditional funds needed over the present estimate to complete the project will
be provi ded.
27.       Constrct-ion wiP b   caried out under unit rice contrac-s le     on
the basis of' international competitive bidding.  Final plans have already been
completed on the Serowe=?al apye road so that a contract for th,is work can be

on te re,alnng r,^dsand -Pinal pl]ans are now under preparation. .Qeuins

30.       T'he execution of the mainteniance part is straightforward as an, adequai
central repair shop is already available, and the PWD staff includes a group of
qualified rmLaintenance personnel. The budgetary provision for iaainteinanc.e for
i963/64 has been increased over the amrount for 1962/63. The Goverrnment has
indicated its intention of continuing to increase maintenance allocatiors as

IV.   EJCUI'KULC JU STMIfCA TION
A. General
31.       The proposed project is essentially the transport sector of Bechuana-
land's 1963-68 Development Plan as prepared by the Government of Bechuanaland
and reviewed by the 'United Kingdom. Transport is the second largest sector of
the Plan after education.
32.       The importance given to roads in the Development Plan is based to a
considerable extent on the findings and recormiendations of an Economic Stu'vey
Mission appointed in 1959 by the United Kingdom in consultation with the ]3ank,
and of a FAO mission which in 1963 made a thorough investigation of Bechuana-
land's livestock industrv. This indust:rv is by far the most i:mportant one in
the territory, accounting for about 85- of total exports and a similar pro-
portion of total emolonment. The FAO mission found that the developinent of
roads was the single most important step for the further development of the
livestock industry.
33.       Specificallyv its recommendation was as follows:  ".An intezrated rcad
system is an urgent need as a first prerequisite for real expansion and develop--
ment. Such a system will dio much. not only to expand production. but alsc to
assist in the redistribution of cattle from the overstocked and overgrazed.
areas of the Eastern and Northe.-n Orote-c,orate. Tt -oiuld also make rcad
transporting of livestock feasible, thlus doing away with the -undesirable and
uneconomic trekking cf nattle over long &istannes   Thiq condition for ex-
pansion cannot be over-emphasized and it is strongly recomnended that all
nossible sources o.' outsidrle 2ndi i nternstI onq1 fuinds he exP-n1ncrP_ for this
purpose."

to h-r FAO and. discussed m.ore  c r- ,cl -%r bhc1 '  but  r I ' - t r  a   reduc
transport costs for     existing and future traffic, The estif-fmte of future

can be expected for each road section, as well as the general development of

35.       D-Lur:.ng LUe jas'. t~en y-ears, nationa± inc1cuiI has ±ncreaaed susal~a
as indicated by the growth in exports of nearly 5$ annually and in governm-ent
revenues of nearly 7`. Under the 1963-63 Development Plan a mrrore ra-oid in-
crease is anticipated.  In most countries, the growth of traff'ic exceeds thle
grorTth of nat:ionai income; however, because of the very Low stage oI develop-
ment of the Bechuanaland economy and the considerable margirn of error in tile
available statistics, it is conservatively assumea that traffic after the first
full year of operation in 1968 will increase by only 4% annaJally in the first
10 years, and 2- thereafter.  The life of the investmrent has oeen conservatively
assumed to be 20 years.



36.       The reduction in transport costs from the road improvements has been
arrived at by adjusting the operating c;osts on bituminous roads by the results
of investigations carried out lately b- the United Kingdom Road Research Labo-
ratory into operating costs on all types of surfaces in similar territories,
particularly Central Africa. These studies show, for exaraple, that the
operating costs of a truck are generally about 25% higher on a gravel than on a
bitwuxinous suriace road and 5u%o higher on an earth surface. The savings from
reduced transport costs have been applied fully to the existing traffic but
only one half of them to the traffic generated by the road improvements on the
assumption that this type of traffic is induced proportionally to the amoulnt
of reduction in operating costs.
37.       The rates of return on tUre investments in the three major roads, from
both the increased benefits from livrestock production and savings in transport
costs, range from about 8 to 25c; a weighted average would be about 17%.   While
these figures can on:ly indicate orders of magnitude, the returns are satisfac-
tory in a country li:ke Bechuanaland. especially since they are based on con-
servatiLve assumptions and are limited to those benefits which can reasonably
be expressed in monetary terms.
B. Gaberones-Border Road
38.       The justification for this short section arises from the Governirent's
decision to Move the country's capital from Mafeking, which is actually out-
side Bechuanaland, to Gaberones. It has become increasingly difficult an(d
expersive to administer Bechuanaland from Mafeking and orderly constitutional
develoi-ment and unif:ication of the country require a capital wit;hin the country,
39.       After the relocation of the Government, the Gaberones-Border road will
be the main connection with Johannesburg. the nearest large industrial and ccm-
mercial center in the South African Republic, and with Pretoria, the adminiis-
trative capital.  Jolhannesburg is also the nearest international air terptinal.
Tfaking into account primarily the diversi-n of traffic now going via Mafekiag,
the Government excects the traffi r. on the rflherones-Rorder roadr to incr,;se fron
25 vehicles per day :in 1962 to 150 vehicles by 1968 when the capital will have
been established there.  The rate o:f return from reduced transoort costs alone
is estimated at about 10%.
C. Palapye-Serowe Road
40       This road of 33 miles forms a major link between Serowe, the largeEt
town in Bechuanalnnd and the tribal c2-pifta:! of the BaRtnmwaton and the railhead
at Palapye. Serowe's population is 50,o00. Recent counts taken by the Govern-
ment show a traffic drensity of over 50 vercles e. rnr dy   f  which over 50  are
trucks and buses. Traffic on the existing road is restricted during the wet
season by waoh,'JLtoa  f al fl.Uditng af  :river cV4--  o ng, so th,at an, ai..lvwca.lter
road is urgently needed.
41.       Serowe is the center of a large cattle ranching district, and improved
access -will encourage e         o              industry.  Agri-ul   e i a

from subsistence farming to cash crop production. A -cod road will facilitate
the rmovemenit of farm suPplies and c-.-op produce and a more effective utilization
of agricultural extersion services.  The rate of return froia reduced transport
costs alone would be about 8>.
D. Francisto7n--Iaun Road
42.       The Francistoi-m4aun iLoad, ex-tending 305 miles, accounits for nearly
two-thirds of the rozid construction program and for- nearly one-half of the
project.  The FAO mission gave it the h-ichest priovity.  The road forms the
only link between the railhead at Franc:Lstow.in, the northern Cror.n Tands, and
Ngamiland, and serves a population of about 'C,OCO people spread over a large
area.  This includes the Okavango Swamps, a regoan vihich Las a large potertial
as a water supply for- the dry areas to tlie south, and settlaiiient areas arounid
Hata, 0diakl.e and Bushlan Pits.  The e:--istinz sr-nd-, track between Nata and
I4aun (185 miles) is not negotiable exccpt to special vehicles at a high cost
and it is not an all-weather road. The traffi.c po-,;enti.al is corsiderablyr
greater tihan the actual traffic densities indicate.  Until a re?iable trans-
portation link can be provided, t-he develorpmert of the northiern Crown Lands an.^
OCamiland, which are among the bes t cattle arcas in Bechuanalancd, w.ill he se-
verely restricted.  There are at present hardly any.r incentives to raise pro-
duction above su..1sistance reeds but the 1963-6d Uevelor.ment i'lan -ives a tigh
priority to the Jevelopr.:ent of the Crown Lands.
43.       The area to be served by the proposed road con `ains a large number o0
cattle, estim-ated to be in the order of ThC,OCO head.  Present sales fron A:-am -
land and Botletle Districts, wThich have been increasing in recent years, ran,e
from 10,000 to 12,000 head per year, or about 7-8%b of the total stock.  Tihe
traditional market for this is Southern  h-Iodesia and the cattle are treldked on
hoof across the border.  Prices paid b'- traders are low and losses in quality
and in stock are heavy.
44.       The main purpose of the Francistown-Iaun roae. is to move these cattl
eastward b-y truck to the ra.ilhead at .rancistown for siinriient e-ther to the
Lobatsi abattoir or to Southern Phodes a.   Under presernt conditions, cattle
oannot stand the rigors of the long trek until they are six or more years olDc
Given access with trucks, the cattle could be transpoited to railhead a-t least
two years earlier.  This factor, together with tne incentive oI nigner pri Ces
(see paragraph 47), sh.ould significantly increase sales.  I..ni.le any qvtantitatilre
estimates must be approxi-mate because of uncertainties, includ irg that of ou-a-
breaks of foot and mouth disease, it could be expected that sales would increase

annual sales from Ngamiland and Botletle districts by somre 5,000 to 5,C00 head
after about five years. Cattle transported by road would also be of better
quality.  The transnort of these 15,000 to 13,000 cattlTe alone iwTould involve an
average daily traffic of abotut 10 trucks, or abeo0t one ha.f of Lhe estimated
total' increase in traffic on the ITata-Iiaun road section.

Furthermore, the implementation of schlemes in the Developmnent Plan to support
thie livestock industry, such as a watering point program, a cattle fattening
schemile, and the opening up of the northern Crown Lands for settlement by cattle-
men, would depend largely on satisfactory transportation. If properly imple-
mented, these measures would considerably increase the cattle stoclkng capacity
of the region served by this road. However, this future benefit has not been
taken into account in the cuantitative justification for the road.
46.       Most of the increase in production would be marketed at the Lobatsi
abattoir or in Southern Rhodesia. Ihe Lobatsi abattoir has a capacity of
100,000 head per year, to be expanded in thie near future to 150,000, and
Southern Rhodesia at present purchases from 15,000 to 30,000 head annually
under a quota.
47.       Farmers will derive substantial benefits from being able to market
their cattle through the existing Bechuanaland beef marketing arrangements.
Prices paid to Ngamiland farmers for cattle sold to traders for the Rhodesian
market generally have not exceeded I, 12 per head.  Improved transport will
re-direct thi.s cattle trade eastward to the railhead in Francistown where sales
of cattle are controlled by the Lobatsi abattoir and prices paid average about
N 22 per head of cattle. Farmers would have to pay trucking costs, which from
Ngamiland are estimated at about E 2-3 per head. On the basis of the prcsent
annual sales of 10,000 to 12,000 head - i.e. without assuming any increase in
annual cattle! sales - the increase in the net annual income of cattle producers,
after allowirg for trucking exDenses, would be in the order of L 70,000 to
b 80,000.
48.       The road appears to be fully justified economically. The return on
the investment in the road from reduced transport costs and higher prices for
cattle sales at the present volume would, be in the order of 20%. If cattle
s>]es increase as anticip_ted in aragraph )I anri t.raffir inr-rc-qq  as an-
ticipated in paragraph 35, the rate of return would be about 25%. These are
satisfac-tor  returtns, erPi rly since possible fuvrther increases in cattle
production discussed :in paragraph h5 and such important benefits as improved
nzm.in"isbrative efficiencyJ and t.e provision of a road link for territorial unity
are not included in thie calculation.
