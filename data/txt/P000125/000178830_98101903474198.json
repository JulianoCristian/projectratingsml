It will consists of three parts: (i) the\n            design, construction and reconstruction of three roads\n            totaling 355 miles in length, (ii) betterment of the main\n            north-south road; and (iii) the strengthening and expansion\n            of the highway maintenance organization. The first component\n            will improve the road from Vleischfontein on the border of\n            the Republic of South Africa to Gaberones, while the second\n            will replace the existing road between the town of Serowe\n            and the railhead at Palapye. The project will lead to\n            economic development, and reduce transport cost for existing\n            and future traffic of a primarily agricultural economy."}, "docdt": "1964-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
