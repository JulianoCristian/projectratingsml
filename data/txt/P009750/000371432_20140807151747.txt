                                     HIGHLIGHTS



         Loan 1648-IN of US$ 50 million and Credit 374-IN of US$ 200 million was
for the implementation of the first phase of the Ramagundam2100 MV development
located in KarimnagarDistrictof Andhra Pradesh in the vicinityof the South
GodavariCoal field, just near to Pochampadreservoiron the river Godavari. It
consistedof civil works, electrical   works, mechanicalworks includingthree 670
tonnes per hour boilers and three 200 MW turbo generatingunits as well as an
associated400-kV transmissionsystem - around 1,070 km of lines and several
substations. The Projectwas the Bank Group's third lendingoperationwith the
NTPC, the beneficiaryand the implementing  agency. The corporation  was
established approximately three years prior to this operation,for the purpose
of constructingand operatinglarge thermal power projectsin the central sector
and distributing power so generatedto the State ElectricityBoards (SEBs).

         As per the Staff AppraisalReport the projectwas to be completedby
June 1984 and the credit and loan closed by December,'4985. However,because of
initial delay in the placementof orders for main plant equipmentthe project
was not completeduntil December,1984 and the credit and loan were not closed
until June 1987 as a result of late retentionpaymentsnotably for spare parts.
The Projectwas completedat a cost of Rs. 7,070.7million which is about 611
higher than the originalcost estimateof Rs. 4,395 million. However in US
dollarsvalue the actual project cost is estimatedat US$ 693.4 million which is
only about 35.7Z higher than the originalesitmateof US$ 511.0 million. The
bulk of this increase  is due to (i) higher than anticipated    increases in the
price of equipment and material;    (ii) customs duty for which allowances were not
made in the appraisalreport; (iii) change in the scope of the project to cover
the cost of trial  and pre-commissioning   procedures; and (iv) changes in the
foreign exchangerate.

             The Project was completed satisfactorily         and is generating   much needed
electricity      in the Southern Power Region.        Several measures were taken to
mitigate     the adverse impact on the environment         and resettlement   of oustees. In
additionto completingthe project satisfactorily,               NTPC initiatedimprovements
on its own accord which are having, and will continueto have, beneficiaryspin-
offs. These include a new controland instrumentation               package, a contract
management system,a rapid coal loading system for unit trains, concept of
quality     assurances       and of design, supply and erection   type packaging for
auxiliaries,       satellite     communication system for data and information     flows
between various projectsand its CorporateOffice, etc. NTPC needs to be
commendedfor these initiatives             and for completing the construction    of the
project in almost the identical            time as was envisagedby the appraisalreport
despite several site related infrastructural            constraints.

         The financialperformance  of NTPC has been satisfactory. During
FY82-88,the rates of return on averagenet fixed assets in operationhave
exceededthe estimatescontainedin the Staff AppraisalReport. NTPC1s debt
equity ratio and debt serviceratios have also been satisfactory  and at the end
of FY88 were 43s57 and 3.9, respectively.NTPC has also increasedsubstantially
and diversifiedits resourcemobilization   for financingof the future projects.
NTPC's collectionof its accountsreceivables   during its first six years of
operationshowever,has been a growingproblem. In spite of effortsmade by
NTPC, the level remainedequal to the equivalentof more than four months sales
revenuesat the end of PY88. The Governmentis currentlymaking additional
efforts to reduce the level to the equivalentof the sales' revenue of the last
two months, as requiredby the Bank's covenantincludedin recent lending
operations.

         Bank Group involvement throughoutthe project and subsequentBank Group
operationshave continuedto provideNTPC the impetusand assistanceneeded to
assume a substantially larger role in the power sub-sectorthan was envisagedat
the time it was established. Bank Group supporthowever will still be needed to
enable NTPC to implementits expandedinvestment   program and develop into a
financially mature utility. In addition,the impact to the sector,through NTPC
operationswhich have reducedpower shortages,supportedthe application    of new
technology, and introduced, althoughnot yet successful,  commercialand
financialdiscipline,  have proven to be more successfulthan previousoperations
with centrai institution.

                            I. INTRODUCTION


1.01     Power shortagesof the 1970's and the adverse effect these were
having on the productivesectorsof the economy promptedthe Governmentof
India (GOI) to intensifyits efforts to balance the demand and supply of
electricity. This was to be achievedwithin the context of GOI-os  overall
strategyfor the energy sectorwhich was formulatedin responseto increase
in the international price of oil to reduce the country'sdependenceon
importedliquid hydrocarbons  and ease the burden on its balance of
payments. Accordingly,  emphasiswas accordedin the power sub-sectorto
Ci) acceleratingthe development  of the hydro power potentialand large
coal fire power plants at both pithead locationsand in the proximityof
load centres;(ii) improvingthe efficiencyof thermalpower plants and
reducinglosses in the transmission  and distribution networks;
(iii)expandingthe rural electrification   program;and (iv) strengthening
the organizational and managementcapabilities  of the State Electricity
Boards (SEB's),as well as, augmentingtheir generatingcapacitythrough
the increasedinvolvement  of the CentralGovernmentin the power sub-
sector. The Projectwas formulatedin the context of this strategyand was
an integralpart of the power development  program of the Sixth Five Year
Plan, (FY80-FY85). However,because of the anticipatedlong gestation,it
was actuallyinitiatedtowards the end of the Fifth Five Year Plan
(FY74-FY79).i/ (Para.2.01)

Power Subsector21

1.02     Accordingto the Constitution and the Electricity(Supply)Act,
1948, (the Act), the power subsectoris within the concurrentjurisdiction
of the Central and State Governmentsand, until 1974, it involvedthe
followingfour agencies:the SEBs, the RegionalElectricityBoards (REBs),
the Central Electricity Authority (CEA)and the Rural Electrification
Corporation(REC). Under the Act, SEBs were assignedthe responsibility
for the generation,transmission and distribution of electricitywithin
each state and for the regulationof private licenses. Although SEBs were



1/ The plan was suspendedin FY78.

2/ Data regardingthe supply and consumptionof electricitybetween FY70
   and FY75, and a descriptionof the facilitiesin operationas of 1978
   when the projectwas appraised,are presentedin Annex 1.

supposedto be autonomousin managing their day-to-dayoperations,  in
practicethey are under the purview of the State Governmentsin such
matters as capital investment,tariffs,borrowings,  pay and personnel
policies. REBs were formed during the period 1964-66 by groupingSEBs into
five regionalsystemsto promote coordination. They are also under the
purview of the State Governmentsand their coordinating responsibilities
include overhauland maintenance programs,general schedules,interstate
power transfersand concomitant tariffs.

1.03     The other two agencies, CEA and REC, are under the purview of the
CentralGovernment. CEA was established   in 1950 in the Power Wing of the
CentralWater and Power Commission,  the Ministry of Irrigationand Power,
to formulatenationalpolicy and coordinatethe activitiesof the various
agenciesinvolvedin supplyingelectricity. However,because of
institutional con traints,CEA was unable to carry out its mandate fully.
REC was established in 1969, to coordinatethe expandingrural
electrification program and provide financialas well as technical
expertiseto SEBs for their rural schemes.

1.04     The constraints on CEA's ability to carry out its mandate and the
ad hoc development of the power subsector,togetherwith the shortagesof
electricity ensuing therefrom,inducedGOI to amend the Act to enlarge the
scope and functionsof CEA and address the financialoperationsof the
SEBs. Legislation  was enacted in 1975 to give CEA an effectiveveto over
new investments by SEBs. The amendmentalso covered the establishment   of
generatingcompaniesby the Central and State Governmentsfor the
installation of large power stationsto allow for economiesof scale in
meeting the forecastgrowth of demand. An ordinanceincorporating    the
amendmentsto the general provisionsof the Act was issued and two Central
Sector generatingcompanies,the NationalThermalPower Corporation(NTPC)
- the beneficiary of the Credit - and the NationalHydro Power corporation
 (NHPC)were established.

1.05     NTPC was registered as a governmentowned company under the
Company'sAct, 1956, and is governedby the general provisionsof the
Electricity(Supply)  Act, 1948, as amended,to give the corporation
statutoryrecognition. The initialauthorizedshare capital amountedto
Rs. 1250 million (US$ 140 million). NTPC was to be managed by Board of
Directorsof not less than 4 and not more than 15, some of whom would be
part time. The corporation  was established to design,constructand
operate large thermalpower stationsin the Central sector, and distribute
and sell the power so generatedto the state electricity  boards. NTPC also
was to own and operate,associated400 kV transmission   system, over which
power would be distributed and sold in bulk to SEB's. NTPC's original
development plan providedfor the construction  of four thermalpower
stationseach with an ultimatecapacityof about 2,000 MW. (Para. 2.01).
At the time of appraisal, work had already startedon the first phase of
600 MW development each for the Projectsand Singrauliand Korba (Credits
685-IN, and 793-IN)while the implementation  of a project at Parakka,in
West Bengal,was under coasideration. The Projectnow completed    was for
the developmentof first phase of 600 MW at Ramagundamwith associated400
                                            -3-




kV AC transmissionsystem. It was envisagedthat NTPC would also take over
the operationof the Governmentowned 300 MW BadarpurPower Stationnear
Delhi.

1.06     In 1978, when the projectwas appraised,  NTPC had made good
progressin buildingup the organization   since 1976 by fillingkey
positions. A competentadministrator  with wide experiencein the formation
and development of large industrialundertakings  and in the constructionof
factoriesand the manufactureof generatingfacilities    had been appointed
as the Chairmanand ManagingDirector. The Board of Directorshad also
been constituted. The principledepartments   had been establishedincluding
the mechanicaland electricaldesign departments,   which togetherformed the
plant and equipmentengineering  grcip, the civil design and systems
engineering departments, which formed the civil and systemsengineering
group, and the operationservicesdepartment. The number of staff
appointedas on March 31, 1978 was 454.

Bank Group Involvements

1.07        Prior to the Project,the Bank had made eight loans to India for
power projectsamountingto US$ 284.5 million and IDA ten credits totalling
US$ 796 million. Of the total amount,US$ 620.5 million had financedthe
construction     of generatingplants,US$ 23 million had financedthe purchase
of construction       equipmentfor the Beas hydro-electric   project,US$ 380
millionwas used on projectsfor high voltage transmission,            and US$ 57
million was for rural electrification.         Nine loans and credits   for
generating    plants,    the Beas Project (Credit 89-IN) and the first three
Power Transmission       Projects (Loan 416-IN, Credits 242-IN and 377-IN) had
been completed. The Fourth Transmission         Power Project (Credit604-IN)was
under implementation;       approximately US$ 94 million of the credit amount of
US$ 150 million had been committedup to September,1978. The Korba and
Trombay Thermal Power Projects (Credit783-IN and Loan 1549-IN),            which were
approvedin April 1978, were still in preliminary         implementation    stages.
Commitments    on November30, 1978 totalledUS$ 104 million on Singrauli
Project (Credit685-IN) and US$ 55.2 million on the Rural Electrification
Project    (Credit 572-IN).

1.08     The ongoinggenerationand transmission  power projectsand the
rural electrification projectswere proceedingsatisfactorily,
notwithstanding initial delays in implementationand in the preparationof
specification notably for more sophisticatedload dispatchequipmentin the
case of the Fourth Power Transmis3ion Project (Cr. 604-IN). The Singrauli
and Korba projectsthough in the early stages of implementation, were also
proceedingsatisfactorily.The projectwas the Bank Group'sthird lending
operation with NTPC.

the commissioning of new capacity associated with the load forecast was set
at 19,666 MW consisting of 13,846 MW of thermal, 5,130 MW of hydro and 690
MW of nuclear capacity.3/   Most of the thermal capacity was to be coal
fired with emphasis on large power stations whose ultimate capacity could
reach about 2,000 MW. Feasibility studies for five such developments were
completed in 1974. The responsibility for constructing and operating four
of these power stations-one at Singrauli in Uttar Pradesh, one at Korba in
Madhya Pradesh, one at Ramagundam in Andhra Pradesh and one at Parakka in
West Bengal-wtasassigned to NTPC. GOI's formal request for Bank Group
assistance in financing the development at Ramagundam, described in
Annex 3, was received in January 1987. The development which was to be
implemented in two stages consisted of three 200 MW and three 500 MW
generating units along with associated 400 kV transmission system for the
evacuation of power. The Project consisted of the first phase (three 200
MW units) of this development.

2.02     The Project was prepared by NTPC and appraised by the Bank Group
in April/May, 1978 and negotiations were held in Washington in December
1978. As NTPC had made significant progress in strengthening its in-house
technical capabilities, during the execution of Singrauli and Korba
projects, it was agreed during negotiations that the corporation would
prepare the basic engineering and preliminpr: design for the Project and
would appoint consultants satisfactory to the Bank to (i) review deviations
from earlier power stations designs and (ii) assist NTPC as necessary in
the design and preparation of specifications for the power station. NTPC
was also to appoint consultants, satisfactory to the Bank, to assist as
required in the design and supervision of construction of 400 kV
transmission lines.

Project Objectives

2.03     The primary objective of the project was to provide NTPC the
impetus and assistance needed to assume its envisaged role, including the
alleviation of power shortages in the Southern Power Region of the country.
In addition, it was to assist GOI in achieving its objective of further
advancing the regional and ultimately the national integration of the power
subsector.

Project Description

2.04     The Project involved the first phase of the Ramagundam development
and consisted of:

         (a)   civil works comprising acquisition of land, construction of
               roads, culverts, railways and other miscellaneous preliminary
               works, power station and residential buildings, plant



31 The original program for expansion of gencrating capacity during the
    Sixth Five Year Plan differs slightly from the actual program as
    presented in Annex 2.

               foundations,canals, ducts, cooling towers and other works
               associatedwith the circulatingwater system;

          (b) three 670 ton/hr boilers and three 200 MW steam turbo
              generatingunits completewith all auxiliariesand ancillary
              electricaland mechanicalequipmentand the switchyard;  and

          (c) the 400 kV AC transmission system comprisingseveral single
              circuit lines (i) Ramagundam-Hyderabad (198 km),
              (ii) Hyderabad-Nagarjunsagar (127 km), (iii)Nagarjunsagar-
              Cuddapah (282 km), (iv) Cuddapah-Bangalore (230 km), and
              (v) Cuddapah-Redhills (232km) and several 400 kV
              substations.

2.05      The site of the Ramagundamdevelopment      of 2,100 MW is in
KarimnagarDistrictof Andhra Pradesh,South of Godavaricoal fields. The
site selection   was based on the ready availability     of coolingwater, coal
and transportation    facilities. Coal for the power stationwas to comie      from
South Godavaricoal fields of the Singarani       collieries,located some 15 km
from the proposedpower stationsite. Coolingwater for the projectwas to
be drawn from the right bank irrigation     canal from the Pachampad dam
located 100 kw, up-stream of the power station,     and the water intake
structure  on the irrigationcanal was 10 km from the project area. The
project was selected    as a logicalslice of the overall development      which on
economic and engineering    considerations  could operate as an independent    and
viable project   in the event that construction    of the remaining units
(aggregating   1,500 MW) was delayedor deferred.


                              III. IMPLEMENTATION


Credit and Loan Effectiveness

3.01    The credit and loan were made effectiveon May 4, 1979 following
executionof the subsidiaryloan agreementbetweenGOI and NTPC.

Project Execution

3.02     The Projectwas executedsatisfactorily,   but because of an initial
delay of about seven months in the placementof orders for the main plant
equipmentall three generatingunits were commissioned   later than
originallyplanned. However,the construction    time taken by all the three
generatingunits was less than that envisagedin the construction   schedule
of 48 months, from the placementof orders, for the first unit and at an
intervalof six months each thereafterfor the subsequent   units, thereby
considerably reducingthe extent of delays that took place in the award of
contract. In retrospect,  the above delays could have been anticipatedif
adequateallowancehad been made in the appraisalreport implementation
schedulefor the site related infrastructural  constraintsand the time
requiredfor either review of bid documents  by consultantsas well as by
                                    -6-




the Bank or completionof bids evaluationby NTPC (para 3.11). The Project
also benefittedfrom the conceptof quality assuranceand of design, supply
and erectiontype of packagingfor auxiliarysystemswhich was introduced
for the first time in the countryby NTPC. tPara.8.03).

3.03     The Project site, which is located in a remote under-developed
area of Karimnagardistrictof Andhra Pradesh,was lacking in
infrastructural facilitiesas well as in basic civic amenitiessuch as
drinkingwater, residential  accommodation,etc. It was throughplanning
and perseverancethat these constraints were overcome.

3.04     As in the case of the Singrauliand Korba projectseffortswere
made at the design stage itself to increasethe safety,reliability  and
availability of power plants and thereby increaseperformance of the units
by the introduction of the followingcontrol and instrumentation packages:
(a) automaticturbine run up system, (b) coordinatedcontrol system,
(c) centralized steam and water analysissystem, (d) uninterruptable power
supply system, (e) analog control system, and (f) computerizedon-line data
acquisitionsystem. In additionto the above systems,a micro processor
base burner managementsystem and a new design and equipmentfor storing
and evacuatingthe bottom ash in place of the conventional scrapper
conveyer system,were used for the first time in NTPC to improveplant
performance.

3.05    During the constructionand erectionstages of the project also,
the following                were also faced by NTPC:
             major constraints

       (i) the rocky nature of earth in the area requireda large
           amount of blastingto be carried out;

      (ii) a temporaryash pond had to be constructedto meet the
           commissioningschedules as a result of land acquisition
           problems;

     (iii) the water treatmentplant packagewas ordered from a
                                             went into
           West German firm which subsequently
           liquidation; and

      (iv) the power receivingsystem from the Andra Pradesh SEB,
           one of the beneficiariesof power from the Project,was
           delayed;as a result units were initiallysynchronized
           through the 33 kV system.


3.06       A well defined field plan, adequatequalitychecks during the
erectionand commissioning     stage, and elaboratetesting and commissioning
procedures   enabled the units to operate from the beginning without major
problems. Several minor problemswere correctedby timely action,
including   minor modifications  in design.

Environment,Resettlementand Rehabilitation

3.07     The implementation of the Project,includingthe expansionphase
of 1,500 MW, requiredthe acquisition  of 4,116.0hectares (10,289acres)
resultingin compensation  and/or resettlement of 2,279 familiesaffecting
13 villages. Part of the requiredarea, locatedat about five km from the
plant, was needed for dumping the ash. That area could not be acquired in
due time and thereforea smallertemporaryash pond, closer to the power
station,has been used during the first two years of plant operation. The
initial ash disposalarea has now been completelyfilled up and
rehabilitated with afforestation. The final disposalarea is used at
presentwhere ash is pumped as a slurry, througha pipeline,and water is
drawn away without any detrimental effect on the local ecologicalsystem.
Regardingresettlement,  782 familieshave resettledin dedicatedcolonies
in the neighborhoodof their former dwellingswhere internalroads,
culverts,tubewells,recreationfacilities    and seven shops were also
allottedto oustees in NTPC shoppingcomplex. Details on measures taken
are detailed in Annex 4. AlthoughNTPC providedcivil amenitiesin the
relocationcolonies,including   medical facilities, periodicvisits by
medicialofficersand preventivecheck up, public health is increasingly
deteriorating in the colonies,partly as a result of a larger squatter
settlement which has grown around the area. Also, although 250 oustees
were trained and given employmentby NTPC, and approximately  400 were
employedthroughvarious contractors   working for the project,no employment
opportunities have been providedto about two thirds of the oustees,
because of their low level of skills.

3.08     As a result of this experience with the RamagundamProject,NTPC
is now becomingmore aware of the particularcomplexities   associatedwith
resettlementissues. In recent projects- e.g. the TalcherThermal Power
Project - the approachhas been from the beginningmore comprehensive. In
the case of Singrauli,NTPC is undertaking  an overall EnvironmentImpact
Assessment(EIA), and throughan Action Plan (currently   under preparation),
for environmental protection, resettlement and rehabilitation, NTPC is
taking action to improveas far as possiblethe local human environment.
However, it has to be recognized that there are limits to NTPC's ability to
resolveall the environmental  issues associated with a power development
project and that the local governmentauthoritiesshould be responsiblefor
the public infrastructure needed in the context of a large project
development. NTPC has also taken appropriate  measureswith regard to stack
emissionsand water effluents. They monitor regularlythese aspectsof
environmentprotectionand comply so far fully with environmental   quality
standardsprescribedby the Indian NationalCommitteeon environmental
planningand thereforeno ecological   problemsare envisaged. In addition,
througha continuousafforestation   programmore than 200,000 trees of
various specieshave been planted and this will be expandedin the future,
notably in order to rehabilitate the ash pond area. The amount paid for
land compensation, resettlement facilities and rehabilitation has been
around Rs 144.9 millions.

Reporting

3.09    NTPC met all the Bank's reportingrequirement,submittingon a
regularbasis, quarterlyprogressand annual reports.

Project Cost

3.10     The Projectwas completedat a cost of Rs. 7,070.7millionwhich
is about 61Z higher than the appraisalcost estimateof Rs. 4,395 million.
A detailedcomparisonof the estimatedand actual protect cost is presented
in Annex 5. The actual cost was about 76Z higher than appraisalestimates
for electricaland mechanicalequipment,115? higher for preliminaryand
civil works, about 30Z higher for transmission system. The coal handling
and transportation systemwere however lower by 332 than the appraisal
estimate. Most of these increasesare attributable   to: (i) customs duty
for which allowances were not made in the originalcost estimates,
(ii) increasein the foreign exchangerate for the dollar which went up
from Rs. 8.6 per USS at the time of appraisalto around Rs. 13 per US$ when
the projectwas completed(iii)higher than anticipated    increasein the
price of equipmentand materials,(iv) minor changesin the scope of
Project particularly in the area of civil works, (v) to cover expenses
amountingto Rs. 64.4 million for trial and pre-commissioning,  and
(vi) miscellaneous expenditures for tools and plant instruments. Based on
the amount of contractsin foreigncurrencies(aroundUS$ 130 million), the
direct foreign cost of the project is now estimatedat Rs 1,352 million as
comparedwith only Rs 554.6 million (USS 64.4 million)in the appraisal
estimatesfor the direct and indirectforeigncosts. This substantial
underestimation highlightsthe difficultyin estimatinga priori the share
of foreign and local costs in industrial projectsin India where there is a
strong competition between local and foreign suppliersof equipment. When
consideringthe total projectcost estimatesin dollar value, however, they
amount to respectively US$ 511.0 million in the appraisaland US$ 693.4
actually,resultingin a smallerincrease- 36? - as comparedwith the
above increasein rupee value.

Procurement

3.11     Bank guidelines were strictlyadheredto by NTPC for procurement
of 57 contractsinvolvinginternational   competitive bidding and
representing an amount of Rs 2,780million. Among these 57 contracts
listed in Annex 6, 15 were awarded to foreign firms for an amount estimated
at Rs 1,600 million. The averageprocurement   time per contract- from the
issuanceof bid documentsto contractaward - was nearly one year,
consistingof around 3.6 months for bidding and about 7 - 9 months for bid
evaluation. This latter time is certainlytoo long and constitutes   a major
source of implementation delay. However, some progressin this regard has
been made so far in subsequent projectsundertakenby NTPC (e.g. Farakka
II). NTPC is in the process of finalizing  with the Bank, a standard
bidding documentwhich is expectedto cut down the time lag substantially.
Several contracts were amendedto includeeither supply of spare parts for
                                   -9-




                                                        claims were
equipmentor additionalquantityof material. No significant
raised by bidders.

Disbursement

3.12     The appraisalestimateof disbursement  and actual disbursement are
presentedin Annex 7. Actual disbursement  was slower than the appraisal
estimatemainly because of the initialdelays in the placementof the
orders for the main plant and equipment. As of December31, 1985, the
originaldate for closing the credit, about 86.52 of the funds had been
disbursed,the remaining13.52 representing  paymentswithheld from the
contractorpending the successful completionof performance  and guarantee
test on the main plant, equipmentand supply of spare parts. The closing
date was extendedto June, 1987 and disbursements were eventuallycompleted
by March, 1988.

Performanceof Consultant,Contractors,and Suppliers

3.13    In additionto the review consultants,NTPC had appointed
consultantsfor:

         (a) Detailedengineering of all mechanicalauxiliaries,  part
             of the electricalequipment and civil works of main
             plant, ash handlingsystem,water treatmentplan and
             coolingwater system.

         (b) Development                     system and railway
                        of coal transportation
             siding.

         (c) Detailedengineering of civil works related to balance
             reservoirand ash disposalsystem.

         The performanceof the consultants - representing around 750 man-
months of activities- was satisfactory and their associationwith the
RamagundamProject furtherenhanced  NTPC's capability in detailed
engineering and strengtheningits in-housetechnicalservicesdivision.

3.14     The performanceof contractsand suppliers was also generally
satisfactory. As is to be expectedin a projectof this size, problemsdid
arise during erectionand commissioning. These, however,were addressed
expeditiously by the contractorsand manufacturersconcerned.


                                    PERFORMANCE
                        IV. OPERATING


4.01     As per NTPC's procedures,a generatingunit is declared
commercially operational only after it has been inspected thoroughly
togetherwith the associatedequipmentand has operatedfor a minimum
period of 1.000 hours continuously(withinfour months of the date of
synchronization), carryinga full load for not less than 72 of these hours
                                  -10-




and generatingat an energy equivalentrate of 2,500 kWh per kW per year
during that period. Of the three units comprisingthe project,the first
unit was able to achieve the operatingstandardwithin four months from the
date of synchronization, i.e. within 96 days. However,in the case of the
second and third units, it took 155 days and 138 days respectively to bring
the units into commercialoperation. This was due to initial teething
problems. During the first year of commercialoperation,the second and
third units achieveda plant load factor 64.02 and 77.8Z respectively,
which comparesfavorably  with the load factor of 63? envisagedin the
appraisalreport. The first howeverwas able to achieve a load factor of
only 49.4Z during the same period primarilydue to teethingproblemswhich
eventuallyhave been resolvedenablingthe unit to achievea plant load
factor of respectively of 66.92, 86.35? and 87.25X in the followingthree
years. Highlightsof the operatingperformance    of the three units are
presentedin Annex 8.

4.02     Although the performanceof all the three units comparesfavorably
with the expectations of the appraisalreport, some of the main plant
equipmentand auxiliariesrequirefurther improvement   to iLchievefull
stabilityand i liabilityfor base load operations. Specifically   NTPC
intendsto:

         (a) increasethe spare capacityof coal mills,

         (b) installan additionaloil seal near the primary air fan
             bearing in order to protectthe fan,

         Cc) take specialdesign measures for early detectionof ash
             build up in furnace,

         'd) improvethe design of low and high pressureheaters to
             eliminateleakages,and

                                     plugs in the motors of cooling
         (e) provide anti-condensation
             towers.

4.03     Fuel for the projectwas to be suppliedfrom the South Godavari
Coal Fields of the SingraniCollieriesLtd. As NTPC has no control over
its development, assurances had been obtainedfrom the coal company that it
will take all necessarysteps to make availableadequatecoal supplies for
the efficientoperationof the three 200 MM units. The companyhas
compliedwith its commitments,  despite initial delays in the implementation
of the coal loading facilities at the mine. The effect of this delay on
generationwas minimal as alternative  arrangementswere made to meet the
initialrequirements  of coal. The qualityof coal suppliedto the power
plant was only marginallybetter than envisaged,but the price paid for it
by NTPC was substantially higher than originallyestimated. The
Corporation was allowed to pass on these higher fuel costs to beneficiary
SEBs throughhigher tariffs. (Para.5.02).

                          V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE


5.01     As per the agreement,NTPC was to sell power from the project to
SEBs in the SouthernRegion4/under bulk supply contractssatisfactory   to
the Bank and GOI was to ensure that all necessarystepswere taken to
obtain an undertaking from respectiveState Governmentsto purchase,in the
aggregate,not less than 85Z5/ of output of power from the Project. GOI
and NTPC have compliedwith their commitmentdespitean initial delay in
the ratification of the bulk supply contractsprecipitated, in part, by the
absence of a blueprint for establishing multi-partycontractsfor the
exchangeof power. NTPC's operatingand financial   performance, however,
was not adverselyaffectedby this delay.

5.02      NTPC's actual and projectedfinancialstatementsfor the period
FY83-FY88are presentedin Annexes 9 to 11. The most salient featureof
NTPC's operationsduring the period FY84-FY88is the spectacular        growth the
corporation  experienced. While net fixed assets in operationtripled,
sales of electricity    increasedalmost five-fold. Even more strikingis the
high level of investmentin projectsunder construction.Work-in-progress
at the end of the period was almost twice as large as that of assets in
operation. This reflectsthe continuation        of a highly accelerated
expansion program which, in turn, explainswhy the self-financing       ratio
remained modest during the period, representing      only 5.82 of the total
financing requirements,    despite the reasonable   rates of return achieved
(around 162 in the last three years, well in excess of those projected       in
the appraisalreport,and much higher than the 9.5X requiredunder the loan
as a target for FY89). Debt servicecoveragewas very comfortable         during
the period because repaymentof debt startedonly in FY89. Current ratio,
which was below one during the earlierpart of the period improvedto 1.6
by FY86. However,a closer look at the working capitalpositionof NTPC
reveals,startingin FY83, a very unsatisfactory        collectionperformance.
Under recent loans, a covenantwas introducedthat requiresthat NTPC's
receivablesshould not exceed the equivalentof two months of sales.
Although,NTPC made strenuousefforts to reduce the level of receivables
over the past few years, from 7.5 months in 1982-83 to 3.3 months in
1988-89,NTPC has not compliedwith it and the Bank has requestedand
agreed during the negotiations     of the proposedRegionalPower Systems
Project (PY90) the implementation     of an Action Plan that is expected to
correct the situation. Sales in the last three years were lower than those
projectedin the staff appraisalreport because of delays in completing
projects,often as a result of slow initialprocurement. In addition,the
time requiredto bring units into commercialoperation,after their
installation,  was not taken into consideration     in the appraisalreport.



4/ Power from the projectwas to be sold in bulk to the State Electricity
   Boards of Andhra Pradesh,Karnataka,Tamil Nadu, Kerala and the
   Electricity Departmentof Goa.

5/ The remaining15Z was to be sold in accordancewith prioritiesto be
   determinedby GOI.

l1 On averagehistoricalfixed assets in operation.


5.03     The AppraisalReport'sf'.nancial  forecastsanticipatedthat NTPC
would eventuallyachieve and maintain from FY89 onwards (the first year in
which the 2,100 MW Singraulipower stationwas expectedto be in full
commercialoperation)a rate of return of not less than 9-1/2Z on the
originalcost of its averagenet fixed assets in service. As shown above,
actual rates of return were considerably higher than forecast. This was
partly because of the introduction of higher than forecasttariffs (see
table below), and partly due to higher than expectedplant load factor
achievedat NTPC stationsthan the targets set in the appraisalreport.
NTPC's averageplant load factor increasedfrom 58? in FY85 to about 74? in
FY86, to 79.6Z in FY87 and 75.6? in FY88 at the Ramagundam,Korba, Farakka
and Singraulipower stations. The early stabilization   of the Ramagundam
200 MW units, increasedavailability  of the Singrauli units (both 200 and
500 MW) and a sustained high level of performance of Korba units (both 200
and 500 MW), were the main reasons for this performance.

5.04     During the FY83-PY88period, NTPC financedabout half of its rapid
growth by borrowing. GOI funded about 602 of NTPC's totai.requirements,
three quartersof it through equity contributions and the balance as loans
includingassistancefrom the World Bank. Through GOI, the Bank financed
Rs 14.6 billion on about 22X of NTPC's requirements. GOI's loans have a
total maturity of 20 years, including5 years of grace and an i'terest
 whichhas changed over time and currentlyis 152 p.a. It is interesting  to
note that NTPC floatedbonds in the domesticmarket in three public issues
and three private placements,for a total of about Rs 16.8 billion
(US$1,122 million at current exchangerate). In addition,NTPC has raised
funds in Japan through a syndicateof banks and financialinstitutions.
Finally,NTPC has receivedfinancingfrom the OPEC Fund, the Saudi Fund,
KfW, the Governmentsof the United Kingdom,USSR, Sweden, Norway, Italy,
and most recently,untied funds from Japan.

5.05     NTPC was requestedto furnishto IDA and the Bank, not later than
seven months after the end of each fiscal year, certifiedcopies of its
financialstatementsand a copy of the auditor'sreports. NTPC has
compliedwith this requirement.


                     VI. INSTITUTIONAL
                                     DEVELOPMENT


6.01     As noted, the credit and loan were the Bank Group's third lending
operationwith NTPC which itselfhad been establishedless than four years
prior to that operation. The institutional  objectivesof the credit and
loan thereforewere to providethe impetusand assistanceneeded to ensure
that the development at Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundamand Farakka,assigned
to NTPC, were implemented successfully. This objective  was achievedfully
and in fact NTPC has been able to assume a much larger role in the power
sub-sectorthan was envisagedoriginally. This is made evident by the
expansionof its existingfacilities,   organization and management,and
staffing. As of end August, 1988, NTPC was operating16 new 200/210MW
units (fiveat Singrauli,three at Korba, three at Ramagundam,three at
Farakka and two at Vindhyachal) and six new 500 MW units (two at Singrauli,
                                   _14-




two at Korba and one each at Ramagundamand Rihand) totalingaround 6,220
MW, and 6,600 km of 400 kV transmissionlines. NTPC also operatesthe 720
MW BadarpurThermalPower Stationnear Delhi and is responsible   for the
constructi'onand operationof a 270 MW captive Thermal Power Station
establishedat Korba for the Bharat AluminumCompany,on a managementfee
basis.

6.02     In responseto the rapid increasein its operationaland
constructionactivities,  NTPC also adopteda regionalorganizational
structurein August, 1982 on the basis of a study conducted  with assistance
from power utilitiesand consultants  in the UK and the USA. Each region is
under the charge of an ExecutiveDirector,who is responsible   for the
constructionand operationof generationand transmission    facilities. The
CorporateHeadquartersis progressively   concentrating on policy making and
on providingfunctionalguidanceto the regionsand operatingdivisions.
AlthoughNTPC has centralized  engineering and contractadministration,  in
order to utilize the trainedmanpowermore effectively,   the conceptsof
carryingout these two functions  on a projectbasis will continue.

6.03     As of August 31, 1988 NTPC had about 19,594 employees. Training
of engineersand operatorsfor operationand maintenance       was to be an
integralpart of NTPC's human resourcesdevelopment      program. Accordingly,
the corporation   developedtrainingprogramsand established     an in-house
managementtraininginstitute. So far 12 batches of engineershave been
trained. For operators'training,NTPC had set up one 200 MWfull scope
training simulator and has recently  procured a similar 500 MWwhich should
be commissioned in 1992. In addition    two training groups, namely Central
TrainingInstitute ,CTI) and Power ManagementInstitute (PMI),have been
established  to provide technicaland managementeducationrespectively. It
has been decided to convertthese traininggroups into full-fledged
independentinstitutes   with the objectiveof increasingthe number of
personnelthat CTI and PMI trains, therebyexpandingits role in order to
help satisfy the power subsector's  needs. The CTI and PMI will be equipped
with all facilitiesof a well developedcampus,which is being constructed
at Noila, near Delhi, where an independent    researchand development  centre
will also be installedto conductin-houseresearchin the areas of
operationand maintenance.

6.04    As NTPC stationsare located at pitheadsin remote areas which are
difficultto access from CorporateHeadquartersin New Delhi, NTPC has
decidedto establishan integrated modern communicationsystem using
computersand a satellitecommunication system. This system is expectedto
be completedshortly.


                        VII. ECONOMICREVALUATION


7.01     In the Appra.-alReport, the return on investmentwas calculated
for the entire 2,100 MW development at Ramagundamto demonstratethe
relationship between tariffs and the economiccost of development. It was
          *                                 ~~~~~~~~~-15-



defined as the discountrate at which the presentworth of the economic
costs associated with the developmentequals the presentworth of economic
benefitsover the life cycle of the development. The measurablecosts
included:

              (a) Capital and labor costs involvedin the developmentof
                  generationand transmission  facilities;
              (b) Annual operatingand maintenancecosts;
              (c) Fuel costs.

The benefitswere measured in terms of the revenuesto be derived from the
sale of electricity.

7.02     Based on measurableeconomiccost and benefitsassociatedwith the
2,100 MV Ramagundamdevelopment,  the ex-ante InternalEconomicRate of
Return (IERR)is estimatedat about 10?. Because actual tariffswere
higher than envisagedand more than compensatefor a higher project cost
and longer construction period, the same approachresults in an estimated
ex-post IERR of 12.5Z (Annex 12) which comparesfavorablywith the
opportunitycost of capital,implyingthat NTPC's bulk supply tariffs for
the southernregion continueto adequatelyreflectthe economiccost of
supply.

              VIII.            OF THE BENEFICIARY
                      PERFORMANCE                ANDTHE BANKGROUP

8.01        The performance of NTPC, the beneficiary               of the credit and loan,
was generally        commendable and met most of the expectations             of the appraisal
report.     The performance         has also to be consideredin parallelwith the
performance of the two other projects             - the Singrauli       and Korba Thermal
Power Project - implemented nearly simultaneously                  and completed
successfully.         NTPC implemented also this Project satisfactorily              and in
almost identical         time as originally     envisaged.     However, the procurement
stage took too long, in particular             the award of major contracts         which
directly    affected       the overall implementation       schedule.      In fact, the
extensive     time needed to complete the procurement stage, in particular                   bid
evaluation,      has been and remains a basic weakness in NTPC's operational
performance.         Also bidding documents, which have been completed with
successive      amendments, tend to become confused and cumbersome for the
bidders.      In order to remedy that situation            and discuss basic procurement
practices,      the Bank recently       organized a procurement seminar, attended by
NTPC and SEBs' staff,          which has been much appreciated          by NTPC management.
Following above procurement delays, NTPCwas able to reduce the
construction       time for each of these units by a period of around two months.
In addition,      when considering       the three projects      together,    NTPC initiated
improvements on its own accord which are having, and should continue to
have, beneficial         spin-offs.     The most notable of these, including          some that
were introduced        in the country for the first         time, are described below.

8.02     NTPC implemented in its projects    a control and instrumentation
package, the first of its kind in the country,     to improve the performance
of power plants in terms of safety,  availability    and reliability.    The
                                  -16-




package consistsof systemsfor automaticturbine run-up coordinated   master
control,centralized steam and water analysis,micro processorbased analog
control and computerizedon-line data acquisitionsystem (DAS). The analog
control systemwith its self-surveillance and diagnosticfeatures,was
implemented to optimizeplant performance. LikewiseDAS will assist plant
operatorsin preparingperformance  calculations, pre and post trip logs and
operatorguidancemessages.

8.03     Followingthe experiencegained illimplementing   the Singrauliand
Korba ThermalPower Projects,NTPC has prepareddetailed specifications    for
power plant equipmentprocuredthrough International   CompetitiveBidding
(ICB). A contractmanagementsystem has been developedand implemented     for
this purpose. The conceptof qualityassuranceand of design, supply and
erectiontype of packagingfor auxiliaries   were furtherdeveloped. Under
this packagingconcept,contractors   and vendors are responsible for
detailedengineering  of the system,manufactureor fabrication,   testing and
supply of equipmentas well as erectionand commissioning   of the sy,-temas
a whole. This approachhas enabledNTPC to reduce the staff time sp4t on
coordinating activities without sacrificing high standardson quality
control and system performance which are ensured throughcontractual
obligations of the supplier.

8.04     For the operationof the power stationslocatedclose to pitheads
NTPC has adopteda system of rapid loading of coal at coal mines for
dedicatedunit trainswith bottom discharge  wagons and undergroundcoal
receivinghopper. Other utilitiesin the countryare currently
contemplating the adoptionof this system.

8.05     For the trainingof plant operatorsand technicians  NTPC has
installed,at Korba, a full scope replicadigitalcomputerbased 200 MW
coal fired thermalpower plant trainingsimulator. A 500 MW simulatorof
similar type was recentlyprocuredand is being installedalso at Korba.61
These trainingsimulatorssimulatethe entire boiler turbine generatorand
their auxiliaryfunctionsin digital computersthat exactly correspond  with
the real plant operation. These simulators, introducedfor the first time
in India, will be used for the trainingof NTPC staff as well as those of
the SEBs.

8.06     Other facilities which NTPC has initiatedto improve the overall
efficiencyand functioning  of its power plants and transmission system
include inter alia a satellitecommunication  system,spring supported
equipmentfoundations,  variablefrequencydrive and static reactive
compensators. As a result of the successin implementing   its first
projects,NTPC has been encouragedto furtherdevelop its capabilityin
undertakingconventional  coal thermalpower projects. Furthermore,   with
the CombinedCycle Power Project (Ln. 2674-IN)and Central and Rihand
TransmissionPower Projects,(respectively   Ln. 2283-IN and Ln. 2555-IN),



6/ The TATA ElectricCompaniesalready operate a 500 MW gaslfuelthermal
   power plant trainingsimulatorat Trombay,financedunder the Third
   Trombay Power Project (Ln. 1549-IN).

                     NTPC has introducedin the country new technologyin
under !.mplementation,
power generationand transmission(highvoltage direct current (HVDC)).

8.07    In additionNTPC has made substantialprogressin developingand
implementingsystemsfor financialmanagement, personnelmanagement,
selection,recruitmentand training;stores accountingand spare parts
management;maintenancemanagementand engineering.

8.08     The financialperformance  of NTPC during project implementation
and initialyears of operationwere also satisfactory. In particular,NTPC
has been able to expand and diversifyits sourcesof projectsfinancing.
However,NTPC has been unable to maintain its account receivables from its
clients,the SEBs, at a level of two months of sales covenantedin
subsequent operationsfor NTPC projects. In this regard, the arrears
situationof the SouthernRegion SEBs, suppliedby the Ramagundampower
station,is slightlybetter than in other Regions. The overall situation
is neverthelessbecom!.ng critical;over the past severalmonths (late
1988), total receivables have remainedstable at slightlyless than four
months,whereas, in accordance  with legal covenantsagreed under following
loans, they should not have exceededtwo months of sales.

8.09     With regard to environmental protectionand resettlement needed
for construction of the plant, NTPC performanceat Ramagundamwas
satisfactory. Howevermore recently,NTPC has been facing a growing
problem in regard to maintainingecologicalbalance,in view of the rapid
expansionin industrialactivityin the country. NTPC intendsto establish
an environmental impact assessmentcell to conduct comprehensive studies
which would cover all ecologicalaspects associated with the settingup of
power projects. This cell would also monitor on a continuousbasis,
pollutantsfrom the power stationsto ensure that these are within the
acceptable norms. NTPC, with the assistanceof the Bank Group, has
initiated work on a Environment Impact Assessment(EIA) in the area around
Rihand Lake, SingrauliCoalfieldsand severalpower stationsfor which
expatriateconsultants,  have been recruitedto assist NTPC.

8.10     The Bank Group supervisedthe project closelyand maintainedgood
relations with the beneficiary allowingit the latitudeneeded to innovate.
This fosteredan environment  conduciveto increasedBank Group involvement
with NTPC. To date, the Bank Group has assistedNTPC in implementing  a
total of 13 projects. However,Bank action could have been prompter in
dealingwith procurement  delays and the size of the receivables,although
severalattemptsto remedy these issues have been made which have been so
far not as successfulas expected. Throughthese operationsthe Bank has
been strengthening the institutional capabilityand financialviabilityof
the corporation. The Bank has also continuedaddressinga number of
shortcomings of broader sectoralconcern in initiatingstudiesaimed at
formulation of a long term power transmission plan, re-structuringbulk
supply tariffs,and most recently,conductingan EIA study in the Singrauli
region.

                            IX CONCLUSION


9.01     The Projectwas successfulin that the three 200 MW units were
completedsatisfactorily  and are generatingthe much needed electricityfor
the SouthernRegion of the country. In addition,the project and
subsequent Bank Group lendinghave providedthe impetusand assistance
needed by NTPC to assume a larger role than envisaged. NTPC needs to be
commendednot only for its active participation  in all stages of project
preparation,implementation  and its final operationbut also for its
initiatives not only in continuingto implementefficiently   large
conventional coal fired thermalpower stationsbut also in other areas such
as the introduction of gas based combinedcycle power generation,  HVDC
transmission, new control and instrumentation package,contractmanagement
system,rapid coal loading system, simulatorfor operational   training,
supply and erectiontype of packagingfor auxiliaries   of conceptsof
quality assurancein engineering  design etc. On the financialside, NTPC
has been successfulin increasingsubstantially   and in diversifying
resourcemobilizationfor future projectsfinancing. These should continue
to have beneficialspin-offsfor both NTPC as well as India's SEBs and the
developmentof the sector in general. In this regard,lending operations
to NTPC has proven to be more successful and beneficialto the sector than
previousoperations  with central institution such as the respective
Transmission and Rural Electrification Projects.

 1.      The RAmAgundamdevelopmentis the third of a series of large
thermal power stations,plannedby the Governmentof India to feed into a
400 kV interconnectedtransmissionsystem and supply bulk power to the
SEBs.

 2.      Ramagundam's2,100 MW power station is located in the Karimnagar
districtof Andhra Pradesh,south of the Godavaririver and in the vicinity
of the south Godavaricoal fields.

 3.      The plant consistsof three 200 MW, in a first stage, and three
500 NW, in a second stage, generatingunits with boiler plant, steam turbo
generator,auxiliarymechanicaland electricalequipmentand associated
transmissionsystem. The first stage of the development,  comprisingthe
project, consistedof three 200 MW units.

  4.      The first stage boilers are of natural circulation,        single reheat,
radiant furnace,dry bottom, single drum, balanceddraft, pulverizedcoal
fired, front wall fired type. Each boiler has continuousevaporation
rating of 670 tonnes/hrwith a superheatsteam outlet pressureof 157
kg/cm 2 and temperature  of 5400C. The 200 1W steam turbines       are two
cylinders  (high and intermediate  pressure in a single cylinder)       tandem
compound, single reheat condensing type operating       at a steam pressure of
150 kg/cm 2 and temperature  of 537.50C.   The alternators     are hydrogen cooler
type rated at 235 MVA and 18 kV.

  5.         The second stage boilers    under installation    are of controlled
circulation,     single reheat,   radiant furnace,dry bottom, single drum,
balanced draft, pulverizedcoal fired, corner fired type. Each boiler has
a continuousevaporation        rating of 1,725 tones/hrwith a superheatsteam
outlet pressure of 180 kg/cm      2 and temperature     of 5400C. The 500 KW steam
turbines     are three cylinders,   tendem compound,single reheat, condensing
type operatingat a steam pressureof 170 kg/cm            2 and temperature  of 5370C.
