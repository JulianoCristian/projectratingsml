The power station will be constructed in the vicinity\n            of the South Godavari coal fields in the State of Andhra\n            Pradesh. Its generation capacity is expected to reach 2,100\n            MW -- comprising three 200 MW and three 500 MW generating\n            units -- by July 1987. The first 200 MW unit is expected to\n            be commissioned by July 1, 1983, and the commissioning of\n            the remaining two 200 MW units will follow at six-month\n            intervals. The principal components of the project include\n            civil works; three 200 MW turbo-generating units and three\n            680 tonnes-per-hour boilers, complete with all auxiliaries,\n            and ancillary electrical and mechanical equipment; coal\n            transportation and handling equipment; and about 1,200 km of\n            400 kV transmission line, together with associated equipment."}, "docdt": "1978-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
