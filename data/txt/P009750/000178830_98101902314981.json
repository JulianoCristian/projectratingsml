with\n            ancillary equipment and related works and 400 kV\n            transmission facilities to convey bulk power to recipient\n            SEBs. The power station will be constructed in the vicinity\n            of the South Godavari coal fields in the State of Andhra\n            Pradesh. Its generation capacity is expected to reach 2,100\n            MW -- comprising three 200 MW and three 500 MW generating\n            units -- by July 1987. The first 200 MW unit is expected to\n            be commissioned by July 1, 1983, and the commissioning of\n            the remaining two 200 MW units will follow at six-month\n            intervals. The principal components of the project include\n            civil works; three 200 MW turbo-generating units and three\n            680 tonnes-per-hour boilers, complete with all auxiliaries,\n            and ancillary electrical and mechanical equipment; coal\n            transportation and handling equipment; and about 1,200 km of\n            400 kV transmission line, together with associated equipment."}, "docdt": "1978-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
