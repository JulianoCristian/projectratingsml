* The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) is a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department. The ICR Review is an
intermediate IEGWB product that seeks to independently verify the findings of the ICR. In this case, the operation had only a
“Simplified” ICR. IEG’s ICRR did not provide an Outcome rating due to “the absence of information on interim outcomes”. At the
time, operations were evaluated for “Sustainability” instead of Risk to Development Outcome. A rating was also given for
“Institutional Development Impact”, which is no longer the case.

      IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This evaluation is a product of the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG). The report was
prepared by William Sutton (Task Team Leader), under the guidance of Emmanuel
Jimenez (Director, Public Sector Evaluation) and Marie Gaarder (Manager, Public Sector
Evaluation), and overall direction of Caroline Heider (Director General, Evaluation). The
report was peer reviewed by Kenneth Chomitz and panel reviewed by Fernando
Manibog. Estela Costa Neves provided some inputs. Marie Charles provided
administrative support.

This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) presents findings based on a
review of the Program Document, the Simplified ICR, IEG’s ICRR, and documents from
the World Bank project files, as well as from other World Bank sources and literature
relevant to the subject. In addition, IEG carried out a mission to Brazil in February-March
2013 that included interviews with government officials at the federal, state and
municipal levels, World Bank staff, development partners, researchers, representatives of
international NGOs and local civil society organizations, and community members. IEG
extends its thanks to the Brazilian government officials, other external stakeholders, and
current and former World Bank staff for their cooperation with the evaluation. IEG also
thanks the World Bank office in Brasilia for logistical support and help in organizing the
mission itinerary.

Following standard IEG procedures, an earlier draft of this evaluation was sent to World
Bank Management, who provided comments; and the revised report was then sent to the
Government of Brazil, who submitted comments. This PPAR was discussed at a meeting
of the World Bank Board’s Committee on Development Effectiveness (CODE) on
January 21, 2015. The Management Response can be found on page xv, Chairperson’s
Summary of the CODE discussion on page xix, and Borrower Comments in Annex D on
page 56.

Overview
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Brazil First
Programmatic Reform Loan for Environmental Sustainability (Env PRL 1) (7256-BR;
P080829).

The Env PRL was designed as a programmatic series of up to three loans to the Federal
Government of Brazil for a total of approximately US$1.2 billion. The first loan—the
subject of this evaluation—was for a total of US$502.52 million disbursed in a single
tranche on IBRD terms. The loan was approved by the World Bank Board on August 24,
2004. It became effective on November 8, 2004, was fully disbursed, and closed on
December 31, 2004.

This PPAR was prepared for two main reasons: accountability and innovation. This
assessment will also contribute to a forthcoming IEG learning product on environmental
policy lending across World Bank client countries.

Accountability. The Env PRL was never properly evaluated, despite the large size of the
operation, and the fact that it was the first World Bank environmental policy lending
program in Brazil and influenced the later design of the 2009 Brazil First Programmatic
Development Policy Loan for Sustainable Environmental Management (SEM DPL). At
the time the first loan closed in December 2004, the practice was to prepare a brief
“Simplified” Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) after each operation
in a programmatic series of policy loans, and a full ICR only at the end of the series. The
Bank produced a Simplified ICR for Env PRL 1, dated June 29, 2005, with only six
pages of main text. However, the planned second and third loans never materialized and
the series eventually lapsed, yet the Bank did not complete the required full ICR. 1 Based
on the Simplified ICR, IEG conducted a desk-based ICR Review (ICRR) that was posted
on January 19, 2006. IEG rated the quality of the Simplified ICR as unsatisfactory
“because it does not provide sufficient information”, and marked Outcome as “Not
Rated” because “in the absence of information on interim outcomes, the project cannot be
rated.” The ICRR recommended a PPAR in order to gather additional information and
endeavor to fill the gap; this PPAR is in part in response to that recommendation. Since a
number of the policy areas are similar to those under the SEM DPL, this PPAR was also
motivated by the need to better establish which reforms were supported by the Env PRL,
in order to facilitate the determination of attribution of reforms to the SEM DPL in the
evaluation of that operation.

Innovation: The Program Document reports that the ENV PRL was the first World Bank
budget support program in Brazil with a purely environmental policy objective, and was
part of a set of environmental policy loans to countries in the Latin America and
Caribbean Region that were some of the first in the World Bank. The Env PRL also
influenced the design of the US$1.3 billion SEM DPL 1 approved in 2009. It is therefore
1
 World Bank BP 8.60, which governs development policy lending, states: “The task team
prepares an ICR on completion of an operation. For programmatic development policy lending,
an ICR is prepared on completion of the program and includes a separate assessment of the
contribution of each individual operation to the program.” (World Bank OPCS)

important to understand not only the outcomes of the Env PRL, but also the processes
involved, and the use of policy lending to support the environmental sustainability
agenda.

The Brazil First Programmatic Reform Loan for Environmental Sustainability (Env PRL
1) (7256-BR; P080829) was designed as a programmatic series of up to three loans to the
Federal Government of Brazil for a total of approximately US$1.2 billion. The first
loan—the subject of this evaluation—was for a total of US$502.52 million disbursed in a
single tranche on IBRD terms. The loan was approved by the World Bank’s Board on
August 24, 2004. It became effective on November 8, 2004, was fully disbursed, and
closed on December 31, 2004. Only Env PRL 1 was completed; the second and third
loans did not materialize. An Environmental Technical Assistance Loan (Env TAL) was
prepared to accompany the Env PRL and provide support through studies, workshops and
other capacity-building activities. However, the EnvTAL did not become effective until
2006, nearly two years after the approval of Env PRL 1.

The Env PRL Program Document notes that, “in few countries is the national
environment as crucial to development and people’s welfare, and at the same time vital to
a sustainable global ecology, as in Brazil.” Thanks in large part to its size and geographic
diversity, Brazilian natural resources are diversified and abundant—including the famous
Amazon rainforest, which is of global importance. At the same time, Brazil has long had
an acute tension between economic development and environmental sustainability. As the
Env PRL Program Document notes, “Brazil has historically based its economy on
exploiting the immense wealth of its natural resources,” and that “a significant part of its
economy still relies on the use of natural resources.” As a result, Brazil faces a variety of
environmental challenges associated with deforestation and the need to combine
agricultural growth, environmental protection, and sustainable development. The
increases in urbanization and industrialization have brought with them additional
environmental challenges. Finding a balance between economic development and
sustainable management of the environment is therefore a key national priority for Brazil,
and for the World Bank’s program there.

According to the Program Document, the principal objective of the Env PRL is “to
support Brazil’s goal of balancing economic growth with social development and the
maintenance and improvement of environmental quality.” Since this long-term goal is
broad, imprecise and ambitious given the size of the country and the scale of its
challenges, this PPAR evaluates the Env PRL based on the following two specific,
monitorable objectives also indicated in the Program Document:

   1. increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of Brazil’s environmental management
      system (EMS), including a green, brown and blue agenda, and
   2. mainstreaming environmental sustainability in selected sector policies and
      programs.
In light of Brazil’s priorities and its Multi-Year Plan, and the World Bank’s strategies for
engagement with Brazil over the relevant period, the general theme of the Env PRL’s
objectives is clearly relevant. The Relevance of Objectives is rated Substantial.
                                             xi


The specific, monitorable objectives noted in the previous paragraph can be considered
necessary for achieving the broader goal of “balancing economic growth with social
development and the maintenance and improvement of environmental quality,” but are
unlikely to be sufficient, particularly on the social side. The Env PRL was designed with
fifteen different policy areas and multiple government agencies in addition to the official
implementing agencies—the Ministry of Finance and the central Ministry of
Environment. The general approach under the Env PRL series of drafting laws and
strategies under the first operation, approving legislation under the second, and
implementing the reforms under the third is causally linked and logically correct in
most—though not all—cases. However, a risk of non-completion was created by
predominantly targeting the federal level with “backloaded” reform agendas that would
not be fully implemented until the second or third operation. The Relevance of Design is
rated Substantial.

Given current IEG and OPCS evaluation practice, the Env PRL 1 has to be evaluated
against the series outcome indicators and objectives, even though the rest of the series
was canceled.

For Objective 1, the achievements in some policy areas were more significant than
others. The Env PRL is credited with contributing to the raising of the profile and agenda
of the Ministry of Environment and associated agencies, resulting in improved
engagement with other important parts of the government, such as the Ministry of
Finance. This was of high importance for advancing the sustainability agenda in Brazil.
The reduction of deforestation in the Atlantic Forest and the introduction of a system for
water charges were also important achievements. In other areas, such as the protection of
the Cerrado Forest, improvement of the environmental licensing process, and improved
management of hazardous chemicals, evidence suggests that significant challenges
remain to this day. Achievement of Objective 1 is rated Substantial.

For Objective 2, some of the reforms supported by the Env PRL are credited with making
substantial contributions to environmental mainstreaming. This is particularly true with
regard to the impressive progress that Brazil has made in reducing deforestation in the
Amazon, which is a signal achievement of great importance for Brazil and for the global
environment. In the area of environmental sanitation, there has been some progress
through the innovative PRODES payment for results sanitation program, and zoning in
the Amazon, though with little apparent impact on the ground so far. In other policy areas
such as energy and tourism, the planned mainstreaming reforms were never carried out.
The failure to introduce a Strategic Environmental Assessment approach into river basin
and hydroelectric investment planning, and the lack of results in mainstreaming
environmental sustainability in financial institutions, are particularly important as missed
opportunities. Achievement of Objective 2 is rated Modest.

Although the second and third operations in the Env PRL series did not materialize as
planned, Env PRL 1 and the accompanying Env TAL gave impetus to the reform agenda,
thus resulting in the continuation of many of the reforms and important contributions to
improved environmental management and mainstreaming of environmental sustainability
in Brazil. Those included the essential strengthening of the Federal Ministry of
Environment, and the significant reduction in deforestation of the Amazon and Atlantic
                                            xii


Forests. On the other hand, reforms in some other areas did not achieve results as
planned.

In view of the substantial Relevance of Objectives, substantial Relevance of Design, and
the substantial achievement of the first objective related to EMS but modest achievement
of the second objective on mainstreaming sustainability, the Env PRL is rated
Moderately Satisfactory for overall Outcome.

The Env PRL was designed as a series of three operations necessary to achieve the
intended outcomes. Although the second and third loans in the series did not materialize,
the Brazilian government continued to make progress on many—but not all—of the
policy areas under the Env PRL program, indicating good commitment to the overall
environmental management and mainstreaming agenda. Risk to Development Outcome is
therefore rated Moderate.

The World Bank team that prepared the Env PRL was praised by both government
counterparts and civil society representatives for the quality of the preparation process,
including the extensive and long-term engagement of the World Bank team with the
Brazilian environmental policy reform agenda and stakeholders both inside and outside
of government during preparation. On the other hand, as the World Bank later
acknowledged, the design of the Env PRL was highly ambitious, involving too many
policy areas and associated agencies. There is also a question as to whether a three-loan
series was the best design option. Although the Borrower continued with a number of the
reforms after the Env PRL 1—despite the rest of the series not materializing—this was
more serendipity than good planning on the part of the Bank, which had envisaged a
program of three loans over four years. The preparation of the Env TAL that was meant
to accompany the Env PRL lagged behind that of the Env PRL. Quality at Entry is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

Supervision of the Env PRL series was not adequate. After Env PRL 1 was disbursed and
closed, there was inadequate attention to continuing the dialogue and engagement from
the World Bank side to ensure that the programmatic series would continue as planned
for a second and third operation. Monitoring and evaluation under the Env PRL were
particularly weak. The Bank neglected to evaluate the Env PRL with a full ICR for the
series, as required by World Bank policy. The quality of the Simplified ICR was rated
Unsatisfactory by IEG at the time. Thus despite the large size of the loan, its innovation,
and its potential implications for the 2009 SEM DPL, there was no proper accounting of
what worked and what did not under the Env PRL, what the outcomes were, and what
lessons could be gleaned for future operations. Quality of Supervision is rated
Unsatisfactory.

Considering the Moderately Satisfactory Quality at Entry rating and the Unsatisfactory
Quality of Supervision rating, and in light of the Moderately Satisfactory Outcome rating,
Overall Bank Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

Brazil has made significant progress in improving environmental sustainability in certain
areas—particularly the signal achievement in reducing deforestation in the Amazon.
There is evidence that this had much to do with actions taken by the Brazilian
                                            xiii


Government, particularly the strengthening of “command and control” enforcement
measures under the PPCD program supported by the Env PRL. The Government also
took steps to strengthen the environmental management system and central institutions in
the country by restructuring, raising the profile of, and increasing staffing for the
Ministry of Environment. Despite the cancelation of the second and third operations
under the Env PRL series, the Brazilian government also continued to make progress in
mainstreaming environment in some of the other sectors.

At the same time, the Government made little progress in other key policy areas
described under the Env PRL, such as improving the performance of the environmental
licensing system overseen by IBAMA, integrating a Strategic Environmental Assessment
approach into hydroelectric investment planning, and mainstreaming environmental
sustainability in financial and fiscal policies. There was also no progress reported in the
planned mainstreaming of environment in the tourism sector. The cancelation of the Env
PRL series adversely impacted the functioning of the high-level Management Committee
composed of representatives of the seven ministries involved. The Brazilian government
also reportedly resisted the associated Env TAL loan, which was an important
complement to the Env PRL. Overall, Borrower Performance is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.

This assessment includes a number of lessons, which are summarized below:

   •   Risks associated with not completing the required ex-post evaluation of an
       operation could influence the quality and effectiveness of subsequent
       operations. The World Bank did not prepare the required full ICR for the Env
       PRL series. As a result, there was no proper accounting for the Env PRL, and
       there were adverse impacts on the subsequent SEM DPL environmental DPO
       series as well. The World Bank should have ensured that the evaluation of the
       previous series was completed before embarking on preparation of a new series in
       the same sector.

   •   Extensive engagement and consultations by the World Bank in preparing a
       DPO contribute to better design and generate goodwill on the part of the
       client. The team that prepared the Env PRL was praised for its long-term, high-
       quality technical engagement with government ministries and sectoral agencies,
       and for its efforts to consult with an array of civil society organizations.

   •   It is important to be selective and realistic about what can be achieved in the
       context of a sectoral DPO. Considering that this was the first DPO series in
       Brazil focused on the environment, the complexity of the issues, and the many
       government agencies that they involved, the World Bank and the Borrower
       needed to be more cautious about program design and policy reform priorities, in
       order to avoid being overly ambitious, as was evident with the fifteen different
       policy areas of the Env PRL.

            Environmental Sustainability (Env DPL) and Management Comments

                     Report to the Board of Executive Directors from the
                         C ommittee on Development Effectiveness

                                  Meeting of January 21, 2015

         The Committee on Development Effectiveness (CODE) met to discuss IEG’s Project
 Performance Assessment Report (PPAR): Brazil – First Programmatic Development Policy
 Loan for Sustainable Environmental Management (2009 SEM DPL) (CODE2014-0042),
 Management Comments on the SEM DPL (CODE2014-0043), IEG’s Project Performance
 Assessment Report (PPAR): Brazil – First Programmatic Reform Loan for Environmental
 Sustainability (2004 Env PRL) (CODE2014-0046), and Management Comments on the Env PRL
 (CODE2015-0001).

          The Committee welcomed the opportunity to discuss the two country project evaluations.
 Members noted the different views by Management and the Government of Brazil (GoB) on the
 IEG approach and findings of the PPAR on the SEM DPL. Several speakers commented that the
 differing views presented a challenge in assessing the findings and broader lessons. They reiterated
 the importance of collaboration and clarity in approach and scope among all parties before
 evaluations are undertaken, and hoped IEG and Management continue their constructive working
 relationship.

         The Committee focused on the two PPARs and the DPLs’ achievements and
 performance, and some members urged Management to consider relevant lessons to help inform
 future DPF operations; others urged caution given the factual disagreements. Members noted
 the progress Brazil has achieved in strengthening and mainstreaming environmental
 sustainability; they supported the Bank’s sustained efforts in this sector and the consolidated
 partnership between the Bank and the Government of Brazil.

          Members acknowledged that sector related DPOs raise particular issues related to
 environmental and social (E&S) risks, and several noted the difficulty in attributing impact and
 results in DPF operations in general. The Committee looked forward to consideration of the
 development policy financing retrospective planned for FY16 and, in particular, discussion of
 E&S risks, implementation, levels of due diligence and monitoring and evaluation requirements
 in DPLs. Members also looked forward to discussing IEG's broader review of DPFs, expected in
 the coming months.

         The Committee agreed that the PPARs will be disclosed with the Management
 Comments, Borrower Comments and Green Sheet Summary, and that the disclosure should
 reference these documents and flag that there were different views.

This report is not an approved record.

1. Background and Context
Environmental Context
1.1     The Env PRL Program Document notes that, “in few countries is the national
environment as crucial to development and people’s welfare, and at the same time vital to a
sustainable global ecology, as in Brazil.” The Federative Republic of Brazil is the largest
country in South America and the fifth largest in the world, comparable in size with the US,
and covering 8.5 million km2. Brazil has almost 17,000 km of borders, which it shares with
every South American nation except Chile and Ecuador 2, and a coastline of 7,500 km.
Stretching from north of the Equator to south of the Tropic of Capricorn, and straddling three
time zones, Brazil embraces a variety of landscapes and climates from tropical to temperate.

1.2     Thanks in large part to its size and geographic diversity, Brazilian natural resources
are diversified and abundant. With more than 5 million km² covered by forests, Brazil also
benefits from major wood and other forest product resources, and is home to the largest
carbon sink on the planet. With eight large river basins—such as the Amazonas, Tocantins
and São Francisco—there are water resources in abundance (though very unequally
distributed across the landscape and population). However, owing to its large size and
diverse geography, one of Brazil’s greatest natural resource endowments is its biodiversity.
In recognition of this diversity, Brazil was defined as the first of fifteen “megadiverse”
countries. This biodiversity is expressed both in genetic terms and at the ecosystem level,
with many species being found only in Brazil.

1.3     Of the main Brazilian biomes, the Amazon is the largest and most famous,
representing 40 percent of the tropical forests of the planet, and occupying 48 percent of the
Brazilian territory. Although the Amazon is in many ways the best conserved biome in
Brazil, it has experienced periods of rapid deforestation, including in the mid-90s and again
in the mid-2000s. However, Brazil contains other important biomes as well. The second
largest is the Atlantic Forest, which goes from the Southern region to the Northeastern and
comprises many different kinds of ecosystems, such as mangroves, forests and plains, and is
particularly rich in biodiversity. The Atlantic Forest is the biome that has suffered the most
losses, especially in the 20th century, with the native vegetation being reduced to less than
nine percent of its original size. The Cerrado, Pantanal, and costal and marine biomes are
other examples of ecologically valuable but highly fragile biomes.

1.4     The diversity and expansive geography of Brazil’s biomes make effective
management a challenge. Brazil’s environmental legislation dates back to 1934 with the first
National Forest and Water Laws. Brazil’s original environmental framework was designed
after the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States. The Special Secretariat for
the Environment (SEMA) was created in 1973, following the Stockholm Conference on the



2
 Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and
Venezuela.
                                                  2


Human Environment (1972), attached to the Ministry of the Interior. 3 SEMA was
responsible for developing pollution control standards, coordinating federal pollution control
activities, managing the natural resource base and state environmental agencies most of
which were established during the 1980s. In 1985, Brazil’s first National Environment
Council (CONAMA) was set up, which included representatives from federal and state
government as well as civil society. In 1986, CONAMA made environmental impact
assessments (EIA/RIMA) mandatory for all new, large-scale public and private infrastructure
projects. Other policy instruments developed at the time included environmental quality
standards, zoning, and the licensing, monitoring and control of polluting activities. The first
ministry dedicated in part to the environment was created in 1985 as the Ministry of Urban
Development and Environment, while the Ministry of the Environment itself (MMA) was set
up in 1993. 4

1.5      During the late 1980s there was a gradual shift in Brazil’s environmental policy away
from a narrow emphasis on pollution control and natural resource management and towards
the reconciliation of conservation with development goals. 5 The 1988 Constitution dedicates
an entire chapter (VI) to the environment that underlines Brazil’s commitment to the
principles of sustainable development. 6 Under the Constitution, the public sector is imbued
with a number of environmental responsibilities including: ecosystem conservation and
management; preservation of genetic biodiversity; protection of vulnerable areas; control of
dangerous substances; enhancing environmental education and public awareness; and the
protection of flora and fauna to preserve species. The Constitution identified the Amazon
forest, the Serra do Mar Mountains, the Pantanal wetlands and the coastline as priority areas
to be preserved.

1.6    In 1989, President Sarney announced Nossa Natureza, Brazil’s first attempt at
formulating a national environmental policy, which announced a number of emergency
measures. 7 In the run-up to Brazil’s hosting of the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, this

3
  The establishment of SEMA was actually triggered by an incident of contamination by toxic fumes
from a wood-pulp plant near Porto Alegre, capital of Rio Grande do Sul. See, R.Guimarães, The
Ecopolitics of Development in the Third World: Politics and the Environment in Brazil, Lynne
Rienner, Boulder, Colorado and London, 1991.
4
 The MMA was originally known as the Ministry of the Environment, Water Resources and Legal
Amazonia, which was shortened in 1999 to its present denomination.

Studies, University of London, 2000: 99-114.

  “All have the right to an ecologically balanced environment which is an asset of common use and
essential to a healthy quality of life, and both the Government and the community shall have the duty
to defend and preserve it for present and future generations” (Article 225).
7
  These measures included attempts to curtail Amazon deforestation, suspension of SUDAM fiscal
incentives for new projects (not existing projects, it should be noted), limits on log exports, the
creation of several national parks and setting up of a National Environment Fund (FNMA).
                                              3


move was seen by many as a response to mounting domestic and international criticism over
the country’s apparent lack of environmentally sound development policies. Attention was
drawn to Brazil’s plight by a number of developments. These included the rubber tappers’
movement and the murder by cattle ranchers of their leader Francisco Alves ‘Chico’ Mendes
in December 1988, as well as the highly publicized Altamira meeting against the proposed
River Xingú dam complex the previous year.

1.7     The main practical and immediate result of Nossa Natureza, however, was the setting
up of Brazil’s environmental control agency IBAMA. In addition to its headquarters in
Brasília, IBAMA has offices in all state capitals and many larger cities as well as local
representation at municipal level. It absorbed four pre-existing environmental agencies, 8
taking on a wider and more adversarial remit, including responsibility for monitoring
ecological damage and enforcing environmental laws in conjunction with state and federal
police forces. At the same time, environmental offices (OEMAs) were set up by state
governments in accordance with the decentralization principles enshrined in the 1988
Constitution. The National Environment Policy of 1990 laid down policies of agro-
ecological zoning, setting up of protected areas (conservation units) such as extractive and
indigenous reserves as well as national parks. In 1992 the G7 Pilot Program to Conserve the
Brazilian Rainforest (PPG7) was launched, which began to reflect a sustainable development
approach to dealing with environmental threats.

1.8     Brazil’s environmental profile was heightened when it took on a leadership role in
international environmental matters by hosting the UN Conference on the Environment and
Development (UNCED) or “Earth Summit” in 1992. The country was the first to sign the
Convention on Biological Diversity (UNCBD) and the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), during the conference. Both were ratified by the
Congress in February 1994. The United Nations Convention on Combat of Desertification
(UNCCD) was signed in October 1994 and ratified by the Congress in June 1997. Brazil also
played an important role during the negotiations before the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol of
the UNFCCC during the Conference of Parties on 1997, particularly with regard to the
creation of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).

1.9     Yet even as it was taking on a leadership role internationally, the idea of
incorporating an environmental dimension into development policies and strategies was still
highly controversial in Brazil. For example, there had been strong resistance by Amazon
state governors to the setting up of local environmental control agencies (OEMAs), which
they saw as potential constraints on development.

1.10 During the 1990s, and despite the beginnings of a dialogue on the new challenge of
sustainable development, centralized command-and-control environmental policies allied to a
conservationist stance remained firm. IBAMA was provided with statutory powers by the
Environmental Crimes Law, which was finally approved in 1998 in the face of strong
political opposition. It imposed large fines and prison sentences for a range of offences



8
    IBAMA absorbed SEMA, the IBDF (forestry), SUDEPE (fisheries) and SUDHEVEA (rubber).
                                               4


including illegal logging, pollution, and illegal hunting. However, the law was poorly
enforced and few fines were ever collected.

1.11 There has been a growing concern in Brazil to make productive use of natural
resources while minimizing environmental destruction. The rubber tappers led the way with
their struggle against encroachment by cattle ranchers in the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in
creation of the “extractive reserve” (resex) in 1990 as the first such policy instrument in the
country. Brazil’s Law on the Management of Public Forests (2006) was designed to promote
large commercial and smaller community concessions on 13 million hectares of publicly
owned forests in the Amazon, in order to legalize a greater proportion of timber extraction in
the Amazon (90 percent of which was illegal). For the first time in Brazil, the law
recognized economic use of the standing forest as a ‘productive’ activity.

1.12 While the federal government retains significant control over the ‘green’
environmental agenda through the MMA and IBAMA, responsibility for the ‘blue’ and
‘brown’ agendas has increasingly been devolved to state authorities. Rapid urban expansion
during the 1960s and 1970s made it difficult for the government to keep up with the demand
for water, sanitation and solid waste disposal. By the late 1980s, the heavily centralized
water and sanitation system came under pressure from the monetary and fiscal controls
introduced to tame Brazil’s persistent inflation. Brazil’s 1988 Constitution decentralized
responsibility for addressing water and sanitation-related pollution issues to the states and
municipalities. The National Water Agency (ANA) was established in 2001, attached to the
Ministry of the Environment, and is responsible for the regulation and management of water
resources. Since the early 1990s, with World Bank assistance, sector specialists in Brazil
have been developing a river basin approach to protecting water quality and environmental
strengthening in or around major metropolitan areas.

Development Context
1.13 Brazil made substantial achievements in fiscal adjustment and price stabilization in
the late 1990s and early 2000s. But the resilience and continuity of that stabilization effort
was tested in the 2000s by the global economic slowdown, a domestic energy crisis,
spillovers from the Argentine crisis, and uncertainties related to the 2002 presidential
election. The subsequent macroeconomic stability and a favorable external environment
allowed Brazil to resume moderate growth from 2004 (IEG 2013).

1.14 At the time of preparation of the Env PRL, the World Bank team noted that “Brazil’s
economic management continues to be strong.” The Program Document noted that Brazil’s
public finances were well-managed and that the government was running a primary budget
surplus of 4.25 percent of GDP; total public debt was falling. Inflation was an issue, with
consumer prices increasing by 9.3 percent in 2003 (though still below the level of historical
hyperinflation episodes, including in 2002). But exports were robust and Brazil’s current
account was in surplus, reducing external financing needs. The country had built foreign
reserves of over US$ 50 billion.

1.15 Although at the time there were concerns that the growth response was slow in
coming, macroeconomic stability and a favorable external environment allowed Brazil to
                                               5


resume moderate growth from 2004. But there were still numerous structural reforms
recommended by the World Bank that Brazil had yet to carry out, and Brazil’s credit ratings
had yet to improve, with Standard & Poor’s rating Brazil a non-investment grade BB- in
2003. As a result, there were concerns about the lack of confidence in both domestic and
foreign investors to make capital investments. The Program Document makes little mention
of Brazil’s high poverty rate and inequality at the time. In 2003, Brazil’s poverty rate was
35.8 percent, and it was struggling to find ways to bring it down. It does mention that at the
time the Government was trying to improve the effectiveness of its conditional cash transfer
programs, by “merging these into a new program, “Bolsa Familia”.

1.16 Brazil’s population has been urbanizing rapidly. Rural out-migration has been
encouraged by agricultural modernization and land concentration in the Southeast and
Northeast with the expansion of major commercial and export crops such as sugar, cattle,
wheat and soybean. Development of transport, road and communications infrastructure has
stimulated frontier settlement westwards, with implications for the environment. The growth
of Brazilian manufacturing industry through import substitution and exports as well as
expansion of the tertiary service sector has further catalyzed urban growth.

Brazil’s Environmental Challenges
1.17 Brazil has long had an acute tension between economic development and
environmental sustainability. As the Env PRL Program Document notes, “Brazil has
historically based its economy on exploiting the immense wealth of its natural resources,”
and that “a significant part of its economy still relies on the use of natural resources.” As a
result, Brazil faces a variety of environmental challenges associated with deforestation and
the need to combine agricultural growth, environmental protection, and sustainable
development. Although Brazil has large and growing industrial and services sectors, and
agriculture now accounts for less than 10 percent of GDP, agribusiness remains one of the
most important sectors in the economy, in terms of its contribution to both GDP and exports.
The increases in urbanization and industrialization have brought with them additional
environmental challenges. In response to increasing demand for energy, the Brazilian
authorities have proposed extensive construction of hydroelectric dams, including at multiple
locations in the Amazon rainforest, which has led to concerns over associated environmental
and social costs. At the time the Env PRL was prepared, the Bank team noted that Brazilian
rivers that crossed urban areas were heavily polluted, which adversely affected the health of
the poor in particular, and that air pollution was a problem in major cities (World Bank
2004). The Env PRL Program Document also highlighted the fact that degradation of the
natural resource base—including Amazon deforestation—was a significant problem that
disproportionately affected the poor.

1.18 The environment has been a rising priority in Brazil because of: (i) growing public
awareness of environmental issues and the need for improved environmental management;
(ii) increasing sensitivity to domestic and external criticism of poor natural resource
management—particularly deforestation; and (iii) growing recognition in both the public and
private sectors that better environmental management would benefit Brazilian business.
                                                     6


1.19 One of the most severe and infamous of Brazil’s environmental challenges at the time
of the Env PRL was the high rates of deforestation. Forest loss in the early- and mid-2000s
averaged around 20,000 km2 a year in the Amazon alone. In 2003-04 it rose to 27,000 km2,
the second highest after record levels in 1995 of 29,000 km2. 9 Just seven percent of the
Atlantic Rainforest remained intact.

1.20 Levels of deforestation vary considerably in Amazonia. In 2004-05, for example,
Mato Grosso and Pará states together accounted for 80 percent of Amazonia’s forest loss. In
Mato Grosso, the expansion of cattle ranching and soybeans, spurred on by high international
commodity prices, encouraged this trend in the 2000s. Such pressures were exacerbated by
the paving of highways through the Amazon, such as the BR-163 ‘soya export highway’,
which induced further settlement and pressure on the ecosystem.

1.21 Although access to treated water and sewerage services has increased in Brazil over
time, important disparities remained at the time of the Env PRL. Urban areas had much
higher levels of water supply and sewerage coverage than rural areas. Even in urban areas,
sewage coverage in Brazil was one of the worst in Latin America, with just one quarter of
collected sewage treated at the time. 10 There were also important geographic disparities, with
the wealthier Southeast enjoying much better water provision and sewage disposal services
than the poorer Northeast and North. These challenges have environmental implications, in
terms of poor water quality, polluted rivers, and lack of access to healthy water by significant
numbers of residents.

1.22 At the time of the Env PRL, between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro there were over
70,000 industrial sites, the highest such concentration in Latin America, making Brazil one of
the most industrialized of the developing countries. 11 During the 1970s, major pollution
from industrial and automotive sources created an environmental crisis situation, with an
estimated 8,000 tons of air pollutants being discharged daily. Brazil has tried to move away
from a pure command-and-control approach for pollution control—and for environmental
management more generally—and integrating environmental objectives with social and
economic ones was seen as a priority by the World Bank Env PRL team.

Brazil’s Environment and the Env PRL
1.23 In 1981 Brazil approved for the first time a National Environmental Policy, which
established a legal framework of general principles and definitions for guiding environmental
management in Brazil (Government of Brazil 1981). 12 Following that, Brazil developed a
number of plans focused on individual sectors and issues. However, unlike many other
World Bank client countries, Brazil did not have a comprehensive, up-to-date National

Environmental Strategy or National Environmental Action Plan at the time of the Env PRL to
establish priorities among the many competing environmental challenges facing the country.

1.24 Nonetheless, environment has since the 1970s been an issue of considerable
significance in the Bank’s assistance to Brazilian development, which was supported with
numerous investment loans and analytical and advisory activities. By the early 2000s, the
World Bank saw an opportunity to support Brazil in achieving balance between economic
growth on the one hand and environmental sustainability on the other, while ramping up its
lending portfolio in the sustainable development sector, through development policy lending.
There was also a broader effort by the Bank to increase sustainable development lending
through environmental development policy loans in Latin America that began with Mexico
and also included efforts in Peru and Colombia. The Env PRL itself represented the largest
World Bank loan to Brazil for the environment at the time (to be displaced in that regard later
by the even larger SEM DPL).

1.25 The Program Document for the Env PRL 1 begins by highlighting the motivation that
“in few countries is the national environment as crucial to development and people’s welfare,
and at the same time vital to a sustainable global ecology, as in Brazil.” The Program
Document identified the general environmental challenges facing Brazil as follows: “Brazil
is thus at a crossroads in its search for equitable and sustainable growth. It has to find the
right balance between its need to grow, reduce poverty, and maintain its natural resources
base.” It also reflected on the political environment at the time, noting that “this year is
President Lula’s opportunity to focus on the sustainability agenda.” The Program Document
attempted to make the case that further deterioration of environmental sustainability would
threaten progress on Brazil’s overall development agenda, including its poverty reduction
goals.

1.26 At the time that the Env PRL was prepared, the World Bank team saw Brazil “at a
crossroads in its search for equitable and sustainable growth.” It noted that “Brazil has done a
lot over the past two decades to improve environmental management at both the national and
sub-national levels.” However, the Env PRL Program Document noted that this was largely
based on a command and control approach, and environmental sustainability continued to
take a back seat to economic decisions. The World Bank team saw a need to “mainstream”
environmental concerns into “core economic and sector decisions” and macroeconomic
policies, to strike a more sustainable balance between economic growth, poverty reduction,
and the environment, and where possible to do this using economic incentives.

1.27 As noted above, the Program Document did not directly address the issue of Brazil’s
high poverty rate at the time. Instead, it puts much more emphasis on the tradeoffs—and
potential “win-win” opportunities—of economic growth and environmental sustainability. It
notes that while, in the case of Amazon deforestation for example, the lack of sustainable
environmental management or pollution controls could bring short-term economic gains,
negative environmental externalities also entailed significant economic and social costs that
were not being accounted for.

1.28 Although it did not discuss poverty reduction goals, the Program Document did
postulate that improved environmental management would “primarily accrue to the poor”,
                                               8


and that “economic growth would, in most cases, help address some of these problems more
easily.” It specifically mentions the threats from “lack of access to clean water, encroachment
into fragile lands and associated risks, and forest and land degradation.” The Program
Document highlighted that the Env PRL would therefore “[strengthen] Brazil’s
environmental management system while supporting growth strategies.”

1.29 The Env PRL was designed as a programmatic series of three operations financed by
three separate loans, with fifteen different policy areas and multiple government agencies in
addition to the official implementing agencies—the Ministry of Finance and the central
Ministry of Environment. The first operation, the Env PRL 1, was approved and disbursed in
2004. But the planned second and third operations never materialized. An Environmental
Technical Assistance Loan (Env TAL) was prepared to accompany the Env PRL and provide
necessary technical assistance through a more traditional investment loan. But it did not
become effective until 2006, nearly two years after the Env PRL 1. Several years later, in
2009, the World Bank approved another environmental development policy operation (DPO),
the Brazil First Programmatic Development Policy Loan for Sustainable Environmental
Management (SEM DPL), for which IEG prepared a separate PPAR (World Bank Report
No. 89848). It was also designed as a programmatic series and it was also canceled after the
first loan. The SEM DPL was even larger than the Env PRL, with the SEM DPL 1 alone
totaling US$1.3 billion—the largest single loan the World Bank ever made to Brazil. The
SEM DPL included a number of policy areas, actions, and agencies that were similar to those
of the Env PRL, so evaluating the Env PRL is important for understanding the context
leading up to the SEM DPL, and for understanding which reforms should be attributed to the
earlier Env PRL.

Evaluation Approach
1.30 One of the main objectives of an IEG PPAR is to gather evidence on outcomes of an
operation. In the case of the Env PRL this presents special challenges: no baseline data was
reported by the Bank team for the operation’s indicators, no intermediate outcome targets
were set for the loans in the series, no outcome data was collected, the required series ICR
was not prepared, and the operation closed relatively long ago. There are also issues of
attribution. The World Bank has financed numerous environmental activities in Brazil over
many years, as have bilateral donors and other international organizations. In addition to the
Env TAL, other activities with environmental policy and institutional capacity-strengthening
components included the Pilot Program to Conserve the Brazilian Rainforests (PPG7) and the
National Environmental Project. While these other activities were acknowledged in the
Program Document and the “Simplified ICR”, as the ICR Review notes, “the important
‘interplay’ between adjustment, investment and institutional strengthening lending is
mentioned but not analyzed”, and there is no effort to differentiate between the contributions
of the other activities and the Bank’s engagement under the Env PRL.

1.31 As explained in the Preface, there are additional reasons for carrying out this
evaluation besides gathering evidence on outcomes, including to establish which
intermediate results were achieved in the form of policy actions, to understand the potentially
innovative role of the operation as the Bank’s first environmental policy loan in Brazil, and
to learn lessons from the design processes involved.
                                               9


1.32 According to the OPCS/IEG harmonized evaluation Guidelines, a development policy
lending programmatic series is evaluated against the series-level objectives. In broad terms,
the sequence of reforms planned under the Env PRL series followed a similar pattern across
policy areas: for Env PRL 1, legislation would be drafted or approved; for Env PRL 2,
regulations for implementation would be established, or a system would be designed, and in
some cases implementation would begin; for Env PRL 3, implementation would be fully
scaled up. The evaluation therefore attempts to track progress beyond the Env PRL 1 where
possible.

1.33 The “Simplified ICR” that was completed for the Env PRL 1 is of little use in this
regard because it is mainly a restatement of the prior actions of the loan, which by definition
were already supposed to have been completed by the time the Program Document was
submitted to the Bank’s Board. On the other hand, the separate Env TAL operation that was
intended to accompany the Env PRL series was designed in part to provide monitoring and
evaluation of policy actions under the Env PRL. As part of that effort, the Brazilian
government coordination unit for the Env TAL maintained a system to track the achievement
of actions planned under the Env PRL (and registered the status in an Excel spreadsheet that
the Bank team shared with IEG). The ICR for the Env TAL operation, which was completed
in 2011, also provides more information on the actions. This was mostly limited to actions
planned under Env PRL 2, and focuses on what it calls “intermediate results” rather than
outcomes. IEG has attempted to fill in the gaps where possible through interviews and
additional data collection.

1.34 Besides the results of the Env PRL, this evaluation also attempts to shed some light
on the processes employed for preparation, supervision, and completion and evaluation, how
they might have contributed to the success or failure of the series, and how they differed
from processes employed in other cases—such as the later SEM DPL programmatic series.


2. Objectives, Design, and their Relevance
2.1     The statements in the Env PRL documentation regarding the objectives are somewhat
inconsistent in different places. The main text of the Program Document (p. 34) states the
objectives as follows:

The principal objective of the proposed program is to support Brazil’s goal of balancing
economic growth with social development and the maintenance and improvement of
environmental quality. Specifically, the Program aims at: increasing the effectiveness and
efficiency of Brazil’s environmental management system in balance with the objectives of
sustainable economic growth, equity, and poverty reduction; and, making the environment
and sustainable use of natural resources a concern of all sectors of the economy and
government (“mainstreaming”).

2.2      The Loan and Program Summary in the front of the Program Document, as well as
the Simplified ICR for Env PRL 1, include the first sentence, beginning with “The principal
objective…”, but do not include the sentence that begins “Specifically,…”. Both the main
text of the Program Document and the Loan and Program Summary also add the following
                                               10


statement: “The program would not only contribute directly to the quality of the environment
and the maintenance of natural resources, but it would also help reduce poverty and achieve a
higher quality of life for all Brazilians both directly and indirectly.” These statements are
very broad and ambitious, and somewhat inconsistent in different places. The references to
economy-wide objectives like growth, equity, and poverty reduction seem beyond the scope
of such an operation, and are more appropriate for CAS-level objectives. There is no clear,
separate objective statement for this specific operation, the Env PRL 1.

2.3     Through communications with the World Bank team, the author of the IEG Review
of the Simplified ICR “infers that this particular operation was aimed specifically at:

   1.    increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of Brazil’s environmental management
        system (EMS), including a green, brown and blue agenda, and
   2.    mainstreaming environmental sustainability in selected sector policies and
        programs.”

2.4    These latter statements are consistent with the contents of the Policy Matrix, and are
more evaluable than the statements in the Program Document. Considering that it was
previously used in the ICR Review and discussed with the World Bank management and
team, for the purposes of this evaluation, IEG will take the latter as the relevant objectives.

Relevance of Objectives
2.5    As noted in the previous section, the original objective statements for the program
were very broad and ambitious. The impacts on indicators such as growth, social
development, equity, and poverty would be difficult to monitor and evaluate, and are likely
beyond the scope of a program like the Env PRL to realistically affect.

2.6     The more specific objectives inferred from the Env PRL Results Matrix—on
increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of Brazil’s EMS and integrating environmental
sustainability concerns into sector policies and programs—are more realistic. There is strong
evidence that these objectives are relevant to Brazil’s national priorities and the Bank’s
support program in the country. The Program Document notes that the Env PRL is based on
the Brazilian government’s Environmental Reform Agenda, which is “embedded in the
federal government’s Multi-Year Plan” (or “PPA”) for 2004 to 2007, which “has the
following priorities:
   •    Improving the environmental management system;
   •    Implementing priority programs, such as those related to protected areas, forestry,
        water basin management and sustainable Amazon; and
   •    Mainstreaming of environmental sustainability across sectors and ministries.”

2.7     The Program Document also includes a copy of the client’s Letter of Development
Policy, which is a standard requirement for DPLs, and is meant to describe the client’s
program to be supported by the operation in the client’s own words. The LDP states that “the
Brazilian government is strongly committed to promoting sustainable growth with social
                                              11


inclusion.” It asserts that Brazil has made significant progress on the environmental front,
resulting in “one of the most modern environmental management systems worldwide.”

2.8      However, the government’s LDP also acknowledges that much remains to be done to
increase the effectiveness of Brazil’s EMS and reverse the historical practice of non-
sustainable use of natural resources. Specific needs referred to include combatting
deforestation in the Amazon and Atlantic forests, reducing air and water pollution, improving
institutional capacity and information availability for the EMS, introducing incentives, and
“coordination of sector policies”.

2.9     The World Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) at the time the Env PRL
1 was approved—and closed—was the 2003-2007 Brazil CAS, titled “A More Equitable,
Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil” (World Bank 2003). As the title implies, there is a
central emphasis on sustainability in the CAS. The document noted that “environmental
vulnerabilities” were among the most important risks facing the country at the time, and in
that context, concluded that “growth must be generated with equity and sustainability.”

2.10 The 2003-2007 CAS specifically mentions a “Sustainable Development
Programmatic Reform Loan Series” as one of the activities requested by government that the
World Bank planned to support under the sustainability dimension, contributing specifically
to the “long-term country goals” of “better water quality and water resource management”
and “more sustainable land management, forests and biodiversity”. It is worth noting that
with regard to instruments, the CAS foresaw a “continued key role for Policy-based lending
and technical assistance (up to 50 percent of the lending ceiling), to support systemic
reforms.”

2.11 In light of Brazil’s priorities and its Multi-Year Plan, and the World Bank’s Brazil
CAS over the relevant period, the general theme of the Env PRL’s objectives is clearly
relevant. However, the way the objectives are stated in the Program Document is broad and
somewhat inconsistent in different places. The objectives appear to have been overly
ambitious given the scale of Brazil’s environmental challenges, and the limited size of the
World Bank’s program in relation (even though for the World Bank the Env PRL 1 loan was
quite large). Overall, the Relevance of Objectives is rated Substantial.

Design
2.12 The Env PRL was designed as a programmatic series of up to three loans to the
Federal Government of Brazil for a total of approximately US$1.2 billion. The first loan, Env
PRL 1—the subject of this evaluation—was for a total of US$502.52 million disbursed in a
single tranche on IBRD terms. The loan was approved by the World Bank’s Board on August
24, 2004. It became effective on November 8, 2004, was fully disbursed, and closed on
December 31, 2004. From the concept date to appraisal to full disbursement, the operation
spanned less than nine months.

2.13 The key to understanding the design and intended program logic for any DPL is the
policy matrix. For the Env PRL, the policy matrix from the World Bank’s Program
Document is reproduced in Annex B. The policy matrix specifies “prior actions” that were
                                             12


supposed to have been completed prior to disbursement of Env PRL 1, “key next steps” that
“refer to actions to a possible second loan in 12 to 18 months”, and “medium-term actions”
that “refer to actions to a possible third loan in 24 to 36 months”. The policy matrix also
includes “expected outcome indicators by 12/2007”. No intermediate outcome indicators
were provided for the Env PRL 1.

2.14 Policy actions for the Env PRL were organized into fifteen policy areas covering
nearly the full spectrum of environmental issues in Brazil. The policy areas were in turn
regrouped into two “components”: “First Component: improve environmental management
system” and “Second Component: mainstream environmental sustainability in selected
government sectors”. The first component was further divided into three sub-components:
“A. Strengthen the environmental management system”, “B. Improve the green agenda”, “C.
Improve the brown agenda”, and “D. Improve the blue agenda”. The policy areas, as
originally designed in the Program Document, are summarized below and reproduced with
their actions in their entirety in Annex B.

First Component: Improve Environmental Management System
Sub-component A. Strengthen the environmental management system
2.15 The program sought to support policy reforms to strengthen Brazil’s EMS through (i)
environmental management integration among the three levels of government, including the
environmental licensing processes; (ii) institutional strengthening of MMA and IBAMA; and
(iii) improvement of transparency of environmental information, including environmental
licensing processes.

2.16 By supporting these policy areas, the Env PRL aimed to: (i) decrease by 25 percent
the time for IBAMA to issue a report on licensing of major projects, and reduce negative
environmental and social impacts of major projects; (ii) increase “the percentage of execution
of the targets established in the key programs compared with Jan/2003” (presumably for
MMA and IBAMA); (iii) decrease the percentage of disputed environmental licensing
decisions at the federal level, and increase “the number of accesses to the information system
compared with June/2004”.

Sub-component B. Improve the green agenda
2.17 The program sought to support policy reforms to improve forest management in
Brazil through (i) protection of the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado; and (ii) sustainability of
forest management more generally. By supporting these measures, the Env PRL aimed to: (i)
reduce net deforestation to zero in priority conservation areas of the Atlantic Forest, and
double the total federal areas under protection in the Cerrado compared with January 2003;
and (ii) sustainable management of 15 million hectares of forest in the Amazon, and
establishment of 400,000 hectares of new forest per year in already cleared areas.
                                               13


Sub-component C. Improve the brown agenda
2.18 The program sought to support policy reforms to improve the management of
hazardous chemicals. By supporting these measures, the Env PRL aimed to decrease by 20
percent the number of accidents and of people affected by hazardous chemicals compared
with January 2003.

Sub-component D. Improve the blue agenda
2.19 The program sought to support policy reforms to improve the management of water
resources management. By supporting these measures, the Env PRL aimed to: (i) increase the
percentage of the volume of water used that is licensed at the Federal level compared to
January 2003; (ii) achieve the operation of water basin agencies in six key river basins; and
(iii) achieve the financial sustainability of the water resources management system in at least
six key river basins.

Second Component: Mainstream environmental sustainability in selected
government sectors
2.20 The second component has no sub-components, but includes a total of eight different
policy areas, designed to represent different sectors into which environment would be
“mainstreamed”. The program sought to support policy reforms to mainstream environmental
sustainability through: (i) control of deforestation in the Amazon; (ii) “development of the
Amazon with environmental sustainability”; (iii) mainstreaming environmental concerns in
the sanitation sector; (iv) integration of environmental economic zoning within regional
development planning; (v) mainstreaming environmental sustainability in financial and fiscal
policies; (vi) improvement of the environmental sustainability of the energy sector; (vii)
improvement of the environmental sustainability of the Agrarian Reform; and (viii)
improvement of the environmental sustainability of the tourism sector.

2.21 By supporting these measures, the Env PRL aimed to: (i) decrease illegal land
appropriations and create over 12 million hectares of protected areas in the region of
influence of the BR-163 highway; (ii) increase by 15 percent the total revenue from certified
sustainable natural resources management activities compared with January 2003, and
increase by 30 percent the sustainable economic use of existing cleared and abandoned areas;
(iii) the abatement of 100,000 kg BOD/day of pollution discharge due to PRODES
implementation, decrease by 15 percent the number of people hospitalized with water-related
diseases in PRODES areas, and increase by five percent the area of municipalities
“occupied” in accordance with socio-environmental use criteria defined by municipal master
plans; (iv) increase by five percent the area of “land use and occupation” in accordance with
regional development plans, 24 months after launch; (v) increase in the volume of lending
based on the Green Protocol; (vi) decrease in the socially and environmentally negative
impacts of major energy projects, and decrease by five percent the energy consumption “per
product unit” in key sectors defined in the strategic plan; (vii) “increase in 15 percent of the
RL and APP areas (as defined by the Brazilian Forest Code) in the settlements effectively
                                                 14


implemented” 13, and “decrease in 15 percent in degraded areas in the settlements”; and (viii)
increase “increase of the environmental sustainability in key regions measured by established
indicators”.

Relevance of Design
2.22 The original objectives of the Env PRL program, as stated in the Program
Document—i.e., “to support Brazil’s goal of balancing economic growth with social
development and the maintenance and improvement of environmental quality”—were too
broad and imprecise to be linked directly to the actions and intermediate outcomes of the
series, which is why the objectives inferred from the Policy Matrix are being used for the
purposes of this evaluation. The program logic is represented by the Policy Matrix developed
for the Env PRL 1 Program Document.

2.23 The two specific, monitorable objectives used for this evaluation—increasing the
effectiveness and efficiency of Brazil’s environmental management system, and
mainstreaming environmental sustainability in selected sector policies and programs—can be
considered necessary for achieving the broader goals for the Env PRL program. But they are
unlikely to be sufficient, particularly with regard to the “social development” side, since this
factored very little into the reforms supported under the program.

2.24 The World Bank team made a strong case for the need for major policy and
institutional reforms in order to improve Brazil’s environmental management system, and
also that such reforms would build on and complement the World Bank’s other
environmental activities in Brazil such as investment lending operations and analytical work
(AAA).

2.25 The causal chain from the policy actions and triggers to the intended outcomes, sub-
objectives, and objectives (at least those inferred), as described in the Policy Matrix, was
generally sound for many of the policy areas. For example for the first policy area,
environmental management integration among the three levels of government including
environmental licensing processes, the prior action under Env PRL 1 was to establish
procedures for committees comprising the three levels of government; for Env PRL 2 the
committees were supposed to be created and legislation harmonized at the three levels of
government in three states; and for Env PRL 3 the government was supposed to establish
rules for decentralizing environmental licensing, improve post-license monitoring, and scale
up the harmonization of legislation to ten more states. This was expected to lead to the
outcome of faster license application processing and improved environmental and social
outcomes from investments. Altogether, these actions and the resulting outcomes should
have contributed to improving the effectiveness and efficiency of Brazil’s EMS.

2.26 In a few cases, the logic of the project design can be unclear or inconsistent. For
example, under “Improve the Green Agenda”, the second sub-component of the first

13
 According to the Program Document, this refers to increasing the areas of Legal Reserves and
Areas of Permanent Protection (which are types of protected areas defined in the Brazilian Forest
Code) in government-sponsored settlements as part of “agrarian reform and colonization”.
                                               15


component, there are policy areas on protection of the Atlantic forest and Cerrado that were
supposed to lead to decreased deforestation in those biomes, and on “Sustainability of Forest
Management” in general that was expected to lead to sustainable management of parts of the
Amazon forest. But then under the second component there are two separate policy areas on
reducing deforestation and “sustainable natural resources management” in the Amazon. It is
unclear why deforestation initiatives for different biomes should be organized under different
components and objectives, or why reducing deforestation in and sustainably managing the
Amazon forest should appear under multiple policy areas.

2.27 Although the project logic was mostly sound, that does not mean that the outcome
indicators were well-designed in every case. Issues with the indicators are discussed in detail
in the Monitoring and Evaluation section below, but they include indicators that are not
readily measurable or monitorable, or that do not reflect the desired outcome.

2.28 As explained under Evaluation Approach in Section 1 above, the design of the Env
PRL programmatic series had many policy areas following a similar pattern, with
preliminary work such as drafting of legislation or preparation of strategies under Env PRL
1, and full implementation being achieved only under Env PRL 2 or 3. For example, under
the policy area on “Improvement of transparency of environmental information”, the prior
action under Env PRL 1 was to approve the “legislation which establishes public availability
of environmental information”, under Env PRL 2 the next step was to design the public
environmental information system, and finally under Env PRL 3 the system was supposed to
be implemented and data made available to the public. Clearly, the policy area would fall
short of its objectives if the system were only legislated and even designed, but never
implemented. This “backloading” of key reform actions in the design of the program created
a risk of not completing the reform agenda if the series was not completed and the Brazilian
government did not continue with the reforms without the Env PRL.

2.29 An area where the design was somewhat inconsistent with the objectives is in the
level of government targeted. All of the Env PRL implementing agencies and “partner”
agencies were at the federal level. Many overarching environmental laws and policies are
approved at the national level, and the Federal government is largely responsible for
enforcement of laws related to the Amazon and for management of water basins that span
more than one state. However, especially with the increasing emphasis on decentralization of
government functions in Brazil (including under this operation), implementation of many
environmental laws and policies is the responsibility of state and municipal governments. But
other than the setting up of tripartite committees under the first policy area, neither state nor
municipal government reforms were targeted in the Policy Matrix.

2.30 The design of legislating/strategizing, designing, and implementing reforms across
Env PRL 1, 2 and 3 is causally linked and logically correct in most—though not all—cases,
although by predominantly targeting reform agendas that were focused at the federal level
and not fully implemented until the second or third operation, it created a risk of non-
completion of the agenda. Overall, the Relevance of Design is rated Substantial.
                                                   16


3. Achievement of the Objectives
3.1     Evaluating the Achievement of Objectives involves assessing not only whether each
of the key outcomes indicated in the operation’s statement of objectives has been achieved,
but also whether the outcomes can be attributed to the actions supported by the operation. 14
In the case of the Env PRL, no intermediate outcome indicators were identified in the design
of the operation against which to assess the efficacy, only expected outcomes by the end of
the series (“by 12/2007”). Moreover, the OPCS/IEG harmonized evaluation Guidelines state
that for a DPL series, “the programmatic ICR should include and justify ratings for the
program based on the overall programmatic series” (OPCS 2006 (2014)). Therefore, the Env
PRL 1 has to be evaluated against the series outcome indicators and objectives, even though
the rest of the series was canceled.

3.2     The goal of this evaluation is to establish whether the intended outcomes were
achieved. The evaluation is also interested in the achievement of the policy actions that were
planned under the series subsequent to Env PRL 1, since these were not reported in a series
ICR, although the information is important for determining attribution under the later SEM
DPL. The discussion that follows assesses the evidence available for achievement of the
policy reforms—and where possible the associated outcomes—for each of the two main
objectives identified in Section 2 above.


Objective 1: Increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of Brazil’s
environmental management system, including a green, brown and blue
agenda
1.A Strengthening of the Environmental Management System
3.3     With regard to environmental management integration among the three levels of
government, including environmental licensing processes, in the Simplified ICR the authors
reported two pieces of information. On page 8, Annex I, it is stated that "Procedures for the
establishment of Committees (Comissões Tripartites) consisting of the three levels of
government formally established and 14 state committees legally created", which was the
prior action for Env PRL 1. It also states on page 3 that “GOB had formally established
Committees (Comissões Tripartites) consisting of the three levels of government in 24 states
out of 27,” as progress towards the action planned under Env PRL 2.

3.4    According to the 2011 ICR for the Env TAL (p. 23), this policy action was partially
achieved. Lists of classification of projects and activities with environmental and local
impacts were made together with state-level environmental agencies (OEMAs) for four



14
  For good practice in designing the results framework for a DPL, OPCS states: “Don’t include
results that are not directly influenced by actions that are part of the operations or programmatic
series of operations supported by the Bank.” (OPCS 2011)
                                                 17


states. Seven other OEMAs also had such a list at that time. However, there is still a need to
harmonize the classification through a federal agreement among all states.

3.5     Efforts made by the Ministry of Environment to establish the Committees had
positive impacts on institutional cooperation. The initiative promoted the strengthening of
organizational culture and learning processes to build and enhance intergovernmental
cooperation on environment. This was the case of States such as Rio Grande do Sul, Rio de
Janeiro and Minas Gerais.

3.6     The institutional solutions adopted for environmental management integration were
useful, though they have more recently been superseded. They should be reviewed according
to the Federal Law approved on December 2011 (law n. 140/2011), which established the
roles for the three levels of government on licensing activities (Complementary Law n.
140/2011). As a consequence, the earlier agreements may have lapsed or need currently
adaptations. In some cases states and municipalities already established updated agreements
based on Law 140; but most states are still in the process of adapting their legislations and
procedures. There is also some question of attribution, as some sources claim that the World
Bank-financed Brazil National Environmental Project 1 (NEP-1) promoted the establishment
of the Committees before the Env PRL.

3.7      With regard to the expected outcome indicators for this policy area on decreasing the
time required by IBAMA to issue a licensing report, there are problems with the indicator
itself, as it reflects outputs rather than environmental outcomes, and issuing licenses faster
could have an adverse impact on quality. 15 The other indicator for this policy area, on
reduction of socially and environmentally negative impacts of major projects, could have
been an important indicator of positive outcomes from the policy actions supported under the
Env PRL. But IEG was informed that this information is not collected.

3.8    More generally, there continue to be problems with the environmental licensing
process in Brazil, and specifically at IBAMA. These problems were highlighted in a
subsequent World Bank study of the environmental licensing process in Brazil (World Bank
2008), and more recently in TOR for consulting assignments to improve the issued by the
Ministry of Environment in relation to another World Bank-financed project—the National
Environment Project II—that describe serious challenges with regard to the capacity of
IBAMA staff and the institutional and regulatory framework in which it operates (Ministry of
Environment 2013a, 2013b).

3.9     With regard to the institutional strengthening of the MMA and IBAMA, according to
the Simplified ICR (p. 3), the GOB had at the time launched the selection process to hire
career staff at the Ministry of Environment and IBAMA. The Simplified ICR (p. 8) also
stated that the “Environmental Specialist” position was created, the public selection process
to hire staff was carried out, and the diagnosis of the administrative structure of the MMA

15
  The Brazilian government provided data to IEG showing that the number of licenses issued by
IBAMA per year has increased several times since 2003, but this is a different measure than the time
required to issue a license, and suffers from the same drawbacks of being at the output level and not
reflecting quality.
                                              18


prepared; reorganization of the new institutional structure for the MMA and IBAMA was
presented to the Ministry of Planning; and the public selection processes to fill 100 vacancies
in the MMA and 610 in IBAMA was authorized. The Env TAL monitoring spreadsheet
indicates that the policy actions related to institutional structure and staff were fully
achieved: all vacancies were filled through a public selection process, and a federal Decree
created the new institutional structure for IBAMA and MMA.

3.10 According to the ICR for the Env TAL (p. 33), the “medium-term” policy action on
training of staff was fully achieved: 885 new IBAMA and ICMBio environmental analysts
were trained with excellent results, in cooperation with the Env TAL. The training included a
course on IBAMA’s and ICMBio’s institutional roles. In addition, several thematic courses
were presented on environmental monitoring, environmental quality, forest management,
conservation units, general wildlife management, and environmental licensing. Regarding the
improvement of the national statistics system, the Env TAL ICR (p. 33) reports that a study
was completed to define and systemize a set of nationwide environmental indicators of
sustainable development.

3.11 With regard to achievement of the expected outcomes for this policy area, the
outcome indicator from the Program Document, “Increase in the percentage of execution of
the targets established in the key programs compared with Jan/2003”, is highly vague and
general.

3.12 Based on interviews conducted by IEG for this evaluation, multiple sources indicated
that this policy area is likely where the Env PRL had the greatest impact—at least for the
Ministry of Environment. The situation before the operation was described as one where the
Ministry of Environment was relatively weak, understaffed, and with low capacity to
implement its mandate. There were only about 100 people total working for the Federal
Ministry of Environment, and there were no career paths for environmental specialists or
environmental managers. Those working on environmental policy were mainly short-term
consultants who, according to sources familiar with the situation at the time, were paid from
a variety of poorly coordinated, donor-funded projects. Key informants confirmed that the
Env PRL served as an important tool to strengthen the bargaining position of the Ministry of
Environment and get them a seat at the table with key ministries such as Finance and
Planning, who would have to approve any increase in budgets or staffing levels. After the
Env PRL helped to secure the agreement of Finance and Planning, the Ministry of
Environment was able to create the position of environmental specialist, and through a public
selection and hiring process, increase its staff by 3-4 times with civil servants on open-ended
contracts. The additional staff gave the Ministry of Environment the ability to increase its
capacity in other important respects as well, such as the creation of an environmental
economics and policy unit within the Ministry. The increased budgetary resources for the
environment have reportedly continued over time.

3.13 The situation in IBAMA differs in some important respects from that in the Ministry
of Environment. The IBAMA staff prior to the changes were reportedly what could best be
described as rangers who performed more of a policing function, and IBAMA had difficulty
in meeting the demand for issuance of environmental licenses, particularly for large
infrastructure projects, such as electricity generation. Increasing their capacity and
                                             19


efficiency—as well as the quality of environmental and social results—was therefore
identified as a priority by the Brazilian government and Bank team, as reflected in
discussions during preparation missions and in the Program Document. The hiring of new
staff began in the early days of engagement under the Env PRL, in 2002 and 2003, as
explained in the Program Document. Moreover, a book describing the evolution of
environmental law and institutions in Brazil notes: “In 2002, IBAMA was granted a long-
awaited authorization to hire a group of six hundred new permanent
employees…Importantly, the 2002 round of hiring represented a moment of institutional
renewal and growth for IBAMA…. The hiring was part of a restructuring of IBAMA aimed
at ‘modernizing, updating information technology, increasing institutional agility, and
improving the agency’s services to society.’” (McAllister 2008)

3.14 But in interviews, IEG was told that there were problems with the large-scale hiring
that took place. Many of those eventually hired were reportedly government employees from
other agencies (for example, Ministry of Finance) who had been furloughed due to budget
cuts, and who were given priority in the hiring process, despite in many cases having no
experience or education relevant to the environment. So it was essential for these people to
receive relevant training, equipment and support. The training provided was criticized for
being poorly targeted and insufficient. So while some of the new hires succeeded many did
not. Most importantly, as explained in the discussion of the previous policy area, major
problems continued to plague IBAMA and the environmental licensing process after the Env
PRL supported reforms, and indeed continue to this day. The 2009 Program Document for
the SEM DPL notes the need to further restructure MMA and IBAMA “to improve
effectiveness in implementing the environmental policies and to best respond to current
challenges”. It also notes that “IBAMA does not have sufficient staff” (World Bank 2009).
These are indications that IBAMA still had problems with staffing and its structure even after
the hiring and restructuring supported by the Env PRL.

3.15 Even more recently, in 2013 IBAMA issued Terms of Reference for consultancies
paid for by another World Bank-financed project—The National Environment Program 2—
to improve the environmental licensing system and capacity of its staff (IBAMA 2013a;
IBAMA 2013b). The Terms of Reference cite an array of problems that continue to adversely
affect the environmental licensing system in Brazil several years after the SEM DPL, and
which cannot be addressed by hiring additional staff. They include: “the need of greater
transparence”; “a deficit in the management capacity of methods—standards, concepts and
procedures—that makes the monitoring and control of results difficult”; “blanks, overlapping
and ambiguities in the definition of concepts, standards and procedures related to the FEL,
EIA, EC processes”; “low capacity to meet the demands and the lack of integration of
standards and compatibility of procedures among the partner agencies”; and “deficiencies in
the capacitation of environmental analysts”. The Terms of Reference warn that these
problems “can compromise the licensing quality” and were resulting in “the amplification of
the environmental conflicts.”

3.16 With regard to the action planned under Env PRL 2 on “improvement of the National
Statistic System with the inclusion of environmental indicators for monitoring”, there is now
a set of indicators collected and made publicly available by the Brazilian Institute for
                                                20


Geography and Statistics (IGBE) on natural resources and environment. 16 This includes
information on Brazilian flora and fauna (including endangered species), land use, water
resources, soils, and climate. Detailed maps and reports have been produced with the data
collected, and are also available on the website.

3.17 With regard to improvement of transparency of environmental information, including
environmental licensing processes, the Simplified ICR mentions that an integrated website
was implemented, where all information regarding licensing procedures at the federal and
state levels would be available to the public (municipalities would be included in a later
stage) (p.3). It states elsewhere that "Legislation that establishes public availability of
environmental information, including tracking of environmental licensing process, approved"
(sic, p.8). The Env TAL ICR states that “the National Environmental Licensing Portal
(PNLA) was formally launched in 2005.” The website is quite comprehensive and can be
accessed by the public. 17 .

3.18 With regard to the expected outcome indicator on “decrease in percentage of the
number of disputed decisions compared with the number of licenses issued at Federal level”,
the data is not available. However, in interviews conducted by IEG, representatives of the
Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office in Brazil stated that the absolute number of disputed
decisions has increased over time (although so has the number of license applications).

1.B Improve the Green Agenda
3.19 With regard to protection of the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado, according to the ICR
for the Env TAL, the actions related to protection of the Atlantic Forest were considered to
be achieved. The Atlantic Forest Law was approved on December 22, 2006, and Decree nº
6660, that regulates it, was approved on November 21, 2008, four years after the Env PRL 1.
The Atlantic Forest Program was launched in 2009. According to the Env TAL ICR, three
regional meetings were held to provide inputs to the draft Decree and Program concerning
Atlantic Rainforest Law and Atlantic Rainforest Program. A book (“Atlantic Forest: A
National Heritage”) was prepared, published and distributed to decision-makers (p. 23-24).

3.20 In terms of the impact of these actions and the Env PRL, the picture is not entirely
clear. The figure below presents data on the annual rate of deforestation of the Atlantic
rainforest. Certainly, deforestation there has been a major problem for many years. But the
rate has come down over time, with the biggest reduction coming in 2001, when
deforestation was cut by more than half, but that was before the Env PRL. There was another
marked reduction in deforestation between 2008 and 2009, when the actions supported by the
Env PRL were implemented. Although the reduction in absolute terms was smaller than the
one in 2001, it was still a significant drop. More recently, since 2011, deforestation is
creeping up again, with nearly 24,000 hectares taken from 2012 to 2013, and this should be

guarded against. Overall, Brazil has made substantial progress in reducing deforestation of
the Atlantic rainforest.

3.21 According to the Env TAL ICR, the targets related to the Cerrado were considered
achieved, because a preliminary document for Cerrado protection program was prepared and
submitted to public consultation. The Sustainable Cerrado Program was formally established
by Decree No. 5.577 of November 2005. The Plan for Deforestation Control in the Cerrado
was launched in September 2010. Studies were carried out to identify priority areas in four
Cerrado states for the creation of conservation units. Consulting work supported the
preparation of the draft Deforestation Control Plan in the Cerrado (Env TAL ICR, p. 23-24).
However, interviews by IEG with Brazilian officials indicate that while the Cerrado Plan was
modeled after the PPCDAM program that was instrumental in reducing Amazon
deforestation, the Cerrado Plan is not working as well.

3.22 The development of a Cerrado Law that the Env PRL series was meant to support
never bore fruit. The Env TAL monitoring spreadsheet notes that although a draft law was
submitted, “for now it has been dropped as a goal”. As of the time of the IEG mission in
2013, there was still no Cerrado Law in place. With regard to outcomes, IEG has not been
able to find up-to-date data on deforestation rates in the Cerrado, which in itself is a sign of
management deficiencies. Brazilian officials admit that reducing Amazon deforestation was
the priority in the 2000s, that the Cerrado has been given lower priority, and that systems for
monitoring forest cover change there are not well developed. 18 The latest data available is
from the 2009-2010 period. 19 The Brazilian government indicates that the deforestation rate
was reduced from 2008, but it was still nearly 6,500 km2, and two years is not enough to
measure a trend. There is no explanation as to why the government stopped monitoring (or at
least reporting on) Cerrado deforestation at that point. FAO estimates that the average annual
loss of forest cover in the Cerrado between 2005 and 2010 was 1.24 percent, which is the

same rate between 2000 and 2005, and slightly higher than the rate of 1.19 percent from 1990
to 2000. 20 Moreover, with regard to the Env PRL indicator on increasing Federal protected
areas in the Cerrado, the figure remains very low, with varying estimates of 1.4-5.5 percent
reported to be under protection, and this has caused concern among conservationists. 21 This
compares to estimates of approximately 47 percent of the Amazon to be under protection
(Nepstad and others 2014). The Cerrado is still considered to be under significant threat,
particularly from agricultural conversion, with some considering the deforestation there to
now be more severe than in the Amazon. 22

3.23 With regard to the Sustainability of Forest Management policy area, based on the text
of the Program Document (paras. 4.27-4.30), the objectives of this policy area are understood
to mean “the sustainable exploitation of native forests”, as well as the establishment of
sustainably managed commercial forests in already cleared areas. The Env TAL ICR
considers the actions related to the creation of the Public Forest Management Law to be
achieved with the approval of Law no. 11284-2006 on public forest management. On the
other hand, actions related to the reform of the forest replacement fee are considered "not
achieved"—as reflected by the World Bank in its ICR of the Env TAL—although the ICR
goes on to say that the fee was no longer necessary because the responsibility was transferred
to the states (which was not a policy action supported by the Env PRL). No information is
provided in the Env TAL ICR or the Brazilian government on implementation of the fees by
the states.

3.24 In interviews conducted by IEG with Brazilian Forestry Service staff, they confirmed
that the Public Forest Management Law was approved in 2006, and that it has been a success
in terms of creating the Forest Service and contributing to sustainable forest management.
CONAFLOR was also created.

3.25 The text of the Program Document refers primarily to the National Forest Plan (PNF)
rather than the Public Forest Management Law. With regard to medium-term outcomes, the
Program Document states that “the institutional framework to manage the PNF would be
strengthened” and that “the desired outcomes are the sustainable management of 15 million
hectares (from the current 1 million hectares) in the Amazon and the establishment of 400
thousand hectares of new commercial forest per year…”. “Sustainable management” can be
defined and understood in different ways, and the Env PRL documentation does not elaborate
on this. Another World Bank program in Brazil, the Amazon Regional Protected Areas
(ARPA) Program, says that it “addresses deforestation by expanding and consolidating areas

under strict protection”. 23 The World Bank has stated that “by the implementation of the
second phase, ARPA’s first two milestones were surpassed with the establishment of 62
million hectares of new protected areas. ARPA now covers nearly 70 million hectares of
rainforest.” This would seem to surpass by far the 15 million hectares targeted by the Env
PRL, but it is unclear whether they are referring to the same areas (see discussion on BR-163
below).

3.26 One third party assessment comes to the following conclusion about the changes
ushered in by the 2006 Public Forest Management Law:

Since 2006 forest management (i.e. timber harvesting) has been permitted in Brazil’s public
forests through forest concession contracts that can span up to 40 years. Concessions are
granted through a transparent tendering and/or bidding process for the production of timber
and/or non-timber products or services. Each year the Brazilian Forest Service prepares an
Annual Forest Concessions Plan, which is a major instrument of policy planning for forest
concessions in public forests. 24

These are important improvements over the situation prior to the new Law. However, there
are reportedly challenges in implementing the new policies, with reports that “Brazil’s
native-forest concession system for public forests is still in an early stage of implementation,
with only one concession (covering an area of 96,300 hectares) approved in the Amazon.”
(ITTO 2011) This falls short of the 15 million hectares of the Amazon targeted by the Env
PRL. On the other hand, private certification initiatives have grown, with the Forest
Stewardship Council reporting “an area of 7.446 million hectares of Brazilian forests are
under FSC certification, ranking the country 5th place in terms of total FSC certified forest
area” (including areas outside the Amazon) at the end of 2013. 25

1.C Improve the Brown Agenda
3.27 With regard to improvement of the management of hazardous chemicals, the Env
TAL monitoring spreadsheet notes that the following actions were undertaken and
considered achieved:

      •   elaboration of a strategic, implementation and management plan for the creation of
          the National Register of Emissions and Transport of Contaminants (RETP), and
          establishment of an information portal,
      •   elaboration of a proposal for a RETP information system,
      •   established a dialogue between MMA and States on RETP.

3.28 The RETP website provides information on the releases and transfers of potentially
polluting substances.

3.29 For actions related to the development of an implementation plan for the National
Plan for Prevention, Preparation and Rapid Response to Environmental Emergencies due to
Hazardous Chemical Products (P2R2), the monitoring spreadsheet indicates that by the time
the Env TAL closed in 2011, the actions were just being initiated. The P2R2 Plan itself was
approved in 2004 by Presidential Decree No. 5.098. 26 The Env PRL series, along with the
Env TAL, was supposed to support the development of implementation modalities and the
actual launch and implementation of the plan. The Env TAL ICR indicates that at that time
(September 2011), a draft P2R2 Plan was still being considered.

3.30 World Bank Management states that the P2R2 has been operational since 2005, and
referred IEG to MMA’s website for documentation and implementation of the P2R2 Plan. A
detailed description of the P2R2 is available on the MMA website. 27 There is less evidence
of the implementation status and results. Summary statistics provided by the MMA on
accidents involving hazardous chemicals only go up to 2010, 28 and the last environmental
emergency registered in the publicly accessible database was from 2011. 29

3.31 With regard to the planned inventory of contaminated sites, both the Env TAL
monitoring spreadsheet and the ICR note that the related actions—including the development
of a methodology for mapping areas at risk of accidents involving hazardous chemicals—
were not achieved.

3.32 There is no information available on the achievement of the outcome indicator related
to the reduction of the number of accidents.

1.D Improve the Blue Agenda
3.33 With regard to improvement of water resources management, for the proposed
increase of the percentage of the volume of water used that is licensed at the Federal level as
compared to January 2003, World Bank program documents do not provide information on
the baseline indicator or on the results achieved. Information is available from the Brazilian
Federal Water Resources Agency (ANA) on the Federal water licensing requirements and
how to apply for a license. 30 With respect to water basin agencies in operation in at least six
key river basins, no information is provided on which river basins are considered "key", nor

on the results achieved. Regarding the payment for usage of bulk water, this policy tool was
implemented and is operated in the following four river basins, managed by the Federal
Government: Paraiba do Sul basin, Piracxicaba - Jundiaí - Capivari basin, São Francisco
river basin and Doce river basin. In the states of Bahia and Ceará there is also a bulk water
fee (ANA, 2013). The National Water Resources Plan was approved by the Water Resources
National Council through the Resolution 58/2006 and revised on 2011, in order to specify
priorities to the period 2012-2015. According to the Env TAL ICR, all Env TAL planned
activities were achieved in relation to supporting the National Water Resources Plan.

3.34 With regard to the intended outcomes, Brazilian national water management policy is
generally considered to be a successful policy area. IEG interviews with the Brazilian Water
Resources Agency (ANA) indicated that the percentage of water volume licensed at the
Federal level increased significantly, and four of six targeted water basin agencies are in
operation. With regard to the last indicator, on financial sustainability of the water resources
management system in at least six key river basins, progress has taken longer than expected.
They are still in the process of implementing water pricing in the targeted water basin
agencies. The collection of payments needs to be strengthened, and resources are still
insufficient to cover staffing costs. Nevertheless, considering how difficult it is to implement
water pricing anywhere in the world, establishing and beginning to implement a system is an
important achievement.

3.35 For Objective 1, not all of the policy areas and reforms were of equal importance.
The Env PRL is credited with contributing to the raising of the profile and agenda of the
Ministry of Environment and associated agencies, resulting in improved engagement with
other important parts of the government, such as the Ministry of Finance. This in turn likely
contributed to strengthened budgets and staffing for the Ministry of Environment around the
time of the Env PRL 1 in 2004, which was of high importance for advancing the
sustainability agenda in Brazil. The reduction of deforestation in the Atlantic Forest, with its
high biodiversity value, and the introduction of a system for water charges were also
important achievements. In other areas, such as the protection of the Cerrado, improvement
of the environmental licensing process, and improved management of hazardous chemicals,
evidence suggests that significant challenges remain to this day.

3.36 There was significant follow-up on reforms after the Env PRL 1—particularly those
envisioned under the Env PRL2—despite the cancelation of the remaining two-thirds of the
Env PRL series, thanks in part to the associated but separate Env TAL project that continued
for more than six years after the Env PRL 1. Achievement of Objective 1 is rated
Substantial.

Objective 2: Mainstreaming environmental sustainability in selected sector
policies and programs
3.37 With regard to control of deforestation in the Amazon, the Env TAL monitoring
spreadsheet considered that some of the policy actions were achieved. It is stated that the BR-
163 highway environmental-economic zoning (ZEE) guidelines were selected, 100 local staff
were trained on territorial management issues, and the zoning of the area was defined.
Inspections on illegal logging and deforestation were carried out, promoted by an interagency
                                                  26


cooperation arrangement that gathered the Ministries of Justice, Defense, Work and
Environment. However, the monitoring spreadsheet states that there is “no information” on
progress with regard to the action under Env PRL 2 on “definition of the land tenure in
critical areas”. The ICR for the Env TAL notes that “a detailed ZEE for area of influence of
BR-163 was adopted through Pará State Law 199 and enacted in 2008.” 31 However, the BR-
163 ZEE was only instituted in 2009 (State of Pará law no. 7243/2009) and regulated in 2010
(Federal Decree no. 7130/2010), some years after the Env PRL 1, and for only one of the
multiple states that the BR-163 traverses.

3.38 The Brazilian government reports that they launched a Sustainable BR-163 Plan in
2006, followed by a Project BR-163 in 2009, which promoted the development of ZEE. 32 In
addition, the Project BR-163 was intended to promote the creation of protected areas and
land regularization. 33 The European Commission launched a “Mid-Term Evaluation of the
BR-163 Project”, out of concern that the “implementation rate has been markedly low”, with
two of three components showing no progress. 34 IEG could find no other evidence of the
results of these BR-163 activities.

3.39 With regard to the outcome indicators on decreased illegal land appropriation and
creation of 12 million hectares of protected areas in the region of influence of BR-163, as
discussed in the Quality at Entry section below, these might not have been the best indicators
for this policy area. They relate to only certain aspects of the problem, and do not indicate
progress on the objective of controlling Amazon deforestation overall. Moreover,
information on illegal land appropriation is hard to come by due to the underground nature of
the problem.

3.40 In terms of the area around the BR-163 highway, informed sources interviewed by
IEG indicated that protected areas were established and some aspects of zoning implemented,
and negative environmental effects curbed. But hopes for sustainable local development
alternatives to deforestation were not realized, and local populations are disappointed and
angry (moreover, the road has not yet been fully paved).

3.41 With regard to the establishment of protected areas in the Amazon more generally
(i.e., beyond “the region of influence of BR-163”), as discussed in relation to the
sustainability of forest management policy area above, the World Bank-financed ARPA
Program has also supported the creation of protected areas. The Env PRL expected outcome
indicator was “creation of over 12 million hectares of protected areas in the region of
influence of BR-163.” As stated in the Program Document, “two-thirds of the additional
protected areas (8 million ha) would be implemented with the support of the GEF-World
Bank funded ARPA program.” Although no specific monitoring data could be found on the

Env PRL indicator related to BR-163 specifically, maps of areas protected by ARPA 35
indicate that at least some of them are proximate to the BR-163, which flows north-south
through the Amazon. 36

3.42 Looking at the bigger picture of controlling deforestation in the Amazon illustrated in
Figure 2, Brazil has been very successful in reducing Amazon deforestation since 2004, and
much of the credit for this—including in multiple interviews carried out by IEG with
government officials and civil society organizations as part of this evaluation—is attributed
to increased enforcement under the Plan of Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the
Amazon (PPCD), actions for which were supported under the Env PRL. As discussed in the
Introduction, many people felt at the time of the Env PRL that Amazon deforestation was
Brazil’s biggest environmental challenge, and certainly from a global public good
perspective, it was the most important. Thus, Brazil’s success in curbing it by 84 percent
from the peak in 2004 to the low-point in 2012 has been recognized as a signal
achievement. 37

3.43 With regard to development of the Amazon with environmental sustainability, the Env
TAL spreadsheet for monitoring Env PRL activitiesconsiders the policy actions for Env PRL
2 to be completed. Support was provided under the Env TAL for nine public consultations on
the Sustainable Development Program for the Amazon (PAS) in the capitals of Amazonian
states and for publication of a final PAS document. The PAS was officially launched in

35

37
  Though challenges remain. As the Figure illustrates, there was an up-tick in deforestation in 2013,
and in absolute terms, it is still around 5,000 km2 per year, which is an area approximately the size of
Trinidad and Tobago. The more recent developments are discussed in the SEM DPL PPAR.
                                                28


October 2008, integrating the outcomes of the consultations. There is no information on the
“design of meso-regional development plans” foreseen for Env PRL 3.

3.44 With regard to outcomes, the two expected outcome indicators for this policy area
related to increasing the sustainable management of natural resources are poorly defined and
seem to potentially duplicate the indicator for the “Sustainability of Forest Management”
policy area, and as with other indicators there are no baselines. As noted in the SEM DPL
PPAR (which had an action on the PAS), the outcomes of the PAS remain uncertain. It was
launched four years after the Env PRL, and four years after the sharp decline in Amazon
deforestation (discussed under the previous policy area) began in 2004, which has been
credited to other interventions.

3.45 With regard to mainstreaming environmental concerns in the sanitation sector, the
Env TAL spreadsheet for monitoring the Env PRL reports achievements on activities related
to this policy area. Support was provided for (i) consultation meetings regarding the draft
bill of Solid Waste Management (SWM); (ii) the publication “The Experience of the
Watershed Pollution Control Program – PRODES” with diagnostic results of the PRODES
watershed restoration program; and (iii) a National Water Agency (ANA) resolution, which
improved technical procedures for certifying water quality in sewage treatment. Concerning
the Municipal Management Plans, the Env TAL was considered just “initiated”. The project
supported the preparation of 10 Participatory Master Plans that consider specific types of
coordination of urban and environmental approaches. Qualitative research is still needed on
Participatory Master Plans, with emphasis on environmental sustainability, which was not
supported by the Env TAL due to delays in the procurement process.

3.46 The PRODES program in particular is a potentially important and innovative
initiative to achieve environmental outcomes using economic incentives in a program that is
similar to “payment for results” (or “P4R”), with the Brazilian government reimbursing
service providers for demonstrated reductions in water pollution rather than for inputs like
treatment infrastructure. The Brazilian Water Agency (ANA) notes that PRODES was
established in 2001, 38 which predates the engagement under the Env PRL, though the Env
PRL was also supposed to support the improvement and expansion of the PRODES
approach.

3.47 In interviews, Brazilian federal officials confirmed that the PRODES certification
system was created as indicated in the Env PRL 1 prior action. They also noted that
expansion of PRODES’s implementation as foreseen under Env PRL 3 was still a work in
progress, while local government representatives reported that it was difficult for some
service providers to obtain the necessary pre-financing for PRODES-eligible investments.
The expected outcomes for this policy area are related to “abatement of 100,000 kg BOD/day
of pollution discharge due to PRODES implementation” by 2007, 39 a decrease in the number
of people hospitalized with water-related diseases, and an increase in the coverage of

38
     http://www2.ana.gov.br/Paginas/EN/programs.aspx
39
  BOD = biochemical oxygen demand, and is a measure of water pollution related to the content of
bacteria and other microorganisms.
                                                   29


Municipal Master Plans (“increase in the area of municipalities occupied”). According to the
Brazilian Water Agency, there were no pollution reductions purchased under the PRODES
Program in 2005, 2006, 2009, or 2010. In 2007 and 2008 combined, PRODES contracted a
total of 50,551 kg BOD per day. 40 So while PRODES has been having some impact, this is
evidence that it did not reach the scale targeted by the Env PRL within a reasonable
timeframe. No information is provided on the health-related outcome indicator for this policy
area, which was supposed to reflect a decrease in the number of people hospitalized with
water-borne diseases in PRODES areas.

3.48 With regard to integration of Environmental Economic Zoning (ZEE) within Regional
Development Planning, the ICR for the Env TAL reports that activities under this policy area
were partially achieved. The Env TAL provided support to analyses on the Macro Ecological
Economic Zoning of the Amazon, but did not support the other regional ZEEs (Midwest,
Northeast). The Env TAL ICR reports that the “Macro ZEE of the Amazon was launched in
2010”. It also reports that three studies to survey the vegetation and degraded areas of sub-
basins of the São Francisco River for its revitalization were completed, and that a
revitalization program was launched in 2007. Brazilian government sources show that the
Amazon Macro ZEE was approved in December 2010, via Federal Decree No. 7.378/2010,
which provides “guidelines for the formulation of public policies and spatial development,
spatial planning and environment, as well as for decisions of private agents.” 41 There is no
indication of how mandatory it is to use the ZEEs in the nine Amazon states that were
implicated. 42 IEG interviews at the federal and state level found that the macrozoning effort
was largely a paper exercise with little evident impact on interstate planning or coordination.
The IEG Brazil Country Program Evaluation examined efforts to support ecological-
economic zoning and concluded that “zoning exercises have had little impact on the ground”,
with two exceptions: the identification and demarcation of protected areas (discussed under
separate policy areas); and the ZEE for the state of Acre, which seems to have the best
prospects of being implemented (IEG 2013).

3.49 With regard to mainstreaming environmental sustainability in financial and fiscal
policies, the Env TAL spreadsheet for monitoring Env PRL activities reports that no progress
was made in this policy area. The Env TAL ICR concluded that the inclusion of
environmental sustainability criteria in fiscal laws and regulations was not achieved. In the
Env TAL Mid-Term Review report, it was concluded that the original proposal was too
ambitious, given its complexity and implications. Its implementation would require decisions
at the ministerial or presidential level. The Env TAL project alone was unlikely to achieve
this level of support without the planned follow-on operations under the Env PRL series.

3.50 The revision and approval of the “Green Protocol” was also included as a prior action
under the SEM DPL. As discussed in detail in the SEM DPL PPAR, the revised Green
Protocol was approved in 2008 and signed by the Brazilian Ministry of Environment and

major state-owned banks. In a comparison between the revised Green Protocol and an
international standard—the Equator Principles—IEG found major shortcomings in the Green
Protocol. IEG was also unable to find any information on the subsequent implementation and
outcomes of the Green Protocol. Subsequent enquiries with officials of FEBRABAN, the
Brazilian banking federation, revealed that implementation of the 2008 revision of the Green
Protocol, included as an action under the SEM DPL, is “on standby”, and moreover that “the
Protocol has lost its importance as an instrument of voluntary and guiding actions of banks.”

3.51 With regard to improvement of the environmental sustainability of the energy sector,
this was one of the more complex areas of reform, with three to four actions specified under
each of the planned Env PRL operations, but also one with potential for high impact given
the importance of the energy sector for the environment and society. The Env PRL Program
Document reports that the following actions were carried out prior to approval of the Env
PRL 1:
     •   New model for energy sector, which includes requirements for environmental
         analysis and licensing to the project tender, approved by Congress.
     •   Technical Cooperation Agreement between MMA and MME signed for the
         implementation of a common environmental agenda.
     •   Program to support renewable sources of electric power energy (PROINFA)
         launched.

3.52 However the ICR for the Env TAL reports that the majority of the activities planned
for this policy area under the Env PRL 2 were not achieved. The most important of these was
the development of a methodology for Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) of river
basins to be used in planning hydroelectric investments. According to the Program
Document, this “aims at transcending the narrow local and short-term impacts of
infrastructure investments, and at looking at major projects using a less localized and more
strategic, longer term, and regional view.” The expected outcome was “a decrease in the
negative social and environmental impacts of energy infrastructure projects.” But as the Env
TAL ICR notes, the Brazilian Ministry of Mining and Energy decided instead to develop its
own approach, which it called Integrated Environmental Assessment (IEA). The Env TAL
spreadsheet for monitoring Env PRL actions notes that the actions related to the SEA and the
cooperation of the Ministry of Environment with the Energy Research Company were
“discarded”.

3.53 Consequently, Brazil still makes hydroelectric investment decisions on a project-by-
project basis rather than taking a holistic and strategic approach that includes environmental
and social criteria as well as power generation potential. 43 As discussed in detail in the PPAR
for the SEM DPL, there is substantial evidence of continuing negative environmental and
social impacts resulting from these investments in Brazil, which has led to criticism from

43
  In comments, the Brazilian government refers to its Decennial Plan for Energy Expansion 2021,
which has been described as “the main guideline for the expansion of the energy sector in Brazil”,
and not a methodology for Strategic Environmental Assessment of hydroelectric investments. See:
http://www.ie.ufrj.br/images/pesquisa/pesquisa/textos_sem_peq/texto1505.pdf
                                                   31


Brazilian government environmental licensing and watchdog agencies. A 2008 World Bank
report also noted significant problems with the Brazilian environmental licensing system,
specifically as it relates to hydropower (World Bank 2008).

3.54 With regard to the PROINFA renewable energy program, there is information that
“by early 2005 the first phase was finished and 3,300 MW were completed (1,266 MW Solar,
655 MW Biomass, 1,379 Wind)”. 44 This target was met earlier than the 2007 deadline set by
the program. A document titled “National Energy Efficiency Plan: Basic Assumptions and
Guidelines” was prepared by Brazil in 2011 (seven years after the Env PRL). 45 In
conjunction with the National Energy Plan 2030, the document states that the goal is to
reduce energy consumption by 10 percent by 2030. However, as the Ministry of Environment
points out in comments on the plans, “the main barriers to the full development of energy
efficiency in Brazil require a government effort to improve the legal and regulatory
framework”. 46 As for this policy area’s outcome indicator of “decrease by 5 percent of the
energy consumption per product unit in key sectors defined in the strategic plan”, Brazil’s
primary energy intensity is estimated to have decreased by 0.4 percent per year from 2000 to
2009, which is rated as “among countries with lowest performances” (ABB 2011). 47

3.55 With regard to improvement of the environmental sustainability of the agrarian sector
[referred to as “Agrarian Reform” in the Program Document], the prior action for Env PRL
1 was to launch a new National Plan for Agrarian Reform, which reportedly includes, for the
first time, environmental sustainability criteria for new agrarian settlements (typically
government-sponsored settlements on public or expropriated private land). The Env TAL
spreadsheet for monitoring Env PRL actions reports that the actions related to the Env PRL 2
were fully carried out. Specifically, it is reported that eight public consultations were held in
four regions (North, North East, Southwest and South) on the revision of agrarian settlement
licensing procedures. Those workshops included NGOs, INCRA, EMATER, state
environmental agencies, social movement representatives, technical staff and managers. The
Env PRL ICR reports that the results were published in the “Report of Licensing Officers on
Environmental Settlement Projects of the National Agrarian Reform” (MMA Brasília,
INCRA, 2009). A national workshop was organized to discuss proposals for changes in the
processes of environmental licensing of settlements, and a proposed new resolution
simplifying procedures for environmental licensing of settlements was submitted to
CONAMA.

3.56 However, the action for Env PRL 2 was the “establishment of simplified procedures
for the environmental licensing of settlements,” and no information is provided on whether

                                               32


the proposed new resolution was approved and whether simplified procedures were
established, and more importantly implemented. It is also not immediately apparent how
simplifying procedures for obtaining an environmental license for settlements would
necessarily contribute to improved environmental outcomes. IEG could find no information
on the expected outcome indicators related to increasing the coverage of protected areas and
a decrease in degraded areas in the settlements. Indeed, the ICR for the Env TAL reports that
an activity under that project on defining an “environmental condition monitoring system for
settlements” was “not achieved”.

3.57 With regard to the improvement of the environmental sustainability of the tourism
sector, the Env PRL ICR mentions that the World Bank supported the Brazilian government
with a workshop focusing on the introduction of SEA in the tourism sector, and focusing on
the National Tourism Expansion Plan (ICR p. 3). It also states that Technical Cooperation
Agreement between the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Tourism was signed—a
prior action for Env PRL1—including environmental criteria in the management of the
tourism sector (ICR p.11). But according to the Env TAL spreadsheet for monitoring Env
PRL actions, no additional progress was made on follow-up actions under this policy area:
establishment of an integrated action plan between the Ministries of Environment and
Tourism, and establishment of indicators for monitoring implementation of the National
Tourism Plan. The Env TAL ICR confirms that “the activities planned to be implemented in
partnership between the Ministry of Tourism and Ministry of Environment were not carried
out”, and states that this was due in part to high turnover of senior staff in the Ministry of
Tourism, including the ministers. Therefore, there were no achievements under this policy
area.

3.58 For Objective 2, some of the reforms supported by the Env PRL are credited with
making substantial contributions to environmental mainstreaming. This is particularly true
with regard to the impressive progress that Brazil has made in reducing deforestation in the
Amazon, which is a signal achievement of great importance for Brazil and for the global
environment. In the area of environmental sanitation, there has been some progress through
the innovative PRODES program, and progress on zoning in the Amazon, though with little
apparent impact on the ground so far. In other policy areas such as energy and tourism, the
planned mainstreaming reforms were never carried out. The failure to introduce Strategic
Environmental Assessment into river basin and hydroelectric investment planning, and the
lack of results in mainstreaming environmental sustainability in financial institutions, are
particularly important as missed opportunities. Achievement of Objective 2 is rated Modest.



4. Ratings
Outcome
4.1     Although the Env PRL’s objectives may be broad and ambitious, imprecise, and
stated in different ways in various places, the general theme of improving environmental
management and mainstreaming environmental sustainability is clearly relevant in Brazil,
and fully consistent with the Bank’s country strategies at the time of appraisal and at present.
                                              33


Relevance of Objectives is rated Substantial. With a few exceptions, such as the inconsistent
treatment of deforestation in different biomes and components, the logic of the causal chain
described in the Env PRL Policy Matrix was generally sound. Relevance of Design is also
rated Substantial.

4.2     The second and third operations in the Env PRL series did not materialize as planned,
but thanks to the impetus given to the reform agenda by the Env PRL 1 and the follow-up
and technical support provided through the Env TAL, many of the reforms continued and
made important contributions to improved environmental management and mainstreaming of
sustainability in Brazil. Those included the essential strengthening of the Federal Ministry of
Environment, and the significant reduction in deforestation of the Amazon and Atlantic
Forests. On the other hand, reforms in some other areas—particularly those related to
mainstreaming—were not achieved as planned. The mixed results lead to ratings of
Substantial for the Achievement of Objective 1 and Modest for the Achievement of
Objective 2.

4.3       The overall Outcome of Env PRL is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

Risk to Development Outcome
4.4      The Env PRL was designed as a series of three operations necessary to achieve the
intended outcomes. Although the second and third loans in the series did not materialize, the
Brazilian government continued to make progress on many of the policy areas under the Env
PRL program, indicating good commitment to the overall environmental management and
mainstreaming agenda, which appears likely to be maintained. Based on information
provided in the ICR for the accompanying Env TAL, the progress—at least on the Env PRL
2 actions—looks to have been aided to some extent by the monitoring and technical support
provided by that operation for another seven years after the Env PRL 1 (that is, until 2011).
With the Env TAL now also closed, and no current environmental development policy loans,
it is not clear what mechanisms are in place for the World Bank to continue supporting Brazil
on the environmental policy reform agenda. Risk to Development Outcome is therefore rated
Moderate.

Bank Performance
Quality at Entry

4.5     The World Bank team that prepared the Env PRL was praised by both government
counterparts and civil society representatives for the quality of the preparation process,
including the extensive and long-term engagement of the World Bank team with the
Brazilian environmental policy reform agenda during preparation. The following positive
aspects of Bank performance during the preparation phase were highlighted:
      •   To further the objective of mainstreaming environmental sustainability into key
          sectors, the Bank team had extensive engagement with the multiple government
          agencies responsible for implementing the necessary reforms—in addition to the main
                                             34


       implementing agencies, and the Ministries of Environment and Finance (a total of
       seven ministries as reported in the Env TAL ICR);
   •   The long-term engagement of the Bank team on the environmental policy reform
       agenda in Brazil leading up to the Env PRL, with documents in the Env PRL’s
       archive indicating that the Bank was already engaging with the Borrower and
       developing the Policy Matrix for the program by September 2002, two years before
       the Env PRL 1 was approved;
   •   The client appreciated the high level of technical expertise and understanding of the
       Brazilian context on the part of the Bank team;
   •   The preparation process was inclusive, involving consultations with large numbers of
       civil society representatives;
   •   The Program Document was comprehensive and provided ample detail, and was
       based on a strong analytical base;
   •   The Bank team acknowledged that—as the first environmental programmatic reform
       loan in Brazil—the operation entailed a high degree of risk;
   •   The Bank team recognized the need for technical assistance to support the
       Government of Brazil in preparing the reforms, and proposed a Technical Assistance
       Loan to accompany the Env PRL.

4.6    Certain areas were also identified in which there was room for improvement in Bank
performance:
   •   A design that was probably overly ambitious and complex, involving too many
       different policy areas and associated agencies, particularly given the novelty of the
       program. The Env PRL Policy Matrix included fifteen different policy areas.
       According to interviews with Bank staff, this was done in part because one of the
       objectives was to mainstream environmental sustainability in various sectoral
       ministries, but also because Bank environment staff were new to policy lending and
       wanted to be ambitious. On this subject, the Program Document for the 2009 SEM
       DPL noted: “One of the lessons learned from the ENV PRL series is that the large
       number of actions and triggers to be implemented by a large set of institutions (seven
       ministries) created a very complex model to monitor and support, and led to uneven
       implementation among different agencies.”
   •   To the extent that it could have been foreseen that the second and third loans in the
       series would be canceled, and considering that progress on many of the policy areas
       continued despite the absence of the planned second and third loans in the series, the
       question arises as to whether the Env PRL should have been designed as a single-
       operation DPL to initially spur reforms—perhaps still with an environmental
       technical assistance loan to provide a basis for support and engagement over the
       medium-term. This would also reduce the total cost of the program.
   •   The arrangements for monitoring and evaluation of the results of the Env PRL series
       were inadequate. As discussed in more detail in the Monitoring & Evaluation section
       of the PPAR, many of the outcome indicators were unclear, difficult to measure, or
                                               35


         not directly related to the objectives sought. Moreover, no baseline information was
         collected for the indicators, making measurement of outcomes nearly impossible.
     •   The design of the Env PRL Policy Matrix in most cases did not respond to one of the
         primary justifications for the operation given in the Program Document: “increasing
         the use of economic instruments as compared to command-and-control mechanisms.”
         The only areas where there was some progress in this sense was in water resources
         management and sanitation—with the introduction of water charges and the support
         for the PRODES payment-for-results sanitation program. It should still be noted, on
         the other hand, that some of the most important achievements of the Env PRL—in
         particular with regard to reducing deforestation—came through the strengthening of
         command-and-control mechanisms.
     •   The Program Document gives short shrift to other environmental activities being
         supported by the World Bank in Brazil at around the same time as the Env PRL. The
         section on “Complementarity with Other Operations” (p. 53) has a table listing
         “Complementary Loans and Grants”, but provides little discussion of synergies or
         potential overlap. For example, the National Environmental Program investment
         loans (I and II) were also supporting strengthening of environmental institutions in
         Brazil over the same period, but their activities are not mentioned. This led in some
         cases to the perception of a lack of coordination and that the Env PRL (at least the
         first operation) was tabulating the achievements of other operations as prior actions.
     •   While, as noted above, the Bank team deserves credit for proposing a Technical
         Assistance Loan to support the Government during implementation of the Env PRL,
         the preparation of the Env TAL lagged far behind that of the Env PRL, and the loan
         did not become effective until April 2006, nearly two years after the Env PRL 1,
         creating a gap in its support for the Env PRL reform agenda.
     •   Although the Env PRL dealt with major changes to environmental policies,
         legislation, and institutions—some of which, like the application of tenure, zoning
         and environmental requirements to land use, could have important social implications
         as well—the Program Document did not acknowledge any risks associated with
         potential (unintended) adverse environmental impacts. 48


4.7     On the whole, the shortfalls in preparation were outweighed by the extensive
engagement and consultations with stakeholders carried out by the Bank team, and the high
quality of the Program Document. Quality at Entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

Quality of Supervision
4.8    Supervision of the Env PRL series was found to be inadequate. After Env PRL 1 was
disbursed and closed, there was insufficient attention to continuing the dialogue and
engagement from the World Bank side to ensure that the programmatic series would continue
48
  IEG recognizes that World Bank requirements for assessment of potential adverse environmental
and social impacts in the context of policy lending might have been less clear at the time of
preparation of the Env PRL, since it just predated Operational Policy 8.60.
                                              36


as planned for a second and third operation. While there fortunately turned out to exist
continued government commitment to many of the reforms, this does not appear to be
attributable to planning or proactivity on the part of the Bank, which had stated in the Env
PRL 1 Program Document that a programmatic series of three loans over four years would be
necessary to support the environmental reform agenda and achieve the program objectives.

4.9      With no ICR after the Env PRL series lapsed, there was no contemporaneous
explanation for the failure of the second and third loans to materialize. IEG could find no
other documentary evidence that a clear, conscious decision was taken to cancel the other
two loans in the series, such as a letter from the Borrower requesting the cancelation.
According to World Bank policy, “a programmatic series is considered to have lapsed if no
subsequent operation is presented to the Board 24 months after the Board approval of the
previous operation in the series” (OPCS 2006 (2014)). In the course of conducting interviews
for this evaluation, IEG was given different and sometimes inconsistent explanations for why
the planned Env PRL series did not continue after the first loan. One explanation was that the
Brazilian government decided not to proceed with Env PRL 2 (as a loan to the Federal
Government) because it wanted to re-focus World Bank lending to the states (or “sub-
national level”) rather than to the Federal Government. But in the year that Env PRL 2
normally should have been approved, fiscal year 2006, two-thirds of new World Bank
commitments were still to the Federal Government (IEG 2013). The recent IEG Brazil
Country Program Evaluation notes that the following year, fiscal year 2007, World Bank
lending to Brazil experienced “a significant dip” due to “the reconfiguration that increased
subnational lending” (IEG 2013). One year later, sub-national lending commitments rose to
96%, but in the next fiscal year, 2009, they fell again to 57%. That same year, the World
Bank approved the SEM DPL—an environmental DPL to the Federal Government.

4.10 Explanations given by other sources indicated that changes in the World Bank team
resulted in a loss of continuity. The World Bank Task Team Leader for the Env PRL—who
had guided the preparation from the beginning—moved to work on a different geographic
region after the Env PRL 1. The World Bank Country Director changed at around the same
time. After these departures, there was a lapse in World Bank follow-up on the series, and
efforts never reached the same intensity as they did under the Env PRL 1. Some interviewees
also indicated that this was accompanied by a lower level of interest in additional loans from
the Brazilian side because the macro-economic situation improved for the Federal
Government.

4.11 Although in a number of policy areas the reforms continued without the loans, there
is evidence that in some other areas the cancelation of the follow-on operations reduced the
visibility and impetus for environmental mainstreaming in sectoral ministries. The ICR for
the Env TAL notes that “the high-level Management Committee did not play its expected
prominent role” guiding the activities, and that “this was caused by the frequent changes in
senior management and the decision not to seek the next two operations under the Env PRL
series, thus making senior management’s close involvement in the management of the Env
TAL less critical. This conclusion was shared by GIZ (Deutsche Gesellschaft für
Internationale Zusammenarbeit, GmbH), the German government cofinancer of the Env
TAL, in their comments to the ICR. In the absence of a functioning high-level Management
Committee, the six sectoral ministries involved achieved fewer results in relation to the Env
                                               37


TAL and Env PRL 2 targets than the Ministry of Environment, with the Ministry of Tourism
in particular showing no progress.

4.12 Monitoring and evaluation by the Bank under the Env PRL were particularly weak.
From the borrower’s side, once it became effective in April 2006, the Env TAL project
contributed to monitoring. But it was focused on actions rather than outcomes, and mostly
limited to planned actions for the Env PRL 2. Most importantly, the Bank neglected to
evaluate the Env PRL as required by World Bank policy, despite the importance of the
operation. 49 A “Simplified” ICR, dated June 29, 2005, with only six pages of main text that
mostly reiterated the prior actions cited in the Program Document, was produced by the Bank
for the Env PRL 1. The Bank did not complete the required full ICR after the series was
canceled. Based on the Simplified ICR, IEG conducted a desk-based ICR Review (ICRR)
that was posted on January 19, 2006. But many questions remained unanswered. The quality
of the Simplified ICR was rated Unsatisfactory by IEG “because it does not provide
sufficient information”, and the Outcome rating was marked “Not Rated” because “in the
absence of information on interim outcomes, the project cannot be rated.” 50 Thus despite the
large size of the loan, its innovation, and its potential implications for the 2009 SEM DPL,
there was no proper accounting of what worked and what did not under the Env PRL, what
the outcomes were, why the series was canceled, and what lessons could be gleaned for
future operations. That was a major oversight. Quality of Supervision is rated
Unsatisfactory.

4.13 Considering the Moderately Satisfactory Quality at Entry rating and the
Unsatisfactory Quality of Supervision rating, and in light of the Moderately Satisfactory
rating for Outcome, overall Bank Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

Borrower Performance
4.14 In the case of the Env PRL, the official Implementing Agencies were the Ministry of
Finance and the Ministry of Environment, who also represent the Government, and so as is
frequently the case for DPOs, only one rating is given for Borrower Performance.

4.15 As noted in the discussion of Efficacy above, Brazil has made significant progress in
improving environmental sustainability in certain areas—particularly the signal achievement
in reducing deforestation in the Amazon. There is evidence that this had much to do with
actions taken by the Brazilian Government, particularly the strengthening of “command and
control” enforcement measures under the PPCD program supported by the Env PRL.
Progress has also been made reducing deforestation in the less-famous but critically
important—from a biodiversity perspective—and highly threatened Atlantic forest. The
Government also took steps to strengthen the environmental management system and central
49
 See BP 8.60 – Development Policy Lending for the requirements on evaluation of DPOs (World
Bank OPCS)
50
  In their written response to the IEG Review of the Simplified ICR of Env PRL 1, the World Bank
team acknowledged that it was “virtually impossible” to measure progress on outcomes at the time,
and promised “a more comprehensive evaluation around the completion of the programmatic series.”
That evaluation was never carried out.
                                                38


institutions in the country by restructuring, raising the profile of, and increasing staffing for
the Ministry of Environment. Despite the cancelation of the second and third operations
under the Env PRL series, the Brazilian government also continued to make steady—if
slower than planned—progress in mainstreaming environment in other sectors, such as
introducing water charges in its approach to water resource management, initiating a
payment-for-results approach to financing sanitation investments, and including
environmental indicators in national statistics and making them publically available.

4.16 At the same time, the Government made little progress in other key policy areas
described under the Env PRL, such as improving the performance of the environmental
licensing system overseen by IBAMA, integrating a Strategic Environmental Assessment
approach into hydroelectric investment planning, and mainstreaming environmental
sustainability in financial and fiscal policies. There was also no progress reported in the
planned mainstreaming of environment in the tourism sector. There is evidence that the
decision not to proceed with the Env PRL program contributed to this. Based on information
from interviews with key informants, the decision was primarily made by the Government of
Brazil. As discussed in the Env TAL ICR, when the rest of the Env PRL series was canceled,
it adversely impacted the functioning of the high-level Management Committee composed of
representatives of the seven ministries involved.

4.17 The Brazilian government also reportedly resisted the associated Env TAL loan.
Although there were strong arguments for the need for technical assistance to the
Government to help with designing the reforms agreed under the Env PRL series, interviews
with both World Bank and Government staff indicate that Brazil was hesitant to borrow for
technical assistance. This was in part responsible for the significant delay in effectiveness of
the loan, and the uneven implementation once effective.

4.18   Overall, Borrower Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

Monitoring and Evaluation
4.19 As mentioned in several other sections of this PPAR, Monitoring and Evaluation
(M&E) under the Env PRL was quite weak. M&E design was almost non-existent. There was
almost no discussion of M&E design, implementation or use in the Program Document.
Many of the Expected Outcome Indicators in the Policy Matrix were either unclear, difficult
to measure, or not directly related to the objectives sought. For example, for the second
policy area on “institutional strengthening of MMA and IBAMA”, the indicator was
“increase in the percentage of execution of the targets established in the key programs
compared with Jan/2003”. No information is provided on which targets or which programs,
and the 2003 data is not given.

4.20 Under “control of deforestation in the Amazon”, the indicators are “decrease of
illegal land appropriation (grilagem)” and “creation of over 12 million hectares of protected
areas in the region of influence of BR-163”, rather than something more directly linked to the
sub-objective, such as the rate of deforestation in the Amazon. In the “Initiating
Memorandum” for the Env PRL issued in June 2004, the World Bank team indicates that
they were considering using the Amazon deforestation rate as an indicator, but were
                                              39


pessimistic about being able to address the problem in the short-term. Instead, they chose
indicators that were not nearly as appropriate. Illegal land appropriation is difficult to
measure, and only indirectly related to deforestation, and BR-163 is only partially in the
Amazon. In contrast, there is very good time-series data on Amazon deforestation, and in
reality much progress was achieved on that indicator. Several of the indicators for actions
related to the Amazon include “sustainable” management or use, but sustainability can be
interpreted in different ways, and it is never defined in the Program Document.

4.21 No baseline information was collected for any of the Env PRL indicators, making
measurement of outcomes nearly impossible. And no intermediate targets were specified for
the outcome indicators, making it difficult to monitor progress under the individual
operations planned in the three-loan series.

4.22 Once the Env TAL became effective nearly two years after the Env PRL 1, it began
collecting information on the implementation of actions, specifically in relation to the
planned Env PRL 2, and this provided some useful information. But for the most part it also
did not provide information on the expected outcomes, and when the Env PRL 2 failed to
materialize, information was no longer collected in progress in relation to the Env PRL 3
actions.

4.23 Most importantly, the World Bank did not complete the required full ICR for the Env
PRL once it was clear that the series would not continue. As a result, no proper evaluation
was conducted to establish the results of the loan, which is a major shortcoming.

4.24 Due to the severe shortcomings in the M&E system’s design, implementation and
utilization, Monitoring and Evaluation is rated Negligible.


5. Lessons
5.1      Risks associated with not completing the required ex-post evaluation of an
operation go beyond the operation itself. The World Bank did not complete the required
full ICR at the end of the Env PRL series. As a result, there was no proper accounting of the
Env PRL, and there were adverse impacts on the subsequent SEM DPL environmental DPO
series as well. Because the outcomes of the Env PRL were not properly documented, it is
difficult to establish the impacts of the SEM DPL, which included a number of similar policy
areas. Moreover, by not firmly establishing the reasons for the cancelation of the Env PRL
series, the SEM DPL might have repeated some of the same mistakes, as it too was designed
as a programmatic series, and it too was canceled after the first loan. The World Bank should
therefore have ensured that the evaluation of the previous series was completed before
embarking on preparation of a new series in the same sector.

5.2     Extensive engagement and consultations by the World Bank in preparing a DPO
contribute to better design and generate goodwill on the part of the client. The team that
prepared the Env PRL was praised for its long-term, high-quality technical engagement with
government ministries and sectoral agencies, and for its efforts to consult with an array of
civil society organizations. This helped to raise the profile of the loan and more importantly
                                              40


the reforms it supported, increase understanding and engagement, and foster inter-agency
cooperation—particularly with the key non-sectoral Ministry of Finance.

5.3     It is important to be selective and realistic about what can be achieved in the
context of a sectoral DPO. Considering that this was the first DPO series in Brazil focused
on the environment, the complexity of the issues, and the many government agencies
involved, the World Bank and the Borrower were overly ambitious with the Env PRL. The
design included fifteen different policy areas. Not all policy areas and actions are equal, and
it would have been better to begin by prioritizing the potential reforms in terms of their
importance, potential impact, and urgency, focusing on fewer policy areas and key agencies,
and ensuring adequate follow-up with those.
