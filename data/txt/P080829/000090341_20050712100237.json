This first loan supported\n            environmental sustainability mainly through policy reforms\n            as a typical Development Policy Lending (DPL). Findings and\n            implications: a supporting Technical Assistance Loan (TAL)\n            is being prepared since typically inter-sectoral\n            coordination is a slow process and needs continuous\n            budgetary and technical support. It is very important to\n            monitor and evaluate the results of the loan and the\n            program. It is important to engage high-level members of\n            beneficiary ministries, ministry staff members, and civil\n            society representatives (NGOs, private sector) in project\n            preparation and implementation and to emphasize coordination\n            and consensus building through a broad participatory and\n            consultation process."}, "docdt": "2005-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
