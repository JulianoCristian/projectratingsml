3. Program Description

3.1.    The principal objective of the Programmatic Reform Loan for Environmental
Sustainability (EnvPRL) is to support Brazil's goal of balancing economic growth with
social development and the maintenance and improvement of environmental quality. The
program involves key policy reforms in seven different ministries, which formally
subscribe to the Letter of Development Policy (Program Document, Report No. 28650-
BR). In line with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for 2004-2007, the program will
contribute to the objective of a more sustainable Brazil, to reduce poverty and achieve a
higher quality of life for all Brazilians in both rural and urban areas. A sustainable Brazil
will also be a source of competitiveness and provide wealth for the future. This project
forms a significant part of the World Bank's overall assistance strategy to an innovative,
committed, and high-performing client. The strategic objective of the program is the
consolidation of the process to revitalize environmental policy in Brazil. The expected
outcome of the program over the course of four years would include significant
improvements in the environmental management system and a reversal in a few selected,
but critical environmental trends.

3.2.    This loan was the first operation (EnvPRL I, US$502.52 million) in a series of up
to three loans over a four-year period, possibly totaling US$1.2 billion. This loan
supported environmental sustainability through policy reforms focusing on two major
areas: (i) increasing the effectiveness and the efficiency of the environmental
management system; and (ii) mainstreaming environmental sustainability in selected
sector policies and programs. This operation did not involve additional spending and
focused on policy and institutional changes that should lead to more effective and
efficient environmental management.

3.3     The strategy for this first operation was to focus on the Government of Brazil's
(GOB) short-term policies and programs that could lay the foundation for supporting the
achievement of its long-term objectives for environmentally sustainable economic
development and poverty reduction. The set of policy and institutional reforms supported
by this loan included: (a) increasing the transparency and social control of the
environmental management system (EMS); (b) improving the effectiveness of the EMS
through better coordination and clearer definition of responsibilities among the three
levels of government; (c) increasing the use of economic instruments as compared to
command-and-control mechanisms; (d) promoting sustainable development in the
Amazon and the protection of other key ecosystems; (e) improving water resources
management through increased decentralization, improved local management and
increased financial autonomy; and (f) promoting the upstream inclusion of environmental
sustainability concerns in sector policies and programs, as well as in the planning and
implementation of major development projects.

4. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs

4.1     The overall outcome rating is satisfactory. The Borrower completed the actions
for release of this loan (Annex I) before Board approval and the loan became effective
right after signing. Since its preparation, the quality of the dialogue between the Ministry
of Environment (MMA) and sectoral ministries (particularly infrastructure) has improved
substantially. Similarly, the Bank brought issues related to the sustainability agenda to the
discussions with the Ministries of Planning and Finance, which prior to this loan would
not be rated as a priority. This achievement indicates the importance of programmatic
lending, when combined with focused investment projects and Analytical and Advisory
Activities (AAA), in offering a comprehensive package of Bank assistance in a large and
important country such as Brazil.

4.2     The GOB is following up on a number of activities and actions that would allow
the achievement of the triggers and benchmarks established for the second proposed
operation in this loan series (Annex II ­ Key Next Steps). In this regard, the GOB has: (i)
launched the selection process to hire career staff to the Brazilian Institute for
Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) and the Ministry of
Environment; (ii) implemented an integrated web portal where all information regarding
licensing procedures in the federal and state levels will be available to the public
(municipalities will be included in a later stage); (iii) formally established Committees
(Comissões Tripartites) consisting of the three levels of government in 24 states (out of
27); and (iv) carried out actions in key areas, such as the Strategic Environmental
Assessment (SEA). The Bank has recently supported the government with three major
workshops/seminars focusing on: (a) introduction of the SEA in the tourism sector
focusing on the National Tourism Expansion Plan; (b) training decision makers and
technicians from federal, state and municipal agencies; and (c) dialogue with the Ministry
of Planning and the President's Office (Casa Civil) on the introduction of environmental
variables and the SEA for the revision of Brazil's multi-year investment plan (PPA).
These actions are major steps forward in the mainstreaming of environmental variables
into sectoral policies and programs.

4.3     The preparation of an accompanying technical assistance loan (EnvTAL) is
progressing well and it is expected to be delivered to the Board at the beginning of FY06
(the Invitation to Negotiate was sent to the borrower on May 5, 2005). The main
objective of the proposed EnvTAL is to support the government in advancing the pace of
reforms on the sustainability agenda program defined in the Letter of Development
Policy, focusing on the targets established for the second EnvPRL operation. The
EnvTAL will provide technical assistance and financial resources.

4.4     In addition, a PHRD Grant proposal for US$600,000 has been recently submitted
to support the preparation of the second operation of the EnvPRL. This grant would
finance several critical studies (Cost of Environmental Degradation in Selected Areas;

                                             3

Opportunities for Green Procurement in Brazil; and an analysis of the Government's
Agenda for Mainstreaming Environmental Sustainability) and ad hoc consultants for
assisting the GOB in preparing the second operation.

4.5      The Bank is also working closely with the Ministry of Transport on the
preparation of a large sector-wide approach loan (SWAp) for infrastructure rehabilitation.
In this context, the inter-ministerial agreement between Environment and Transport for
the management of environmental impacts and for improving instruments for planning
new investments could possibly be supported by the second loan of the EnvPRL.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1      A major risk identified during the preparation of the program--the environmental
reform agenda not being carried out adequately--could still be possible. There are
several possible causes, including: (i) the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks
and social and political pressure; (ii) a lack of coordination may occur among the key
stakeholders, which could affect program implementation; (iii) government agencies may
fail to demonstrate sufficient institutional and political capacity to push the reform
agenda forward; (iv) some or all partner (sectoral) ministries and agencies may abandon
the "mainstreaming" agenda; (v) the Brazilian Legislature may not pass required
legislation; (vi) a change in the leadership of individual ministries could lead to a delay in
the implementation of the reforms; (vii) a new federal administration may take over in
2007 and fail to implement remaining policy reform steps; or (viii) vested interests could
oppose and delay the implementation of key elements of the reform agenda. These risk
factors continue to be mitigated through the preparation and further implementation of
the EnvTAL and the actions for the second EnvPRL operation.

5.2      These risks were explicitly recognized during project preparation and have been
partly mitigated by: (i) complementary operations; (ii) the proposed EnvTAL; (iii)
transparent and participatory preparation; (iv) upstream consultation with civil society;
(v) strong government ownership; (vi) due diligence; (vii) realistic expectations; and
(viii) a flexible programmatic framework.

5.3      The preparation of the EnvTAL has experienced high-level buy-in, which
indicates that the ministries involved in the EnvPRL are willing to conclude their
proposed reforms and that the results of the studies supported by the EnvTAL will reach
the decision-makers in time and therefore be included in the new policies. The proposed
management structure for the EnvTAL includes a Management Committee (highest
authority) consisting of the Executive Secretaries (Vice-Ministers) of all seven ministries
involved in the EnvPRL and in the EnvTAL, and the Executive Secretary of the Ministry
of Planning, Budget and Management and a representative of civil society. This
Management Committee will also contribute to the coordination of the overall Bank-
financed technical assistance package in support of the environmental sustainability
agenda among the different Bank-financed projects, including projects with the
Ministries of Cities, Tourism, and Mining and Energy, in addition to the Ministry of
Environment.

5.4     For environmental sustainability policy reforms to become effective, it is
necessary to balance the views of different stakeholders. The EnvPRL I promoted
mechanisms for improved participation, accountability and transparency to influence
long-term behavioral changes. Consultations were held with a number of representative
civil society organizations (CSOs) in the development of the program. In addition, the
EnvTAL design enables the participation of the CSOs by providing a seat in the high-
level Management Committee and in the Technical Committee, as well as participation in
the monitoring and evaluation of the TAL and the EnvPRL.

5.5     The programmatic policy-based EnvPRL complements existing programmatic
approaches involving both investment and capacity building in key priority areas such as:
public sector environmental management at the national and sub-national levels (NEP II),
soil conservation and micro-basin management in the south and southeast, water resource
management in the northeast, biodiversity conservation and forest management in the
Amazon (PPG7, ARPA, PROARCO), and urban sanitation improvements supported by
the Bank and the GOB's other partners (IDB, KfW, USAID, IFC, WWF) over the past
two decades. Together, this unique combination of adjustment, investment, and
institutional strengthening lending represents a complete and comprehensive "package"
of Bank support to environmental improvement and sustainable development that has
shown important results on the ground.

6. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank

6.1     The Bank's performance is rated as satisfactory. The EnvPRL program and its
first operation were prepared and supervised by a large multidisciplinary Bank team, as
required for this type of inter-sectoral program. The team consisted of specialists in areas
such as, water and sanitation, forest management, licensing, agrarian reforms, tourism,
and the SEA. This team worked with the GOB to identify the reforms needed in each
sector.

6.2     In order to maximize the impact of this project and ensure synergy among the
different Bank-financed projects, as well as other partner-supported projects (IFC, IDB,
KfW), the project design considered the support from other on-going projects for the
GOB's environmental sustainability agenda. Both the GOB's and the Bank's teams
involved in the implementation of these projects were consulted with and/or were part of
the EnvPRL preparation team to ensure complementarity with these projects and that the
most relevant environmental sustainability reforms were referred to in the Policy Matrix.

6.3     Project preparation, with a highly participatory process, was carried out in record
time and focused on areas of strategic importance for the environmental sustainability
agenda in Brazil.

6.4     The innovative nature of this project has been recognized during this year's ESSD
Week. The project team received one of the three Bank-wide Environment Sector Board
Annual "Green Award" given to projects which support relevant environmental
outcomes.

                                            5

Borrower

6.5     The Borrower's performance is rated as satisfactory. The political will and high-
level buy-in of the operation were crucial for the fulfillment of the agreed conditions
before Board approval. Several consultations with technical staff and CSOs were carried
out by the GOB, which also increased the public's and the GOB's accountability on the
overall program.

6.6     After the declaration of effectiveness and disbursement of the loan, there was a
delay in the preparation of the companion EnvTAL. This slow start has led to a delay in
some reforms that will need the Bank's technical assistance support. However, other
relevant reforms are underway, even without direct support from the Bank (for example,
the public selection process to hire staff for the MMA and IBAMA).

6.7     In 2004, the Ministry of Finance allowed the MMA to spend all resources
allocated in the government's budget without any constraints. The Ministry of Finance
also allocated a total amount of US$8.0 million to the MMA's budget for the next years
to ensure support for the EnvTAL activities. All this support has enabled the MMA to
negotiate with all beneficiary Secretaries and Ministries on the activities to be supported
by the EnvTAL in order to achieve the agreed reforms in the second phase of the
EnvPRL. Although the Ministry of Finance has shown great interest in the EnvPRL
program and is participating in the EnvTAL, in 2005 the financial support to the MMA's
activities has fluctuated and a significant amount of the MMA's actual budget resources
for this year may have to be decreased due to fiscal constraints.

6.8     The coordination of this type of inter-institutional program is complex and time-
consuming, but it has allowed the MMA to leverage its institutional capacity, and
increase the mainstreaming of the environmental sustainability agenda in the other
ministries' activities.

7. Findings and Implications for Subsequent Operation(s) in Series

7.1     This first loan supported environmental sustainability mainly through policy
reforms as a typical Development Policy Lending (DPL). For this reason, the more
concrete impacts of the program in terms of improved environmental conditions, which
are its ultimate objective, require a longer time to materialize. Therefore, its impacts
should not be assessed based on short-term changes in environmental conditions, but
rather on the path of policy and institutional conditions leading to them.

7.2     A supporting TAL is being prepared since typically inter-sectoral coordination is
a slow process and needs continuous budgetary and technical support. A DPL can benefit
from a companion TAL to avoid gaps between the operations, take advantage of the
window of opportunity created by the program, and increase the pace of implementation
of the proposed reforms.

7.3     It is very important to monitor and evaluate the results of the loan and the
program. In this context, it is crucial to define clear and reasonable indicators that are

                                             6

accessible to the client. In the case of Brazil, at the time of preparation, there were no
good quality indicators and therefore, the program included the development these
indicators as a trigger to the follow-up loans. This type of activity could also be supported
through technical assistance developed during the accompanying TAL implementation.

7.4     Given the multi-sectoral nature of the reforms proposed in a DPL, it is important
to engage high-level members of beneficiary ministries, ministry staff members, and civil
society representatives (NGOs, private sector) in project preparation and implementation
and to emphasize coordination and consensus building through a broad participatory and
consultation process. In this EnvPRL, the high-level buy-in was evident in program
Letter of Development Policy, which was signed by the seven beneficiary ministers. This
Letter included the GOB's targets for the overall environmental program, considering a
medium-term period for implementation.

7.5     This operation was the first experience with a DPL in the environment sector in
Brazil and as part of early project preparation, the team scheduled several meetings with
potential beneficiary partners to explain the process, the instrument and the benefits of
being a part of the project. It is important that this type of consultation occurs early in the
process so that doubts and possible conflict situations can be resolved and all potential
reforms identified.

7.7     This type of programmatic operation must have a strong analytical base, including
technical, institutional, and political economy analyses. In order to build technical
credibility with the client, the team should also include professionals with knowledge
about the issues in the country related to the DPL area (in this case, environment). The
team should be a multidisciplinary group to ensure that all relevant sectors are identified
and supported by the project.

7.8     The presence of the project team in the country not only accelerated project
preparation, but also enhanced and continued a strong dialogue with the client. The field
presence encouraged the client to have greater confidence in the Bank, and the team was
better able to address the client's needs.

7.9     Bank teams should be forthcoming when presenting the expected outcomes to
Management and to the Board and not fall into the trap of over promising. This is
particularly important in policy related projects when processes take long periods to
mature. DPLs should be developed with flexible mechanisms that could permit
adjustments as the policy reforms in the country evolve.

7.10    DPLs should be supervised with great deal of care and emphasis by experienced
senior staff. Managers should allocate adequate resources for their supervision. In the
case of the EnvPRL I, the Brazil CMU has allocated sufficient resources to guarantee the
high level and continuous dialogue with the client.

In Annex III, the Borrower has confirmed its concurrence with this ICR and its ratings
and great enthusiasm regarding the overall EnvPRL I results and processes, especially
public consultation and the transparent preparation procedures.
