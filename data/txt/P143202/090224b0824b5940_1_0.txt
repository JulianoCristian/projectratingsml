                         The Project Development Objective is to mitigate the negative effects of the 2012 drought by helping maintain the corn and wheat productive capability and prevent
                         livestock de-stocking of farmers in the most affected districts.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has largely completed the compensation program for farmers affected by the catastrophic 2012 drought. Compensations to affected farmers commenced on October 25,
                         2013, later than originally expected, however within a period of less than 2 months, all compensations were paid to all eligible farmers in all eligible rayons at the time. Currently,
                         compensations remain to be paid only in three small rayons (and only for wheat), following the inclusion of these rayons into the compensation program in March, 2014. The project
                         has provided compensations for the plantation of wheat and corn in the 2013 agricultural season to almost 60,000 farmers in an amount of US$6.3 million. The total area for which
                         compensations were defrayed was is approximately 317 thousand hectares. The amount disbursed for compensations was lower than anticipated, and as a result an amount

                         equivalent to US$2.3 million was canceled from the project. The under-run came primarily from weaker absorption of compensations for corn, which can be explained by the fact that
                         despite the Government's best efforts to incentivize plantation some farmers opted not to plant it for purely economic reasons, while still reeling from the drought. However, there is a
                         general consensus in the Government of Moldova and in the farming community that overall, the compensation program was a success, and that it generally played a very important
                         role in economically incentivizing farmers to plant wheat and corn.
