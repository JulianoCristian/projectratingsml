                         The Project Development Objective is to mitigate the negative effects of the 2012 drought by helping maintain the corn and wheat productive capability and prevent
                         livestock de-stocking of farmers in the most affected districts.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has completed the compensation program for farmers affected by the catastrophic 2012 drought. Cash transfers were defrayed to farmers based on a formula of losses
                         incurred in 2012 to: (i) for corn - 31 (out of 34) rayons; and (ii) for wheat - 18 (out of 34) rayons. The former includes the three additional rayons of Anenii Noi, Rezina and Taraclia,
                         which were added to the cash transfer program in March 2014, based on additional evidence of sustained losses. The final tally indicates that the project has provided compensations
                         for the plantation of wheat and corn in the 2013 agricultural season to 60,010 distinctive farmers in an amount of US$6.5 million. Thirty-nine percent of the recipients were women.
                         The total area for which compensations were defrayed was approximately 322,000 hectares. All other project activities were also successfully completed: (i) a vast information and

                         testing new approaches for animal nutrition under conditions of weather stress, i.e. new silage techniques, and (iv). a body of work related to the strengthening the country's Agency
                         for Interventions and Payments in Agriculture capacity for managing the implementation of large and complex compensation programs. All in all, it can be said that the project played
                         a major role in mitigating the negative effects of the catastrophic drought of 2012 on the production of corn and wheat, and prevention of animal de-stocking. For two years now, the
