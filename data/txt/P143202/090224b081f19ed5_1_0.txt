                         The Project Development Objective is to mitigate the negative effects of the 2012 drought by helping maintain the corn and wheat productive capability and prevent
                         livestock de-stocking of farmers in the most affected districts.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has become effective on July 30, 2013. All necessary steps for putting in place the mechanisms required for the implementation of the project have been taken. An
                         information and outreach campaign to potential beneficiaries about the project's activities has been launched on July 20, 2013 by the country's National Rural Development Agency
                         (ACSA). The mechanism for the defrayal of compensations to farmers has been developed and enacted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry (MAFI). An ensuing contract
                         between the country's Agency for Payments and Interventions in Agriculture and the country's National Post Office has been signed for defraying compensations to farmers without
                         bank accounts. Additionally, a grievance mechanism has been developed and put in place by MAFI to ensure that farmers who have not been awarded a compensation have a fair

                         Compensations for the plantation of winter wheat are likely to commence before the end of August, 2013, since the eligible beneficiaries for wheat are already known. The lists for
                         corn compensations are expected to be finalized by the middle of September, 2013. All defrayals to farmers are scheduled to take place before October 31, 2013.
