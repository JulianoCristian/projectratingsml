The lessons learned were: (1) In emergency\n            projects, in order to ensure quick action, it is rather\n            appropriate to work through country office-based TTL,\n            working together with country office-based and regional\n            fiduciary specialists, who can swiftly process and approve\n            No Objections and other clearances; (2) Innovative solutions\n            enable project implementation to continue in a context of\n            political instability; (3) It is important to have a\n            systematic effort at building drought management capacity,\n            clarifying institutional roles and developing a policy\n            framework; (4) An emergency operation can only be designed\n            on the basis of sound statistics and credible policy; (5)\n            Projects of this emergency nature work well if they have\n            clear and well defined internal system procedures.\n            Especially for emergency relief operations, an efficient\n            monitoring and evaluation system (follow-up checks) needs to\n            be developed and implemented in a very short period of time.\n            Developing a single standard manual for all participating\n            parties is recommended for future emergency projects; (6)\n            Emergency projects have to demonstrate quick wins in the\n            shortest possible time. This entails starting with cash\n            transfer programs, quick disbursements, etc., that gain\n            momentum rapidly and reach their peak during one year; (7)\n            Submission of detailed supporting documents and original\n            receipts is not ideal for emergency operations, or for\n            speedy disbursements."}, "docdt": "2014-02-20T15:20:01Z"}
