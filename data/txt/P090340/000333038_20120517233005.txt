      QUALITY EDUCATION IN THE RURAL AREAS OF MOLDOVA (P090340)
                 CREDIT NO. 4155 AND GRANT NO. H2080


                                     Restructuring Paper


1.      This restructuring paper extends the closing date of the Quality Education in the Rural
Areas of Moldova Project (P090340) from May 30, 2012 until October 31, 2012. This will
be the Project’s second extension for a cumulative period of 29 months.

2.      In line with its Project Development Objective (PDO), the Project has continuously
contributed to improving the quality of education in the rural areas of Moldova. Since its
approval, the Project has steadily moved toward achieving its PDO which has, throughout its
lifetime, oscillated between the ratings of Moderately Satisfactory and Satisfactory. The latter
has been the rating for the past twelve months. The PDO is measured through the improvements
in average learning in rural schools and the reduction in the gap in achievements between rural
and urban schools. The Project has, moreover, served as a catalyst in jumpstarting education
efficiency reform measures outlined in the Government’s Education Reform Program.

3.      This five-month extension is being sought in order to avoid a financing gap for the
Project as the Additional Financing (AF) of the Project, which was approved by the Board on
March 20, 2012, is not expected to be effective before the current closing date of May 30, 2012.
The AF would be effective once it is ratified by the Parliament of Moldova which could take up
to five months. The original Project was financed through a Grant (H2080) and a Credit (4155)
in the amounts of SDR 3.6 million each (US$5 million equivalent, for a total of US$10 million
equivalent) to be implemented over a four-year period. The Project was approved on February
14, 2006, and became effective on August 7, 2006.

4.     There are no outstanding audit reports and the last audit report was found satisfactory to
the Bank. It is important to note that the actual disbursements exceed the Financing Plan in this
Project because of exchange rate fluctuations. The Financing Plan will be updated once the
Additional Financing is effective.
