was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: project design\n            must be based on a well-defined results framework (RF),\n            allowing capturing key results influenced by the project.\n            Top-down and bottom-up approaches are needed for the\n            efficiency reforms to be successful. The assessment showed\n            that school autonomy provides a number of advantages as part\n            of a comprehensive strategy for school and education system\n            improvements, including the incentive to use funds more\n            efficiently.
